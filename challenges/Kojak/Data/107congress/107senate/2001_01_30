As chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, I have full confidence that \nshe is the right person for this job and will be an outstanding leader. \nShe has an incredible environmental record as the Governor\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\nof New Jersey. New Jersey has cleaner air; the number of days that her \nState violated the Federal 1-hour standard for ozone dropped from 45 in \n1988 to only 4 last year.\n  It is a remarkable accomplishment. The water is cleaner. The fish \npopulation is thriving. New Jersey beaches are once again clean and \nopen for enjoyment, beaches that I enjoyed, I might add, as a young man \ngrowing up in New Jersey. There was a brief hiatus where it was not \neven safe to walk those beaches. Annual beach closings dropped from 800 \nin 1988 to just 11 last year. That is 11 too many, but still it is an \nincredible task in development.\n  The National Resources Defense Council has praised New Jersey for \nhaving the most comprehensive beach monitoring system in the entire \nNation.\n  Under Governor Whitman, New Jersey has been a national leader in \nredeveloping brownfields, which has long been an issue for me as the \nchairman of this committee, and even prior to becoming the chairman--in \nreforming the brownfields legislation to clean up these blights on our \nsociety. That experience in dealing with brownfields will be invaluable \nas we develop Federal legislation.\n  Conservation has also been a top priority for this nominee. During \nher 7 years as Governor of New Jersey, more open space and farmland was \npreserved than in the previous 32 years. She has preserved more land \nthan any previous administration in New Jersey, and under a \nconservation program that she established, and was overwhelmingly \napproved by the voters, nearly 1 million acres will be preserved by the \nyear 2010.\n  The list of her environmental accomplishments goes on and on, from \nair quality to smart growth to species conservation. The bottom line is \nthat New Jersey's air, water, and land are cleaner because of Governor \nWhitman.\n  It is remarkable and, some hate to say, unusual for a nominee to be \nthis qualified for this position. This is all occurring when the \neconomy is stronger than ever. We can have a clean environment and a \nstrong economy, and Governor Whitman has proven that.\n  What is most impressive about Governor Whitman's record is how she \nachieved this environmental success. It is an approach that focuses on \nresults, an approach with which I totally identify and agree, results \nachieved through cooperation and partnership as opposed to \nconfrontation and not working together. You use the hammer of \nenforcement when it is necessary, but if you can lay the groundwork too \nso you do not need to use the hammer, that is even better. We address \nproblems in a holistic manner--we look at the entire problem, all the \nsources of pollution air, land, or water. Governor Whitman has done \nthat.\n  As we begin to tackle the environmental issues of the 21st century, \nwe need that ability to think outside the box. We need to have someone \nin this agency saying: Just because we did it yesterday or last year \ndoes not mean we have to do it again this year. We may want to think \nabout something new, something innovative, something flexible.\n  Governor Whitman, with her record and experience, is the right person \nto oversee the protection of our environment. President Bush is to be \ncongratulated for choosing such a strong protector of the environment \nto head the EPA.\n  On a personal level, in the private meeting I had with Governor \nWhitman, we discussed the environmental agenda of President Bush. We \nalso discussed her own environmental agenda. I found it very much in \ntune with mine. We were talking at great length about the utility \nemissions reduction, the so-called bubble bill, where we cap and trade \nand bring utilities and other sources of pollution under this bubble to \nbring down the emissions. This is a high priority for President Bush \nand for Governor Whitman. I look forward to working with her on that.\n  Brownfields, which I discussed a moment ago, is also one of her top \npriorities. I predict, working with Administrator Whitman, we will move \nout of the gate very quickly with good strong brownfields legislation \nwhich will allow us to get into these communities where these \ncontaminated sites are. Some are asbestos-filled buildings or other \nmesses that have been left by industrial development. We will clean it \nup. We will remove the unfair liability and allow the contractors to \nget on site and clean them up.\n  The spinoff is remarkable: A, you clean up the environment; B, you \ncreate jobs; C, you allow areas to be developed that were developed and \nyou do not have to put more pressure on green space somewhere else \nbecause now you can clean up, you can build and put new industries on \nthe old industrial site. It is a tremendous opportunity, and it is very \nexciting to think about working on this with Governor Whitman.\n  We must address the environmental infrastructure, the combined sewage \noverflow, storm and sewage overflow. There is much infrastructure that \nis necessary to look at. She, again, has experience in this area, and \nwe can work together.\n\n  On conservation funding, we need to get dollars into the areas we \ncan; with a willing seller and a willing buyer to perhaps set aside new \nland and, at the same time, protecting private property rights and \nencouraging dollars to help fish and wildlife and other areas of our \nenvironment.\n  Something the Governor and I really click on is the MTBE issue, which \nis a big issue in her State as well as it is in mine. We have to work \ntogether to try to remove that contamination that is such a problem all \nacross the country, but especially in New Hampshire, California, New \nJersey, and several other States where MTBE gets into the water supply. \nWe have to do something about the leaking underground storage tanks \nthat create this problem and, at the same time, begin to develop \nanother source to replace MTBE to still keep the air clean with no \nbacksliding and see to it that we keep this kind of chemical out of our \nwater supply.\n  It is an ambitious agenda. She is up to that agenda. She is up to the \ntask. I look forward to working with her, and I am very anxious to see \nher nomination move quickly through the Senate this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to this session of Congress as \nchairman of this committee, the committee of jurisdiction dealing with \nChristine Todd Whitman. For 17 days, I was chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. One of my first acts was to hold hearings \nregarding Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. Part of me said this is my \nchance to stand out. This is somebody who wants to be the Administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency, someone whose name has been \nsubmitted to us by President Bush, whom I did not support in the \nelection. I thought it would be a time to set a real good record show, \nmaybe not a lot, but a significant number of Senators, that they should \nvote against her.\n  I went into the hearing with that direction: What could we do to show \nthat she would do a bad job. We had questions from all types of her \nenemies in the State of New Jersey, many of which we asked orally; the \nothers we submitted to her in writing.\n  I say candidly, this woman did a great job before the committee \nanswering these questions. We went through four different rounds of \nquestions. Some Senators sat through the entire hearing. It was long. \nIt started at 9:30 in the morning and ended around 1 o'clock, as I \nrecall, or 1:30 p.m. that day. She, I repeat, answered every question \nwe submitted to her. She did not appear to be evasive. When we \nsubmitted the questions to her in writing, the answers we got back, as \nfar as I am concerned, especially on issues relating to the State of \nNevada, were even stronger than her oral answers.\n  I do not proudly say there was a part of me when these hearings \nstarted that wanted to find things against her. I say to the Senate and \nthose within the sound of my voice, that perhaps was a wrong attitude. \nCertainly she was able to alleviate any questions I had about whether \nor not she should be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency.\n  This is an important agency. I have been on the committee since I \ncame to the Senate. I have seen EPA Administrators come, and I have \nseen them go. I am confident--and I am very hopeful--that she will be a \nvery good EPA Administrator.\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\n  Of all the testimony that she gave, the only concern I have --and I \ntold her this at the hearing--is that I hope she does not depend too \nmuch on voluntary compliance. I have no problem if she wants to try it, \nbut let's not push this envelope too far. My experience has been, in \nthe environmental field, voluntary compliance simply does not work.\n  This agency is responsible for protecting both the health of our \ncitizens and the health of our environment. The agency must ensure that \nFederal laws protecting human health and the environment are fairly and \neffectively enforced.\n  There are 10 comprehensive environmental protection laws that \nGovernor Whitman must administer, including the Clean Air Act, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, and the Superfund law. These are very important \nlaws. She and the regional offices she directs throughout the country \nneed to implement them. Leading this agency is a big job.\n  The Administrator of the EPA needs to ensure that these \nresponsibilities are carried out, in addition to overseeing the \nAgency's environmental research and making recommendations to the \nPresident on environmental policy.\n  Given the importance of the mission of this agency and the role it \nmust play in developing the future direction of environmental \nprotection, I am joining with my colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, as a \nsponsor of a bill that would give the Environmental Protection Agency \nCabinet level status. I have supported efforts in the past in this \nregard, and I certainly support the efforts today. I think it should be \na Cabinet office.\n  As my friend, the chairman of the committee, has acknowledged, she \nhas been the Governor of New Jersey since 1993. Her accomplishments as \nGovernor are significant: Preserving open space and farmland in New \nJersey; expanding the brownfields redevelopment program, and having one \nof the most comprehensive beach monitoring programs in the entire \ncountry. I can remember, it was not long ago, I was speaking to Senator \nBradley. Being from Nevada, it was hard for me to comprehend, but \nsyringes and needles were washing up on the shore. People were afraid \nto go to the beaches. That is no longer a problem in the State of New \nJersey, or at least it is a very minor problem.\n  Governor Whitman has seen the importance of the partnership between \nthe Federal Government and the States in accomplishing mutual goals, \nsuch as cleaning up Superfund sites. I think it is significant that \nrather than what happens in many States, where people and Governors and \nState entities go out of their way to prevent Superfund sites from \nbeing declared, she did just the opposite. She went around soliciting \nto help the Federal Government clean up these sites that needed to be \ncleaned up. Therefore, we have a significant number of Superfund sites \nthere. I believe the State of New Jersey has more Superfund sites than \nany other State in the Union.\n  She testified before our committee that she would do what she could \nto make sure that Superfund became an effective law and continued being \nan important law.\n  I will hold her to the promise she gave to the committee to support, \ndefend, and enforce the laws of this land. In particular, I am glad \nthat she and the President intend to make sure Federal facilities will \ncomply with the same environmental standards that apply to private \nfacilities. I am glad she has recognized that the Environmental \nProtection Agency must fulfill its legal obligation to set radiation \nprotection standards for Yucca Mountain in the State of Nevada. This is \nthe facility that is being looked at to determine whether or not it can \nsafely hold nuclear waste.\n\n  I think she recognizes the Federal Government's legal obligation to \nset radiation standards for Yucca Mountain that fully protect human \nhealth and the environment. To my mind, anything less stringent than \nthe final rule would not satisfy that responsibility.\n  While she has not been fully briefed on all these issues, and some of \nthe answers provided to the committee reflected that, the Governor did \nsay at her hearing she is committed to working on these issues. It is \nmy hope she will look carefully at the recent actions of the new \nadministration that would halt some of the proposals, as well as the \nprogress of the last administration.\n  I expect Governor Whitman to consult with us, the committee, before \nmaking any changes that would weaken our environmental protections. We \nhave come too far to allow a single-minded or shortsighted action to \nset us back environmentally. There are too many problems out there. \nPeople want clean air. They want pure water. They want these sites that \nare so dangerous to be cleaned up.\n  We have, in the State of Nevada, regarding Superfund, some very good \nhistory. I can remember coming into Reno and there was a huge pit. We \ncalled it the Helms Pit. The State of Nevada's small environmental \nprotection agency was fighting, working with the oil companies, to do \nsomething about the black stains that appeared on this huge gravel pit. \nIn the bottom of it was water. Just a few feet away was the Truckee \nRiver--the source of water for the entire State.\n  I directed the EPA to take a look at it. Within 2 weeks, an emergency \nSuperfund site was declared at the Helms Pit. Here it is now, 8 or 9 \nyears later, and this is a beautiful area called the Sparks Marina, \nfull of water, with motor boats on this little lake. It is just \nbeautiful. And it is all as a result of the Federal Government. It is \nthe Federal Government at its best. The government came in and \ndetermined that it was dangerous. There were millions of gallons of \nfuel that leaked out of pipelines the oil companies had brought into \nthe area. They paid for it. The Federal Government didn't pay for it. \nThe oil companies paid for it.\n  Now all of northern Nevada has benefited from this environmental law \nthat we passed a number of years ago. So I think it is important we do \nnot set back the progress we have made over the last decade.\n  I expect, as I have indicated, she will consult with us before making \nany changes that will weaken our environmental laws. She has a credible \nenvironmental record, certainly not perfect, but a credible \nenvironmental record, and a profound understanding of conservation \nissues from a New Jersey perspective. She now needs a perspective for \nthe entire country.\n  As Administrator of EPA, she will have an opportunity to learn about \nthe different regional environmental challenges that face Americans \nfrom coast to coast. For example, in Nevada we face a situation in \nwhich dozens of small communities, through no fault of their own, will \nbe in violation of the new safe drinking water regulation standard for \narsenic. The issue of naturally occurring arsenic contaminating \ndrinking water may not have been a major issue in New Jersey, but in \nNevada it is something that I am confident she can learn about and help \ncommunities address.\n\n  These challenges are significant. It will be an important task for \nGovernor Whitman to ensure that, all through the western United States, \nthe water standards that have been set can be met. We know from a \nhealth perspective they should be met. We need the Federal Government \nto step in and help us with some of these small communities.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has a 30-year history to be proud \nof. I hope, by working together, we can continue to do just that--\nprotect our environment for generations yet to come.\n  Mr. President, I support the nomination of Gov. Christine Todd \nWhitman to be the Administrator, and maybe soon the Secretary, of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Before vacating the floor, I want to say, early in this session, what \na pleasure it has been to work with the chairman of the committee, Bob \nSmith. He and I have a long history of working together. We were both \non the Select Committee on MIA-POWs. It was a very difficult year we \nspent together. We also spent some difficult time together, and some \npleasant time together, as the two party leaders on the Ethics \nCommittee. I have found him to be fair and to always have an open door. \nI look forward to working with him as the ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nvery much. I also commend Senator Reid for the expeditious and \nnonpartisan way in which he has handled the nomination during his \ntenure as chairman, which was ever so brief. It was a pleasure to work \nwith the Senator. I look forward to working with the Senator in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the Whitman nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Nevada has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am going to just take \nanother 2 or 3 minutes to make some comments on the Norton nomination \nand then will not use all of the remaining time but will be happy to \nyield it back so we can move to the next nominee.\n  Again, let me just reiterate my strong support for Governor Whitman \nin this position as EPA Administrator.\n  She is extremely well qualified--one of the most qualified people \never to be recommended for the job. She has firsthand experience as a \nGovernor dealing with these problems--some of them on the receiving end \nof the Federal Government and other times just working in cooperation \nwith the Federal Government.\n  It is an exciting opportunity to work together on the agenda I talked \nabout a few moments ago: clean air, clean water, infrastructure, many \nother issues that will be coming before us, including MTBE, which is a \nbig issue in New Hampshire and New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nChristine Todd Whitman to be Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Christine Todd Whitman has a long and distinguished record of public \nservice, and has made many important contributions to my State of New \nJersey. She is well qualified to head the EPA, and I urge my colleagues \nto support her nomination.\n  Governor Whitman is highly articulate and persuasive. She genuinely \ncares about the issues, and she knows how to make an impact.\n  Governor Whitman has been a leader in protecting New Jersey's 127-\nmile shoreline and in fighting for cleaner air, guarding against the \nkind of pollution that knows no state boundaries. As an individual and \na Governor, she has demonstrated a strong commitment to preserving open \nspace.\n  The Administrator of EPA has the primary responsibility for ensuring \nthat our air and water is clean, our natural resources are preserved, \nand our public health protected. It is a difficult job. It often \nrequires a careful evaluation of highly complex scientific data, and an \nability to translate that data into detailed policies. It needs someone \nwho will fight internal battles to make environmental protection a \nbudget priority. It needs someone who will work with local communities \nand businesses to find mutually acceptable solutions to environmental \nproblems. And it needs someone who, when necessary, will be tough on \npolluters and force them to do the right thing.\n  I believe that Governor Whitman has the background, the experience \nand the skills necessary to do the job, and to do it well. I know that \nwe will not always agree on every policy issue. This became clear \nduring the hearing on her nomination in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. In fact, I was concerned by some of her answers with \nrespect to the need for tough enforcement against polluters and the \nneed to ensure that environmental decisions adequately respect the \nrights of minorities and other disadvantaged groups.\n  However, I remain hopeful that Governor Whitman will use her \nconsiderable skills to be a strong environmental advocate, and I look \nforward to working with her to ensure that EPA remains committed to \nstrong and effective enforcement of our environmental laws.\n  With that, I want to conclude my remarks and wish Governor Whitman \nthe best of luck as she undertakes this important new challenge.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to make a short statement on \nPresident Bush's nomination of New Jersey Governor Christine Todd \nWhitman to serve as Administer of the Environmental Protection Agency I \nhave known Governor Whitman for many years. I admire her public service \nrecord and believe she comes to this job with a strong committment and \nsensitivity to its many responsibilities. I welcome the opportunity to \nvote for her.\n  President Bush's choice of New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman \nis positive signal regarding the environmental agenda that he will \npursue over the next four years at EPA. Under her guidance, New Jersey \nhas worked with other Northeastern states to strengthen local and \nnational clean air protections. For example, Ms. Whitman recently \nsupported the EPA's newly announced rule to reduce pollution from \ndiesel fuel. Ms. Whitman has been a strong advocate of preserving open \nspace. On the issue of coastal and marine protection, which is of \nparticular concern to my state of Massachusetts, Ms. Whitman has \nadvocated tougher controls on ocean pollution and enhanced protection \nof our seashores.\n  One area of concern how been expressed regarding Ms. Whitman's \nrecord. Conservation groups in New Jersey claim that during her time as \nNew Jersey governor, Ms. Whitman took a somewhat lax approach to \nenforcement of environmental law. Needless to say I believe \nenvironmental law should be enforced as strenuously as any other law. I \nanticipated that Ms. Whitman will recognize her new responsibilities \nand leave no one doubting her willingness to enforce the law \nvigorously.\n  While I certainly do not share all of Ms. Whitman's views on \nenvironmental protection, I believe that she has shown balance and a \nwillingness to listen to all sides throughout her career. I wish her \nwell at the EPA, look forward to working with her and will vote for her \nnomination today.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to support Christine Todd \nWhitman as President Bush's nominee for Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. During her years as Governor we have \nwaged many fights together from open space preservation to ending ocean \ndumping.\n  President Bush has made a wise selection. The EPA and the country \nwill be getting an Administrator who is qualified, battle-tested and \nready to tackle the challenges that lie ahead for this Agency. With \nthis nominee, there will be no learning curve.\n  There are few training grounds that could better prepare someone for \nthis position than the Governor of New Jersey. As Chief Executive of \nthe State, Governor Whitman has the managerial and administrative \nexperience of running an agency as large as the EPA. But more \nimportantly, no state has a better sampling of the issues facing the \nincoming Administrator of the EPA than New Jersey.\n  With 127 miles of shoreline, Governor Whitman has dealt extensively \nwith issues of clean water and non-point source pollution. She knows \nfirst-hand the threats to the economy and the environment from ocean \ndumping. Governor Whitman has increased funding for beach cleanups, and \nunder her watch, beach closings have dropped from 800 in 1989 to just \n11 in 1999.\n  With more Superfund sites than any other state in the Union (111), \nshe knows what works and what doesn't in the Superfund program. She has \nseen the value of a concerted effort to turn urban brownfields into \nproductive industrial and commercial sites.\n  With the many dense urban centers in New Jersey, she has dealt with \nthe complex funding and regulatory issues of upgrading dilapidated \nsewer systems and controlling combined sewer overflow.\n  As Governor of our Nation's most developed State, she initiated and \npassed a landmark $1 billion bond measure to preserve one million acres \nof farmland, forest, watersheds, and urban parkland. Few elected \nofficials in this Nation, yet alone, this Cabinet, have a better \nunderstanding of what is needed to curb sprawl and protect our open \nspaces, than Christie Whitman.\n  But more than her record of environmental progress, what makes \nGovernor Whitman uniquely qualified for this position is her \nunderstanding that economic and environmental progress are not mutually \nexclusive goals. For example, travel and tourism generates $28 billion \nin revenue and employs nearly 800,000 people in Central and\n\n[[Page S659]]\n\nSouthern New Jersey. No issue is more important to those jobs than \nocean quality. Yet the Port of NY/NJ is a vital component of economic \ngrowth and employment in the northern part of NJ contributing $20 \nbillion annually to the economy and supporting nearly 200,000 jobs. I \nhave worked with Governor Whitman to balance these constituencies and \ndevelop a policy that ended ocean dumping while still allowing for the \ncontinuation of the dredging necessary for the Port's continued growth.\n  The job for which Governor Whitman seeks confirmation is by no means \nan easy one. The challenges faced by the next Administrator are both \nnumerous and difficult. The Superfund and Clean Water and Clean Air \nActs have not been re-authorized in a decade and there are new \nchallenges on the horizon, especially in our urban areas. Our urban \ncenters have sewer systems that were built at the turn of the 19th \nCentury. They frequently back-up and endanger public health and water \nquality because they are incapable of handling overflow. Too often \nindustries unwanted anywhere else find homes on city blocks because of \nthe jobs they offer and the taxes they pay. The next Administrator must \nmake a priority of closing the gap between available funds and \ninfrastructure needs and ensuring that environmental justice is more \nthan a think tank slogan.\n  I am confident that Governor Whitman will do this and more. The \nchallenges ahead are many--protecting our drinking water and purifying \nour air, preserving open space and reforming Superfund. But President \nBush could not have selected a nominee with more experience and \ncommitment than Governor Whitman. I have the utmost confidence that she \nwill do the Senate and her home State very proud, and I urge her \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join today in supporting the nomination \nof Christine Todd Whitman to be Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have \nhad the opportunity to discuss with the nominee the many challenging \nenvironmental and public health issues facing us today.\n  As the former, two-term governor of New Jersey, Ms. Whitman brings to \nthis position on the ground experience in finding solutions and making \nprogress on environmental problems. Today, New Jersey's beaches, once \nplagued with closures, have seen dramatic reductions in closures due a \ncomprehensive beach monitoring system. New Jersey's brownfields \nredevelopment initiations are leading the nation in revitalizing urban \ncenters.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Whitman brings to this important post a record of \naccomplishment. More importantly, she has a demonstrated ability to \nfind common ground to make progress on complex problems. Her experience \nas a state executive will guide her as she works with our state \npartners to improve air and water quality, to restore abandoned \nindustrial sites and to reinvigorate the Superfund program.\n  I have every confidence of her steadfast commitment to advancing the \nprotection of public health and the environment. I look forward to \nworking with her and urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S659-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S659-S660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF GALE NORTON\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nstrong support for the President's nominee for the Secretary of the \nInterior, Gale Norton. I know there are some groups out there that have \nmischaracterized her record and have indicated some fears or concerns. \nI remember similar fears and concerns being expressed about me. It \ndidn't seem to work out the way some thought it would. They have \nresorted to name calling, misrepresenting her record, making false \naccusations. We are probably going to hear some of those accusations \nrepeated on the floor today, regretfully.\n  I begin by trying to set the record straight. I think this business \nof personal attacking and trying to destroy people personally is a \nmistake that is uncalled for. It is one thing to disagree on the \nissues. It is another thing to begin to get into name calling and \nmaking accusations about people's character that are not justified.\n  Let me stick to the record. Gale Norton has a strong environmental \nrecord. Certainly, if we look at the facts in Colorado at Rocky Flats \nand Rocky Mountain Arsenal, she has a strong record of enforcing \nFederal and State environmental laws vigorously and fairly. As attorney \ngeneral of Colorado, she fought to make the Federal Government and \nprivate companies clean up hazardous and nuclear waste left behind at \nthe Rocky Mountain Arsenal and Rocky Flats.\n  At the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, she fought all the way the U.S. \nSupreme Court for the State's right to hold the Federal Government to \nthe same stringent cleanup standards that she applied to private \ncompanies. She sued not to try to weaken the cleanup standard but to \nstrengthen it. Today the Rocky Mountain Arsenal is a national wildlife \nrefuge. That is not an accident. That is strong leadership on the part \nof this nominee for Secretary of the Interior.\n  The extreme environmental groups also blame Ms. Norton for the \nSummitville mine disaster and suggest that she didn't do enough to \nenforce the law. Again, their facts are wrong completely. Ms. Norton \ndid go after the mine operator shortly after she took office. Because \nof her actions, the mine operator was forced to operate a water \ntreatment facility to prevent contamination from spreading. She also \nbrought an enforcement action against the mine operator recovering \nmillions of dollars to pay for the cleanup. She did not let the \npolluter off the hook. To the contrary, she made the polluter pay.\n  This ``let the polluter off the hook'' is a favorite expression of \nthe left to somehow assume that if you try to work to get cleanup and \nyou are not extracting every last dollar from every person who has it, \nsomehow we are letting polluters off the hook. As we know, we have \ncrossed this rubicon in the past. We have crossed that threshold, and \nit depends on which polluter we are talking about. What is a polluter? \nIs a polluter somebody who throws a ballpoint pen in a landfill? Under \nsome definitions, yes. We have to be very careful how we throw that \nterm around.\n  We are going to hear it a lot today in the debate, that somehow she \nlet the polluters off the hook. The facts are, she did not.\n  These are just a few examples. Anyone who looks at her record--\ninstead of the environmental groups' characterizations--will see that \nMs. Norton enforced the law and she protected the environment at the \nsame time.\n  She appreciates the value of preserving our land. She grew up in \nColorado. She understands what wilderness means and what it means to \nlive in a beautiful, pristine area such as central Colorado.\n  The extreme environmental groups have also suggested that Gale Norton \ncannot be trusted to protect our public lands, our national parks and \nrefuges and wilderness areas. That is not true. Her record demonstrates \nthat Ms. Norton values our public lands and she will protect them. \nAgain, just look at the record.\n  As attorney general, she worked with Congress to craft the Colorado \nwilderness bill that established 19 new wilderness areas in the State. \nThat doesn't sound like somebody who is opposed to cleaning up our \nenvironment and protecting our wilderness.\n  That bill was enacted in part because of Ms. Norton's efforts to \nbuild consensus for the preservation of those lands.\n  Her record at the Department of Interior, where she was Associate \nSolicitor for Conservation and Wildlife from 1985 to 1987, shows once \nagain that she was an effective advocate for protecting our public \nlands and natural resources, including endangered species.\n  Let me name just a few of her accomplishments in the Solicitor's \nOffice:\n  She represented the Fish and Wildlife Service in its successful \neffort to add 80,000-90,000 acres to the Big Cypress National Preserve.\n  She was involved in an effort to add 5,000 acres to complete the \nFlorida Panther National Wildlife Reserve in Florida.\n  She fought to ensure the success of the captive breeding program that \nsaved the California condor when environmental groups sued to try to \nstop\n\n[[Page S660]]\n\nit. If they had succeeded, the condor would now be extinct.\n  She fought for the acquisition of land to extend the Appalachian \nTrail.\n  She worked on the regulations that banned lead shot for migratory \nbirds, saving millions of birds.\n  She secured funds for the restoration of Ellis Island and the Statue \nof Liberty.\n  And she negotiated the original agreement with Senator McCain to \nrestrict overflights in the Grand Canyon.\n  Again, these are just a few of her accomplishments over the past 15 \nyears, but they paint a clear picture.\n  They paint a picture of someone who has dedicated her life to public \nservice, to preserving the environment and natural resources, and to \nenforcing the law.\n  They paint a picture of an individual who is highly qualified to be \nthe next Secretary of Interior, and the first woman to serve in that \nposition.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the facts, not the distortions, in \nmaking their decisions about Gale Norton.\n  I strongly support Ms. Norton's nomination to be Secretary of the \nInterior, and look forward to working with her on the many challenges \nthat lay ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S660-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S660-S677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF GALE ANN NORTON TO BE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR--RESUMED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the nomination of Governor Whitman is laid aside, and \nthe Senate will now resume consideration of the nomination of Gale Ann \nNorton, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Gale Ann Norton, of \nColorado, to be Secretary of the Interior.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nallotted to Senator Feingold with respect to the Norton nomination be \nprovided to Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe I have 15 minutes to speak on \nthe Norton nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New \nHampshire, I think there is a distinction between what I hope will be \nsubstantive remarks on my part in opposition to Ms. Norton to be \nSecretary of the Interior and personal attack.\n  I am a Senator from Minnesota. I am from a State where we love our \nlakes and rivers and streams, the environment.\n  My opposition to Ms. Norton to be Secretary of the Interior does not \nmean ipso facto that what I say represents any kind of personal attack. \nIt is simply a very different assessment of whether or not she should \nin fact be the Secretary of the Interior for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I have a lot of policy disagreements with Ms. Norton. I have a lot of \npolicy is agreements with any number of the President's nominees to \nserve in our Cabinet, but almost all of them I will support because \nthere is a presumption that the President should be able to nominate \nhis or her people.\n  On the environmental front, as long as I have the floor of the \nSenate--and I hope I am wrong--I say today that I believe the record of \nthis administration will amount to a rather direct assault on \nenvironmental protection. I think that would be wrong for the country. \nThis is not a debate about ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \nnot today. My disagreement with Ms. Norton or the President is not the \nreason why I oppose her to be Secretary of the Interior.\n  Part of the debate we will have in this country has to do with this \nnexus between the way we consume, the way we produce energy, and the \nenvironment. I see an administration that is an oil interest \nadministration, and the focus will be more and more on oil, barreling \ndown a hard path energy policy, with fossil fuels, environmental \ndegradation getting lipservice but not investments in clean \ntechnologies, renewables, safe energy.\n  The reason I oppose not Gale Norton as a person but Gale Norton to be \nSecretary of the Interior is because I have doubts about her ability to \nfairly enforce existing environmental and land use laws. That is why I \noppose this nomination.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is the principal steward of nearly one-\nthird of our Nation's land. The Secretary is the chief trustee of much \nof our Nation's energy and mineral wealth.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is the principal guardian of our \nnational parks, our revered historic sites, and our fish and wildlife. \nIt is the job of the Secretary of the Interior to protect this precious \nlegacy and to pass it on to future generations. As Catholic bishops \nsaid 15 or 20 years ago in their wonderful pastoral statement, we are \nstrangers in this land. We ought to make that better for our children \nand our grandchildren.\n  Ms. Norton has had significant positions--government positions and in \nthe private sector. It is her record in these positions--both in \ngovernment and private sector roles--that are the most troubling to me. \nIn fact, her record indicates that she may not be able to enforce \nenvironmental protections and ensure the preservation of our public \nlands.\n  There is no doubt that Ms. Norton did a good job in the confirmation \nhearings. She pledged her past views, and she is certainly committed to \nenforcing the laws of the Interior Department. I commend her for her \ntestimony. It is my sincere hope that she will live up to these \ncommitments. However, I think the Senate and Senators are compelled to \nview her record not in terms of 2 days of testimony but the totality of \nher record.\n  The totality of her record is one that I believe points to her \ninability to strike the very difficult and the very delicate balance \nbetween conservation and development. As a private attorney, Ms. Norton \nhas taken positions that indicate a strong opposition to the very \nenvironmental protections which, if confirmed, she would be asked to \ndefend.\n  For instance, she has argued that all or parts of the Clean Air Act \nare unconstitutional--taking a State rights view. She has argued that \nthe Surface Mining Act, which is all about protecting workers' coal \ndust level, which is all about occupational health and safety \nprotection, which is all about the problems of strip-mining and the \nenvironmental degradation that it causes many communities in \nAppalachia, again, unconstitutional.\n  She has argued that provisions of the Superfund law that require \npolluting industries to pay for cleanup of waste sites should be \neliminated.\n  Ms. Norton has testified that implementation of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act--NEPA--is something that should be essentially \ndevolved to the State level, that she would prefer not to conduct \nFederal land environmental reviews.\n  I am sorry; when it comes to this most precious heritage, when it \ncomes to the land, when it comes to our environment, when it comes to \nsomething that is so precious for not just us but our children and \ngrandchildren, it is not just a matter of State options.\n  We are a national community, and we have made a commitment to \nenvironmental protection. I believe the actions Ms. Norton has taken \nand the positions she has taken in the past would make it impossible \nfor her not only to enforce these laws but to be a strong steward for \nthe environment.\n  In 1997, Ms. Norton argued that the global warming problem didn't \nexist. That is, of course, in contradiction to the international \nscience community. I know in her testimony she essentially said she now \ntakes a different position--I appreciate that--as Colorado attorney \ngeneral.\n  But I also have questions in my own mind given the position she has \ntaken about what kind of steward for the environment she would be.\n  As Colorado attorney general, Ms. Norton argued against the \nEndangered Species Act, saying it was unconstitutional. As attorney \ngeneral, Ms. Norton supported measures that would relax otherwise \napplicable environmental safeguards if businesses volunteered to \nregulate themselves. And regardless of the damage, regardless of the \neffect on the public, regardless of the effect on people, these \ncompanies would be shielded from any liability.\n  Her position is troubling to me because Ms. Norton might be willing \nto permit private companies that operate\n\n[[Page S661]]\n\non or near public lands to regulate themselves. As Colorado attorney \ngeneral, in the case of one mining company acting under self-\nregulation, there were violations and massive contamination of the \nAlamos River. My colleague from New Hampshire said she took action, but \nit was only after the Federal Government was forced to step in and say \nyou must take action. Indeed, the Federal Government was forced to step \nin and spend $150 million in emergency cleanup of the river.\n  In addition, there is a case of citizens living downwind from a mill \nthat had been emitting pollution for months. Again, the Secretary of \nthe Interior refused to take action, and again the Federal Government \nwas forced to intervene--again resulting in a record $37 million in \nfines against the company.\n  Since leaving her job as AG in 1999, Ms. Norton has been lobbying \nCongress and the Colorado State Legislature on lead paint issues in \nbehalf of the NL Industries, a Houston company formerly known as the \nNational Lead Company. This company has been named as a defendant \ninvolving 75 Superfund or other toxic waste sites in addition to dozens \nof lawsuits involving children allegedly poisoned by lead paint. The \nonly thing that I can say is I understand Ms. Norton's right to work \nfor whatever company she wants to, but it does not give me very much \nconfidence that she is the right person to be Secretary of the \nInterior--a major position of environmental leadership in the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  After reviewing her record of 20 years, I believe Ms. Norton has not \ndemonstrated the required balance needed to be a guardian of our \nnational heritage and a trustee of our national lands. Furthermore, she \nhas shown a career pattern of opposing environmental protection, which \nI think speaks to her ability--or, I say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts, her inability to carry out the requirements of Secretary \nof the Interior.\n  I appreciate her testimony to the Energy Committee, and I take that \nin good faith. However, I cannot ignore her resistance to prosecute the \nindustry in order to protect Colorado's land and people while serving \nas attorney general. As Secretary of the Interior, Ms. Norton would be \ncharged with balancing the interests of industry against conservation. \nIn my view, her record strongly indicates she will heavily tilt that \nbalance away from conservation, away from preservation of the \nenvironment, away from environmental protection, away from being the \ntrustee for the land, and away from understanding what a sacred duty we \nhave.\n  It is a value question to make this Earth a better Earth and hand it \non to our children and grandchildren. I find all of that unacceptable, \nand that is why I oppose this nomination. I hope other Senators will \noppose this nomination as well.\n  Might I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor, and I also say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts that I would be pleased to yield the additional time to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota not just \nfor his graciously yielding me additional time but, most importantly, \nfor the thoughtfulness and sensitivity expressed in his remarks. I \nassociate my remarks very much with his thinking and his approach on \nthis issue.\n  I think each and every one of us in the Senate feels an automatic \npressure to want to support the nominee of the President of the United \nStates. I think it is a national feeling that generally pretty good \npeople, with honest records of taking a position for something they \nbelieve in in the course of a lifetime, have found their way to the top \nof their profession in a sense, and the President of the United States, \nfor one reason or another, makes a decision to entrust them with \nsignificant responsibilities.\n  There is a lot of goodwill here in the initial days of the \nadministration to want to give the President the person that the \nPresident chooses. I think through the 16 years I have been here, and \nthe several Presidents I have had the privilege of giving advice and \nconsent to with respect to their nominations, that there are precious \nfew, a small percentage--very small--that I have chosen to cast my vote \nagainst the President's choice.\n  As the Senator from Minnesota said, I think what we are looking for \nin the person who comes to a job with that kind of responsibility, \nbeing a Cabinet Secretary in charge of major responsibilities, is \nsomebody who brings not a series of denials, renunciations, \nconversions, if you will, from a lifetime of effort, but somebody who \nbrings with them to the job their gut and their heart and their head \nall linked together in concert with the fundamentals of the job they \nare being asked to do.\n  In the case of the nominee Gale Norton, I don't find there is that \nkind of connection, that there is a continuity of a lifetime of effort \nthat shows me with assurance where the stewardship of this department \nwill go. I regret to say to the Chair and to my colleagues that in the \ncourse of the years I have been here and had the opportunity to provide \nadvice and consent on other nominees, we have seen people who came \nwithout that connection, with that disconnect, and who subsequently \nfell short in the job because the gut instinct was not to strike the \nbalance; it was to keep faith with who they were and what brought them \nto the job.\n  I don't cast this vote lightly because I know Ms. Norton has a long \nand even distinguished record of public and private service. I know her \nfriends and others say she is a decent and a capable professional. Some \nhave, in the course of this debate, labeled her an extremist or even \ncaricatured her as James Watt in a skirt. I think that is unfortunate. \nI find those labels troubling and improper. They distract from honest \ndifferences over principle and policy that have made this nomination \ntroubling for the Senator from Minnesota, for myself, and for others.\n  I oppose Gale Norton's nomination. For a Cabinet post that demands \nthat its occupant strike a very difficult and a very delicate balance--\nthe same word my colleague from Minnesota used--a balance between \nconservation and development, President Bush has selected this \nindividual. I suppose one might ask the question, of all the people in \nthe country who have records with respect to the environment and \ndevelopment and striking that balance, of all the attorneys general, of \nall the people involved in conservation itself, of all the people in \nthe environmental movements of this country, of all the people who have \nbuilt up records of activism in an effort to try to strike that \nbalance, why is it that we are presented with an individual whose \nphilosophy over the past two decades has been singularly unbalanced?\n  The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for protecting the \nalmost 500 million acres of public land, including 383 parks, 530 \nwildlife refuges, and 138 wilderness areas. Among these are some of our \nNation's most valued lands: Yosemite, with its waterfalls, meadows, the \nforests, and the giant Sequoias, the world's oldest living things; the \nEverglades National Park, with its sea of sawgrass, mangroves, hardwood \nhemlocks, stork, great blue heron, and egrets; Mount Rainier National \nPark at Mount Rainier--a 14,410-foot-tall active volcano encased in 35 \nsquare miles of snow and ice and flanked with old-growth forests and \nalpine meadows.\n  Some are sanguine to suggest, well, those areas will never be \nthreatened. But I know from talking to people in various parts of the \ncountry I visit that there are huge movements where people are angry \nthat so much of their State is protected by the Federal Government; \nwhere people believe more of these areas ought to be open to \ndevelopment, not less; where people have witnessed, indeed, efforts to \ntry to stop finding that proper balance between mining and grazing, or \na host of other interests, and who would rather open the forests and \nhave the U.S. Government build more logging roads, without even \ncommenting on whether our logging practices are good or bad, after \nfires that we had last year. Sure, we can improve, but these are \ndifferent movements, these are movements which disagree with these \nsetasides.\n  I remember what happened on the floor of the Senate just a very few \nyears ago, in 1995, with the House of Representatives and the Senate \nfirst term in Republican control, and I remember standing here and by 1 \nvote\n\n[[Page S662]]\n\nonly we managed to stop major destruction to 25 years' of efforts to \nprotect the environment of this country--by 1 vote only.\n\n  We happen to be a little stronger in the Senate today, but knowing \nhow close it was and watching how critical the discretion of a \nSecretary is in what happens in terms of the regulations, what happens \nin terms of efforts they take to court or don't take to court, or seek \nto have protected or not protected, there is enormous discretion \nexercised on a daily basis.\n  I believe we need to remember the history we have traveled here. \nThere was a period of time where some of the lands I just mentioned, \nthe very ones that are protected today that we think of as national \ntreasures, were not thought of in that way. In 1853, when the U.S. \nArmy's topographical engineers returned from a trip to what we would \nlater call the Grand Canyon, the party reported that it was ``the \nfirst, and will doubtless be the last, party to visit this profit-less \nlocality.''\n  As each decade has passed since those early forays into the American \ncontinent, the country's appreciation for its land has grown--I believe \nit continues to grow among Americans today--the places to hike, canoe, \ncamp, to play, to learn, and to leave nature, except for a harmless \nvisit now and then. There were 273 million visits to our National Parks \nalone in 1993, a clear sign of their value to the Nation.\n  At the same time, the Interior Secretary manages the development of \nour public lands. Private companies, from multinational conglomerates \nto small family businesses, use our Nation's water, minerals, timber, \noil, gas, and other public resources. Their industry, obviously, \ncontributes to the national economic growth, and it provides thousands \nof jobs in regional communities. Our public lands have produced all of \nthe needs of this Nation, and the Department of the Interior has \nmanaged hundreds of thousands of claims to mine gold, copper, and other \nvaluable metals; 34 million acres of commercial timberland and 164 \nmillion acres of rangelands that are open to grazing.\n  It is the Secretary of the Interior's job to strike the proper \nbalance between conservation and development. It is a tough job. The \nSecretary is under enormous pressure from those who hope to profit from \nthese natural resources. Once a decision is made to develop land, the \nimpacts are often permanent. You can't turn back the clock and recreate \nan old-growth forest. You can't return an extinct species of life. You \ncan't return polluted land to absolutely pristine condition.\n  There are many steps we can take to avoid unnecessary damage and \nrestore land, and nature has shown itself to be resilient, but the rate \nof destruction today and the levels and the kinds of destruction too \noften force us to lose natural resources forever. The numbers of \nbrownfields in cities around this country, the numbers of Superfund \nsites that have been on the list for years and remain not cleaned up \nare testimony to that tragedy.\n  In considering this vote, I have reviewed Ms. Norton's record as a \nconstitutional attorney, an activist, and as Colorado attorney general, \nand her testimony before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It \nis a record that in my view simply does not reflect the balance I \ntalked about that is necessary to serve as Secretary of the Interior.\n  I know she will be confirmed. Perhaps in the end we will see a \ndifferent exercise of that discretion. As a constitutional attorney, \nMs. Norton argued that bedrock Federal environmental, public health, \nand other laws are unconstitutional.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator has a minute and a half \nremaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Senator Boxer said that she would yield me \n5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent I be afforded that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, based on her legal views, which are, \nthankfully, outside the opinion of most legal scholars and reflected in \ndecades of court decisions--the Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, \nand Clean Water Act--and many other laws not directly related to the \njob of Secretary of the Interior but certainly important to this \ncountry, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act, Fair Labor \nStandards Act, and the Violence Against Women Act--violate our \nConstitution in one way or another. Indeed, if her convictions were the \nbasis for this new administration's actions, it would unravel most of \nour Nation's environmental safeguards.\n  In addition to these writings and comments, Ms. Norton has been an \nactive participant in several lawsuits and other efforts to overturn \nenvironmental protections. For example, she serves as an attorney to an \norganization called the Defenders of Property Rights that has advocated \nagainst endangered species protections in more than two dozen lawsuits.\n  Ms. Norton's writing and activism on these issues reaches far beyond \nthe few examples that I have outlined here. To her credit, she has been \na capable and dedicated advocate for more than two decades. The \nproblem, simply, is that she has advocated legal and policy positions \nentirely at odds with the job of Secretary of the Interior.\n  In her testimony before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nMs. Norton distanced herself from her legal and activist record. While \nI certainly appreciate Ms. Norton's willingness to rethink and revise \nhere views, I remain greatly concerned. Too often absolutist views were \ncast aside with little or no explanation. Too often the answers were \nvague and incomplete. Do I expect Ms. Norton to have answers to every \nissue she may encounter as Secretary? No. But my standard is higher for \na nominee who comes before us with a career's record of fighting the \nlaws the administration has now asked her to enforce.\n  History warns us to be concerned and cautious.\n  In 1981, Mr. James Watt was nominated to be the Secretary of the \nInterior by President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Watt, like Ms. Norton, came to \nthe Senate with a record of anti-environmental legal activism. And like \nMs. Norton, Mr. Watt showed a willingness to rethink and revise his \nviews. A passage from the Congressional Record from 1981 is \nenlightening. For example, Mr. Watt was asked how, in light of his \nrecord, would he\n\n     carry out the Secretary's dual responsibility to permit \n     resource development on the public lands while preserving \n     natural values?\n\n  Mr. Watt offered the following answer:\n\n       As Secretary of the Interior, I will fully and faithfully \n     execute the public land policy adopted by Congress requiring \n     such a balanced approach.\n\n  The record after this is clear. It was opposite to that very answer.\n  This year, Ms. Norton was asked a similar question in regard to her \nviews on the takings clause of the Constitution and environmental \nenforcement. Ms. Norton answered that she:\n\n     will protect the federal government's interests in its lands \n     and enforce all environmental and land use laws that apply to \n     the lands and interest managed by the Department of the \n     Interior.\n\n  Sound familiar? My point is that we have been witness to \n``confirmation conversions'' before, and the result--as in the case of \nMr. Watt--is sometimes regrettable. When a nominee's record is \noverwhelmingly slanted in one direction and falls far outside of the \nmainstream on a set of issues central to the job they will perform, \nreversals and revision leave me concerned.\n  I looked to Ms. Norton's record as Colorado Attorney General to learn \nhow she performed at a job that required her to enforce environmental \nlaws--again she has argued are constitutionally flawed. I found that \nrecord to be decidedly mixed and worrisome.\n  While Ms. Norton pursued two high profile cases against the federal \ngovernment, environmental organizations, environmental attorneys, and \nthe Denver Post report that in several major cases she failed to \nenforce environmental law against private companies.\n  For example, in one case, neighbors of a Louisiana-Pacific mill were \nforced to abandon their homes because the stench of pollution from the \nfacility was so great. Without assistance from the state of Colorado, \nthey hired attorneys and won a $2.3 million court against the company. \nAlthough that civil trial uncovered criminal wrongdoing by the company, \nthe state still failed to prosecute. Finally, the federal government \ninterceded and assessed $37 million in fines for fraud and violating\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\nthe Clean Air Act against Louisiana-Pacific.\n  The attorney who represented the citizens in that case, Kevin Hannon, \ntold the Denver Post.\n\n       I would have grave concerns about Gale Norton's \n     aggressiveness in enforcing environmental compliance and \n     protecting citizens from environmental damage.\n\n  And there are additional similar cases.\n  In her defense, Ms. Norton claims to have not acted because state \nagencies did not ask her to prosecute. That answer is inadequate in my \nview, Mr. President. In several instances Ms. Norton aggressively \npursued her legal agenda as attorney general. For example, Ms. Norton \nproactively wrote state agencies declaring that a program to increase \nminority enrollment at state schools was unconstitutional. Ms. Norton \nrefused to defend a state program to increase minority contracting from \nlegal challenge because it was unconstitutional. As Colorado Attorney \nGeneral, Ms. Norton filed a brief in an Endangered Species Act case in \nOregon arguing a provision of the law was unconstitutional. Clearly, \nMs. Norton was an aggressive and capable advocate when the legal agenda \nmatched her policy agenda. But when it came to enforcing environmental \nlaw against polluting companies, she too often failed to act and seems \nto have been uncharacteristically passive.\n\n  Arguably Ms. Norton's performance enforcing environmental law as \nColorado's attorney general is the most relevant portion of her resume \nas she becomes the next Secretary of the Interior. One of her primary \nresponsibilities will be to protect the environment and public land by \nenforcing the law against private companies. Unfortunately that record \nis weak on environmental crime.\n  As I have said, Ms. Norton will not receive my vote today. I do not \ncast this vote lightly. I believe that President Bush should be given \nwide discretion in selecting a cabinet to advance his agenda. However, \nthere is a reason that the Constitution calls for the Senate to advise \nand consent on nominations. I believe that policy, ideas and a \nnominee's professional record matter. In many ways they matter more \nthan the personal issues that derailed other candidates. Each Senator \nhas the right--indeed an obligation--to vote their concerns and hope \nand their consciences.\n  Ms. Norton will be entrusted with protecting our federal lands and \nfinding that difficult balance between conservation and development. \nNot an easy job. I feel strongly that Ms. Norton can only do that job \nproperly if she sticks with the legal and policy philosophy she set \nforth in the Energy Committee hearings and not the philosophy she has \nadvocated for 20 years. I feel strongly that Ms. Norton can only do \nthat job properly if she does a better job enforcing environment law \nthan she did in Colorado.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 3 minutes of \nthe time allotted to Senator Stabenow with respect to the Norton \nnomination be provided to the senior Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first let me say I agree with many of my \ncolleagues that Gale Norton is clearly an experienced, capable public \nservant with a distinguished record. I know the Senate confirmation \nprocess can be an arduous one. I think she has handled herself very \nwell. She has made herself available to questions by those of us on the \ncommittee and conducted and presented herself in a very able way.\n  That said, I am afraid Ms. Norton has not been able to erase all my \ndoubts and the doubts of many New Yorkers about her environmental \nrecord and whether or not she will be a strong enough guardian of our \nNation's treasured public lands.\n  Although she is clearly an honorable person, I believe she does not \nhave a balanced enough view on the question of conservation versus \ndevelopment to serve as Secretary of the Interior. To me, the key word \nis ``balance.'' I reject those on either side.\n  There are some who say the conservation movement, the conservation of \nour lands, is really not necessary, or, once you have one place \npreserved, you have had enough and conservation should hold little \nweight when we talk about the needs of development. I have always \nphilosophically rejected that view.\n  I must also tell you that I reject the view of some of my friends in \nthe environmental movement who believe in no development at all, \nparticularly at a time of scarce resources. There has to be a balance, \nand that is what I think most Americans seek. Obviously, we all differ \non where that balance should be. I am worried that Ms. Norton does not \nhave enough of that balance.\n  She spoke very well at our committee. But if you look at her history \nin both the public and private sectors, it is not one of balance. It is \none, rather, of almost instinctively saying that development should \ntake precedence over conservation. I do not think that is the right \nperson for the Secretary of the Interior, and therefore I must \nreluctantly--although I generally believe in supporting the President \nwith his nominations and intend to support the President in all but two \nof his Cabinet level nominees--I must reluctantly vote no on the \nnomination of Gale Norton.\n  Mr. President, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding under the allotted \ntime I have 15 minutes to speak on the nomination of Gale Norton as \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today we are charged with the important \ndecision of considering Gale Norton for our next Secretary of the \nInterior. This position is extremely important. As the Secretary of the \nInterior, Ms. Norton would be the principal steward of nearly a third \nof our Nation's land; the guardian for our national parks; and the \nprotector of our wildlife refuges.\n  The process of appointing and approving cabinet members is a curious \nmix of politics and policy. I believe President Bush has every right to \nexercise the same prerogative as Presidents before him, of choosing \nmembers of his cabinet that share his point of view.\n  In proposing Ms. Norton, President Bush asks the Senate to entrust \nher with our environmental heritage.\n  In sending me to the Senate, the people of Illinois have entrusted me \nwith the duty of deciding whether Ms. Norton will faithfully fulfill \nthe job that she has been asked to do.\n  Although Ms. Norton conducted herself well throughout the \nconfirmation hearings, I am left with many questions about her vision \nfor the future of our Nation's environment. I have no doubt that Ms. \nNorton has the professional experience to be a capable Secretary of the \nInterior. The question is not about her ability to lead, but whether \nshe will be a leader for the preservation of our public lands and \nnatural resources.\n  This is why I rise in opposition to her nomination today. I am \ndisturbed that not one respected conservation group in our Nation has \nannounced its support for Ms. Norton. Her strongest supporters hail \nfrom the mining, drilling, logging, and grazing industries--industries \nbetter known for exploiting public land than for protecting it.\n  My concerns were not allayed during her confirmation hearings. \nDespite more than 20-years experience in dealing with environmental \nissues, she often gave vague, uncertain answers to questions on how she \nwould enforce many of our significant environmental laws. Her answers \ngave me little to reassure Americans who support conserving our natural \nresources.\n  Let me be clear. I am not opposing her nomination based on her \nideology alone. Her documented public record speaks louder than her \nwords. Her career is filled with stands on environmental law and policy \nthat are incompatible with the Secretary of the Interior's role as \nsteward of our public lands. Her actions reflect her philosophy that \nproperty rights are pre-eminent and Federal intervention should be \nminimized. She has not addressed the concern that this approach will \ninterfere with her duty as Secretary of the Interior to aggressively \nenforce compliance with Federal environmental laws.\n  By now, most of us know that Ms. Norton started her career at the \nMountain States Legal Foundation under\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\nthe guidance of James Watt, the controversial former Secretary of the \nInterior. During her time with Mr. Watt, she pursued cases opposing the \nenforcement of the clean Air Act in Colorado and supported drilling and \nmining in wilderness areas. She followed Mr. Watt to the Department of \nthe Interior in 1985 as an Assistant Solicitor where she worked to open \nup the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. But it was in \nher capacity as attorney general for Colorado from 1991 to 1999 that we \nfind egregious examples of her tendency to side with private, pro-\ndevelopment interests over those of preservation.\n  As attorney general of Colorado, Ms. Norton was an advocate of the \npolicy of self-auditing: a policy that allows polluting companies to \nescape fines if they report the problem and correct it. Unfortunately, \nthis policy allowed Summitville mine, a large gold mine, to continue \noperating even though it had serious environmental problems. It was \nonly after the mine spilled a mixture of cyanide and acidic water into \nthe Alamosa River, killing virtually every living thing for a 17-mile \nstretch, that her office became involved.\n  The Summitville mine was considered Colorado's worst environmental \ndisaster and is now the poster child of bad mining practices. To her \ncredit, Ms. Norton vigorously pursued the mining company for repayment \nto cover the cleanup. However, she sought no criminal charges, and her \noffice was criticized for being slow to act. The Federal Government had \nto step in to prevent the disaster from worsening and later won felony \nconvictions against many of the corporate owners of the mine. In fact, \nthe Denver Post said: ``It's a shame that Colorado must rely on the \nfeds to pursue the case.'' This happened under the watch of attorney \ngeneral Gale Norton of Colorado.\n  As Secretary of the Interior, Ms. Norton will have enormous \ndiscretion to unilaterally alter environmental policy. She could block \nfunding or enforcement of rules and regulations proposed by the \nprevious administration. For example, she could prevent a recent \nproposal to limit snowmobile use in our national parks from taking \neffect, a proposal that was supported by literally thousands of \ncitizens.\n  As a strong promoter of wilderness areas, I am concerned that Ms. \nNorton's pro-development leaning will make it more difficult to \ninventory areas for wilderness designation. I am concerned that she \nwill open more land to mineral and mining development leaving less for \nwilderness areas. I am concerned that she won't stand strong and \nprotect existing and proposed wild areas from off-road vehicle damage.\n  I am especially concerned that the Interior Department headed by Ms. \nNorton will parallel the Interior Department headed by her early \nmentor, James Watt. Mr. Watt tried to overturn environmental \ninitiatives implemented by President Carter's administration. Ms. \nNorton says she wants to review many of President Clinton's \nenvironmental initiatives. Mr. Watt wanted to shift public land policy \ntowards development and resource exploration. Ms. Norton has indicated \nshe would like to do the same. Mr. Watt tried to make many of these \nchanges out of the congressional limelight by using budgetary \nrecommendations and administrative and regulatory actions. I am \nconcerned that with strong public support for protecting the \nenvironment but an almost evenly divided Congress, Ms. Norton may be \ntempted to try the same tactics.\n  The Secretary of the Interior has a significant distinction from that \nof other Cabinet posts. That distinction is that no other Secretary's \ndecisions have such a long-range impact. Once the earth is disturbed to \nstart a mining operation, that land will never be the same. Once an \nanimal goes extinct, there is no replacing it. Once land has been \ndeveloped, it loses its character as a wilderness.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Ms. Norton's nomination sends the wrong \nsignal to the country: a signal that we are moving away from conserving \nour natural resources and moving toward turning our public lands over \nto private interests.\n  As a great Republican President and the father of our Nation's \nconservation ethic, Theodore Roosevelt, said, ``It is not what we have \nthat will make us a great nation; it is the way in which we use it.'' \nMr. James Watt echoed this statement during his nomination process in \n1981 when he testified that he would seek balance in managing our \nNation's lands. Ms. Norton recently testified that she would also seek \nto find this balance between using and preserving our natural \nresources.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Watt did not keep his word. If Ms. Norton should \nbe confirmed today, I urge her to learn a lesson from Mr. Watt's \nexperience and uphold her promise ``to enforce the laws as they are \nwritten.''\n  The Interior Department is responsible for many of our Nation's most \nvaluable treasures--natural resources that belong not only to this \ngeneration but also to generations to come. Americans will be counting \non Gale Norton, should she be confirmed, to protect these national \ntreasures so they can be handed on as an enduring legacy--to keep them \nsafe from those who would exploit and destroy them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time under \nthe control of Senator Stabenow be allocated to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, can you tell me how much time I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 9\\1/2\\ of minutes of \nhis 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  At this time, I see Senator Boxer has come to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum until she is \nprepared to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have for my \npresentation this morning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-one minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to explain to my colleagues, and to my \nconstituents, why I will vote no on the nomination of Gale Norton to be \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  It is very rare for me to oppose any Cabinet nominee because I \napproach the whole subject of advise and consent on Cabinet nominations \nwith the presumption that the President has the right to pick his or \nher own Cabinet. Having said that, you cannot walk away from a \nconstitutional responsibility to advise and consent if you feel that \nnomination is way outside the mainstream of American thought, and if \nyou feel that nomination could harm our country in one way or another. \nAnd I have many questions about this nominee which lead me to the \nconclusion that it would be far better to have someone more mainstream \nin this position. I will be explaining it through a series of charts \nand through my comments.\n  I have supported all of President Bush's nominees but for two--this \none, and John Ashcroft, which we will be speaking about later this week \nand perhaps into next week.\n  I will start by discussing why this position is so important. The \nSecretary of the Interior is the primary steward of our Nation's \nnatural resources. One of the most incredible gifts that we have from \nGod is our natural resources, the beauty of our Nation. It seems to me \nwe have a God-given responsibility to protect those resources for \nfuture generations.\n  Into the hands of the Secretary of the Interior we place a vast \namount of control over our parks, over our wildlife refuges, over \ngrasslands, over ranges, and over endangered fish and wildlife.\n  I will just show you a beautiful photograph. I have a few. This \nparticular one is Death Valley National Park. What you can see from \nthis photograph is the magnificent environment the Secretary of the \nInterior will be protecting. If a decision is made, for example, to \nextract minerals from a park such as this, you could certainly endanger \nthis beauty.\n  She will make decisions regarding grazing, mining, offshore oil and \ngas\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\ndevelopment, habitat protection or habitat destruction, and American \nIndian tribal concerns that will have far-reaching and long-lasting \nconsequences.\n  I asked her some questions about some of these areas in my State, and \nI have to tell you, as I will in greater detail, that I was very \nsaddened; they were really no answers. There was no commitment that I \nwanted to hear to protect these magnificent areas. I will go into some \nof her comments that were put in writing.\n  We give the Secretary of the Interior the discretion, and we trust \nher to balance the economic development of our rich natural resources \nwith the need to protect and conserve them. We are looking for a \nbalance, and in my view, we have not seen that balance, either in Gale \nNorton's past or, frankly, in her answers, which I did not find to be \nterribly believable. And again, I will get into that.\n\n  After more than a century of untempered resource extraction, we have \nlearned we must restore some equilibrium to the management of our \npublic lands and wildlife resources. The American people understand \nthis. Poll after poll shows they overwhelmingly support environmental \nprotection and restoration. They understand we are living in the most \nbeautiful place and we have a responsibility to protect it.\n  They are willing, for example, to conserve a little energy in order \nto spare pristine areas such as wildlife refuges. How people could say \nyou can drill in a wildlife refuge, to me, just on its face, there is \nsomething that does not make sense about that. If it is a wildlife \nrefuge, it is a refuge; it is not oil-drilling land. Why would it be \ncalled a refuge if it is not a refuge, a magnificent area where \nwildlife can live?\n  So I think in this appointment President Bush, who for the most part \nI think made good, moderate appointments, has gone off the reservation. \nI also understand Ms. Norton will be confirmed. I hope she proves me \nwrong. I hope she listens to this and proves me wrong. But I can say, I \nam worried. And there is precedent for me to worry.\n  If her nomination is approved, Ms. Norton will have authority to make \ndecisions that determine the fate of some of California's treasures and \nAmerica's treasures, places such as Yosemite National Park, the \nPresidio, Klamath National Wildlife Refuge, the San Diego National \nWildlife Refuge, Death Valley National Park--you can see from the \npicture how beautiful this is--and the California Desert--and believe \nme, it is a precious environment; I have been there; I have seen--Point \nReyes National Seashore--which is in my backyard; a magnificent area \nthat needs to be protected--and the Santa Barbara coastline. I will get \ninto that because there are 39 leases off the Santa Barbara coastline \nthat are under threat of development.\n  Ms. Norton's answer to that question leaves me very worried about \nwhat will happen.\n  These unique ecological and cultural gems are fragile and vulnerable \nplaces. If they are mismanaged, the damage is likely to be irreparable. \nShe will have responsibility for protection and recovery of \nCalifornia's most imperiled wildlife and fish species. Those endangered \nspecies, such as the California condor, will depend upon her for their \ncontinued survival.\n  Taken in total, it is an awesome responsibility and one of great \nimportance to my constituents who treasure California's unique \nenvironment.\n  Let me say something about that. Oftentimes, people come to the floor \nand say: Well, you can't be an environmentalist because it means you \ndon't want economic growth. You can't be an environmentalist because it \nmeans you will not have enough energy. We are going to hear this \nargument over and over and over, particularly about energy. I will talk \na little bit about that. That is a false premise.\n  Our economy depends on our environment in California. People come to \nour State and spend money to stay there because of our unique \nenvironment. They come to our ocean not to look at offshore oil \ndrilling but to enjoy the beauty and the serenity of standing on that \nshoreline and looking at the vastness God gave us. To say that being an \nenvironmentalist is somehow not for a strong economy is a fact that is \nwrong on its face.\n  The green industries that grow up around clean air and clean water, a \nclean environment, are industries we are not exporting across the \nworld.\n  To the people of this country, take heart. There are many in this \nbody who understand this.\n  After Ms. Norton's confirmation hearings, her responses to over 200 \nwritten questions and an in-depth look at her long and detailed history \nof work on these environmental issues--unfortunately, on the other side \nof most of them--it is clear to me that her record is remarkably \nconsistent. One can say that about Ms. Norton; her record is remarkably \nconsistent.\n  She has spent her lifetime over the past 20 years focused on fighting \nagainst our essential Federal environmental laws and fighting for \nincreased resource extraction from our public lands. That is her \nhistory. That is her life. Indeed, it is striking how few examples \nthere are where Ms. Norton worked for the protection of the \nenvironment, despite the fact that her positions as Associate Solicitor \nat Interior and attorney general in Colorado required it.\n  Let us look at some of her statements. On mining she said:\n\n       The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act is not \n     constitutional.\n\n  This is the act that tries to at least repair the damage that is done \nafter there is mining.\n  On endangered species she said:\n\n       The federal government has interpreted its habitat \n     protection duties far too broadly.\n\n  In other words, she doesn't think the Federal Government should have \nmuch say in habitat protection.\n  On takings compensation:\n\n       Compensation is desirable because it will have a chilling \n     effect on federal environmental regulations.\n\n  A chilling effect on Federal environmental regulations?\n  We have a lot of important Federal environmental regulations: the \nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act--all \nFederal regulations--the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, \nthe Endangered Species Act; these are important advances that our \ncountry has made. They have strong support. She likes things that give \na chilling effect to Federal Government regulation. It gives me the \nchills to think that someone who feels this way is in charge of a lot \nof our laws.\n  We see recurring themes, deeply held philosophies. These include \nvehement opposition to Federal environmental regulation, an unflagging \ncommitment to the supremacy of property rights even if those rights \nlead to environmental destruction and harm everyone else.\n\n  Ms. Norton has argued that ``control of land use and of mining is a \ntraditional State function outside the scope of the commerce power.'' \nThus, they are not activities that should be regulated by Federal land \nmanagers. She went so far as to argue that the Surface Mining Control \nand Reclamation Act is unconstitutional, as I have stated. Given these \nbeliefs, it is doubtful that she will apply this law and implement it \nand make sure these conservation standards are applied in a meaningful \nway.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  She has raised strong complaints about the Endangered Species Act, \nanother one of our bedrock laws that the Interior Secretary must \nimplement. During her earlier tenure at the Department of the Interior, \nshe complained the courts were providing an overly broad interpretation \nof the ESA's habitat provisions. She argued that the habitat protection \nstandard should be extremely narrow so that only habitat that was \nimmediately occupied by an endangered species would be protected. This \ninterpretation would have ignored everything we know about the \nbiological needs of species. It would have protected, for example, a \nbald eagle's nesting tree but allowed the rest of its surrounding \nhabitat to be destroyed. With that kind of thinking, the bald eagle \nwould never have been saved because you save the tree and then right \naround the tree you don't take any measures to protect the bald eagle.\n  Let us show a picture of some of our habitat. We are talking about \nGod's creations that we have a responsibility\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\nto protect. This is Mohave National Preserve Joshua trees. We have to \nmove to protect them.\n  Let us show some other habitat. Let us show the beautiful habitat of \nAlaska.\n  Here we can see some of the magnificent caribou up in Alaska. We will \nbe arguing a lot about that issue. We can see, if we are going to \nprotect their habitat, we cannot just protect a small amount. It is as \nif saying that we are going to protect the air in one State and not in \nanother one. We know the air moves; the animals move. We have to think \nabout their whole habitat if we are going to protect them and not have \nthis narrow view that Ms. Norton has articulated, which is that you \nshould apply it very narrowly.\n  She submitted an amicus brief in the Babbit v. Sweet Home case and \nargued that the Department of the Interior's protection of habitat on \nprivate lands was unconstitutional and constituted a taking. She argued \nfor such a restricted interpretation of the law that it would have \nseverely hindered our ability to protect habitat necessary for the \nrecovery of the Endangered Species Act. On that case, her side lost. \nShe is out of the mainstream of thought.\n  Is it possible she could forget her lifetime of work against these \nthings and suddenly become a fighter for the environment? I conclude \nno. Over and over again, Ms. Norton has advocated for ``the devolution \nof authority in the environmental area back to the States.'' In other \nwords, she doesn't really see the need for Federal laws such as the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA.\n  While working in Colorado, she wrote of having ``to do battle'' with \nthe Federal Government to wrestle control away from Washington and \nspoke with pride of her challenges to the Environmental Protection \nAgency regarding its interference in Colorado's air pollution programs. \nOddly, she lamented that the end of the Civil War meant that ``we lost \nthe idea that states were to stand against the Federal Government \ngaining too much power over our lives.''\n  There are a lot of things you could bring up to drive home a point, \nbut to raise the Civil War is odd. She said that the end of the Civil \nWar meant that ``we lost the idea that states were to stand against the \nFederal Government gaining too much power over our lives.''\n  She is way out there, in my opinion, because the people whom I \nrepresent--I think the vast majority of people--want to have a Clean \nWater Act, want to have a Safe Drinking Water Act, want to protect the \nmagnificent species from destruction, and believe we have a God-given \nresponsibility to do that. But she is way outside the mainstream. \nPresident Bush, for the vast majority, in my opinion--all but a \ncouple--has chosen from the middle ground this time and reached over so \nfar that there isn't much room on the other side and put this \nindividual in the position where she can do harm.\n  As a matter of fact, given her statements about the inappropriate \nrole of the Federal Government in all of this protection, it is hard to \nunderstand how she would want to be a part of the Interior Department, \nmuch less be the head of it. It raises questions to me about her \nability to adequately serve as an advocate from the Federal perspective \nin various environmental decision-making processes. Ms. Norton has a \nlong history of association with organizations that promote ideas such \nas eliminating the Bureau of Land Management and selling off our \nnational parks. Not surprisingly, these views have sparked strong \nopposition from the people of our country.\n  I want to show you some of the groups that have opposed her \nnomination: the Natural Resources Defense Council, The Wilderness \nSociety, Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, Republicans for \nEnvironmental Protection, Physicians for Social Responsibility, NAACP, \nAFL-CIO, Childhood Lead Action Project--I understand why they oppose \nher--Community Energy Project, the Network for Environmental and \nEconomic Responsibility for the United States Church of Christ.\n  This is a lightning rod nomination for people who care about \nprotecting the environment. Why do we have to see their kind of \nnomination? We could have had a nomination for the President to ``unify \nus'' and not divide us.\n  That is the reason I am against this nomination. Her lobbying to \ndissuade States from holding the lead industry accountable for the \ncontinued use of lead-based paint has brought criticism. I showed you \nthat. The Childhood Lead Action Project, why would they get involved in \nthis? Guess what we know. Lead-based paint causes mental retardation in \nchildren. This isn't a theory; it is a fact, and she led the charge to \nget the Federal Government out of regulating lead.\n  You have to stand up at some point in your life and be held \nresponsible and accountable. I think this is a moment when someone has \nto be held accountable.\n  Everyone knows what a strong environmentalist I am and everyone knows \nhow strong I am for a woman's right to choose. They know I have \ndedicated my life to do these two things. Suppose the laws were changed \nand suddenly a woman's right to choose was outlawed and I was put up \nfor a position where I had to say enforce that law--put a woman in \njail, put a doctor in jail. If this were to happen, people should come \ndown to the floor and say Barbara Boxer is not the right person for \nthat job; her whole life has been dedicated to making sure that a woman \nhas a right to choose. Why would they give her this position? They \nwould be right. I don't care if I said I will do it; I will enforce it. \nThey know how strongly I feel.\n  We know how strongly she feels about the interference of the Federal \nGovernment, what she considers to be interference in States rights in \nterms of protecting the environment. Why is this a good appointment? \nAgain, you have to wonder why someone who has dedicated their adult \nlife to opposing the Federal Government's involvement would even take \nthis job. But we saw that happen before. His name was James Watt. We \nwill get down to when someone says they will fully enforce the Nation's \nlaws. Fine. But then when you ask her how she interprets those laws, \nyou have to wonder because it is not the same interpretation as most \npeople have.\n  When I asked her how she felt about priority issues for California, \nif she would uphold the Bureau of Land Management's important decision \nto deny a permit to a gold mine, which everyone agreed would destroy \nNative American land and destroy the environment in California near the \nSan Diego area, she basically passed on an answer. I asked her about \nhow she felt about the much heralded new management plan for Yosemite \nNational Park. She basically passed on an answer. The Klamath Wildlife \nRefuge, she passed on an answer. The Trinity River Restoration effort, \nshe passed on an answer. She said she wasn't familiar with the issue; \nshe had not taken a position. This troubles me since she worked at the \nDepartment of the Interior before. Yosemite should not be unfamiliar to \nsomeone who is to be head of the Department of the Interior and, yet, \nshe passed on an answer on Yosemite.\n  I would like to submit these answers for the Record at this time. I \nask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nQuestions From Senator Dianne Feinstein Submitted on Behalf of Senator \n                             Barbara Boxer\n\n       Question. There are currently 36 undeveloped oil leases \n     situated on the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of \n     California. Development of these leases has been strongly \n     opposed by the state of California and the associated local \n     coastal communities. This Administration has signaled its \n     intent to prioritize the development of domestic oil and gas \n     sources. Will you encourage development of offshore leases in \n     states like California where there is strong and persistent \n     opposition to the development of such leases? Past \n     administrations have used their executive authority to place \n     a moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling in currently \n     undeveloped areas. Would you recommend that such a moratorium \n     be continued under this administration? Would you view such a \n     moratorium, or any other environmental regulation that \n     prevents development of a lease, to be a taking under the \n     Fifth Amendment of the Constitution?\n       Answer. President Bush pledged to support the existing \n     moratoria on OCS leases. He also committed to working with \n     California and Florida leaders and local affected communities \n     to determine on a case-by-case basis whether or not drilling \n     should occur on existing, but undeveloped leases. If \n     confirmed as Secretary of the Interior, I will\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\n     honor these commitments and promise to work with all parties \n     to reach a consensus on how undeveloped leases should be \n     handled and the extension of existing moratoria.\n       Question. The Interior Department recently announced its \n     denial of a permit for the Glamis Imperial gold mine that was \n     proposed for development in Imperial County, California. This \n     mine was rejected on the grounds that it would have caused \n     undue degradation to the site's environmental and cultural \n     resources. Do you think it is appropriate under current \n     mining law for the Secretary to reject mines like the \n     proposed Glamis Imperial Mine on these grounds?\n       Answer. I am not familiar with the specifics of the Glamis \n     mine proposal or the basis on which the mine was rejected. I \n     look forward to learning more about the proposed Glamis \n     project and working with Congress to ensure that all new \n     mining projects maintain an appropriate balance between \n     legitimate mineral development activities and preservation of \n     important environmental and cultural resources.\n       Question. Recently, the National Park Service developed a \n     detailed plan for the future management of Yosemite National \n     Park. This plan was developed after considerable input from \n     all of the affected stakeholders and over 10,000 members of \n     the public submitted comments to the agency. Central to this \n     plan is the notion that visitors to the park should be \n     encouraged to leave their personal vehicles outside the park \n     and travel through the park on a park transit system. As \n     Secretary of Interior, will you actively support \n     implementation of the new Yosemite Valley Management Plan? \n     Will you be aggressive about developing similar management \n     plans for the many other national parks that are suffering \n     environmental degradation because their management \n     practices have not kept pace with the growing numbers of \n     visitors?\n       Answer. I am not familiar with the details of the Yosemite \n     Valley Management Plan. As a general matter, I support the \n     concept of management plans for our public lands and believe \n     that they represent an important decision-making tool for \n     land managers. For these plans to be successful, I believe it \n     is important that they be developed in consultation with the \n     affected States, local communities, affected stakeholders, \n     and environmental groups.\n       Question. In 1998, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n     adopted a policy for Tule Lake and Lower Klamath National \n     Wildlife Refuges in California and Oregon that prevents \n     irrigation on commercial farmland on the refuges unless \n     sufficient water is available to sustain the refuges' \n     marshes. Do you support this policy which gives priority to \n     the refuges' ecological resources over commercial farming? \n     The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 \n     set new requirements for the management of refuges. In \n     response, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued \n     regulations establishing procedures for determining what uses \n     are compatible with the mission of the refuge system and the \n     mission of each individual refuge. Do you believe farming is \n     compatible with the mission of the Tule Lake and Lower \n     Klamath National Wildlife Refuges? What uses would you deem \n     to be incompatible with the mission of the national wildlife \n     refuge system?\n       Answer. I am not familiar with the details of the \n     Department's 1998 policy.\n       I have not yet had an opportunity to review the \n     Compatibility Policy, and am not in a position at this time \n     to assess how it might affect the Tule Lake and Lower Klamath \n     National Wildlife Refuges. I am also aware that the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service recently issued a draft Appropriate Uses \n     Policy that may impact activities on refuges such as Tule \n     Lake or the Lower Klamath. I look forward to learning more \n     about the Fish and Wildlife Service's policies implementing \n     the National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act and about the \n     530 Refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n       Question. The Department of the Interior, with the \n     concurrence of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, announced on December \n     19, 2000, a plan to restore the Trinity River in California. \n     The decision is based on 20 years of scientific research and \n     public involvement. It completes a process supported by the \n     Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations and has \n     enjoyed bipartisan support in the Congress. Will you commit \n     your Department to follow through on the decision and \n     implement the Trinity River restoration program?\n       Answer. I am not familiar enough with this restoration plan \n     to respond to this question at this time. I look forward to \n     working with you to learn more about this plan and the \n     Department of Interior's role in implementing it.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, she had a good answer on the Outer \nContinental Self moratorium where she said she supported the States \nrights not to drill. When I pressed her on 36 existing leases off Santa \nBarbara, I didn't get the same answer. She said she would look at them \non a case-by-case basis. That is not good enough because the State \ndoesn't want any drilling there. Why wouldn't she just take it off the \ntable? She couldn't do that.\n  I am very troubled, and we will have a lot of debate over those 36 \nexisting leases. It is one of the most pressing environmental issues in \nCalifornia. We have unwavering opposition to the development of those \nleases. Since she says she is for States rights, now she can't suddenly \nsay I'm for States rights on this one.\n  Finally, I want to address the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I am \nnot going to spend a lot of time on that. That will come at a later \ndate. I agree with President Bush. It is unfair to criticize her for \nnot wanting to drill in the Arctic. He says, I do; of course, my \nSecretary would. I have no problem with that. However, Ms. Norton seems \nto have enthusiasm about drilling there.\n  If you look at her historical role in pushing to open up the refuge, \nand her links to the oil and gas industry through the Mountain States \nLegal Foundation, and the oil companies that hire her current lobbying \nfirm, and the oil and gas interests that gave her significant \ncontributions during her Senate race, I think there are valid questions \nwe could raise about whether she can effectively serve the role that \nthe Secretary must fill in this type of decision-making.\n  What do I mean by that? Let me show you a picture of the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge. You already saw a picture of the caribou there. This \nis just an open view of the Coastal Plain. By the way, this came from, \nif Senator Murkowski is listening, the State biologists in Alaska. They \nwanted us to show this Coastal Plain. Basically, we are going to have a \nhuge debate over whether to open up this refuge to drilling. This is \ngoing to be a tough debate. I know that at best there is 6 months' \nworth of oil there. If you just change the mileage on SUVs a few miles \nyou wouldn't have to do any of this. But we will have that debate. I \nlook forward to it.\n  But Ms. Norton, in her position, is going to have to be objective \nabout facts such as how much oil lies there, and what is the impact on \nthe caribou and the rest of the environment. I question whether she \nwould be objective given her strong stand in favor of oil drilling.\n  My State is suffering from energy problems. I want to put something \nright out here right now. Outside of California, the people are saying \nit is California's fault because it didn't build enough powerplants. I \nwant to explain something. It was explained very well in the New York \nTimes editorial. Our utilities did not want to build any powerplants \nbecause they want to control the supply. The fact is, no new plants \nwere built in the 1990s because prices were low, supplies were \nplentiful, and producers wanted to wait until they better understood \nthe new era of deregulation.\n  The State of California recognized back in the 1980s that generation \nneeds might increase, and they tried to move forward with building for \nnew generating plants. It was the utilities, not conservationists, who \nblocked the efforts. They said we didn't need any new capacity until \n2005, and they took their appeal to the State administrative law judge \nin their efforts to stop the State's push for new generating plants.\n  The utilities lost that battle. The State said you have to build new \ngenerating plants. Do you know what the utilities did? They ran to the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. And guess what the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission did. they sided with the utilities over the \nobjections of the State, and therefore we did not have these plants go \non line. Finally, now they are coming on line, and that, along with \nlong-term contracts and energy conservation, will solve our needs.\n  I can assure you that rolling back environmental laws and making our \nair dirty is the last thing my constituents want or need.\n  In Ms. Norton's testimony before the Energy Committee, she backed \naway from her life's work. Call me simplistic--and you can, and I don't \nmind it because I know I am a tough debater in this way. Call me \nsimplistic, but I do not believe that a lifetime commitment to \nrepealing environmental laws can be dissipated by nice, warm, fuzzy \nstatements made in front of a committee.\n  I was not born yesterday. I watched James Watt. He made nice, warm, \nfuzzy statements in front of the committee. He said: I will fully and \nfaithfully execute the public land laws adopted by Congress. I believe \nin balance. He said in his answers: Gee, I am unfamiliar with the \ndetails.\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\n  That is what Ms. Norton said. As a matter of fact, I find the \nparallels chilling, looking at her answers and looking at his answers.\n  We remember Secretary Watt's tenure at the Department of the \nInterior: Catastrophic impacts on the environment, opening up millions \nof acres of protected Federal lands, blocking Federal land \nacquisitions, making substantial changes in strip mining regulations \nthat weakened or directly repealed environmental law, new plans for oil \nand gas drilling in the Arctic, et cetera.\n  In closing, let me say I cannot vote for someone for this important \nposition whose life record has been against every single law that she \nsays she will now protect. There is too much at stake for my State. \nThere is too much at stake for the Nation. I have laid out my reasons. \nI take the Senate's responsibility of advice and consent seriously.\n  I would like to submit for the Record some of Ms. Norton's writing \nwhich include the extreme statements I referred to in my comments. I \nask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 14, 1987.\n     Hon. F. Henry Habicht, II,\n     Assistant Attorney General, Division of Land and Natural \n         Resources.\n\n     Attention: Donald A. Carr, Esquire,\n     Chief, Wildlife and Marine Resources Section, Department of \n         Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Habicht: In Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land \n     and Natural Resources, Civ. No. 78-0030 (D. Hawaii, Nov. 21, \n     1986), the United States District Court for the District of \n     Hawaii recently issued an opinion that interprets the scope \n     of the ``taking'' prohibition of Section 9 of the Endangered \n     Species Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1538 (1982). The Interior \n     Department is concerned that the Palila court's discussion of \n     the concept of taking, or ``harming,'' endangered species by \n     habitat degradation is overbroad; therefore, should the \n     Palila decision be appealed, the Department requests the \n     opportunity to prepare or review an amicus curiae brief for \n     submission to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       In determining that the State of Hawaii's maintenance of \n     mouflon sheep on the Mauna Kea Game Management Area (which \n     includes most of the Palila's critical habitat) ``harms'' the \n     Palila, the district court held that: ``A finding of ``harm'' \n     does not require death to individual members of the species, \n     nor does it require a finding that habitat degredation is \n     presently driving the species further toward extinction. \n     Habitat destruction that prevents the recovery of the species \n     by affecting essential behavioral patterns causes actual \n     injury to the species and effects a taking under section 9 of \n     the Act.'' Palila, supra, slip op. at 9. The district court's \n     analysis appears to improperly blend Section 7 concepts \n     (i.e., the prohibitions against jeopardy and the destruction \n     or adverse modification of critical habitat) into the \n     definition of ``harm,'' and, therefore, needlessly expands \n     that definition to include habitat destruction that does not \n     actually result in death or physical injury to an endangered \n     species, either directly or indirectly in the foreseeable \n     future. In order to show ``harm,'' there must be proof of a \n     causal connection between the habitat modifying activity and \n     foreseeable death or injury to an endangered species.\n       The scope of the holding in Palila runs counter to the \n     Interior Department's redefinition of the term ``harm'': Harm \n     in the definition of ``take'' in the Act means an act which \n     actually kills or injures wildlife * * * such act may include \n     significant habitat modification or degradation where it \n     actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing \n     essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or \n     sheltering.'' 50 C.F.R. Sec. 17.3 (1985) (emphasis added). In \n     short, the department's definition of ``harm'' quite clearly \n     requires a showing of actual death or injury to wildlife, \n     even in the case of taking by habitat modification.\n       For those who would develop real estate near or within \n     endangered species habitat, the Palila decision could expand \n     their Section 9 liability if essential behavioral patterns of \n     the species are affected to the extent that recovery is \n     prevented. No proof of mortalities or actual physical injury \n     to endangered species would be required to sustain a \n     prosecution or civil injunctive action under the Palila \n     ruling. The Palila decision poses an equally serious concern \n     to federal land managing agencies.\n       Please contact Michael Young of my staff at 343-2172 if we \n     can be of assistance on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gale A. Norton,\n     Associate Solicitor, Conservation and Wildlife.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Takings Analysis of Regulations\n\n                          (By Gale A. Norton)\n\n       Because the panel already has discussed why property is \n     both an enemy and an ally of regulation, I will move \n     immediately to a discussion of how to protect property from \n     excessive regulation. How do we restore a regime of property \n     rights? I would like to discuss a few things happening on \n     that front.\n       This Symposium occurs at an appropriate time: March 15, \n     1989, is the first anniversary of the issuance of President \n     Reagan's Executive Order 12,630 dealing with takings. It is \n     surprising that the Executive Order has received so little \n     publicity because it is a unique approach to the issue. It \n     asks the federal agencies to move beyond their environmental \n     and regulatory impact analyses, and to perform a takings \n     impact analysis. The agencies are asked to examine their \n     regulations and determine whether the regulations are likely \n     to cause takings of property and, if so, to estimate what \n     effect the regulations will have on the federal budget. As \n     might be expected, the agencies are not wildly enthusiastic \n     about performing takings impact analyses. The agencies tend \n     to believe that they are not taking anything and that they \n     should never have to pay compensation. Nevertheless, it \n     appears that the agencies are beginning to develop plans for \n     performing analyses in accordance with the Order.\n       Compensation is the key issue in any analysis under the \n     Takings Clause. First, of course, compensation provides \n     fairness to the person who is harmed by the regulation or \n     other government action. The classic rationale for \n     compensation is that, in fairness and justice, one individual \n     should not be forced to bear the burden that ought properly \n     to be borne by society as a whole. Second, compensation tends \n     to limit government action. Even though bureaucrats enjoy the \n     benefit of spending other people's money, their actions are \n     constrained by their agency's budget. If the government must \n     pay compensation when its actions interfere with private \n     property rights, then its regulatory actions must be limited. \n     This constraint also results in a limitation on transfer \n     activity. If compensation is paid, the political system must \n     take into account some financial costs. Therefore, some \n     brakes are applied on political redistribution as compared \n     with a system that puts everyone's property rights up for \n     grabs.\n       Finally, the payment of compensation helps encourage the \n     resolution of social problems by private, voluntary \n     contractual arrangements rather than by regulation. It may \n     appear cost-free to work out conflicts by regulation because \n     the costs are off-budget. But when regulations impose burdens \n     on private individuals, the costs are borne by the private \n     sector and are not considered in the democratic \n     decisionmaking process. As those costs are returned to the \n     budget by payment of compensation, we will start looking at \n     alternatives to regulations that may in the long run be more \n     beneficial.\n       President Reagan's Executive Order on takings has generated \n     significant disapproval from the environmental community, \n     including criticism from Jerry Jackson, a former attorney for \n     the National Wildlife Federation. He said the Executive Order \n     mandates an impossibility because it requires the agencies to \n     determine under the current takings law what actions might be \n     unconstitutional takings. I agree with him on this point. The \n     takings case law is currently such a mess that it is \n     difficult to ascertain what is and is not a taking. The \n     Supreme Court has provided clear guidance in this area.\n       I, however, disagree strongly with Mr. Jackson about the \n     role of the Constitution in executive agency decisionmaking. \n     He seems to believe that the only way the Constitution \n     figures into an executive agency's decision is that, long \n     after the fact, a court finally addresses the issue and \n     decides that there was indeed a taking. Before a court's \n     decision, the agency should be oblivious to the takings \n     implications. Mr. Jackson says, ``Whether a permit denial \n     might be construed by a court to effect a taking is not a \n     relevant factor in an agency's decision to grant or deny the \n     permit absent express legislative authority making it a \n     factor.'' I would be very interested to see that legislative \n     authority. It would have to say something like, ``In this \n     case, the Constitution applies.'' Mr. Jackson also notes that \n     the Executive Order on takings may have a chilling effect on \n     regulation. I view that as something positive.\n       I consider next the formulations that might be used in \n     deciding when an environmental regulation is a taking and \n     ought to result in compensation. An exception to the \n     compensation requirement has been recognized when the \n     government acts pursuant to the police power or restrains \n     public nuisances. The exact scope of this exception is not \n     clear. Because we are looking at alternatives. I will act \n     like a good bureaucrat and look at the extreme alternatives.\n       Let us first assume that there is absolutely no police \n     power or nuisance exception to the takings rule. The \n     government pays whenever it regulates in a way that \n     interferes with private property rights. In a way, this \n     regime would be easy to administer. One would simply look at \n     the property values before and after the regulation is \n     imposed to determine the amount of compensation. But under \n     this regime, the government would have to pay for all types \n     or regulations--even those that halt the worst criminal \n     offenses. (One wonders what the compensation to criminals \n     would be for closing down a crack house--probably mind-\n     boggling.) In such a case, we have little justification for \n     taking money from the taxpayers to pay someone not to engage \n     in socially inappropriate or criminal behavior. Such cases \n     also pose the danger of\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\n     someone coming back time and time again with, ``Well, last \n     time you paid me to close down a crack house. Now it's time \n     to pay me to close down the bordello, and next week you can \n     pay me to close down whatever I dream up next time.'' The \n     model is open to exploitation by repeat offenders.\n       At the other extreme, let us assume that the government \n     does not have to pay at all unless it chooses to label its \n     action condemnation. Again, such a regime would be easy to \n     administer. In fact, it would be facile. The government never \n     would have to worry about what it takes, but individual \n     rights clearly would not be protected.\n       One formulation that actually has been adopted by the \n     courts is a nuisance exception: No compensation is due if a \n     taking is performed pursuant to the police power in \n     regulating a nuisance. Unfortunately, this is often expressed \n     as a broad police power exception: Compensation need not be \n     paid for government actions undertaken pursuant to the police \n     power. The problem with this approach is defining the police \n     power. The police power may be interpreted very broadly, as \n     it was, for example, in the License Cases of 1847: ``nothing \n     more or less than the powers of government inherent in every \n     sovereignty to the extent of its dominions.'' This definition \n     covers far too much. No regulatory taking would ever be \n     compensated. Furthermore, there is no textual support in the \n     Constitution for an exception to the takings rule for police \n     powers. A further problem with a broad police-power exception \n     to the compensation requirement is that the public-use \n     requirement in the Takings Clause has been interpreted as \n     being ``coterminous'' with the police power. Combining a \n     police-power exception to the compensation requirement with a \n     police-power definition of what is a public use leaves an \n     empty box as to when compensation would be awarded. A taking \n     would be appropriate if performed pursuant to the police \n     power and pursuant to public use, but no compensation would \n     be necessary because it falls within the police-power \n     exception.\n       A much better formulation focuses on the extent of the \n     property rights involved, presumably, there is no actual \n     property right in maintaining a nuisance. Thus, government is \n     not involved in a taking when it halts a nuisance because \n     there is no property right to take. The Keystone decision \n     states this rule, but the analysis in the opinion proceeds to \n     ignore it. There was clearly a property right under state law \n     in that case, but the Supreme Court proceeded as if there \n     were no such right.\n       Another crucial step in the analysis is defining a \n     nuisance, including determining whether a nuisance is to be \n     interpreted by the common law, and deciding whether nuisance \n     is synonymous with a negative externality. If they are \n     synonymous, then aesthetic harms are problematic. Let me give \n     you an example. I am from Denver, I am a Broncos fan--at \n     least I watch about half of every Super Bowl game in which \n     they are involved. A few years ago, when we were in our fist \n     Super Bowl, there was a craze to paint one's house Bronco \n     orange. If I lived across the street from one of those \n     houses, I would view the aesthetic harm to myself as an \n     interference with my right to use my property, but I doubt \n     that we want to regulate such aesthetic harm.\n       A different way of identifying a nuisance is to require a \n     physical invasion of neighboring property. A physical \n     invasion test eliminates the problem of aesthetic harm. But \n     physical invasion standing alone is not necessarily a \n     nuisance. There must be some additional element of \n     harmfulness, undesirability, or inappropriateness.\n       Another alternative is to consider some kind of reasonable \n     right to use our property. In the Nollan case, Justice \n     Scalia, writing for the Court, noted that the right to build \n     on one's property was an actual right and not a government-\n     granted privilege. Regulation of this right may have very \n     significant repercussions in future land-use litigation. \n     Interestingly, we might even go so far as to recognize a \n     homesteading right to pollute or to make noise in an area. \n     This approach would eliminate some of the theoretical \n     problems with defining a nuisance.\n       Moving beyond the question of defining the nuisance \n     exception to the just compensation requirement. I would like \n     to summarize a few other key components of current takings \n     analysis. In evaluating regulatory takings, particularly in \n     the land-use context, the Court often employs a diminution in \n     value test. Under this test,if a regulation goes too far, it \n     is a taking. The question, as phrased by the courts, is \n     whether the regulation denies the owner all economically \n     viable use of the property. Under this test, the courts have \n     found that diminutions in value of seventy-five percent of \n     almost ninety percent are not sufficiently severe to \n     constitute takings.\n       Another question is whether a regulation substantially \n     advances a legitimate state interest. This is similar to the \n     requirement of having a public use for the taking under the \n     Fifth Amendment, and therefore it does not provide us with a \n     satisfactory test of what should and should not be \n     compensated. It focuses on what the government is properly \n     empowered to do, not at what it can do on the condition that \n     it pay compensation. Although this test has been frequently \n     reiterated by the Court, it has seldom been used to strike \n     down an uncompensated taking.\n       One other approach is the bundle of rights test. An \n     interference with a particularly important strand in the \n     bundle of rights may constitute a taking. This test has not \n     yielded particularly enlightening results. A right to exclude \n     others and a right to pass to one's heirs are significant and \n     denial of these rights will be deemed a taking. On the \n     other hand, ownership of a support estate as part of a \n     mineral interest or the right to sell property, are not \n     considered significant and compensable.\n       An emerging way of looking at the question is the nexus \n     requirement that is set forth in the Nollan decision and that \n     is discussed extensively in Executive Order 12,630. This \n     analysis requires that conditions put on permits have the \n     same health and safety objectives, and substantially advance \n     the same objectives, as the denial of a permit would serve. A \n     good example of such an approach is the case of wetlands \n     dredge and fill permits. The purpose of the wetlands \n     regulatory program is to protect water quality. Its \n     application has been judicially and administratively expanded \n     to protect wetlands values. Frequently, conditions are placed \n     on dredge and fill permits that have no relationship to the \n     overall purpose of the regulatory program, such as providing \n     recreational boat ramps and docks. It will be interesting to \n     watch how these issues are treated as the Executive Order \n     analysis develops.\n       In this discussion, I have not examined a number of other \n     formulations in the takings context--compensating benefits \n     and so forth--that further complicate the whole analysis. As \n     the preceding discussion indicates, the analysis at this \n     point is very confused and inconsistent. This confusion, \n     however, creates an opportunity for a major shift in takings \n     jurisprudence, toward a greater protection of property \n     rights.\n\n                               [Panel II]\n\n             Economic Rights Provisions of the Constitution\n\n                            (By Gale Norton)\n\n       I would like to explore some of the means by which I \n     believe the Constitution provides judges with standards for \n     the protection of economic liberties. Throughout the history \n     of the United States, the protection of economic rights has \n     been attempted through a variety of provisions: the ex post \n     facto clause, the contracts clause, the takings clause, the \n     privileges and immunities clause, and through theories of \n     natural rights and due process. While each of these \n     approaches has been largely rejected by the courts, litigants \n     are continually exploring new approaches for the protection \n     of economic rights.\n       Economic rights are clearly not protected today. Land is \n     owned subject to the whims of one's neighbors on the zoning \n     commission. Prices of goods and services are controlled by a \n     plethora of governmental and regulatory bodies. Selective \n     taxation hampers the growth and innovation of industry, and \n     subsidies enrich some sectors of society at the expense of \n     others.\n       There are substantial similarities between the takings and \n     contracts clauses. Both clauses limit the powers of \n     government, chiefly the police and eminent domain powers. The \n     eminent domain power is not explicitly provided in the \n     Constitution, but it has been upheld for many years as a \n     necessary and inherent power of government. The police power \n     is exercised by state governments; the federal government \n     exercises similar authority through the commerce power and \n     other delegated powers. The contracts clause applies by its \n     terms only to the states, the takings clause only to the \n     federal government. The requirement of just compensation has, \n     however, been applied to states through the fourteenth \n     amendment. Ellen Frankel Paul has noted the inconsistencies \n     between recognition of the eminent domain power and the \n     Lockean natural rights approach to property rights. An \n     extended discussion of these inconsistencies is beyond the \n     scope of today's discussion; however, I believe it is \n     instructive to explore briefly the character of these \n     governmental powers as they highlight the role and \n     importance of the takings and contracts clauses.\n       The police power is basically government regulation for the \n     promotion and protection of health, safety, morals, and the \n     general welfare. In a narrow sense, it is the government \n     attempting to enforce the maxim that one should use one's \n     property so as not to injure that of another. This narrow \n     view of the police power firmly prevailed in the early days \n     of the United States, but it has now been broadened to \n     include not only the protection of public safety, health, and \n     morals, but anything rationally related to these broad areas. \n     Indeed, Justice Brennan stated in his dissent in Nollan v. \n     California Coastal Commission that a review of the use of the \n     police power ``demands only that the state could rationally \n     have decided that the measure might achieve the state's \n     objective.'' Thus, the only practical limitation on this \n     power comes from specific constitutional provisions such as \n     the contracts and takings clauses.\n       The contracts clause is one of those provisions that has \n     been virtually written out of the Constitution in current \n     times. Even though James Madison eloquently discussed the \n     contracts clause in Federalist No. 44 in fairly modern terms, \n     modern jurisprudence has seemingly discarded the clause. \n     Essentially, Madison viewed the contracts clause as \n     discouraging transfer activities, keeping decisions out of \n     the hands of lobbyists, and providing the predictability \n     necessary for business planning.\n       Despite the soundness of the reasons behind the contracts \n     clause, its erosion began discouragingly early in our \n     history. In Ogden v. Saunders, the Supreme Court held that \n     only existing contracts were protected by\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\n     the clause. The Court had previously held that the ex post \n     facto clause applied only to criminal activities, thereby \n     preventing its use for the protection of contracts. Thus, by \n     1827 the Court had already moved away from viewing the \n     contracts clause as a broad freedom of contract provision \n     that would protect contracts generally.\n       Today, the clause is so weakened that in the recent \n     Keystone Coal decision the Court stated, ``Unlike other \n     provisions in article 1, section 10, it is well settled that \n     the prohibition against impairing the obligation of contracts \n     is not to be read literally.'' The chief reason for this view \n     of the contracts clause is that the courts have clearly \n     stated that the clause does not supersede the police power. \n     This puts us in a ``catch 22'' position because the police \n     power (in the modern broad sense) is exactly what the \n     contracts clause should be limiting. Therefore, we have a \n     limitation that is superseded by the power it is intended \n     to restrain.\n       The takings clause is somewhat more alive than the \n     contracts clause, but it also suffers from some debilitating \n     restrictions. An encouraging note is the widespread interest \n     in Richard Epstein's analysis, which expands the takings \n     clause beyond simply eminent domain activities to encompass \n     limitations on the commerce power, taxing power, and so \n     forth. The analysis takes a simple political science \n     approach, i.e., that the takings clause was meant to operate \n     as a check preventing the majority from raiding the assets of \n     the other forty-nine percent of society. Compensation must be \n     paid when the burdens of society fall too heavily on an \n     individual or group, which presumably limits regulatory \n     excesses. The compensation may be monetary or implicit in-\n     kind compensation. Thus, those who are burdened or taxed for \n     the benefit of society are compensated for their special \n     sacrifices.\n       The current judicial interpretation of the takings clause, \n     however, falls far short of the role discussed by Richard \n     Epstein and intended by the Constitution. For instance, in \n     the public use cases of Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff \n     and Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto the Supreme Court held that the \n     public use justification is coterminous with the police \n     powers. This interpretation can work to deprive individuals \n     of their economic rights. The transfer of property from \n     private party to private party, through the compulsion of the \n     state, will now be upheld when any rational basis can be put \n     forth. Moreover, the courts will only step in if the state's \n     public use determination involves an impossibility and \n     therefore has no rational justification.\n       In the case of a regulatory taking, the standard approach \n     has been that when regulation goes too far, it is a taking. \n     ``Too far'' generally means that a regulation, under the \n     guise of the police power, does not advance a legitimate \n     state interest or that an owner has been deprived of all \n     economically viable use of his property. As stated earlier, \n     the courts will uphold any state action that is supported in \n     any fashion by some state interest. Moreover, the courts have \n     held that the loss of only one or several attributes of the \n     ``bundle of sticks'' of property ownership is not equal to a \n     taking. The courts have often gone to ridiculous extremes to \n     find some remaining viable use. The only relief the courts \n     have granted property owners in this area in recent times has \n     been to hold that a deprivation of property need not be \n     permanent to bring into force the takings clause. This is a \n     minimal breakthrough since the property owner still has the \n     ominous burden of showing that a taking has occurred.\n       I believe that some changes are desperately needed in the \n     jurisprudence of economic liberties. The preceding analysis \n     suggests some specific overall changes. I think one important \n     change should be in the level of scrutiny applied to statutes \n     affecting economic liberties. An extreme proposal would be to \n     place the burden of proof on the government to justify its \n     regulations. Levels of scrutiny below this extreme, but \n     higher than the current minimal scrutiny, are realistic.\n       I would like to note that there are some grounds for \n     optimism in the recent Supreme Court decisions. Bernard \n     Siegan, in his Economic Liberties and the Constitution, \n     states: ``A change of one vote on the Supreme Court in Ogden \n     v. Saunders would have, in 1827, brought economic due process \n     into being through the contracts clause. One vote likewise \n     separated the majority and minority position on the \n     constitutional status of economic rights in the 1872 \n     Slaughterhouse cases. * * * [E]conomic due process was \n     unanimously accepted in 1897 and it fell by one vote in \n     1937.''\n       Hopefully in the future these close calls will be resolved \n     in favor of freedom.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume of Senator Murkowski's time, I believe. I ask for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, that is one of those remarkable things \nabout this body. We can come to the floor and debate vigorously many \ndifferent issues. In this case, we are making remarks about what I hope \nwill soon be our secretary of the environment, our Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Interior, Gale Norton.\n  I come to the floor to give some words of support for her appointment \nand with just the greatest amount of respect to my colleague who just \nspoke, Senator Barbara Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you very much.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from California--and I have the \ngreatest respect for her as an environmental leader--I have carefully \nconsidered the nomination of Gale Norton, former attorney general of \nColorado, to be our Secretary of the Interior and arrived at a \ndifferent conclusion.\n  Let me begin by saying that since the announcement for this position, \nthere has been much debate about positions she has taken throughout the \ncourse of her career. Whether the topic has been protection of private \nproperty rights, environmental self-audits, or certain provisions of \nthe Endangered Species Act, she has advocated for limits on Federal \npower while arguing for more State and local authority.\n  In its core essence, that is not necessarily a bad thing. We need to \nbe very sensitive to local and State governments as we craft and \nfashion and design environmental laws for this Nation. Frankly, I think \nin some instances the Federal Government has gone, you might say, \noverboard or has not had as much sensitivity to State and local \ngovernments as perhaps we should. We are still a work in progress here.\n  I find her position, actually, for State and local authority, \nrefreshing and necessary, recognizing that one size does not fit all. \nBut I do not question her commitment to clean air, to clean water, and \nto finding the right ways to pursue those goals.\n  As Secretary of the Interior, it would be her duty to manage public \nlands on behalf of the Federal Government and also to represent its \ninterests in any dispute. So some legitimate concerns have been raised \nas to whether she would fall on the side of State and local government \nor Federal Government. I think she put those issues to rest clearly and \nsquarely in her testimony before the committee as she said she would \nrepresent the interests of the Federal Government, using her \nsensitivity to State and local governments as an asset, but not as a \nbarrier to fighting vigorously for and enforcing environmental laws \nthat are on the books.\n  One such example I would like to point out that should be in her \nfavor is her successful advocacy for the Rocky Mountain Arsenal \ncleanup. When the Federal Government itself was standing in the way of \nefficient and effective cleanup, Gale Norton challenged the Federal \nGovernment to clean up its own hazardous waste sites and led the fight \nsuccessfully in that area, and that is a project that is still going \nforward.\n  In her 2 days of testimony before our committee as well as her \nanswers to a few hundred written questions, I believe she has \nsufficiently indicated her honest intention to enforce the Federal laws \nas they are written and as the courts have interpreted them. Policy \ndifferences from time to time between Ms. Norton and the Members of \nthis body are unavoidable. However, she has listened attentively to the \nconcerns expressed by members of the committee, and her pledges to work \nwith us seem genuine.\n\n  In addition, I am encouraged by her comments that she was willing to \ngive appropriate consideration to the impact of Federal laws on State \nand local interests, which is something I mentioned before as very \nimportant to me and many Members, Democrats and Republicans, in our \nbody. While there are certain instances where national policy on \nenvironmental issues is necessary, as I said earlier, sometimes one \nsize does not fit all. We would be wise to recognize that and implement \ndifferent strategies for different regions and different States.\n  In fact, Ms. Norton and I had the opportunity to discuss such a \nmatter during her recent visit to my office--my favorite subject, \nactually--the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which is a \nconservation program that will benefit all 50 States. She expressed an \ninterest to learn more about this. She expressed a very keen \nunderstanding of the contribution made by coastal States, in terms of \nthe amount of\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\nmoney that is sent to the Federal Government from offshore oil and gas \nproduction, that could be used more wisely to replenish and restore \nsome of our renewable resources while we are, in fact, depleting a \nnonrenewable resource.\n  Based on the crisis that we are facing in our Nation today, our \nenergy crisis--as the chairman, Senator Murkowski, from the State of \nAlaska, has so ably spoken about on this floor so many times--we can \nreally now recognize the value of producing States. Let's make sure the \nbillions of dollars we are sending to the Federal Treasury is used not \njust for general government purposes but used to invest in our \nenvironment to provide parks and recreation, wildlife and conservation, \nand, yes, to extend help to coastal impact assistance and coastal \ncommunities everywhere.\n  She says she understands it. Although she has not officially endorsed \nthe bill, she will work very closely with us to carry out our work on \nCARA. Let me be quick to mention, though, that while she has not taken \nan official position and did not do so in the hearings, President Bush \ndid in fact endorse, during the campaign, the CARA legislation. He did \nremind us all as Americans that you just can't keep taking; that \nsometimes you have to give back if you want your children and your \ngrandchildren to enjoy the same benefits of open spaces, wildlife, and \nfisheries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes to close.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may, I dearly want to accommodate my good friend \nfrom Louisiana, but Senator Landrieu asked for 7 minutes, Senator \nHutchison for 5, and Senator Baucus for a minute and a half. The two \nSenators from Colorado need time, and we have to finish at 12:30. I \nencourage colleagues to try to keep within their time limits.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. I will take 1 minute to close.\n  President Bush endorsed this bill during the campaign, and I believe \nwith Ms. Norton's leadership, with President Bush's leadership, and \nwith bipartisan leadership in the Senate and House, it is an early \nbipartisan victory we can achieve for the environment and for our \nNation. I look forward to working with her on that and many other \nissues. I am proud to support her nomination as our new Secretary of \nthe Interior, and I look forward to working with her in the years \nahead.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I believe the Senator from Texas seeks recognition as the next in \norder on the list, followed by Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Energy Committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of my friend Gale \nNorton to be Secretary of the Interior.\n  I have watched Gale as the attorney general of Colorado. I worked \nwith her very closely on the lawsuit that the attorneys general of our \nStates filed against the tobacco companies. Gale was one of the key \nleaders of the States' attorneys general in that effort and \nsuccessfully negotiated the lawsuit against the tobacco companies. We \nworked very hard to make sure that that money stayed in the States, \nthat the Federal Government was not able to take part of the tobacco \nsettlement money away from the States. That has certainly helped all of \nour States use that money mostly for the purpose of better health care \nfor the indigent people in their States and for all citizens who need \nhelp with health care.\n  In my State of Texas, we added it to the CHIP program for children's \nhealth insurance. I know this has added to the quality of health care \ncoverage in our country, and Gale Norton was one of those most \nresponsible for it.\n  As a former State official, she has also shown that she wants to \nprotect the environment, and she also wants balance in our \nenvironmental laws. She believes the Federal Government should have the \nsame requirements to keep environmental standards high that our private \nindustries do.\n  As Colorado attorney general, she was able to get involved in \nnegotiations to make sure the Federal Government cleaned up hazardous \nwaste in the Rocky Mountain arsenal.\n  She is going to be the person who will improve public health and the \nenvironment in an evenhanded and thoughtful way. I can think of no \nperson who would be better for this job as Secretary of the Interior \nthan Gale Norton.\n  Mr. President, we will also be voting on the nomination of Gov. \nChristine Todd Whitman to be EPA Administrator, a Cabinet post. I \ncannot think of a better person for EPA Administrator than this \nwonderful Governor of New Jersey who has a very strong environmental \nrecord and who also believes in balance to make sure that our economy \nstays strong and we keep the environment clean for future generations.\n  I am proud to speak for Governor Whitman and for my friend Gale \nNorton to join the Cabinet of President Bush, hopefully this afternoon, \nbecause I think they will add immense experience, quality, \nintelligence, and integrity to that Cabinet. I am pleased to support \nthem.\n  I thank Senator Murkowski for giving me this time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  Senator Baucus is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at the outset, I want to be clear that I \nhave reservations about Ms. Norton's ability to reconcile her history \nof passionately battling Federal environmental and public health laws \nwith her duties as Interior Secretary, the public's voice in protecting \nand managing the Nation's national parks, its endangered wildlife and \none-third of the nation's public lands.\n  Ms. Norton has stated she endorses the goals of our nation's land and \nwildlife protection laws. She must do more. She must enforce and uphold \nthe spirit of those laws, the very laws she has tried in the past to \nundermine. She must ensure balance in her and her Department's \ndecisions, listening to the concerns of all interested parties.\n  Because so many lands in Montana belong to the Federal Government and \nwill fall under Ms. Norton's jurisdiction, Ms. Norton's actions will \nhave an enormous impact on our way of life. Her actions will also \nimpact the many native American tribes in Montana. I hope we can work \ntogether to ensure that those impacts are positive, both for Montana \nand for the Nation. I know I will do my part, and I expect she will do \nher part.\n  Despite these reservations, I believe that Ms. Norton is qualified \nfor this position, I believe that she is honest and that she has the \nutmost integrity and that she will do her best to carry out her many \nobligations. I believe that Ms. Norton should be confirmed as Secretary \nof the Interior.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to offer my \nwholehearted support for Gale Norton's nomination.\n  After all the rhetoric about Ms. Norton for the last month, it only \ntook two appearances before the Energy Committee to get an 18-2 vote. \nThat may not be unanimous, but it is mighty close to it. It is \ncertainly overwhelming. I believe it is evidence that an overwhelming \nmajority of the committee knows she is an outstanding candidate for the \njob.\n  She has proven she is knowledgeable, articulate, and capable of \nenduring round after round of detailed questions while being the object \nof pretty outrageous charges and mean-spirited ads paid for by her \nextremist detractors. She handled it, as she does everything, by simply \nfocusing on the job at hand. The more she sat in those hearings, the \nmore she convinced our colleagues that she is the right person for the \njob.\n  My Democrat colleagues on the committee saw, as with several other \nBush nominees, that getting through this nomination process is not \neasy. The environmental groups that focused on her simply were wrong. \nHer management direction and experience have been proven over and over, \nand I was pleased to hear some very enthusiastic and\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\ncommendable words from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and \nother side of the dais in our Energy Committee before we voted to send \nher nomination to the floor.\n  My friend and colleague from California, Senator Dianne Feinstein, \nstated:\n\n       Some of the things said about her are simply not correct.\n\n  That is absolutely true. Some of the articles in paid-for ads in the \nWashington Post were simply distorted.\n  She certainly allayed, through her testimony and her answers to 227 \nwritten questions to the committee, the fears my colleagues had. \nSenator Baucus, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Bingaman, all valued \nMembers of this body, questioned her at length and came away with the \nsame opinion I have: That she is going to be a very good Secretary of \nthe Interior. Directly after the vote, the same people who had attacked \nher before did so again, and also sent kind of a warning shot to the \nSenate Democrats on the committee. The President of the Friends of the \nEarth, a prominent environmental group, said after the vote that Norton \nis ``a wolf in sheep's clothing'' and that ``she pulled the wool over \nthe eyes of the Senators.'' That paragraph was in the Washington Post \non January 24. These are the types of fictional jabs that I believe led \nto the vote for her overwhelmingly.\n\n  Contrary to the Friends of the Earth, she did not pull the wool over \nanybody's eyes. In fact, if anything, she opened the eyes of many of \nthe committee members who had some questions about her qualifications \nbefore she had a chance to be interviewed.\n  I have known Gale for many years both in a professional capacity and \nas a friend, too. Let me state for the Record, she has a long and \ndistinguished career of doing the right thing--always. Her consensus-\nbuilding ability might be best illustrated by her 8 years as Colorado's \nattorney general. There she served under a Democrat Governor and still \naccomplished much for the betterment of Colorado, not the least of \nwhich was the cleanup of Superfund sites.\n  For more than 20 years, she has provided leadership on environmental \nand public lands and has demonstrated a responsible commonsense \napproach to preserving our natural heritage.\n  I listened to some of the comments of her detractors on the floor \nthis morning, and I will tell you that is not the Gale Norton I know. \nIn fact, the Gale Norton I know represents a balanced approach to \npublic lands.\n  Another significant fact to know about Ms. Norton is she is committed \nto enforcing the law as it is written. Throughout her questioning in \nfront of the Energy Committee, she repeatedly stated she will enforce \nthe letter of the law with which she is entrusted. I believed her. The \nmajority of the committee also believed her.\n  I think that is a novel approach. I say to the Presiding Officer, \ncoming from the West, you, as I, have seen a Secretary of the Interior \nthe last number of years who believes laws are passed by Congress, and \nthey are simply an extension of what the Secretary of the Interior \nwants to do by rulemaking authority. Ms. Norton will follow the rule of \nlaw.\n  She listens to common sense while she searches for common ground. \nUnlike many in Washington, she understands that real environmental \nsolutions do not just come from beltway professionals or are driven by \nideological purists but come by including people whose lives are going \nto be affected. They come from real people with honest concerns about \nthe land and the water.\n  She relayed this to all of the Senators she testified before and \nvisited around the time of her confirmation hearing. She proved to 18 \nof the 20 Senators of the committee that she is the right person for \nthe job. She is up to the task. She will be a very fine Secretary of \nthe Interior.\n  And probably above all, we have witnessed in the West in the last few \nyears a process which certainly locks out any local input whatsoever. \nMs. Norton is concerned about that. She knows that the people whose \nlives are affected at the local level must also be included when we \ntalk about public lands policy.\n  Her record as a public servant demonstrates she will work with all \nparties to craft reasonable solutions. That kind of evenhanded approach \nto public land management has been missing, and the West is worse off \nfor it. I know she will bring to this office of Interior Secretary \ndecisive action in the land and resource issues where we have recently \nseen too much photo-op and not enough solid demonstrable decisions.\n  I believe she should be confirmed by the full Senate quickly, and by \na large margin, and certainly would ask my colleagues to do so.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, might I ask, how much time is remaining \nfor debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Seventeen minutes. I thank the Chair, and I thank my \ncolleague from Colorado.\n  Mr. President, virtually every newspaper in Colorado has endorsed Ms. \nNorton. I cannot think of one that has not. The attorneys general \nthroughout the United States have rallied behind her, those who have \nworked with her and know her. I cannot think of a greater tribute to \nher than hearing from those who have worked with her and have respected \nher over an extended period of time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters, dated January 29, 2001, signed \nby the general president, James P. Hoffa, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      International Brotherhood of\n\n\n                                                    Teamsters,\n\n                                                 January 29, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.5 million members of the \n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I urge you to support \n     the nomination of Gale Norton for Secretary of Interior.\n       As you know, the United States finds itself facing an ever-\n     growing crisis in meeting its energy needs. As skyrocketing \n     gas prices hit the pocketbooks of working Americans and \n     rolling blackouts bring to a grinding halt the economic \n     engine of California, the citizens of this country look to \n     the federal government to address this program now.\n       Our first step must be to increase the United States' \n     energy independence. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     (ANWR) offers a realistic and immediate opportunity for \n     working toward this goal. Tapping the resources of ANWR in an \n     environmentally sensitive manner will provide 10.3 billion \n     gallons of oil, while at the same time creating an estimated \n     25,000 Teamster jobs and potentially 750,000 jobs nationwide.\n       Ms. Norton recognizes these facts. Her commitment to \n     finding real solutions, particularly with regard to ANWR, \n     demonstrates that she has the ability to balance the needs of \n     the environment with the needs of working Americans.\n       Admittedly, during her tenure as Colorado Attorney General, \n     Ms. Norton did oppose the labor community on some issues very \n     important to our members. However, I believe that her \n     commitment to energy independence and job creation portends a \n     welcome shift in priorities at the Department of the Interior \n     that will benefit Teamsters and other working families.\n       For these reasons, I ask you to vote to confirm Gale Norton \n     as Secretary of Interior.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James P. Hoffa,\n                                                General President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  I will take the liberty of referring to the letter:\n\n       On behalf of the 1.5 million members of the International \n     Brotherhood of Teamsters, I urge you to support the \n     nomination of Gale Norton for Secretary of Interior.\n\n  The next paragraph reads as follows:\n\n       As you know, the United States finds itself facing an ever-\n     growing crisis in meeting its energy needs. . . .\n       Our first step must be to increase the United States' \n     energy independence. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     (ANWR) offers a realistic and immediate opportunity for \n     working toward this goal. Tapping the resources of ANWR in an \n     environmentally sensitive manner will provide 10.3 billion \n     gallons of oil, while at the same time creating an estimated \n     25,000 Teamster jobs and potentially 750,000 jobs nationwide. \n     It would be the largest construction project in the history \n     of North America.\n       Admittedly, during her tenure as Colorado Attorney General, \n     Ms. Norton did oppose the labor community on some issues very \n     important to our members. However, I believe that her \n     commitment to energy independence and job creation portends a \n     welcome shift in priorities at the Department of the Interior \n     that will benefit . . . working families.\n\n  Mr. President, we disagree in this body on a daily basis, and that is\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\nhealthy, and it is a part of the process before us. But I think some in \nthe environmental community could learn from that model associated with \nMs. Norton's confirmation effort. She represents some of the western \nvalues and approaches toward public lands and the environment.\n  People are free to disagree with her values and approaches; however, \nin some cases, some have tried to portray her as an extremist. \nRepresentatives of some special interests said that she has spent her \nlifetime trying to undermine the mission of the agency she is nominated \nto lead; that is, the Department of the Interior.\n  The disagreeable rhetoric used was never born out in fact. In her \nentire testimony before the committee, of which I chair, the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, where we have held 2 days of hearings, we \nhad her respond to about 224 questions. We voted her out with a mandate \nvote of 18-2.\n  In any event, that rhetoric is without reality and has led to \nquestioning the goals of some in the environmental community. I do \nquestion the goals, and I do question the effort to basically character \nassassinate this nominee.\n  Let me quote from a January 19, 2001, guest editorial in the Chicago \nSun Times:\n\n       The Norton nomination exposes a growing schism within the \n     national environmental movement. An increasingly radical left \n     wing, funded by a small number of liberal foundations and \n     tens of millions of dollars each year from government grants, \n     will stop at nothing to shut down American manufacturing and \n     to ban all public access to public lands. These are the same \n     groups that rioted in Seattle in November 1999 and are \n     burning down resorts and new homes to protest sprawl.\n\n  Mr. President, it goes without saying that the Colorado newspapers \nhave supported Ms. Norton, but they go further than that. How about the \nTacoma News Tribune:\n\n       Norton has been described, even by some Democrats, as \n     bright, hard-working, highly ethical and willing to at least \n     listen to those with opposing views.\n\n  Washington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire said:\n\n       The Sierra Club asked me not to say positive things about \n     [Ms. Norton]. I told them to show me why she shouldn't be \n     confirmed. I am still waiting for them to show me the \n     evidence.\n\n  Like the Washington State attorney general, I am still waiting to see \nthe evidence that Ms. Norton does not support the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  She led the fight to save the California condor. In her appearance \nbefore the committee, she repeatedly stated that she would enforce the \nEndangered Species Act. I have heard television ads run about Ms. \nNorton's, something they call, ``right to pollute.'' They did not \nclarify that Ms. Norton used this phrase only in discussing emissions \ntrading, a concept later embodied in the Clean Air Act passed by the \nCongress. It was a Democratic Congress.\n  These are two of the egregious misrepresentations of her record made \nby special interest groups. I am almost ashamed of some of these \ngroups. I don't think any person in this body should repeat any of the \nvicious personal attacks made in desperate attempts to derail this \nnomination. I view some of the attacks as despicable, unworthy of the \nspace it took to print them. Such distortions and name calling really \nreflect badly on the authors, not on Ms. Norton. I am also ashamed that \nsome of these D.C.-based groups use the word ``Alaska'' as part of \ntheir name. The reputation of several of these environmental interest \ngroups is in tatters after this process. Ms. Norton's stature remains \nupright and in one piece.\n  I know we have heard from a number of Senators expressing their views \ntoday. The Senators who will close the debate--we have already heard \nfrom Senator Campbell; Senator Wayne Allard from Colorado is next--have \nworked under the tenure of the attorney general, and I commend their \nstatements to the Senate as a true picture of the nominee before us, \nthe nominee who will make an excellent Secretary of the Interior.\n  Finally, they try to rub out the messenger, but they can't rub out \nher message; that is, that she will uphold and enforce the law.\n  I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Alaska. I compliment him on a \nfine job on the floor and in committee on the nomination of Gale Norton \nto be Secretary of the Interior. I also recognize the diligent efforts \nof my colleague, Senator Ben Campbell of Colorado, in carrying forward, \nmaking sure we get a confirmation.\n  I rise today in strong support of President Bush's nomination of Gale \nNorton to be the next Secretary of the Interior. I have known Gale \nNorton for years and know her to be an individual with strong personal \nconvictions and the upmost professional integrity.\n  This past month, my colleagues in the Senate and our constituents \nhave had a chance to get to know Gale Norton. During that time they \nlearned that Gale was a member of the law school honor society at the \nUniversity of Denver; after law school she joined her alma mater as the \nInterim Director of the Transportation Law program at the University of \nDenver law school. Gale also worked at the U.S. Departments of \nAgriculture and Interior serving as Associate Solicitor for \nConservation and Wildlife. This diverse background gave her a solid \nfoundation to run successfully for Colorado's Attorney General, a \nposition she was overwhelmingly reelected to in 1994. During her 20 \nyears working on environmental and natural resource issues, Gale Norton \nhas gained a solid reputation defending the role of the State, \nadvocating sensible environmental cleanup and solving problems.\n  Now, I know that most western Senators support Gale Norton for \nSecretary of the Interior. But for those of my Senate colleagues who \nstill have doubts, let me tell them some more about Gale and her career \nand why she deserves their support.\n  I am a fifth generation Coloradan, and believe me, I know what it \nmeans to represent such a beautiful and diverse State. Gale also grew \nup in Colorado and she knows that Coloradans take environmental issues \nseriously. Whether it's a farmer or rancher, small businessman, high \ntech employee or new immigrant to the state, everyone recognizes and \nappreciates the connection between our economy and our environment. \nColorado is not gaining a 7th congressional seat because our \nenvironment has been neglected. If anything, Colorado has demonstrated \nthat there can be a balance between environmental protection and \neconomic prosperity. This balanced approach was utilized during Gale's \ntenure as Attorney General.\n  Coloradans recognized Gale's ability and qualifications and entrusted \nher to represent them on complex and diverse issues. As Colorado \nAttorney General, Gale was committed to enforcing the law. She led \nefforts to ensure that the federal government cleaned up its hazardous \nand toxic wastes in Colorado and actively participated in the \nsettlement of complex water rights cases. Gale also testified before \nCongress on implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act, \nSuperfund and Colorado wilderness legislation. Gale's input on these \nissues was always based on the premise that we can improve the laws so \nthey protect the environment without imposing unnecessary burdens on \nsociety. Contrary to some reports, commenting on the effectiveness of a \nlaw does not equate to advocating repeal of the law.\n  We need to set the record straight on some of the outlandish \nstatements radical environmental groups have been generating. Radical \nenvironmental groups are trying to tie Gale Norton to the Summitville \nmine disaster, an event that didn't even happen on her watch. It \nhappened under former Colorado Governor Roy Romer, a Democrat, his head \nof Department of Natural Resources Ken Salazar, and the attorney \ngeneral, also a democrat. No one denies the environmental abuses at \nSummitville, but unfairly trying to link Gale to this is appalling. \nEven Ken Salazar, who now serves as Colorado's Attorney General \nbelieves she should have the opportunity to serve as Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  During Gale's 8 years as attorney general, she never allowed free \nreign for polluters to come in and destroy our environment.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \neditorial entitled ``Summitville Gold Mine Is Cast As A Political \nBoogeyman'' by Denver Post columnist and editorial writer Al Knight.\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Jan. 30, 2001]\n\n         Summitville Gold Mine Is Cast as a Political Boogeyman\n\n                             (By Al Knight)\n\n       January 10, 2001.--The New York Times, for reasons that \n     must be assumed to be political, has attempted to smear Gale \n     Norton, President-elect George W. Bush's choice for Secretary \n     of Interior.\n       In an article last Sunday, The Times essentially attempted \n     to make Norton, a former Colorado attorney general, \n     responsible for what is headlined as ``the death of a \n     river.''\n       The article, which relied on a series of factual \n     misrepresentations regarding the Summitville gold mine, also \n     made a hash of explaining applicable environmental law.\n       The writer, Timothy Egan, clearly doesn't understand the \n     history of Summitville, nor does he demonstrate any \n     understanding of the ongoing dispute between the \n     Environmental Protection Agency and various states, including \n     Colorado, that have passed environmental self-audit laws.\n       Egan's thesis was simple. Summitville was an environmental \n     disaster. Norton was attorney general when it happened, thus \n     she was partially responsible for it. Because Norton has \n     supported self-audit laws that allow companies to inventory \n     and report on environmental problems, she therefore must \n     somehow countenance the environmental damage at Summitville.\n       The problem with this thesis is that it is wrong on almost \n     every count.\n       Egan misrepresents the so-called death of the Alamosa \n     River. That river has for decades been anything but a prime \n     fishery. The watershed has long been affected by acid mine \n     drainage and by naturally occurring minerals and heavy metals \n     in the soil. It is simply irresponsible of The Times to \n     continue to repeat allegations that discharges from \n     Summitville killed the river.\n       A high-level EPA memo written in 1995 summarizing \n     ``ecological data and risks at Summitville'' said there were \n     ``uniquely high and variable levels of natural background \n     metals (in the Alamosa River) which can often exceed aquatic \n     lethality benchmarks independently of site contamination.''\n       Translation: Summitville contamination alone cannot account \n     for the absence of fish in the river.\n       That same memo, by the way, says that drainage from the \n     Summitville site at certain times of the year ``could \n     actually improve upstream Alamosa River water quality.''\n       Egan goes on to repeat the falsehood that cyanide releases \n     from the Summitville mine killed fish. It makes for a nice \n     scare story but it did not happen. No fish died of cyanide \n     poisoning.\n       Norton was attorney general when the state and federal \n     government filed suit in 1996 against financier Robert \n     Friedland--a former owner of the company who ran the mine in \n     the mid- and late 1980s--attempting to recover cleanup costs.\n       That suit was finally settled last month, with Friedland \n     agreeing to pay $27.5 million. There is no allegation in The \n     Times or elsewhere that Norton did less than quality work in \n     connection with that case, which was mostly dictated by \n     federal law. It's worth noting that Friedland paid much less \n     than the government originally sought and won some important \n     concessions as part of his settlement, which ends all U.S. \n     claims against him.\n       For one thing, most of his money will stay in Colorado to \n     help improve conditions in or near the Alamosa River. \n     Normally, under the Superfund law, recovery of cleanup costs \n     goes directly into the federal treasury. Friedland has long \n     claimed that the federal government wasted millions at \n     Summitville and said that he did not want his money to be \n     used to effectively finance what he believes is EPA waste.\n       This concession was almost certainly won because the EPA \n     had badly botched its legal case against Friedland. Friedland \n     had a important case pending against the United States before \n     the Canadian Supreme Court, and it is safe to assume the \n     United States was anxious to avoid having that case go \n     forward. Any mishandling of the Summitville litigation can be \n     directly traced to the EPA and to the Justice Department. \n     Norton was certainly not responsible.\n       Finally, there is the matter of the state's self-audit law. \n     Colorado's law was passed after Summitville went out of \n     business. The self-audit procedure has nothing whatsoever to \n     do with Summitville. What happened under Norton's watch \n     regarding self-audits was quite simple:\n       The EPA, in effect, declared war on the states that had \n     such a statute, and North--as attorney general--defended the \n     state law against what was clearly a federal over-reach. \n     Self-audits were never intended to trump or otherwise replace \n     all other federal or state regulation. The truth is that the \n     EPA didn't want to see its power diminished and decided to \n     fight the use of self-audit laws even though there was clear \n     and convincing proof they produced environmental benefits \n     that otherwise would not have been achieved.\n       The New York Times seems incapable of keeping its clearly \n     liberal political positions out of its news columns. It has \n     achieved something of a temporary new journalistic low in \n     trying to tie Norton to a mythical ``death'' of a river. The \n     state of Colorado may have made a number of mistakes relative \n     to Summitville, but they pale to insignificance compared with \n     the mistakes made since by the EPA, its waste of millions in \n     tax dollars and the federal government's mishandling of years \n     of litigation. That's the truth, whether The New York Times \n     knows it or not.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Denver Post, which describes itself as a newspaper \nwith an active environmentalist agenda says that ``Norton should not be \nslammed for other politicians' mistakes,'' also defends Norton as one \nwho tried to fix Summitville under nearly impossible circumstances. I \nhope my colleagues read these editorials and help set the record \nstraight to end these vicious rumors.\n  With Gale as the Secretary of the Interior, we can begin the healing \nprocess in our rural communities, of regaining their trust. You see, \nwhen I was elected to the Senate, I made a commitment to all the \nresidents of Colorado, that I would visit their county every year for a \ntown meeting. I've held more than 250 town meetings, and whether I was \nin the rural communities of Craig and Lamar or the larger communities \nof Grand Junction and Pueblo, the message was the same--they were tired \nof constant threats and assaults on their way of life, they don't trust \ngovernment. And how can they? When in the waning days of the Clinton \nadministration, some 2000 pages a day of new rules and regulations were \nadded to the Federal Register. How can this be good for the environment \nand the economy?\n  Gale believes there is a role for local input in the public policy \nprocess. It's one thing to say that you believe in local involvement, \nbut to actually use their input and listen is different. I know that \nGale adheres to this philosophy. I also know that Gale recognizes the \nrole of Congress in protecting our environment. I am confident that she \nwill work with all of us, as elected officials and our constituents to \naddress our complex environmental issues.\n  With Gale Norton and President Bush, we will restore the premise that \nthe public and Congress have a role in the decision making process, \nespecially as it relates to federal land management. Local input and \ncongressional support ensures that sound public policy prevails. I know \nthe new administration will work to protect the environment and restore \nintegrity to the public process.\n  Now that you know who Gale Norton is and what she represents, I hope \nyou too will give her your strong support and vote yes for her \nconfirmation.\n  Again, I thank Senator Murkowski and Senator Ben Campbell for their \nefforts on Gale Norton's behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my two colleagues from Colorado for their \nstatements in support of the nominee. I ask unanimous consent that I \nmay be allowed to simply recognize a group of supporters who I believe \nshould be entered into the Record at this time.\n  We have letters of support for Gale Norton from Indian tribes: the \nNavajo Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, Oneida Indian Nation, United South \nand Eastern Tribes of Tennessee, Ute Mountain Tribe, the Southern Ute \nIndian Tribe, and United South and Eastern Tribes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print letters of support from those tribes \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            The Navajo Nation,\n\n                                Window Rock, AZ, January 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: On behalf of the Navajo Nation, I \n     convey our support for Ms. Gale Norton, nominee for Secretary \n     of the Department of the Interior. The Navajo Nation, in its \n     government-to-government relationships, works with the \n     Department of the Interior on myriad issues affecting the \n     Nation. Although there are times when we disagree with one \n     another we continue to work together for the benefit of the \n     Navajo People. We wish to continue the working relationship \n     with the new administration and we look forward to working \n     with Ms. Norton.\n       The Navajo Nation's past experience with Gale Norton \n     involved issues with the Southern Ute Tribe during her term \n     as Attorney General for the State of Colorado. During that \n     time Ms. Norton approached the tribes and asked how she could \n     help. She provided testimony to the House (Natural Resources) \n     Committee on the Animas-LaPlata project which benefitted the \n     tribes. Her willingness to support the tribes demonstrates \n     her knowledge of Indian nations and their position within the \n     federal system.\n\n[[Page S675]]\n\n       The Navajo Nation does have its concerns with regard to \n     Indian country policies and initiatives. We advise the new \n     administration to follow the basic goals and principles of \n     affirmation of the commitment to tribal sovereignty and self-\n     determination, protecting and sustaining treaty rights and \n     the federal trust responsibilities, and supporting \n     initiatives which promote sustainable economic development in \n     Indian country.\n       The Navajo Nation supports the nomination of Gale Norton \n     for Secretary of the Interior and we trust she will continue \n     to work with Indian country as she has done in the past. We \n     look forward to working with her in advancing Indian country \n     policies and Indian initiative for the Bush/Cheney \n     Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kelsey A.

Bush's Cabinet Nominee for United \n             States Department of the Interior, Gale Norton\n\n       Whereas:\n       1. Pursuant to 2 N.N.C. Sec. 821, the Intergovernmental \n     Relations Committee of the Navajo Nation Council is \n     established and continued as a Standing Committee of the \n     Navajo Nation Council; and\n       2. Pursuant to 2 N.N.C. Sec. 822(B), the Intergovernmental \n     Relations Committee of the Navajo Nation Council ensures the \n     presence and voice of the Navajo Nation; and\n       3. Pursuant to 2 N.N.C. Sec. 824(A), the Intergovernmental \n     Relations Committee of the Navajo Nation Council shall have \n     all the powers necessary and proper to carry out said \n     purposes; and\n       4. Pursuant to the Treaty of 1868, the Navajo Nation and \n     the United States Government have a government-to-government \n     relationship; and\n       5. The United States Department of the Interior is charged \n     with maintaining the government-to-government relationship \n     between the United States and the Navajo Nation; and\n       6. President-Elect George W. Bush has nominated Ms. Gale \n     Norton as the Secretary of the Interior, United States \n     Department of the Interior; and\n       7. The Navajo Nation previously interacted with Ms. Gale \n     Norton, former Colorado State Attorney General, on issues, \n     which benefited the Southern Ute Nation and the Navajo \n     Nation. Now therefore be it resolved, that:\n       1. The Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Navajo \n     Nation Council supports President-Elect Bush's Cabinet \n     nominee, Ms. Gale Norton, for Secretary of the Interior, \n     United States Department of the Interior.\n       2. The Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Navajo \n     Nation Council authorizes and directs Navajo Nation President \n     Kelsey A. Begaye to deliver a letter of support for Ms. Gale \n     Norton to President-Elect George W. Bush, Senator Jeff \n     Bingaman, Senator Pete Domenici, Senator John McCain, Senator \n     John Kyl, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Senator Ben Nighthorse \n     Campbell, Senator Orrin G.

Bush election victory, a primary \n     interest of the Nez Perce Tribe in the transition process is \n     the appointment of Gale Norton as the Secretary of the \n     Interior. As you know, this Secretary's agency, the Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs, has the primary charge of maintaining the \n     federal government's trust relationship with Indian Tribes.\n       President-Elect Bush, in a letter to the Nez Perce Tribe \n     dated August 18, 2000, stated ``I will strengthen Indian \n     self-determination by respecting tribal sovereignty, which \n     has improved the quality of life for many Native Americans. I \n     recognize and reaffirm the unique government-to-government \n     relationship between Native American tribes and the federal \n     government. I will strengthen Indian self-determination by \n     respecting tribal sovereignty, which has improved the quality \n     of life for many Native Americans. I believe the federal \n     government should allow tribes greater control over their \n     lives, land, and destiny.'' He also stated that he would like \n     to work with Indian tribes to chart a course which \n     ``recognizes the unique status of the tribes in our \n     constitutional framework...'' We urge you to ensure that when \n     making your decision to support the President-Elects' \n     appointee, Gale Norton, these principles underlie the \n     process.\n       In addition, the Republican Platform states that ``high \n     taxes and unreasonable regulations stifle new and expanded \n     businesses and thwart the creation of job opportunities and \n     prosperity [for Native Americans]. The federal government has \n     a special responsibility, ethical and legal, to make the \n     American dream accessible to Native Americans. We will \n     strengthen Native American self-determination by respecting \n     tribal sovereignty, encouraging economic development on \n     reservations. We uphold the unique government-to-government \n     relationship between the tribes and the United States and \n     honor our nation's trust obligations to them.''\n       We sincerely hope that all the President-Elect's \n     appointees, including Gale Norton, is not only aware of these \n     basic tenets of tribal sovereignty, but that such tenets are \n     upheld and enforced, rather than ignored or legislated out of \n     existence. In upholding these significant maxims, it is \n     essential that the Secretary of the Interior appointee \n     support the rights of Indian people. To Indian Tribes, this \n     position is extremely important so, again, we urge you to \n     take great care in the confirmation process of the appointed \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n       Thank you. Please give me a call if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Samuel N.

As Attorney General, Ms. Norton repeatedly \n     demonstrated respect for tribal sovereignty. For example, in \n     the wake of Colorado's settlement with the tobacco industry, \n     Ms. Norton worked to ensure that the tribal share of the \n     proceeds went directly to tribal governments rather than be \n     administered through state agencies.\n       As Secretary of Interior, Ms. Norton would preside over the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs and help set the agenda for issues \n     that are of vital importance to Native Americans. These \n     issues, which include health care, education, sovereignty, \n     economic development, gaming, and taxation, have been \n     increasingly the subject of debate in Congress. Consequently, \n     we believe that it is imperative that the next Secretary of \n     Interior respect the role of tribal sovereignty, affirm a \n     government-to-government relationship between the federal \n     government and Indian nations, and provide the tools the \n     tribes need to further the goal of tribal self-advancement \n     and economic self-sufficiency.\n       Because of Ms. Norton's background and record on issues \n     relating to Native Americans, we offer our endorsement of her \n     nomination to become the next Secretary of Interior.\n           Na ki' wa,\n                                                   Ray Halbritter,\n     Nation Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  United South and\n\n\n                                         Eastern Tribes, Inc.,\n\n                                  Nashville, TN, January 19, 2001.\n     Hon.

As Attorney General, \n     Gale Norton furthered that relationship through her \n     commitment to resolving issues in a fair and thoughtful way. \n     She is an open-minded leader who listens and then works \n     toward a resolution. We were able to agree to a gaming \n     compact with the State of Colorado during her tenure as \n     Attorney General. In addition, her strong and adamant support \n     of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act was a \n     major factor in what ultimately became successful legislation \n     to modify the Animas-La Plata Project and still meet the \n     obligation to the Ute people of Colorado.\n       Ms. Norton is a very capable individual whose public \n     service is not based on a desire for accolade or credit, but \n     on a commitment to resolve issues, no matter how \n     controversial.\n       We proudly support her nomination and enthusiastically \n     encourage the Senate to approve her nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Ernest House,\n\n                                 Chairman, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe.\n\n                                                 Vida Peabody,\n\n                                         Acting Chairman, Southern\n                                                 Ute Indian Tribe.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \n         Senate Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Murkowski: On behalf of the Fraternal Order \n     of Police, United States Park Police Labor Committee, we are \n     writing to strongly endorse President-elect Bush's nomination \n     of Gale A. Norton for the office of Secretary of the \n     Interior. We feel Ms. Norton is extremely well qualified for \n     this position and possesses the knowledge, experience, and \n     leadership necessary to be a highly successful Secretary. We \n     urge the Committee to favorably report her nomination to the \n     full Senate as quickly as possible.\n       The United States Park Police Labor Committee is deeply \n     concerned with the current state of law enforcement within \n     the Department of the Interior. For this reason, we are \n     adding our voices to the many others who are supporting the \n     nomination of Mr. Norton. Our Committee does not customarily \n     write endorsements, but we feel that the importance of \n     confirming Ms. Norton justifies our participation.\n       During the past two years, three separate studies have been \n     conducted to examine law enforcement operations in the \n     Department. Two of these studies were conducted by outside \n     experts, namely Booz-Allen Hamilton and the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police, while a third was an \n     Internal Departmental review mandated by the Senate. All \n     three studies concluded that the effectiveness of law \n     enforcement activities by the U.S. Park Police and the Law \n     Enforcement Rangers has been consistently declining. While \n     both organizations continue to successfully fulfill their \n     mission of protecting our parks and their visitors, a lack of \n     resources and emphasis on law enforcement in the Department \n     threatens our future ability to keep public lands safe. \n     Strong leadership and critical reforms are needed now.\n       From a law enforcement perspective, Ms. Norton is an \n     outstanding candidate for Secretary. Her background in law \n     enforcement as Attorney General of Colorado, coupled with her \n     previous service within the Department, gives her a unique \n     ability to understand and address the problems faced by its \n     law enforcement agencies. Throughout her career in public \n     service, she has consistently shown strong support for law \n     enforcement officers. Furthermore, she has repeatedly proven \n     her ability to work with diverse individuals and groups to \n     forge consensus and accomplish important tasks. We are \n     confident that Ms. Norton will exert this same vigorous \n     leadership as Secretary of the Interior to enact the reforms \n     necessary to strengthen agency law enforcement efforts and \n     ensure the safety of the visitors to our parks and monuments.\n       Once again, we strongly urge the Committee to favorably \n     report her nomination to the full Senate at the earliest \n     possible opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Peter J. Ward,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                           Guam, January 18, 2001.\n     Chairman Jeff Bingaman,\n     Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in support of the \n     nomination of the Honorable Gale Norton as Secretary of the \n     Interior. The people of Guam look forward to Ms. Norton's \n     leadership of the executive department that has direct \n     responsibility for insular affairs. I am confident that as \n     Secretary of the Interior, Ms. Norton will continue progress \n     on the issues of great importance to Guam and that she will \n     be instrumental in resolving the land issues that have been \n     at the forefront of the Guam-United States relationship in \n     the past few years.\n       Ms. Norton has substantial experience in the Department of \n     the Interior, having previously served in the Solicitor's \n     Office. We believe that she has the necessary familiarity \n     with territorial issues to be an effective Secretary and that \n     she brings a broad understanding of the unique federal land \n     issues on Guam to her office.\n       Guam has had a contentious relationship with the Department \n     of the Interior in large measure due to the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service's acquisition of 370 acres of excess military lands \n     in 1993 for a wildlife refuge. The 370 acres at Ritidian have \n     become the focal point for Guam's dissatisfaction with \n     federal land policy on our island. Due to the historical \n     context of the military's acquisition of over one-third of \n     Guam's lands after World War II for national security \n     purposes, the Interior action has been harmful to the good \n     relationship between the people of Guam and the United \n     States. We hold the federal government to its commitment that \n     military lands no longer needed for defense purposes should \n     be returned to the people of Guam.\n       In an effort to resolve these issues, I have been engaged \n     in discussions for the past year with the previous Secretary \n     and his staff on possible solutions that would enhance the \n     level of environmental protection on Guam while addressing \n     the issue of Interior's acquisition of Ritidian. I was \n     willing to make the necessary compromises that would restore \n     the good relationship between the U.S. and Guam and that \n     would meet the needs of the Interior Department and the \n     Government of Guam. Regretfully, the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service was not.\n       We believe that Ms. Norton will restore a balance to \n     federal land policy on Guam that has been missing since 1993. \n     There is now an imbalance where the bureaucrats at the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service make policy without adequate regard for \n     local concerns. Environmental policy should not be a zero sum \n     game where the Fish and Wildlife Service wins and the people \n     of Guam lose. Environmental policy should be collaborative \n     process with respect for, and accommodation of, local needs. \n     On Guam, the respect we seek would recognize the patriotism \n     of the people of Guam and our support for the national \n     security interest, even when the national interest requires \n     the use of one-third of our island for military bases. And \n     the accommodation we seek would balance environmental policy \n     with the federal commitment to return excess military lands \n     to our people. We believe that Ms. Norton appreciates our \n     history and our culture, and that she will be fair in dealing \n     with us on these land issues.\n       We are also encouraged by Ms. Norton's commitment to the \n     devolution of federal power where local governments are more \n     appropriate to formulating public policy in response to local \n     needs. This is a bedrock principle of self-government that \n     Guam supports and encourages. We are confident that Ms. \n     Norton will appoint policy makers and senior staff at the \n     Department of the Interior that will reflect this view. Any \n     increase in local self-governance in the territories is \n     welcome and long overdue. We find Ms. Norton's views on \n     limiting the role of the federal government in our lives both \n     refreshing and promising for the resolution of the Guam's \n     political status issues.\n       Thank you for considering my support of Ms. Gale Norton as \n     Secretary of the Interior. I hope that the Senate Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources votes to recommend Ms. Norton \n     to the full Senate and that she is confirmed quickly. We look \n     forward to her new leadership and her initiatives for the \n     territories.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Carl T.C.

I am \n     writing, on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, to express our support for her \n     confirmation as Secretary of the Interior.\n       The Department of the Interior, in particular its Office of \n     Insular Affairs, plays a central role in the relationship of \n     the Commonwealth with the United States Federal Government. \n     We were pleased by the announcement of her nomination to this \n     position. We believe that we could establish a positive and \n     fruitful working relationship with Secretary Designate Norton \n     should she be confirmed and wish her the best of luck.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Pedro P.

These insights are based on our work with Gale \n     during her eight years as Attorney General for the State of \n     Colorado. While Gale provided numerous examples of her \n     leadership and ability as Colorado's Attorney General, there \n     are a few specific instances that truly demonstrate her skill \n     and experience.\n       First, in the early 1990's, Gale worked with Attorneys \n     General and Governors in an effort to force the United States \n     Department of Energy to comply with federal environmental \n     laws as its facilities around the nation. Gale helped lead \n     the fight to ensure that Energy would be responsive to the \n     states, comply with the law, and refocus on cleaning up Rocky \n     Flats in Colorado and other sites around the nation.\n       Gale served as the Chair of the Energy and Environment \n     Committee for the National Association of Attorneys General \n     from 1992 to 1994. As Chair of the Committee, Gale worked \n     with Attorneys General from both political parties to achieve \n     results for all states. Gale had the instinctive ability to \n     work for bipartisan solutions and she helped create consensus \n     on a number of sensitive issues.\n       Finally, Gale's work on the tobacco settlement was \n     significant. Gale was selected by her colleagues to be a \n     member of the settlement negotiating team. Gale's selection \n     was based on the fact that she is very bright, hard working, \n     and has extremely high ethical standards and integrity. She \n     was a valuable member of the team throughout the prolonged \n     and complicated negotiations.\n       We know that you are receiving extensive comments about \n     Gale's qualifications. We want to provide you with our views, \n     based on our years of experience working with Gale on \n     complex, sensitive issues. We know that Gale will do her best \n     to build coalitions and develop solutions to hard problems in \n     a way that creates broad-based support. It is our hope that \n     this information will be helpful as you consider Gale \n     Norton's nomination for Secretary of the Interior.\n         Alan G.

I thank all of my colleagues who have spoken on behalf \nof the nominee. The action out of the committee on a vote of 18-2 is \ncertainly, in my opinion, a mandate for approval by this entire body. I \nthink she will represent our new President in a manner that attempts to \nbalance the delicate issue of concern over the environment and the \necology.\n  Since there has been a lot of comment about ANWR during this entire \nprocess and many pictures, for my colleagues, I show a picture of ANWR \nas it exists for about 9 months of the year. This is what it looks \nlike.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I come before you today to offer my views \non the nomination of Ms. Gale Norton to be Secretary of the Department \nof the Interior. I believe in some basic principles relative to \nPresidential nominees for the President's Cabinet. I believe they are \nreviewed for purposes of advise and consent of the Senate with the \npresumption that the President has a right to choose his or her closest \nadvisers.\n  I believe our duty as Senators in discharging that constitutional \nresponsibility of advise and consent is to assure those advisers are \ncapable of and committed to doing the jobs for which they have been \nnominated.\n  In the past, Ms. Norton has made statements that raise questions in \nmy mind, and in many others, about her appropriateness for the position \nof Secretary of the Interior. Ms. Norton's explanations of those \nstatements suggested that her views have evolved over time.\n  Having listened to her responses and evaluated her truthfulness, I \ntake her at her word and trust her sincerity. My own life experience \ntells me that it is possible--in fact, it is highly desirable--for \nindividuals to evolve in their thinking over their adult years. If a \nperson at 55 has the same views they had at 25, that would raise \nserious questions as to whether this was an individual who was \nsufficiently affected by life to be an appropriate holder of a position \nof major public trust.\n  I asked Ms. Norton a series of questions during the course of the \nhearings before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I asked Ms. \nNorton if she would support the current moratorium that exists on \noffshore oil and gas leases, particularly those in California and my \nhome State of Florida. She answered yes. She echoed President Bush's \nsupport for those moratoriums. I take Ms. Norton at her word.\n  I asked Ms. Norton if she would work with our State and other States \nto assure that the wishes of the State, with regard to existing leases, \nare followed. Ms. Norton answered yes, and I take her at her word.\n  I asked Ms. Norton if she would enter into discussions toward the \nobjective of developing a plan for the buyback of Outer Continental \nShelf leases in those States which had expressed opposition to their \ndevelopment for oil and gas purposes. This is much in line with the \nplan which is currently in effect in Florida for buyback of leases in \nthe area of the Florida Keys that was originally developed by President \nGeorge Bush. Ms. Norton answered yes, and I look forward to the \nopportunity to commence that process.\n  I spoke to Ms. Norton in my office regarding the importance of the \nDepartment of the Interior in the restoration of America's Everglades. \nI consider the passage of that legislation last year to have been one \nof the signal events of that Congress and one of the most important \nenvironmental advances in recent years.\n  As a steward of four national park units and 16 national wildlife \nrefuges, the Secretary of the Interior has a distinct role in assuring \nthat the natural systems are protected in America's Everglades, \nparticularly protected as we move forward with their restoration.\n  She clearly understood the importance of the Department of the \nInterior's role in Everglades restoration, and I take her at her word.\n  I asked Ms. Norton what her plans were for funding of the Land and \nWater\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\nConservation Fund. Ms. Norton answered that in accordance with \nPresident Bush's campaign position, she supported full funding of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, both those funds that flow to Federal \nagencies and those that go to State and local communities. I take Ms. \nNorton at her word.\n\n  Ms. Norton went further and recognized the important \ninterrelationship between a balanced park and recreation policy, with \nthe Federal Government having the primary responsibility for the \nprotection of natural resources and with State and local governments \nhaving the responsibility for providing appropriate recreational \nactivities for our people.\n  I asked Ms. Norton how she would balance the Secretary's \nresponsibility to protect public lands with her desire to partner with \nprivate landholders and local governments in executing those \nresponsibilities. Ms. Norton answered that these partnerships are not a \nsubstitute for enforcement actions, and that as Secretary of the \nInterior, she would remain committed to enforcing the law. And I take \nher at her word.\n  I could continue this list of questions and answers for some time. \nHowever, my conclusion is that Ms. Norton demonstrated during the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee hearings that she will be open \nminded and will take the expertise of State and local governments on \nthe issues that come before her very seriously.\n  I was particularly pleased she committed to respecting the moratoria \non new leases off the coast of Florida and California; that she intends \nto look to the future relative to the buyback of those leases which are \ncurrently outstanding, and that she intends to uphold the Department of \nthe Interior's responsibilities as a caretaker of public lands involved \nin America's Everglades restoration.\n  With these assurances, I offer my support for the nomination of Ms. \nGale Norton to be Secretary of the Interior, and I look forward to \nworking with her, the Department of the Interior, and State and local \nofficials in my State and elsewhere to build upon the commitments that \nshe made during her confirmation hearings.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the pending \nnomination of Ms. Gale Norton to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nthe Interior. I suspect that Ms. Norton's nomination will be approved \nby the Senate later today, without my support, and I want to share with \nmy colleagues and the people of West Virginia why I have decided to \noppose this nomination.\n  First and foremost, I should say that I do not oppose this or any \nother presidential nomination lightly or on personal or ideological \ngrounds. President Bush should have a Cabinet of people whom he trusts \nand who will govern as he wishes. In the vast majority of cases, I have \nand will lend my firm support to the President's nominees, after \nconsidering their qualifications and determining that they will \neffectively represent our nation and share my commitment to tackling \nthe challenges facing West Virginia.\n  I have no litmus test for nominees, and I do not expect or insist \nthat they agree with me on how best to approach our challenges or solve \nour problems. But I do take seriously my duty under the Constitution to \napprove or disapprove presidential nominees. In these times of national \ndivision and discontent without government on so many issues, what I \nlook for in a nominee is an overriding ability to follow through on the \nPresident's promise to bring our nation together, and a commitment to \nthe values that West Virginians hold dear.\n  Let there be no doubt that Ms. Norton is a capable and experienced \nperson whose willingness to serve her country is to be commended. But I \ndo not believe that her life's work reflects the balance and \ninclusiveness we need to chart this new course, and I cannot abide by \nher fight against laws that I and my fellow West Virginians support and \nrespect.\n  One prominent example is Ms. Norton's prior work to dismantle the \nSurface Mining and Reclamation Control Act, SMRCA.\n  SMRCA is a law that strikes a balance between critical economic and \nindustrial development and adequate environmental protections. It is \nintended to ensure that after mining is complete, reclamation will \nhappen and water quality will be protected. And it provides an \nimportant level playing field for states and companies that are \ncommitted to this kind of balance--with federal standards that prevent \nany competitive disadvantage for sound mine reclamation.\n  As a constitutional lawyer for the Mountain States Legal Foundation \nin 1980, Ms. Norton tried to convince the courts that SMRCA is \nunconstitutional, on grounds that it usurped state government in a way \nthat ``threaten[ed] to destroy the structure of government in America. \n. . .'' First as Governor and then as Senator for a coal state, I have \ndisagreed with Ms. Norton's assessment. I testified then in support of \nsurface mining legislation that would ``equalize reclamation standards \namong the states and alleviate West Virginia's distinct competitive \ndisadvantage in the marketplace.''\n  I remain proud of my work on the surface Mining Act and its initial \nimplementation during my years as a Governor. I know that the law is \nnot perfect, and that we need always to be vigilant about striking the \nintended balance. Yet also believe Ms. Norton's position on this law is \nindicative of her determination to limit or eliminate the federal role \nin this area--even when that role can help balance the needs of \ncritical industries with the goal of preserving our environment and \nprotecting the quality of our water and air.\n  Some will say that Ms. Norton's nomination should be approved because \nshe has promised to uphold the law and has recently distanced herself \nfrom some of her more divisive past positions. I should be clear that I \ndo not doubt Ms. Norton would respect the decisions of the courts, nor \nthat she would uphold the law as it is written. But I also do not \nbelieve that one can so easily change course after a career dedicated \nto strong and passionate advocacy for limited environmental \npreservation and protection.\n  As Interior Secretary, Ms. Norton would have enormous discretion in \nimplementing and enforcing federal law and policies. She would set \npriorities or the Department's resources and would develop and promote \npolicy positions large and small. Ms. Norton's career and experience \nreflect neither balance nor moderation, and I simply do not think she \ncan be expected to change her approach so dramatically at this point.\n  In addition, Ms. Norton's nomination has been questioned by leading \npublic health organizations because of her policies and actions \nregarding lead paint and its link to public health, particularly the \nhealth of our children. I have a long history in promoting children's \nhealth, and I feel obligated to raise these matters as part of my duty \nto ``advise and consent'' on the president's nominees.\n  Let me close by saying that my opposition to Mr. Norton's nomination \nis intended primarily to register my grave concern. I stand ready and \nwilling to work with her as the new Interior Secretary and hope we can \nfind common ground in striking a balance on environmental policies and \nprograms.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of Gale \nNorton as Interior Secretary because, based on her record, I do not \nhave confidence that she will serve as an environmentally-sensitive \nsteward of the nation's public lands. There is too much at stake to \ntake a chance on someone who, throughout her career, has consistently \nchosen development over environmental protection. Her responses to \nquestions at her confirmation hearing failed to relieve my concerns \nabout her record of weak environmental enforcement as Colorado attorney \ngeneral.\n  For instance, Ms. Norton wrote that ``we might even go so far as to \nrecognize a homesteading right to pollute or to make noise in an \narea.'' Although she attempted to explain that statement by stating \nthat she was referring to emissions trading, I see no indication in the \narticle itself that she was referring to emissions trading. Rather it \nseems to be an extreme position on takings law.\n  As attorney general, Ms. Norton pursued government polluters while \nrarely\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\ntaking on corporate polluters. According to the Denver Post, Ms. Norton \n``sat out fights when a corporate power plant broke air pollution laws \n19,000 times, a refinery leaked toxins into a creek and a logging mill \nconducted illegal midnight burns.''\n  Further, when I asked Ms. Norton about her position on drilling for \noil and natural gas in the Great Lakes, she responded that she had no \nposition. This caused me concern because her philosophy could play a \ncentral role in decision- making on Great Lakes protections at the \nDepartment of Interior.\n  We have made substantial progress the past several years in improving \nthe quality of the Great Lakes and its habitat. I hope that Ms. Norton \nproves my concerns unfounded and will work hard the next four years to \nprotect our valuable natural resources and further the environmental \nprogress that we have worked so hard to achieve.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nconfirmation of Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior. After \nthorough consideration of her record and her recent testimony before \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have reluctantly \nconcluded that Ms. Norton is not the right person to serve as the chief \nsteward of our nation's public lands.\n  Ms. Norton stated at her confirmation hearings earlier this month \nthat she would feel ``very comfortable'' enforcing federal \nenvironmental laws as they are written. Unfortunately, her record of \ntwo decades in private and public life strongly suggests that she will \ndo so with little enthusiasm, and, where the law gives her discretion--\nwhich it often does--she will favor resource extraction over resource \nprotection.\n  Ms. Norton's employment history and legal writings reflect a \nconsistent record of supporting industry and developers over wildlife \nand public lands protection, even going so far as to argue to the U.S. \nSupreme Court that the Endangered Species Act and the Surface Mining \nand Reclamation Act--both of which she would administer if confirmed--\nare unconstitutional. She has repeatedly taken the position that the \nfederal government lacks the constitutional power to address a wide \nrange of environmental harms, a view that is diametrically opposed to a \nlong line of Supreme Court rulings and is hard to reconcile with the \nSecretary of the Interior's role in managing our precious natural \nresources.\n  President Bush and Ms. Norton support opening the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration. I oppose drilling in the \nANWR, and I believe a bipartisan majority in the Senate feels the same \nway, but let me emphasize that my opposition to this nomination is not \nabout a policy disagreement over ANWR. It is about whether we will have \nan Interior Secretary who will provide aggressive oversight of \nindustries that have been granted the privilege to seek profits on \nfederal land--whether in the ANWR (should Congress ever approve such \nactivity) or in the hundreds of other magnificent places owned by the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  The President committed during his campaign to come to Washington to \nunite the nation and to work with Congress to protect America's \nenvironment. That makes his choice of Ms. Norton to head the Interior \nDepartment all the more disappointing. With so many outstanding public \nservants across this country to choose from, including both Republicans \nand Democrats with substantial experience managing public lands and a \nbalanced view on the best use of those lands, it is regrettable that \nPresident Bush chose someone who has spent so much of her professional \nlife working against the very mission of the Department she would \noversee and, more importantly, the laws she would enforce.\n  I must, therefore, cast my vote against the confirmation of Ms. \nNorton. I urge my colleagues to do the same, and I hope that if she is \nconfirmed Ms. Norton will set aside her long-held views and work with \nCongress to protect our public lands for generations to come.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Gale \nNorton to be the Secretary of the Department of Interior.\n  The Department of the Interior is charged with the protection of more \nthan 500 million acres of public land that comprise an important part \nof our natural and cultural heritage. The Secretary of the Interior is \nthe steward of this land and is responsible for protecting it for the \ngenerations that follow.\n  Unfortunately, based on her record, I am concerned that Gale Norton \nis the wrong person to handle this critically important responsibility. \nFrom all indications, she has a strong tendency to favor the interests \nof industry over the needs of the environment. That is not my preferred \napproach, nor does it represent the values of the people in New Jersey \nwho I represent.\n  When Ms. Norton served as a State Attorney General, for example, she \nwas very reluctant to prosecute industries that polluted Colorado's \nrivers and air. Perhaps the most disturbing example of this involved \nthe Summitville Consolidated Mining Corporation, which spilled cyanide \nand acidic water into a 17-mile stretch of the Alamosa River, killing \nevery living organism that was there. Notwithstanding this egregious \nconduct, Ms. Norton refused to prosecute. It took federal intervention \nto prosecute the polluters. I find this very troublesome.\n  In many other ways, Gale Norton has expressed views towards \nenvironmental protection that strongly conflict with my own. She has \ntaken the states' rights argument to the extreme--arguing that the \nSurface Mining Act, an invaluable tool to protect the environment from \nproblems associated with coal mining, was unconstitutional. She has \nsupported restrictions to the Endangered Species Act that would have \ngutted the law. She has shown a readiness to accept an extremist view \non what constitutes a taking under the Constitution, something that \ncould jeopardize necessary environmental protections. She also has \nstrongly supported drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, something I cannot support.\n  Ms. Norton also has argued against the ``polluter pays'' principle \ncontained within the Superfund law. That is very troubling to me. \nComing from a state that has the most Superfund sites in the country, I \nbelieve strongly that those who pollute the land should pay to restore \nit.\n  I recognize that during her confirmation hearings Ms. Norton seemed \nto moderate her approach, and promised to enforce laws such as the \nEndangered Species Act and the Surface Mining Act. Yet one statement \nbefore a congressional committee does not negate a lifetime opposition. \nFor a position as important as this, we need someone whose commitment \nto the environment is clear and long-standing.\n  For all these reasons, regretfully, I must oppose the nomination of \nGale Norton to be the Secretary of the Interior. However, I recognize \nthat she probably will win confirmation. I only hope that my concerns \nare proven wrong.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to cast my vote against \nGale Norton for Secretary of the Interior. I do this with some \nreluctance, as I believe that the Senate owes the President significant \ndeference in its review of his Cabinet nominees. The Senate's review, \nhowever, must be substantive and searching, and cannot amount to \nautomatic approval of every nominee.\n  Over the years of my service here, I have given great thought to the \nextent of the Senate's advise and consent power. In all cases, I \nbelieve that our review must focus on a candidate's experience, \njudgment, and ethics. However, I also believe that a Senator may \nconsider whether the nominee holds fundamental and potentially \nirreconcilable policy differences with the department she will head \nwhich put in doubt the nominee's capacity to credibly carry out the \nresponsibilities of the department.\n  The Interior Secretary plays a critical role in determining our \nnational natural resource policy, which will affect our nation for \ncenturies to come. I have concluded that Ms. Norton's record reflects a \nphilosophy that is so contrary to the mission of the Department of \nInterior that I have serious doubts about the manner in which she would \nadminister the Department.\n  The Secretary of the Interior enjoys wide discretion in how to best \ncarry out the Department's mission of preserving, ``the Nation's public \nlands and natural resources for use and enjoyment both now and in the \nfuture.'' I\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\nhave reviewed Ms. Norton's past writings, speeches and professional \nactivities, and they reveal an ideological viewpoint at real variance \nwith the legal requirements and responsibilities that she would have as \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  Many of my colleagues have stated that they were comforted by Ms. \nNorton's testimony in her confirmation hearing in which she seemed to \nback away from her more controversial positions and they therefore have \ndecided to vote in favor of her nomination. I respect their decisions \nbut I remain with too many doubts. Therefore, I will reluctantly and \nrespectfully vote no.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the confirmation \nof Gale Norton to be Secretary of the Interior.\n  I have three criteria I use to evaluate nominees: (1) competence; (2) \nintegrity, and (3) commitment to protecting the mission of the \ndepartment he or she seeks to lead.\n  I do not question Ms. Norton's competence or integrity. But I am \nconcerned that Ms. Norton's views and her record cast serious doubt on \nwhether she is suitable to act as our chief land conservation \nofficial--safeguarding our Nation's parks, wilderness, and wildlife \nrefuge areas.\n  The Interior Department's mission is ``to encourage and provide for \nthe appropriate management, preservation, and operation of the Nation's \npublic lands and natural resources for use and enjoyment both now and \nin the future.'' The Department of Interior is charged with ensuring \nthat we preserve and protect our Nation's extraordinary public lands \nand natural resources. To do this, the Interior Secretary must \nimplement critical parts of the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, \nSuperfund, Endangered Species Act and other laws that protect our \nnation's natural heritage.\n  I am concerned about Ms. Norton's commitment to fulfilling this \nmission. She has fought against these very laws and regulations her \nentire career. We need an Interior Secretary who can balance economic \ninterests with environmental protection. Yet Ms. Norton has shown an \nunfortunate bias toward those who profit from public lands.\n  For example, as the Attorney General of Colorado, Ms. Norton refused \nto vigorously enforce environmental compliance against corporate \npolluters. She didn't seek criminal penalties against a mining company \nthat allowed cyanide to pollute a river or against a power plant that \nbroke air pollution laws thousands of times. She supported a law to \ngrant immunity to industrial polluters and weaken the government's \nability to enforce environmental regulations. She has also sided with \ncompanies that are being sued for exposing children to lead paint. This \nrecord of siding with corporate polluters casts doubt on her commitment \nto pursuing polluters and holding them accountable.\n  In addition, Ms. Norton has sought to overturn the Endangered Species \nAct. This law is essential to maintaining our nation's fragile, diverse \necosystems. Yet Ms. Norton signed onto an amicus brief in a case before \nthe Supreme Court in which the state of Arizona sought to weaken the \nEndangered Species Act. She argued that the Endangered Species Act was \nunconstitutional in the requirements it placed on landowners. How can \nshe enforce laws that she claims are unconstitutional?\n  Finally, Ms. Norton strongly supports opening the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Drilling at ANWR would threaten this \nfragile and unique ecosystem. It is a short-term solution to the long-\nterm problem of energy dependency. This policy could result in \nirreparable damage to one of our Nation's natural treasures.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Norton's record raises serious concerns about her \nappropriateness to serve as our highest ranking land conservation \nofficial. Her record indicates that her views are fundamentally \nincompatible with the mission of the Department she seeks to lead. I am \ndeeply concerned that her confirmation may lead to a significant \nretreat from the gains made by former Secretary Babbitt.\n  Although I hope her actions prove me wrong, I must regretfully oppose \nGale Norton's confirmation.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns \nregarding the nomination of Gale Norton as President Bush's Secretary \nof the Interior. I will vote against her confirmation today. I will do \nso with some reluctance because I believe that the President enjoys the \nprivilege of selecting the people he wishes to join his administration. \nHowever, after much thought and reflection, I am afraid that the views \nthat Gale Norton and I hold on a number of important environmental \nissues are irreconcilable.\n  Let me begin by saying that I do not believe Gale Norton is a bad \nperson. However, her documented record as Attorney General of Colorado \nand positions she has taken for twenty years in opposition to a number \nof important federal environmental laws, such as the Endangered Species \nAct, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, and Superfund are of concern.\n  Gale Norton supports, as does President Bush, opening the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. While the President is \ncertainly entitled to nominate those who share his views, I am unable \nto support a nominee who would advocate for the opening of this \npristine wilderness to oil drilling.\n  I am also concerned that Gale Norton will bring what I perceive as a \nsolely Western orientation to resource management issues to the \nInterior Department. The Secretary of the Interior must represent all \nregions of our Nation with equal vigor. This means understanding the \nunique issues facing the Northeast. Our open spaces are being churned \nup by development at an alarming rate. New Jersey is losing its open \nspace faster than any other State in the Union. Federal funding for the \nacquisition of this open space is not viewed as a ``land grab'' in New \nJersey, it is a necessity. However, I am not convinced that these \nconcerns will be addressed. Open space protection is perhaps the most \nimportant issue facing a state like New Jersey, and I am concerned that \nthe same passivity in enforcing environmental laws and protecting \nnatural resources in Colorado will occur in New Jersey.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, ``The throwing out of balance of the \nresources of nature throws out of balance also the lives of men.'' I \nstrongly believe that this balance is critical to the success of the \nnext Secretary of the Interior. I have attempted to find this balance \nin President Bush's nominee, but have not. I am concerned that her \nrecord does not reflect this balance that is so necessary. I see no \nreal difference between her positions from 20 years ago, 10 years ago, \nand today. Therefore, I reluctantly oppose this nomination, not this \nperson.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in expressing my concern over the \nnomination of Gale Norton to be Secretary of the Interior.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is charged with being the caretaker of \nthe Nation's public lands and public's waters, which are held in trust \nby the government for the benefit of the public.\n  Our Nation's public lands and public waters contain vast riches of \nminerals, oil, gas, timber, and grazing areas. The Secretary of the \nInterior has the responsibility of ensuring that these private uses of \nthe public lands are compatible with the public's right to enjoy these \nlands as a priceless part of the Nation's environmental heritage.\n  I am concerned that Gale Norton's record has too often been hostile \nto many of our most fundamental environmental protection laws. The \nviews she has often expressed in opposition to needed federal \nenvironmental regulation raises serious doubts about her commitment to \nthe environment. Her partial, vague, and evasive answers to questions \nat the committee hearing were in sharp contrast to her past harsh \ncriticisms of the important federal role in the protection of the \nNation's natural resources.\n  The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act--which calls for the government to `` . . . \nfulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the \nenvironment for succeeding generations''--are long settled and \nrespected bodies of law. The American people are proud of the progress \nthat we have made in recent years on the environment. The talented and \ncommitted officials in the Department of Interior deserve a great deal \nof credit for that achievement, and they and the American people \ndeserve a Secretary of the Interior who shares that commitment.\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\n  Superfund and the Surface Mining Act have also been largely \nsuccessful environmental laws. But it was environmental brinkmanship \nthat made those laws necessary.\n  Energy crises in the 1970's and again during the Gulf war were not \nsolved by putting our priceless environmental heritage at risk, and \nthey cannot be solved by such a strategy today.\n  The position of Secretary of the Interior requires a vigilant leader \nwho can resist the urge to exploit our natural resources at the expense \nof the environment.\n  The next Secretary will also face numerous challenges in the \nmanagement and development of our National Parks. As recreation becomes \nmore and more popular, our parks and wildlife refuges will continue to \nbe under pressure, and sound management policies will be needed to \nprotect them.\n  These, and many other environmental concerns, are widely shared by \nthe vast majority of the American people, and the country needs a \nSecretary of Interior who shares that commitment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today as the Senate begins the \nconsideration of the nomination of Gale Norton to be Secretary of the \nInterior, we confront an enormous responsibility.\n  The individual charged with this responsibility will set the \ndirection for our national policies for our natural resources. This \nperson will have the power to decide whether to nurture and conserve, \nor to develop and destroy our Nation's great resources. As a member of \nthis body, I have committed myself to a career of environmental \nstewardship. I have tried to cast votes and offer legislation that \nfully reflects the importance and lasting legacy of America's natural \nresource management decisions. I have done so because of the role of my \nown home state in this matter. America's conservation history is \nWisconsin's conservation history. From John Muir's battles with Teddy \nRoosevelt over the Hetch Hetchy Dam, to Sigurd Olson's efforts to \ncreate the National Wilderness Preservation System, to former Senator \nGaylord Nelson's efforts to create the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, \nto Aldo Leopold's struggles to move and mold the Forest Service, \nWisconsin's role in conservation has been rich. I also have another \ntradition to defend and uphold. I have committed myself, to a \nconstructive role in the Senate's duty to provide advice and consent \nwith respect to the President's nominees for cabinet positions.\n  As the Secretary of the Interior, Ms. Norton will be charged with \nunique and historic responsibilities, which will be as important as \nthey are far reaching. In varying ways, all Americans will be affected \nby her decisions. As the Nation's principal conservation agency, the \nDepartment of the Interior has responsibility for most of our \nnationally owned public lands and resources. During the nominations \nprocess, I have been disturbed to learn of the fears that Ms. Norton \nwill not live up to this responsibility for stewardship of all our \nnatural resources. I have been concerned that Ms. Norton's background \nmight cloud her judgement and objectivity on a number of important \nissues and place her at odds with members of the conservation community \nand with this Senator. While I am concerned with Ms. Norton's professed \nunfamiliarity with many of the laws which I regard as critical for the \npromotion of balanced conservation policy, I am somewhat heartened by \nMs. Norton's responses to questions by members of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee with regard to her responsibility to \nenforce federal environmental law. I am encouraged by this statement \nfor two reasons: first, it is an acknowlegement that she is obliged to \nwork hard to enforce the letter of the law; second, it is an admission \nthat there is indeed an interest on the part of all Americans in \npreserving our environmental heritage.\n  I will take Ms. Norton at her word - that she will devote her time \nand energy to the proper enforcement of the Interior Department \npolicies, rather than circumvent or repeal laws which preserve our \ndwindling resources, that she will attempt to address the pollution of \npublic lands which ruins our enjoyment of them and makes our air unfit \nto breathe and our water unsafe to drink, and that she will protect our \nland and water resources. For this reason, I will vote for her today.\n  However, in doing so, I fully recognize that my responsibility \ninvolves nothing less than overseeing the institution with stewardship \nof our public lands and national resource wealth. The Senate does not, \nby confirming Ms. Norton, place the responsibility for the protection \nof public lands and resources in the hands of a single individual. I do \nnot believe that the American people are ready to ignore the voices of \nthe environmental community who remind us how fragile and vulnerable \nour resources can be. That is not the message of November 4, 2000. I am \nhopeful that these voices will be heard by Ms. Norton. I am placing my \ntrust in her that she will embrace her duty to take into account the \nfuture and forseeable consequences of her actions, and that she will be \nguided by the knowledge that this Senator will raise those consequences \nat all appropriate opportunities.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Gale \nNorton as Secretary of Interior, and encourage my colleagues in the \nUnited States Senate to vote to approve her nomination as the first \nwoman to ever hold this position as the premier land manager within the \nUnited States Government.\n  I don't know how I can impress upon this Senate the great impact that \nthe Secretary of Interior can have on my home state of Wyoming, and on \nthe rest of the Western United States. Between the National Park \nService, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, the \nDepartment of Interior is the single largest land owner within the \nState of Wyoming. This means that most of my state's rich natural \nresources and energy opportunities are dependent on the Interior to be \nable to find and develop those resources. I know from experience that \nwith cooperation and open communication this process can be completed \nin a manner that not only benefits our nation's energy and mineral \nneeds, but does so in a way that preserves the rich natural beauty and \nwildlife that calls Wyoming home.\n  In order to do this, however, both the Federal Government and local \ncommunities must be able to sit down together and talk through any \npotential conflicts and must do so in a way that lays the groundwork \nfor the future. In her years as Attorney General for the State of \nColorado, Ms. Norton was able to demonstrate the invaluable ability to \ntalk to people, on all sides of the issues, to get to the heart of the \nmatter, and to effect real change in the only place that really matters \nwhen it comes to environmental and community protection--directly on \nthe ground.\n  As a Wyoming State legislator and member of the Wyoming State Senate, \nI watched Ms. Norton as she pioneered the development of Colorado's \nenvironmental self audit program. I was very interested in seeing what \nobstacles she faced and what hurdles she had to overcome in creating \nthis incredible environmental protection opportunity, mainly because I \nwanted the same thing for my state. You see, I knew that if I could \nprovide the people of Wyoming the same opportunity that Ms. Norton was \ngiving the people of Colorado--the opportunity to find environmental \nhazards for themselves, and to provide a way for them to correct those \nhazards without being penalized for being responsible--then I knew that \nmy friends and neighbors would jump at the chance to clean up their \nbusinesses and neighborhoods, and would make their homes safer, on \ntheir own, for their children to grow up in.\n  I also knew that without this program there would be no incentive for \nprivate business owners to find out what kind of conditions existed on \ntheir property. In fact, the over bearing bureaucratic penalties that \nexist to punish conscientious property owners work more as a deterrent \nto responsibility than as a motivation to accomplish the goals of \nenvironmental clean up.\n  Because of her efforts I am happy to say that she made my work much \neasier, and now both Colorado and Wyoming have responsible, \nenvironmental audit laws that encourage businesses to clean up their \nproperty without forcing the United States payers to foot the bill. I \nam also proud to say\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\nthat these statutes have made more of a difference on the health and \nenvironmental well-being of local communities than superfund. There is \nmore proactive action on the part of property owners and there is a \ngreater testing of unknown substances so we now have a much better \nunderstanding of what is out there in our communities. Most states have \nnow followed this lead.\n  Ms. Norton is also aware of the fiscal responsibilities that many \nfederal agencies have shirked over the past several years. In one \ndiscussion I had with Ms. Norton, she made the comment that as a state \nofficial she had a fixed budget and was responsible for every dollar, \nbut in reviewing the budgets of the Federal Agencies that fall under \nthe jurisdiction of the Department of Interior she was appalled to see \nthe lack of accountability. I encouraged her then, and I will encourage \nher now, to do what she can as Secretary to see that this situation is \nreversed. Most policy is set by the President. Secretaries administer \nand manage huge work forces. Ms. Norton is a manager.\n  In closing Mr. President, when I spoke with Ms. Norton earlier this \nyear I was encouraged by her sincerity and by her understanding of the \nresponsibility and sense of duty that must accompany public servants \nlike the Secretary of Interior. I am convinced that Ms. Norton will \nuphold the laws of this land and will hold not only private individuals \nresponsible for their actions, but will ensure that the Federal \nGovernment does not shirk its duties as a major landowner, or its \nliabilities as a polluter.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I join a majority of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to confirm President Bush's nomination of Gale Norton as the \nSecretary of Interior.\n  As you know the Secretary of Interior has tremendous responsibilities \nas the chief steward of America's public lands as well as the \nbiological and mineral resources native to those lands.\n  The role of the Secretary of Interior is nowhere more important than \nin the great state of Nevada where nearly 90 percent of the land is \nowned by the federal government.\n  Through her oversight of the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of \nReclamation, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Secretary of \nInterior impacts the lives of Nevadans every day.\n  The challenges of managing the Interior Department have evolved over \nthe years. Today, some of the most important issues facing the \nSecretary are urban land management decisions that did not pose major \nproblems decades ago.\n  For example, the Las Vegas Valley, which is the fastest growing \nregion in the country, is completely encircled by federal lands. Much \nof this public land, including scattered parcels throughout the Valley, \nis managed by the Interior Department.\n  The tremendous growth in Southern Nevada places increasing pressure \non our public land resources.\n  As an example, recreational sportsmen cannot safely shoot in many \nparts of the Southern Nevada desert any longer because of urban growth \nand competing recreational uses.\n  In an effort to remedy this problem, I am working with Clark County \nand the BLM to identify and dedicate public land for use as a \nrecreational shooting complex. Recreation and access to public lands \nare of paramount importance in Nevada.\n  Conservation and protection of natural resources in the Silver State \nare important too.\n  It is my sincere hope that Secretary Norton and President Bush do not \nview confirmation of someone who once worked for the Mountain States \nLegal Foundation as a mandate for the rollback of environmental \nprotections enacted over the past 8 years.\n  The recently enacted phase out of snowmobile use in Yellowstone \nNational Park will provide a litmus test for whether President Bush \nwill promote conservation or oversee the decline and degradation of our \ntreasured national park system and our public lands generally.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, after carefully considering the record \nand statements of Gale Norton, nominee for Secretary of Interior, I am \nvoting to confirm her nomination today. I have serious concerns about \nmany of the land use and conservation policies Ms. Norton has promoted \nin the past, and my vote is in no way a confirmation of these policies. \nHowever, after a lengthy discussion with Ms. Norton, she has pledged to \nwork closely with me on the issues that affect Washington state.\n  We discussed many of Washington's challenges, including the Hanford \nRanch, Elwha dams, salmon recovery, habitat conservation plans, and \nfunding for Interior programs. In our conversation, I assured Ms. \nNorton that if she threatens Washington's interests she will find in me \na strong and persistent opponent. I will speak out from the Senate \nfloor and use my position on the Appropriations Committee to challenge \nany initiatives or spending proposals that don't meet Washington's \nneeds. If the Interior Secretary seeks to roll back important policy \ninitiatives, I will defend my state with every authority available to \nme. President Bush wants Gale Norton to manage the Department of \nInterior. I will hold President Bush accountable for his policies and \nbudget decisions.\n  I believe it's important to leave the door open for discussion, and I \ntrust that Gale Norton will reach out to work with Senator Cantwell and \nme on Northwest issues. Given her pledge to work with me and her \npromises during the confirmation process, I'm voting for Gale Norton \nwith the understanding that we will have a seat at the table on the \npolicies and budgets that will affect us.\n  Washington state has many environmental challenges. We have the \nresponsibility for recovering endangered species, including salmon, \nbulltrout, sturgeon, the spotted owl, and the marbled murrelet. The \nDepartment of the Interior plays a crucial role in protecting these \nspecies on federal lands. If the department does a good job of \nprotecting these species, less of a recovery burden will fall to \nprivate property owners. In addition, we must also fund land and forest \nconservation efforts.\n  The next Interior Secretary will need to develop innovative \npartnerships that include federal, state, local, and tribal \ngovernments, along with private property owners and businesses. It is \nparticularly important in Washington state that the Interior Secretary \nworks closely with tribal governments and treats them as equals. \nFurther, I call on Ms. Norton to fill critical posts, including the \nDirector of the U.S. Fish and wildlife Service, with appointees who are \nfamiliar with the unique environmental needs of the Pacific Northwest.\n  I do want to address President Bush's proposal to open the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to drilling, a proposal Ms. Norton \nsupports. During the past eight years, I've consistently opposed \ndrilling in ANWR, which the Bush Administration considers a high \npriority. I remain very skeptical of our ability to drill without \nthreatening or disrupting this pristine area, and I will continue to \nshare my concerns with the Bush Administration.\n  Throughout the past eight years, we have made great progress in \nprotecting the environment and preserving natural resources while \nmaintaining resource-dependent industries. We need to continue our \nprogress in this fragile balance. Now is not the time to undo the \nenvironmental progress made under previous Administrations. Now is the \ntime to look ahead, to work together, and to find creative solutions to \nthe many problems still facing our nation. I look forward to working \ntogether with Ms. Norton in the months ahead.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to comment on the \nnomination of Gale Norton to the position of Secretary of Interior, and \nto explain the reasons why I plan to support her nomination.\n  The founders of this nation gave the United States Senate an \nimportant responsibility when they granted it advice and consent \nauthority over Presidential nominations. Throughout my career in the \nSenate I have taken this responsibility seriously and have established \nconsistent standards for application of this power, regardless of which \npolitical party sits in the White House.\n  However, not all Presidential nominations are equal. I apply a very \ndifferent standard to Supreme Court and federal judicial appointments \nthan to political appointees.\n  Federal judges and Supreme Court Justices receive the highest \nstandard\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\nof scrutiny. They are confirmed for life and can only be removed \nthrough impeachment by Congress. Justices, by the nature of the job, \nshould be non-partisan. I subject Judicial nominees to intense review, \nexamining their experience as well as their ideology.\n  Cabinet and subcabinet appointments receive a different standard of \nscrutiny. These appointees serve at the will of the President and can \nbe removed from office with relative ease. Unless the nominee is shown, \nthrough the nomination and hearing process, to be unfit or unqualified \nto serve, I believe any President should be allowed to choose his or \nher cabinet and the Senate should confirm the nomination.\n  Mr. President, Gale Norton and I may disagree on many issues. \nHowever, after two days of hearings by the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and answers to over 200 questions submitted in \nwriting, she came across as a qualified nominee of integrity and \nintellect who is committed to upholding current environmental laws, \nwhatever her past opinions. In fact, I have been encouraged by the fact \nthat her nomination was reported to the full Senate by a bipartisan \nvote of 18-2.\n  My guess is that today she will receive the votes of a majority of \nDemocrats who, like me, consider themselves devoted environmentalists. \nMy good friend and the ranking member of the Energy Committee, Senator \nJeff Bingaman, who had earlier expressed concern about the nomination, \nspoke yesterday on the floor of the Senate and said that Norton had \nstated her commitment to ``conserve our `great wild places and \nunspoiled landscapes' '' and to enforce endangered species, surface \nmining and other laws. ``I take her at her word,'' he told the Senate.\n  I will also take her at her word, and will be watching her actions \ncarefully on the natural resource issues that we Vermonters care so \ndeeply about. In this regard, let me take a moment to lay out my \npositions and priorities for protecting the natural resources under the \npurview of the Interior Secretary.\n  I will not support drilling for oil or natural gas in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). I continue to believe that the United \nStates' dependence on oil and its byproducts cannot overshadow the \nimportance of keeping ANWR free from the detrimental impacts of oil and \nnatural gas drilling and exploration. Drilling and exploration in this \npristine Arctic wilderness could have a lasting impact that would \nforever damage the environment of this region. Hopefully, we can secure \npermanent protection for this unique linkage of ecosystems upon which \nthe local communities depend, and the American community as a whole \nshould value as a national and natural treasure.\n  In order to reduce our dependence on nonrenewable resources like oil \nand coal, we must consider alternative energy resources, as well as \nincreasing investments in energy efficient technologies and promotion \nof energy conservation. I have worked to increase our nation's \ninvestments in solar, wind and other alternative technologies since \nfounding the Congressional Solar Coalition in 1976. We must make \ninvesting in alternative energy sources and energy efficiency a higher \npriority.\n  In the past and in the future, many environmental battles come down \nto funding questions. One of the new Secretary's first responsibilities \nwill be to help draft a Bush Administration budget. She should know \nalready that I am a strong supporter of full funding for the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, and I will fight to achieve this goal in the \nnext Congress.\n  Our National Parks and National Monuments must receive adequate funds \nto cope with greater use by the American public and to ensure that \nthese treasures and the animals that inhabit them are not loved to \ndeath. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management \nare not agencies we often hear about in the news, but they play a \ncritical role in preserving our native species of plants and animals \nand they must be adequately funded.\n  Finally, I have been and continue to be a strong supporter of mining \nand grazing reform. It is outrageous that a 19th century statute \ncontinues to govern what the U.S. taxpayer is paid by companies \nextracting precious resources from public lands.\n  As a Senator from the party of President Theodore Roosevelt, and a \nSenator who represents the beautiful State of Vermont, I believe \nstrongly that we all must be conservationists. I will vote for Gale \nNorton today because I am confident that she will stand by her promise \nto enforce the laws that are the responsibility of the Interior \nSecretary, and will consult with all interested parties in making \nregulatory decisions. Furthermore, I pledge to be a watchdog to ensure \nthat environmental protection and conservation are not undermined at \nthe Department of the Interior.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I have decided \nto support Gale Norton as the Secretary of the Interior. It is not \nbecause I agree with her on every issue. In fact, on many issues we \ndisagree. She supports expanding the extraction of resources on federal \nlands, including allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. I do not. In the past, she has supported greater exploitation \nand commercialization of our public lands, and that troubles me. While \nI agree that public lands can have mixed uses, I am concerned that Ms. \nNorton will swing the pendulum too far in favor of industry. Her \nattitudes, however, fairly represent those of the President, and \nPresident Bush has the right to appoint a Cabinet that is a reflection \nof his beliefs.\n  While I am concerned about her past writings and beliefs about the \nrole of the Federal government in managing federal lands and conserving \nnatural resources, she has pledged to the Senate to uphold the law as \nit is currently formulated by the Congress and interpreted by the \ncourts. She has told the Senate that her thinking on issues like global \nwarming has changed. She now says that she supports the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and the right of the Federal government to intervene on \nprivate lands to protect wildlife from extinction. I will take her at \nher word and give her the opportunity to serve as our nation's leading \nconservationist.\n  Ms. Norton's opponents have compared her to James Watt, for whom she \nonce worked, but I hope she learned well from his term as the Secretary \nof the Interior. I hope she learned the lesson that the American people \nwill not tolerate an extremist anti-environment agenda. Americans have \nembraced a moderate environmental agenda that protects, nurtures, and \nmanages our lands in the public interest, and not for the private \nbenefit of a few. This country will not allow an Administration to \nabuse that public trust.\n  Secretary Watt damaged not only the Department of the Interior and \nour public lands, but the Administration that he served. President Bush \nhas spoken at length about bi-partisanship and bringing this country \ntogether. Nothing will evaporate the spirit of bi-partisanship faster \nthan vigorously pursuing an anti-environmental agenda.\n  So I believe that Ms. Norton should be given the opportunity to serve \nas Secretary of the Interior, but she will be watched carefully by \nCongress and private organizations. She needs to prove to many that she \nwill be a faithful steward of our natural riches and properly balance \ndevelopment with conservation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to give \nmy full and heartfelt support to Ms. Gale Norton as our new Secretary \nof the Interior. It gives me great pleasure and some hope that our \nnational land management policies will be more balanced and will take \nlocal views into account that she has been confirmed today.\n  I congratulate President George W. Bush for putting forward this \noutstanding nominee. Clearly, one of the first impressions our new \npresident has made on the nation is that he is willing to seek out and \nsurround himself with the most capable administrators our nation has to \noffer. If anyone wishes to know why Gale Norton is such a great \nnominee, just look at what her worst critics are not saying about her. \nNo one has questioned her intelligence; no one has questioned her \nqualifications; and no one has questioned her ability to work with all \nsides on an issue. Some may question her views on the issues, but that \nis to be expected in a change of government.\n  Mr. President, Gale Norton understands what Utahns have always known, \nbut what the last administration was unwilling to acknowledge:\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\nthat the environment and our public lands belong to the people, not to \nfederal bureaucrats. Gale Norton seems to believe, like I do, that some \npower should be returned to our state and local communities who have \nthe greatest interest and the greatest stake in protecting their \nenvironment.\n  There will always be a role for our federal government in protecting \nour environment and our federal lands. But our federal government \ncannot be effective when it fails to listen to the needs of the people \nit is supposed to serve. After the last eight years of increasing all \nviewpoints will be a breath of fresh air. I urge all of my colleagues, \ntoday, to join me in confirming Gale Norton as the Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconfirmation of Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior. I do not \nreach this decision easily. However, I do not have the confidence that \nMs. Norton will bring the necessary balanced approach that should be \nrequired for this position.\n  I have discussed the important and special role that the Secretary of \nthe Interior performs in this country when the Senate has considered \nother nominees to this office. In 1983, I described the office of the \nSecretary of the Interior as:\n\n       the chief environmental officer of the United States as \n     well as the conservator, trustee and steward of the public \n     lands and natural resources. At the same time, the Secretary \n     is expected to promote and direct the reasonable and \n     efficient use of those lands and natural resources, in ways \n     which do not conflict with his primary environmental \n     responsibilities. And the American people, those who wish to \n     preserve those lands and resources as well as those who wish \n     to develop them, expect that the Secretary will bring to bear \n     an appropriate expertise, experience and balanced temperament \n     on the wide variety of issues he is called upon to decide.\n\n  I do not question that Gale Norton has a great deal of experience and \nknowledge about the matters that will come before her. However, I am \nconcerned that her record fails to indicate a ``balanced temperament on \nthe wide variety of issues she will be called upon to decide.''\n  From her earlier attacks on the Surface Mining Act and Endangered \nSpecies Act to positions she has taken to undermine implementation of \nthe Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, her judgments evidence a pattern \nthat calls into question exactly how she will view her responsibilities \nas the steward of our public lands when she is called upon to make \ndecisions about their appropriate use. The position of Secretary of the \nInterior is too important to entrust to someone whose record does not \nconvey a commitment to the preservation of our public lands and natural \nresources.\n  For these reasons, I will cast my vote against the confirmation of \nMs. Norton.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Gale Norton to be Secretary of Interior. While I am \nnot a member of the Energy Committee that held hearings on the \nnomination, I have closely reviewed her record and her testimony.\n  The Secretary of Interior is the steward of our country's natural \nresources and public lands. Any nominee for this position should be \nselected for their commitment to protecting our precious resources as \nwell as their dedication to uphold and enforce our environmental laws.\n  After reviewing the record of Gale Norton there is little doubt that \nshe is an intelligent and dedicated public servant who has strong \nconvictions about issues that concern the Department of Interior. On \nthe one hand, I commend her commitment to her strong ideological views. \nHowever, it is this unyielding commitment to those strongly held \nbeliefs that makes me question whether she will be able to set those \nviews aside and consider the views of all Americans as we debate \nimportant issues concerning the natural resources.\n  As our country continues to prosper, the Secretary of Interior will \noversee a number of ongoing debates concerning public lands and the \nprotection of endangered species. There is no single solution that can \nserve as an answer to land management issues in each region of our \ncountry. There are many stakeholders with a wide variety of views on \nhow we protect, access and use our natural resources. We in Vermont and \nNew England are deeply concerned about pressure being placed on our \nnatural resources from rapid growth. We Vermonters also have concerns \nthat environmental standards should be strictly enforced for our lands, \nair, water and threatened species.\n  The record of Gale Norton provides important insight on how she will \ninterpret laws and weigh the views of stakeholders concerning our \nnatural resources. These beliefs have been remarkably unwavering.\n  Based on the record I must vote against this nomination. However, if \nGale Norton is confirmed, you can be sure that I will work closely with \nher on a variety of issues that are important to Vermonters. I will \nwork with her to try and foster consensus not only in our region but \nalso throughout the country.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Gale Norton has a long public record and \nhas written extensively on environmental issues over her career. I have \nreviewed that record and understand the concerns of those who have \nasked whether, as Secretary of the Interior, she would implement and \ndefend environmental laws, many of which she has challenged or \nquestioned in the past.\n  That is the core question surrounding this nomination. It was put to \nMs. Norton in a number of ways by members of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Ms. Norton testified that she is a ``passionate conservationist'' who \nwill enforce the law as interpreted by the courts. I will vote to \nconfirm her nomination, but I don't discount the seriousness of the \nconcerns raised by her opponents. I intend to monitor closely her \nstewardship of the Department of the Interior.\n  The duties of the Secretary of the Interior are profound, and have \nserious implications for the health of our nation's environment and the \nquality of life for millions of Americans. The Secretary is the primary \nguardian of the Endangered Species Act, our nation's flagship law for \nprotecting plant and animal species threatened with extinction. The \nSecretary also is charged with administering most of our nation's \npublic lands, including places of extraordinary beauty and fragility \nsuch as Yellowstone National Park.\n  As Ms. Norton undertakes these responsibilities, it is my hope and \nexpectation that she will follow the pragmatic approach reflected in \nher testimony before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Her \nsuccess as Interior Secretary will be measured by the degree to which \nshe maintains this balanced approach to environmental and natural \nresource issues.\n  Our nation's environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act \nand the National Environmental Policy Act, must be enforced fully, as \nthey have been interpreted by the courts.\n  In managing our natural resources, we should respect the views of \nlocal residents, but we must also recognize that the American people \nown these lands and that the Secretary must uphold the public interest \nas a whole.\n  Ms. Norton has expressed confidence in the efficacy of allowing \nindustries to police themselves when it comes to protecting the \nenvironment. History has shown too often that this approach fails to \nprotect the public interest. Summitville, Colorado, is only one example \nof how insufficient oversight has led to environmental disaster. The \nmap of the United States is dotted with other examples. It is my hope \nthat, through this confirmation process and through her experience in \npublic office, Ms. Norton has gained a better appreciation of the fact \nthat the Secretary of the Interior's trust includes active enforcement \nof the nation's environmental laws.\n  It is particularly important to me that Ms. Norton fully implement \nthe biological opinion written by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nregarding the management of the Missouri River. The Fish and Wildlife \nService has found that, unless the Corps of Engineers makes major \nchanges in the operations of federal dams on the river, it will be in \nviolation of the Endangered Species Act. Ensuring that the Corps makes \nthe needed changes in the operations of the dams is a top priority for \nthe upper Midwest, and for me personally. It is imperative that \nSecretary Norton follow through on the Fish and Wildlife Service \nrecommendations so that they are adopted by the Corps.\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\n  I also hope to work with Secretary Norton to preserve small wetlands \nand native prairie in South Dakota, both of which provide important \nhabitat for wildlife. Tallgrass prairie preservation has been a \nremarkable success in my state, and the number of farmers seeking to \nparticipate in the program has outpaced the amount of available \nfunding.\n  Finally, I want to work with Secretary Norton to strengthen the \nBureau of Reclamation. Vast areas of South Dakota lack potable drinking \nwater. Federal projects funded by the Bureau of Reclamation such as the \nMni Wiconi, Mid-Dakota and Lewis and Clark rural water systems are \ncritical to the public health and economic vitality of our state. At \ncurrent funding levels, however, it will be years before these projects \ncan be completed. I urge the Secretary to give these projects the \npriority treatment they deserve.\n  Ms. Norton faces some significant policy challenges at the Department \nof the Interior. I expect we will have our differences, such as on \nPresident Bush's support for opening the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge for oil exploration and drilling. On those issues I anticipate a \nspirited debate. On many other issues, I am certain we will work \nclosely together to protect and manage our nation's natural resources \nand honor our trust responsibilities to tribes.\n  Gale Norton has my congratulations on her nomination and confirmation \nas Secretary of the Interior.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nnomination of Gale Norton to be the next Secretary of the Department of \nInterior. Clearly the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nhearings on Gale Norton's nomination have revealed that she is a \nvivacious lawyer who contemplates and explores ideas. Concepts matter \nto her, and more importantly she has the management ability to turn \nconcepts into public policies which have both enhanced compliance with \nenvironmental laws and respected the responsible stewardship of \ncitizens who live on the land. Gale Norton knows there must be a \nbalance and this will make her invaluable for America's conservation \nprograms and for all our communities.\n  Too often, some environmentalist groups only offer false choices. \nThey only want a policy choice which pits the environment against \ncitizens and industry. This is unacceptable. Some environmentalist \ngroups also only want Washington ``experts'' making the decisions. \nWell, Gale Norton has repeatedly shown her commitment to a safe and \nclean environment through consensus building. For over 20 years, she \nhas brought people together with different views to overcome problems \ndealing with environmental and Federal land issues.\n  I have little doubt that Americans will see for themselves that Gale \nNorton will serve with a steady, firm and fair hand as our Nation's \nnext Secretary of Interior. I firmly believe our Nation's treasures \nwill be both protected and improved.\n  Americans will quickly discover just how harshly inaccurate many \nspecial interest groups' characterizations of her have been. Gale \nNorton has shown the grace and resolve that will help her restore the \nunanimity at the Department of Interior.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Is there a couple minutes remaining before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield to my friend from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have spoken at length about the \nInterior Secretary nominee and also about our other nominee today, but \nI have not had a chance to say anything about the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the nominee, Christine Todd Whitman. I am very \nproud to make a statement for the Record that expresses my views.\n  Mr. President, ``just as houses are made of stones, so is science \nmade of facts; but a pile of stones is not a house and a collection of \nfacts is not necessarily science.'' For the past 8 years I have \nquestioned numerous collections of facts put out by the Environmental \nProtection Agency in the name of science. That is why I strongly \nsupport president Bush's nomination of Christine Todd Whitman as the \nnew Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  President Bush has endorsed Christie Whitman as a person who \nunderstands the importance of a clean and healthy environment and who \nwill ensure that environmental regulations are based, not merely on \nassembled facts, but on solid, sound science. Sound science has been \nleft out of the regulation equation too often over the past 8 years. A \nprime example is the new arsenic standards proposed last week. These \nstandards were not based on sound science and they were not implemented \nto increase health benefits, they were put into effect because it was \nthe politically expedient thing to do.\n  Arsenic is naturally occurring in my home state of New Mexico. I have \nnot seen reasonable data in support of increased health benefits from \nthese lower standards. I have only seen a collection of facts from \nstudies conducted outside of the United States. New Mexicans will not \nsee appreciable health benefits; they will see their water bills double \nand will be forced to endure financial hardship.\n  Ms. Whitman has been an advocate of clean water, clean air and clean \nshores and while I know that she will continue to promote these things \nfor all Americans, I am excited about the way she will champion these \ncauses. I believe that she will promote scientifically valid \ninitiatives to ensure that we have clean water, clean air and clean \nshores.\n  In conjunction with sound scientific, Ms. Whitman also understands \nthat better results can be achieved through a more cooperative, rather \nthan a confrontational, approach with the regulated community. This too \nis consistent with the beliefs and philosophies of President Bush. \nPresident Bush has said that the federal model of mandate, regulate, \nand litigate needs to be modernized. Americans need to be rewarded for \ninnovation and results when it comes to protecting the environment.\n  Christie Whitman has worked extensively on environmental issues \nduring her service as the New Jersey Governor. She has demonstrated her \ncommitment to a safe and clean environment and shows that she is \nwilling to bring all parties together in an effort to find solutions to \ncomplex environmental issues. She exemplifies the qualities of a \nconsensus builder, not a divider.\n  Environmental issues continue to be some of the most complex and \ncontentious and require a leader who can balance various competing \ninterests. Christie Whitman will bring this type of leadership into the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  It is time to base our regulations on more than just a collection of \nfacts. It is time to work together and to search for solutions that are \nbased on scientifically valid facts. I look forward to working with Ms. \nWhitman in doing just that.\n  As I have said, the Secretary of the Interior has important jobs \nbesides just the Interior Department's functions. I say the same about \nChristine Todd Whitman. She will have a tough job because America is in \nan energy crisis. That means every Department of our Government is \ngoing to have to start looking not only at their policies but how do \ntheir policies affect America's energy future? She will have a \ndifficult job because that has not been the case at EPA in the past. So \nI bid her well. I hope she has a very successful term because if she \ndoes, we will. If she adjusts some of her rulings to a bigger problem, \nand can make some cost-benefit assessments that are good for the \nenvironment, but also for energy, the energy supply, I think that will \nbe a marvelous achievement.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 14 years in the Senate, I have voted \non 36 Cabinet nominations: 24 by Republican Presidents and 12 by a \nDemocratic President. Of all of them, this one is by far the most \ndifficult. I have struggled with this decision, as have most of us.\n  I have spent many hours thinking about what I have heard and read. I \nhave reviewed the words of our founders, and I have searched my memory \nand my conscience.\n  In his inaugural address, President Bush pledged to ``work to build a \nsingle nation of justice and opportunity'' for all Americans. I think \nmost Americans share that desire.\n  That is why this vote is so important.\n  John Ashcroft is a man of considerable accomplishment. He is a \ngraduate of Yale and the University of Chicago Law School, a former \nState auditor, State attorney general, and a former Governor.\n  Beyond that, he is a former Member of this Senate. Many of us have \nworked with him for a number of years.\n  The question facing us, however, is not: Does John Ashcroft have an \nimpressive resume? Clearly, he does.\n  The question facing us is: Is John Ashcroft the right person to lead \nthe United States Department of Justice?\n  The Attorney General is more than ``the President's lawyer.'' He is \nthe guardian of the constitutional rights of all Americans--the \nprotector of our fundamental freedoms.\n  The Attorney General of the United States has enormous power. He \nadvises the President and every other Cabinet member--on whether their \nactions are\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\nconstitutional. He has enormous authority to decide which laws are \nenforced, and to what extent.\n  The Attorney General decides how--and whether--to intervene in court \ncases. He is responsible for screening and recommending nominees for \nthe Federal bench, including the Supreme Court.\n  Because of his enormous authority and discretion, the Attorney \nGeneral--more than any other Cabinet member--has the power to protect, \nor erode, decades of progress in civil rights in America.\n  I believe the President has the right to choose advisers with whom he \nis philosophically comfortable.\n  That is why--out of 36 Cabinet nominations, I voted so far on 35, \n``yes.'' The only nominee I voted against was John Tower. I think we \nare all aware of the problems with that nomination.\n  My respect for the President's right to choose his own Cabinet is \nalso a good part of the reason I have voted to confirm every other \nnominee this President has sent us.\n  At the same time, the Senate has a right--and a responsibility to \nevaluate the President's nominees; offer advice; and either grant--or \nwithhold--its consent.\n  How do we decide whether to confirm--or reject--a Cabinet nominee? \nOur Founders, unfortunately, gave us no constitutional guidelines. The \n``appointments clause'' of the Constitution says only that the Senate \nhas the power of advice and consent. It does not specify how we should \ndecide.\n  During his 6 years in this body, Senator Ashcroft had his own \nstandard. He made it clear he believes Presidential appointees can--and \nshould--be rejected for ideological reasons. That is the standard he \nused in blocking Bill Lann Lee's nomination to head the Justice \nDepartment's Civil Rights Division.\n  As Senator Ashcroft put it at the time: Mr. Lee ``obviously (has) a \nstrong capacity to be an advocate. But his pursuit of objectives \nimportant to him limit his capacity to make a balanced judgment.''\n  Some might say it is fair to hold Senator Ashcroft to that same \nstandard. And they might be right. But I choose a different standard.\n  In Federalist No. 76, Alexander Hamilton said there must be ``special \nand strong reasons'' for Senators to reject a Presidential nominee.\n  Rarely has that standard been met. Out of more than 900 Cabinet \nnominations that have reached this floor, the Senate has rejected only \nfive.\n  Only one nominee for Attorney General has ever been rejected on the \nSenate floor; and that was 76 years ago.\n  Nearly 30 years ago, Archibald Cox was the special Watergate \nprosecutor--until President Nixon had him fired for doing his job too \nwell. Before that, he was Solicitor General of the United States.\n  He has said that the best way to judge what sort of Attorney General \na person will make is not by listening to the nominee's promises about \nthe future. It is by examining his past.\n  In his words:\n\n       Respect for the law--the fairness with which the law is \n     administered--is the foundation of a free society. The \n     individual who becomes Attorney General can do more by his \n     past record . . . than by his conduct in office . . . to \n     strengthen or erode confidence in the fairness, impartiality, \n     integrity and freedom-from-taint-of-personal-influence, in \n     the administration of law.\n\n  Is John Ashcroft the right person to lead the Justice Department? Or \nare there ``special and strong'' reasons that make his appointment as \nAttorney General unwise? The answer is not in his heart. It is in his \nlong public record.\n  Senator Ashcroft has been a public official for nearly a quarter of a \ncentury.\n  Throughout his career, he has been a fierce advocate for his beliefs. \nThose beliefs--on civil rights, on women's rights, workers' rights, \nseparation of church and State, and many other issues--put him far to \nthe right of most Americans.\n  Senator Ashcroft and his supporters argue that his past activism does \nnot matter. Legislators write laws, they say. Attorneys general simply \nenforce the laws that are on the books.\n  It is an interesting distinction. But in 8 years as Missouri's \nattorney general, it is not a distinction John Ashcroft made.\n  For 8 years as Missouri's attorney general and 8 years after that as \nGovernor, John Ashcroft prevented efforts to end segregation of public \nschools in St. Louis and 23 surrounding communities.\n  The Federal court system found the State responsible for the \nsegregation, and ordered it to correct its sad history. John Ashcroft \nfought nearly every one of those orders. Three times in 4 years, he \nappealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Each time, he lost.\n  When St. Louis and the surrounding communities agreed on their own to \na voluntary desegregation plan, Attorney General Ashcroft used the \npower of his office to block it. His obstruction provoked one judge in \nthe case to threaten him with contempt. Today, he insists that his \nopposition was just a matter of guarding the public till.\n  But in 1984, when he ran for Governor, John Ashcroft denounced the \nvoluntary desegregation plan as ``an outrage against human decency.''\n  According to the St. Louis Post Dispatch, he and his opponent in the \n1984 Republican Gubernatorial primary competed ``to see who could \ndenounce desegregation most harshly . . . exploiting and encouraging \nthe worst racist sentiments that exist in the state.''\n  His continued defiance as Governor caused another judge in the case--\na Republican appointed by President Reagan--to conclude that ``the \nState is ignoring the real objectives of this case--a better education \nfor city students--to personally embark on a litigious pursuit of \nrighteousness.''\n  John Ashcroft's 16-year fight to prevent the voluntary desegregation \ncost Missouri taxpayers millions of dollars. Worse than that, it cost \nmany children their right to a decent education.\n  So much for the distinction between writing laws, and merely \nenforcing them.\n  In addition, Attorney General Ashcroft vigorously opposed the Equal \nRights Amendment.\n  When the National Organization for Women urged a boycott of Missouri \nand other States for failing to ratify the ERA, Attorney General \nAshcroft ignored settled legal precedent and stretched antitrust laws \nto sue the organization. He used taxpayer dollars to take the case all \nthe way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court ruled that NOW members \nwere simply exercising their fundamental, constitutional right to free \nspeech.\n  Governor Ashcroft also twice vetoed voting-rights bills that would \nhave allowed trained volunteers to register voters in the city of St. \nLouis--just as they did in neighboring suburbs, where there were more \nwhite and Republican voters.\n  Earlier this month, in his opening remarks before the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Ashcroft described himself as ``a man of common-\nsense conservative beliefs.'' The truth is, there is nothing common \nabout his conservatism.\n  Here in this Senate, he demonstrated what the New York Times called \n``a radical propensity for offering constitutional amendments that \nwould bring that document into alignment with his religious views.''\n  In more than 200 years, our Constitution has been amended only 27 \ntimes--including the 10 amendments of the Bill of Rights. In his one \nterm in this Senate, John Ashcroft introduced or cosponsored seven \nconstitutional amendments. One of his amendments would have radically \nrewritten the rules to make it easier to amend the Constitution. \nAnother would have made abortion a crime, even in cases of rape and \nincest, and even when continuing a pregnancy would result in serious \nand permanent injury to a woman. It also would have banned most common \nforms of birth control.\n  By his own account, Senator Ashcroft was ``probably more critical \nthan any other individual in the Senate'' of Federal judges. He has \nvilified judges with whom he disagrees as ``renegade judges, a robed \nand contemptuous elite.''\n  He frequently opposed qualified Presidential nominees. He opposed \nboth Dr. Henry Foster and Dr. David Satcher for Surgeon General because \nthey supported President Clinton's position on a woman's right to \nchoose. In Dr. Foster's case, he prevented the nomination from ever \nreaching the Senate floor.\n  In 1998, when James Hormel was nominated to serve as U.S. Ambassador \nto Luxembourg, Senator Ashcroft said\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\nhe opposed the nomination because Mr. Hormel ``has been a leader in \npromoting a lifestyle.''\n  While Senator Ashcroft never met with Mr. Hormel to discuss his \nqualifications, he now asserts vaguely that it was the ``totality'' of \nMr. Hormel's record that prompted his opposition.\n  Then-Senator Al D'Amato--a member of Senator Ashcroft's own party--\nsaw a different reason.\n  In a 1998 letter to Senator Lott, Senator D'Amato wrote: ``I fear Mr. \nHormel's nomination is being held up for one reason and one reason \nonly: the fact that he is gay.''\n  Senator Ashcroft blocked Bill Lann Lee's nomination to head the \nJustice Department's Civil Rights Division because of Mr. Lee's views \non affirmative action.\n  Just as Senator Ashcroft assures us that he will enforce laws with \nwhich he disagrees, Mr. Lee assured members of the Judiciary Committee \nthat he would enforce Supreme Court rulings restricting affirmative \naction.\n  Senator Ashcroft refused to accept that assurance. Perhaps the most \ntroubling for me personally is Senator Ashcroft's treatment of Judge \nRonnie White, the first nominee to the Federal district court to be \nrejected on the Senate floor in 50 years.\n  Judge White grew up in a poor family and worked his way through \ncollege and law school. He is a former prosecutor, State legislator, \ncircuit judge, and member of the Missouri State appeals court. He is \nthe first African American ever appointed to the Missouri Supreme \nCourt. In 1997, he was nominated to be a U.S. district court judge. For \n2 years, Senator Ashcroft blocked Judge White's nomination from coming \nto the Senate floor. The wait lasted so long that the seat for which \nJudge White was nominated was officially declared a judicial emergency.\n  When Judge White's nomination finally did come to the floor, Senator \nAshcroft misled the Senate and deliberately distorted his record. For \nme, that day was one of the saddest in all of my years in the Senate.\n  John Ashcroft smeared Judge White as ``pro-criminal and activist,'' a \nman with a ``tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  Stuart Taylor who writes for the conservative National Journal \nmagazine writes that John Ashcroft's treatment of Judge White alone \nmakes him ``unfit to be Attorney General.''\n  ``The reason,'' Taylor writes, ``is (that) during an important debate \non a sensitive matter, then-Senator Ashcroft abused the power of his \noffice by descending to demagoguery, dishonesty and character \nassassination.''\n  I do not believe John Ashcroft's treatment of Judge White was \nmotivated by racism. I believe it was plain political opportunism. In \nthe heat of a tough reelection battle, John Ashcroft was willing to try \nto distort the record and destroy the reputation of a good man. To this \nday, Senator Ashcroft continues to misrepresent Judge White's record \nand insist that he himself did nothing wrong.\n  The job of Attorney General demands fairness, judgment, tolerance, \nand respect for opposing views. It demands commitment to equal rights \nfor all Americans and a sensitivity to injustice. John Ashcroft has \nshown a pattern of insensitivity through his public career. Even now he \nrefuses to disavow Southern Partisan Quarterly Review, a magazine that \nhas defended slavery. He refuses to distance himself from Bob Jones \nUniversity, a cauldron of intolerance that has described Mormons and \nCatholics as ``cults which call themselves Christian.''\n  Senator Ashcroft has said there are only ``two things you find in the \nmiddle of the road: a moderate and a dead skunk.'' I think he is wrong. \nThe other thing you find in the middle of the road is the vast majority \nof the American people.\n  An article in the December 23 New York Times quoted an adviser to \nPresident Bush as saying:\n\n       Attorney General was the one area where the right felt very \n     strongly, a la Ed Meese. This is a message appointment.\n\n  The adviser described it as a signal to the conservatives that ``I \nhear your concerns.''\n  What message does making John Ashcroft Attorney General send to the \nrest of America? What message does it send to women or to minorities? \nWhat message does it send to judges and others who may not see the \nworld exactly as John Ashcroft sees it? What message does making John \nAshcroft Attorney General send to Americans who fear their votes don't \ncount and aren't counted?\n\n  John Ashcroft has said:\n\n       There are voices in the Republican Party today who preach \n     pragmatism, who champion conciliation, who counsel \n     compromise. I stand here today to reject those deceptions. If \n     ever there was a time to unfurl the banner of unabashed \n     conservatism, it is now.\n\n  I say, if ever there was a time to unfurl the banner of conciliation, \nit is now. Senator Ashcroft is a man of intellect and passionate \nbeliefs. I am sure there are many ways he can serve the causes in which \nhe believes so fiercely, but I do not believe it is fair or reasonable \nfor us to expect him to fully enforce laws he finds unwise, \nunconstitutional, and, in some cases, morally repugnant.\n  How can John Ashcroft enforce laws he has spent his entire public \ncareer fighting? What would that say about him if he did?\n  I have turned this over in my head a hundred times. Every time the \nanswer is sadly the same: I do not believe John Ashcroft is the right \nperson to lead the U.S. Department of Justice. For that reason, I will \nvote no on this nomination.\n  In his inaugural address, President Bush spoke of the ``grand and \nenduring ideals'' that unite Americans across generations. ``The \ngrandest of all these ideals,'' he said, ``is an unfolding American \npromise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no \ninsignificant person was ever born.''\n  I applaud the President's words, but I cannot reconcile them with \nthis nomination. John Ashcroft spent 6 years in the Senate mocking \nbipartisanship. To require that we confirm him now as proof of our \nbipartisanship and good faith is asking too much.\n  I thank Senators Leahy and Hatch and members of the staff of the \nJudiciary Committee for conducting a full and fair hearing. I thank the \nmany witnesses and people all across our Nation who made their voices \nheard on this critical nomination.\n  In closing, regardless of what we decide, I hope we will all remember \nwhat this debate is about. It is not about partisan politics. It is not \nabout whether we are willing to work with this President. It is about \njustice.\n  Nearly a century ago, another Republican, President Theodore \nRoosevelt, heard rumors that the district attorneys and marshals in a \nparticular State would be ordered to replace their deputies for \npolitical reasons. Immediately President Roosevelt sent a letter to his \nAttorney General, a man named William Moody, demanding that the plan be \nstopped. As he put it:\n\n       Of all the officers of the Government, those of the \n     Department of Justice should be kept free from any suspicion \n     of improper action on partisan or factional grounds.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I am particularly anxious that the federal courts . . . \n     should win regard and respect for the people by an exhibition \n     of scrupulous nonpartisanship, so that there shall be \n     gradually a growth--even though a slow growth--in the \n     knowledge that the Federal Court and the Federal Department \n     of Justice insist on meting out even-handed justice to all.\n\n  That was in 1904.\n  Over the course of the 20th century, we made great strides in \nassuring that America's courts and Justice Department are indeed \ncommitted to evenhanded justice for all. Now, as we begin the 21st \ncentury, is not the time to turn the clock back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are in a time for morning business. In an \neffort to have Senators know what is next, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Inhofe be recognized next for up to 15 minutes or whatever \ntime.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Maybe a little bit longer.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Inhofe for 25 minutes. Following that, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, be recognized for 15 minutes; following \nthat, Senator Bunning be recognized for up to a half hour; following \nthat, Senator Harkin\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nbe recognized; and following that, Senator Murray from Washington be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was just advised that I failed to mention \nSenator Jack Reed in the mix, and we want him to follow Senator Bunning \nin the same order, if there is a Republican who needs to speak in \nbetween Senator Reed and Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was listening very carefully during the entire \npresentation of our very illustrious minority leader, immediate past \nmajority leader. I had a hard time figuring out who he was talking \nabout.\n  I am 66 years old, and I have been involved in virtually every kind \nof political job. I have been involved for 30 years in the private \nsector. I don't believe I can stand here and think of one person I have \never met in my entire life who is a more honorable person, who is \ntotally incapable of telling a lie, than John Ashcroft.\n  I have watched him take courageous stands for things he believes in, \nyes, but he always tells it exactly the way he believes it. That is not \nthe question here. We are talking about a law enforcement officer. We \nare talking about the chief, the guy at the top.\n  When I have heard people say that he will not uphold the rule of law, \nI am reminiscent of the last 8 years, certainly Janet Reno and the \nClinton administration. We have been waiting for her to uphold the law, \nto prosecute people, and not to let people off just because they may be \nfriends of the administration.\n  I have watched her refuse to go after campaign fundraising abuses, \nrefuse to appoint an independent counsel where it is required by law, \nreject advice by Louis Freeh and Charles LaBella, refuse to prosecute \nGore's White House phone calls, questionable plea bargains with John \nHuang, Charlie Trie. I have watched the theft of nuclear secrets, \nwatched the botching of the investigation of Wen Ho Lee. I have watched \nthis Attorney General refuse to vigorously enforce gun laws. Gun \nprosecutions went down under the Reno administration.\n  We could think of a lot of examples. One that comes to mind, I happen \nto be in a Bible study with a man named Chuck Colson, who occasionally \ncomes by. I got to know him quite well. I think most Americans know who \nChuck Colson is. Chuck Colson violated the law back during the \nWatergate era. He disclosed confidential information and leaked it to \nthe media. As a result of that, he was found guilty and he served time, \nwas prosecuted and went to prison in a Federal penitentiary.\n  Ken Bacon did exactly the same thing. I have stood on this floor on \nthree different occasions and talked for about 40 minutes just on this \nparticular case, that during the Linda Tripp case, Ken Bacon did in \nfact release confidential information to the media. And as a result of \nthat, this person was taken out of consideration in terms of \ncredibility.\n  There is no reason in the world. The law hasn't changed. If anything, \nit is stronger than it was at that time. But there is no reason in the \nworld that if Chuck Colson was prosecuted 25 years ago and spent time \nin the Federal penitentiary, Ken Bacon should not have been prosecuted \nand sent to the penitentiary exactly as Chuck Colson was.\n  There is an accusation that John Ashcroft would not uphold the law. I \nam not saying he should be just a little bit better than our previous \nAttorney General, Janet Reno, has been. He has to be much, much better. \nBut there is certainly no comparison.\n  As far as Ronnie White is concerned, I think it is important that we \nnot try to paint John Ashcroft as being any kind of racist. During the \ntime he was in the positions that he held in the State of Missouri, he \nsupported 26 of the 27 black judges. It is my understanding that he \nsupported more black judges during his administration than anyone had \nbefore him.\n  As far as Ronnie White is concerned, I listened to him testify before \nthe committee, and I was wondering why certain things were not said \nthat should have been said, because after going back and reading the \ncase--I believe the name is James Johnson--where this individual had \ngone out and had violently murdered a sheriff, in the same night a \ndeputy sheriff, in the same night another deputy sheriff, and then, if \nthat weren't enough, went to a person's home where they were having a \nChristmas party and in the process of praying brutally murdering the \nwife of one of the sheriffs, White was the lone dissenter in the death \npenalty case involving that man who brutally murdered four people.\n  On the same day that the nomination came to the floor, I heard this \nstory. I voted against Ronnie White mostly because of that case.\n  But I have to say this. I don't think many of us here who were not on \nthe Judiciary Committee knew that Ronnie White was black. This is the \nthing that shocked everyone. One of the Senators said this: The first \ntime I realized that he was black is when someone took the floor and \nsaid this was a result of racism. I know this isn't true.\n  There is one thing I want to clarify. I think it is important during \nthe next few hours that each one of these allegations be responded to \nbecause there is an assumption out there that is true. I am going to \nrespond to one in kind of an unusual way about James Hormel.\n  I almost 3 years ago on the floor of this Senate made a speech. It \nwas on May 22, 1998. I heard some comments by one of my favorites in \nthe Senate. I have to say this. When Patrick Moynihan was in the \nSenate, I always referred to him--he was my nextdoor neighbor--as my \nfavorite liberal. Since he is gone, I think I will refer to Paul \nWellstone as my favorite liberal. He and I have found that we don't \nagree on too many things, but he made some comments concerning my \nopposition to James Hormel.\n  It has been stated several times on this Senate floor, and I think in \nthe hearings also, that John Ashcroft was the one responsible for James \nHormel not getting legitimately confirmed. I am here to say today that \nit was not John Ashcroft; it was I.\n  I am going to read the Record where I thanked the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, for some comments he made, and I also said \nwhat we might do since we are both sharing time was that I would speak \nfirst and he could respond afterwards.\n  Some statements were made on the floor yesterday concerning the hold \nI have on James Hormel to be Ambassador to Luxembourg. It is true I \nhave a hold on James Hormel. This is I, myself, speaking almost 3 years \nago. It was not John Ashcroft, it was I.\n  There very well may be a vote on this individual, but I will oppose \nhis nomination, and I want to stand and tell you why.\n  Statements were made on the floor by the senior Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone. I will read excerpts from it.\n\n       Now, one of my colleagues, and I think it is extremely \n     unfortunate, one of my colleagues has compared Mr. Hormel, a \n     highly qualified public servant and nominee, to Mr. David \n     Duke, who, among other credentials, is a former grand wizard \n     of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I want to say to my colleagues, that given this kind of \n     statement made publicly by a United States Senator, this kind \n     of character assassination, it is more important now than \n     ever that this man, Mr. Hormel, be voted on.\n       In defense, really, of the senior Senator from Minnesota, I \n     say that if I had said what he thought I said, he was \n     certainly entitled and justified to make the statements that \n     were made. But I think it is important to know that I did not \n     make those statements in the context that he believed I made \n     them.\n       Let me, first of all, say that there probably are not two \n     Members of the U.S. Senate who are further apart \n     philosophically than the senior Senator from Minnesota and \n     myself, I would probably, in my own mind, believe him to be \n     an extreme left-wing radical liberal and he believes me to be \n     an extreme right-wing radical conservative. And I think maybe \n     we are both right.\n       But one thing I respect about Senator Wellstone is he is \n     not a hypocrite. He is the same thing everywhere. He is the \n     same everywhere. He honestly believes that government \n     should have a more expanded role. He is a liberal. I am a \n     conservative.\n\n  Having said that, let me go back and talk a little bit about what he \nhad actually said. I made the statement when I was running for office--\nand I have been consistent with that--that if I get to the Senate where \nI have the opportunity to participate in the confirmation process, I \nwill work to keep the nominee from being confirmed if that\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\nindividual has his own personal agenda and has made statements publicly \nto the effect that he believes strongly in his personal agenda and will \nuse that office to advance the personal agenda more than he will the \nAmerican agenda.\n  In the case of James Hormel, a gay activist, he made statements in \nthe past, which I will read in a moment, that have led me to believe \nthat his personal agenda is above the agenda of the United States. As I \nsaid, the same thing would be true if it were David Duke. If he were up \nfor nomination, I would oppose him because I believe he would have his \nagenda above the agenda of America. Maybe with Patricia Ireland it \nwould be the same thing, Ralph Reed, who started the Christian \nCoalition. Maybe if he were up for nomination and he made the statement \nthat he would use that nomination, whether it be ambassadorial or \nanything else, to advance his own agenda, I would oppose it. Yet I \nagree with his agenda.\n  I would also like to quote someone who I think is familiar to all of \nus and whom we hold here in very high esteem, Faith Whittlesey, former \nU.S. Ambassador to Switzerland. She was talking about this trend of \ntrying to put people with their own personal agendas in the various \nembassies. She said:\n\n       Ambassadorial appointments should not be used for the \n     purposes of social engineering in the countries to which the \n     ambassadors are assigned.\n\n  One of the many statements I have made previously about James Hormel \nthat led me to the conclusion he wanted to use his position to advance \nthe agenda was the following statement he made June 16, 1996. He said:\n\n       I specifically asked to be Ambassador to Norway because, at \n     the time, they were about to pass legislation that would \n     acknowledge same-sex relationships, and they had indicated \n     their reception, their receptivity, to gay men and lesbians.\n\n  I believe he was implying and there is no question in anyone's mind \nthat he was saying he was going to use that job to advance his own \nagenda. I think it is important that we understand that.\n  I would like to repeat what I just said. It was 3 years ago.\n  As we listen to the confirmation hearings and hearing the speeches on \nthe floor, whoever it was who said that John Ashcroft was the one who \nblocked and attempted to block the confirmation of James Hormel, they \nare wrong. I am the one. It was not he.\n  I think there is a more serious thing here. I don't think it is the \nissue so much of James Hormel, or of abortion, or of discrimination. We \nare always shocked when we hear about repercussions in places such as \nSudan and China. People are enslaved for their religious belief.\n  I look at this and I think John Ashcroft is guilty of one thing. He \nis guilty of having an inseparable walk with the Lord. And he has said \nthat several times.\n  There is someone I dearly love by the name of Bill Bright who wrote \nthe book ``Red Sky in the Morning.'' I think it should be required \nreading for all Americans. Let me read a couple of things from it.\n\n       George Washington, ``Father of Our Country,'' 1st President \n     of the U.S.: ``Bless O Lord the whole race of mankind, and \n     let the world be filled with the knowledge of Thee and Thy \n     Son, Jesus Christ.''\n       ``It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God \n     and the Bible.''\n       Patrick Henry, American Revolutionary Leader: ``It cannot \n     be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great \n     nation was founded, not be religionists, but by Christians; \n     not on religions, but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ.''\n       Thomas Jefferson, 3rd President of the United States: \n     ``Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is \n     just, and that His justice cannot sleep forever.''\n\n  It goes on and on. You can read all of the founding fathers of this \ncountry.\n  What would John Adams, who said we have no government armed with \npower capable of contending with human passions, unbridled mortality, \nand religion--what would they say if they knew right now that a man \nfrom Missouri, after very carefully listening to all the comments, all \nthe charges have been made about John Ashcroft?\n  I believe this is a case of religious persecution.\n  I have to conclude by saying what I started out by saying; that is, \nof all the people I have known and worked with in my entire life, I \nknow no one of greater character or more highly moral than John \nAshcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Stabenow pertaining to the introduction of S. 215 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, before I am recognized under the time \nallotted under the previous order, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order, Senator Allard be recognized for up \nto 15 minutes following the remarks of Senator Reed of Rhode Island and \nthat Senator Thomas be recognized for up to 15 minutes following the \nremarks of Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJohn Ashcroft to be our next U.S. Attorney General. For weeks now, the \nmedia, Members of this body, and the liberal left have conducted \nnothing more than a smear campaign against John Ashcroft.\n  For the past 2 years in the 106th Congress, I served with John \nAshcroft as a deputy whip, and I came to know him very well.\n  He is one of the most intelligent, fair, and compassionate men I have \never known. He is thoughtful and full of integrity and humility. He is \ngoing to make a fine Attorney General.\n  What is being done to John Ashcroft and his reputation is wrong and \ndespicable. Today I want to help set things straight about John \nAshcroft, and to separate the facts from the lies and distortions that \nare being carelessly tossed around about him and his record.\n  First of all, John Ashcroft is one of the most qualified nominees \never to be named to be Attorney General. He was twice elected to be \nMissouri's attorney general. He was twice elected to be Missouri's \nGovernor. And the people of Missouri elected him in 1994 to be one of \ntheir U.S. Senators.\n  None of our previous Attorneys General has had such broad popular \nsupport from the people who knew them best.\n  In each of these posts, John Ashcroft served with distinction, being \nhonored by his peers with leadership positions.\n  As Missouri's attorney general, John Ashcroft was elected president \nof the National Association of Attorneys General. In other words, the \nother 49 elected him to lead their group.\n  As Missouri's Governor, he was elected chairman of the National \nGovernors' Association. The same thing: 49 others elected him to lead \nthe Governors' organization.\n  Now many of the liberal special interests groups are trying to tar \nand feather him by attacking his long and distinguished record of \npublic service.\n  But facts are stubborn things, and the facts prove them wrong.\n  The liberals claim that John's views are out of the mainstream. Some \nare even resorting to name-calling and calling him a racist and an \nextremist.\n  It is hard to see how he could be such a demon and still be five \ntimes elected to statewide office.\n  If John Ashcroft's execution of these earlier public trusts was as \nfar ``out of the mainstream'' as his critics now claim, the people of \nMissouri would have ridden him out of town on a rail. His peers surely \nwould not have honored him for his achievements.\n  The fact of the matter is that John Ashcroft's views are in line with \nthose of most Missourians and most Americans.\n  If his ideas and beliefs are so far out of the mainstream, are John \nAshcroft's critics really saying that the majority of citizens in \nMissouri who elected him to these posts are extremists? Are his critics \nready to make this claim? I doubt it.\n  The rhetoric we have heard from these critics serves nothing more \nthan to fatten up the fundraising of the left and to scare people into \nvoting for liberals by continuing to try and label conservatives as \nmean-spirited.\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\n  We saw it with Robert Bork. We saw it with Clarence Thomas. Now we \nare seeing it with John Ashcroft.\n  It is just hot air, and I believe that the American people are going \nto reject these tactics and the politics of personal destruction.\n  Another one of the lies that is being told about John Ashcroft is \nthat he is a racist. His critics point to his opposition to Missouri \nJudge Ronnie White for a position as a Federal judge as proof.\n  But, again, let's ignore the rhetoric and look at the facts. When he \nwas Governor, John Ashcroft appointed the first black judge to one of \nMissouri's appellate courts. As a Senator, John Ashcroft voted to \nconfirm 26 black judges out of 28 nominated to the Federal bench.\n  He led the fight to save Lincoln University which was founded by \nblack soldiers. His wife, Janet, even teaches as a law professor at \nHoward University, one of our leading historically black colleges.\n  For his critics to now turn around and call John a racist is absurd \nand nothing more than dirty politics. When they're not calling John \nAshcroft a racist, the liberals sneer that he can't be trusted to \nenforce the law. They don't have any real proof, just a lot of strong \nwords. They say that John isn't fair-minded enough to enforce laws he \nmight not agree with.\n  But John did a fine job enforcing Missouri's laws when he was \nattorney general there. And I believe that after he lays his hand on \nthe Bible and swears to uphold the Constitution as our 68th Attorney \nGeneral that he will do a fine job for our Nation.\n  Eight years ago when Janet Reno was nominated to be Attorney General, \nno one made the ridiculous charge that she wouldn't uphold laws she \nmight not agree with.\n  No one can or should make the same claim about John Ashcroft.\n  John Ashcroft will enforce the law. He is a man of his word. He has \nan impeccable record of law enforcement. I know and I fully trust him \nto do the job which he will be sworn to do.\n  Let's face it. The real problem the critics on the left have is John \nAshcroft's stance on the issues and his conservative philosophy. But \nthey know they can't use this as a real reason to defeat his \nnomination, so they resort to calling him names and throwing mud at \nhim, hoping that some will stick. They drag out the process as long as \npossible and dig around in the dirt for any scraps they can find.\n  They smear his good name. They make up bogus charges. They even sink \nas low as to question his religious beliefs. It is very sad, but it \nwon't work.\n  The job of Attorney General is not to advocate policy. It is to \nenforce our laws. The question we have to ask about John Ashcroft is, \nwill he enforce those laws? His record says he will. He has repeatedly \nsaid he will. There is no evidence to say otherwise, just false charges \nand name-calling.\n  John Ashcroft is going to be confirmed, and I believe his critics and \nthe tactics they take will backfire.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for John Ashcroft. We \ncould not ask for a more qualified and fair-minded person for the job. \nJohn will make us all very proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island came to the \nfloor quickly. The Senator from Oklahoma has about a 4-minute statement \nhe would like to make on Christine Todd Whitman. Would the Senator from \nRhode Island allow him to proceed?\n  Mr. REED. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S691-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the assistant minority leader.\n  Certainly in having the discussion on the floor about Christine Todd \nWhitman and her nomination to be the director of the EPA--I have served \non the Environment and Public Works Committee since I have been in the \nSenate--I can say what a refreshing change it is going to be. I have \nwatched her record and things for which she stands. She is someone who \nreally believes in a commonsense approach to solving problems. She has \nexperience as Governor and has the desire for cost-effective programs \nand environmental beliefs. I am very pleased that she is going to take \non this job at a time when we really have serious problems.\n  For the last 8 years, we have not had a reliance upon science in the \npromulgation of our rules and regulations. We haven't had the cost-\nbenefit analyses that I think most people realize we should have. I \nthink there is a lot of work to be done.\n  I was very upset when we ended up with the so-called ``midnight \nregulations.'' I applaud President Bush for issuing a 60-day review of \nall of the Clinton administration's midnight regulations. For example, \none of the regulations was the final rule, the sulfur diesel rule which \nspent 2 weeks at the OMB instead of the customary 90 days. This is \nsomething that will have a direct effect on the cost of fuel, something \nwe were having hearings on, and we didn't need to rush into that. Or \nsome of the regulations having to do with putting 60 million acres out \nof reach so that they cannot be developed or have roads built on them.\n  Right now, we have a crisis in this country. Some States have a \ngreater crisis than we have. But certainly it is a crisis in terms of \nthe price of fuel and the availability of fuel. By putting this 60 \nmillion acres in the category that it is in, it would keep us from \ndeveloping about 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. That would be \nenough to run this country for a period of 1 year.\n  The EPA doesn't operate in a vacuum. Some of the things they have and \nthe rules they promulgate affect other departments. I happen to be \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. And I \ncan tell you right now that some of the EPA regulations on our training \ngrounds have caused us to be less than adequate in our training \nactivities. In fact, we have testimony from one of our commander \ntrainers that they spend more money on compliance of EPA rules and \nregulations than they do actually on training.\n  In terms of the energy supply, we can't just act as though all of \nthese new rules and regulations affecting our refiners don't have an \neffect on cost. They do have an effect on cost of gasoline that we burn \nin our cars. It is something that will have to be dealt with. Right \nnow, we are at 100 percent of refining capacity in this country. Any \nnew rules and regulations that would cause any of these refiners to \ndrop down directly impacts and increases the cost of fuel.\n  If I could single out one thing that I am really thankful for in \nChristine Todd Whitman taking on this position, it is that she has been \non the receiving end of abusive regulations. She has been the Governor \nof a State that had to comply with things without adequate time, \nwithout the resources, and I think it is time we had someone in that \nposition who has been on the receiving end of these regulations. I am \nsure Christine Todd Whitman will be one of the best directors we have \never had for the EPA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S691-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S691-S692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JOHN ASHCROFT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, after listening to the testimony given \nbefore the United States Senate Judiciary Committee and after much \nreflection, I decided to oppose the nomination of John Ashcroft as \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  This has been a difficult decision; one that I take very seriously. \nJust as the Constitution gives the President the unfettered right to \nsubmit nominees to the Senate, the Constitution requires the Senate to \ngive ``Advice and Consent'' on such nominations.\n  The Senate does not name a President's Cabinet, but it also does not \nmerely rubber stamp his choices. Senatorial consent must rest on a \ncareful review of a nominee's record and a thoughtful analysis of a \nnominee's\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nability to serve not just the President, but the American people.\n  Unlike other cabinet positions, the Attorney General has a very \nspecial role--decisively poised at the juncture between the executive \nbranch and the judicial branch. In addition to being a member of the \nPresident's Cabinet, the Attorney General is also an officer of the \nfederal courts and the chief enforcer of laws enacted by Congress.\n  He is in effect the people's lawyer, responsible for fully, fairly \nand vigorously enforcing our nation's laws and Constitution for the \ngood of all.\n  In addition to being intellectually gifted, legally skilled and of \nstrong moral character, I believe that the position of Attorney General \nrequires an outlook and temperament that will allow the American people \nto believe that he will champion their individual rights more than any \nparticular and potentially divisive dogma.\n  During the past several weeks, I have listened to John Ashcroft's \nwords in the context of his lifetime of public conduct. As a state \nattorney general, a governor and a United States Senator, he has \nestablished a pattern of activism that challenges important civil and \nindividual rights.\n  Instead of being a positive force for reconciling the races, as \nMissouri's Attorney General John Ashcroft conducted a futile struggle \nto frustrate the voluntary integration of public schools.\n  He fought a voluntary desegregation plan for the city of St. Louis, \nshowed defiance of the courts in those proceedings and used that highly \ncharged issue for political advantage instead of for constructive \naction.\n  Instead of accepting commonsense approaches to limiting the damage \ndone by guns in our society, he has rigidly worked against such \nsolutions--such simple solutions as asking that guns be sold with \nsafety locks\n  He also has aggressively worked to dismantle some of our country's \nmost basic legal tenets, such as the separation between church and \nstate.\n  On the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to the United States Federal \ncourt, he appears to have mischaracterized Judge White's record \nunfairly, and at the end of the process, raising issues that really did \nnot go to the merits of Judge White's nomination. This raises serious \nconcerns and questions about both his sense of fair play and his \nrespect for judicial independence.\n  In sum, although he claims he will enforce the letter of the law, I \nfear he will not recognize the true spirit of the law.\n  I believe he will use the considerable power of the Attorney General \nin directing resources, initiating lawsuits, and interpreting the law \nto clearly and consciously impose his views as he has done in the past.\n  His views are not the views of a vast majority of Americans, \nregardless of political affiliation.\n  Given the extremely divisive nature of the last election, and the \nnature of some of the voting irregularities, our nation needs an \nAttorney General who can lead us on critical civil rights issues, unite \nus in the pursuit of justice, and help heal some of these wounds.\n  I believe that John Ashcroft lacks the temperament needed to serve as \nAttorney General of the United States and I cannot support his \nnomination as our next Attorney General.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be dispensed with and that I may proceed for \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized without \nobjection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S692-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S692-S695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BUDGET PITFALLS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I had the privilege of coming \nto Congress in 1978 and being assigned as a freshman in January of 1979 \nto the House Budget Committee. In 1979, I never thought I would live to \nsee the day we would balance the budget, much less did I think I would \nlive to see the day that, in fact, we would get into a surplus \nsituation. Now, in this time of prosperity and budget surpluses, it is \nvery much incumbent upon us to be fiscally wise and fiscally \ndisciplined in how we use these budget surpluses so we do not go back \ninto the boom-and-bust cycles that we have experienced in the past.\n  Mr. President, 22 years ago as a freshman member of the House Budget \nCommittee--I am now a freshman member of the Senate Budget Committee--\nwe had an annual deficit somewhere in the range of about $20 billion to \n$24 billion. Then, as we moved into the decade of the 1980s, that \nannual deficit crept higher and higher and higher. Toward the end of \nthe decade of the 1980s, we exceeded $300 billion in annual deficit \nspending. That is not the kind of financial situation you want.\n  Indeed, we just had Mr. Greenspan before the Budget Committee and he \ncontinued the very severe lecture that he has given us for years, which \nis: Be very fiscally disciplined and wise, and don't return to that era \nof deficit spending.\n  I bring this up today--and this is, by the way, my maiden speech in \nthe Senate, so what a privilege for me to be here, what a privilege to \nrepresent such a dynamic State as the State of Florida--but I rise on \nthe occasion of my maiden speech to talk about the potential pitfalls \nthat could take us back into deficit spending. In these times of \nprosperity and budget surpluses, it is important for us to be very wise \nand fiscally conservative in making these choices--and we are going to \nmake some choices very soon.\n  One of the first choices we have to make is: Are we going to use all \nof the Social Security surplus and most of the Medicare trust fund \nsurplus to be applied to reducing the national debt? I can tell you the \npeople in Florida believe very firmly that we should use the surplus to \nreduce and ultimately pay off the national debt. I think most of us, \nalmost unanimously in this Chamber, would be dedicated to that \nparticular part of budgetary restraint. We have the surpluses. We need \nto do that.\n  The next question that is going to face us, then, is: What should be \nthe size of the tax cut?\n  I am going to argue and articulate about what my people have educated \nme, and that is to craft a Federal budget that will be balanced so we \ncan have a substantial tax cut and, at the same time, we can address a \nnumber of other very important needs facing this country, such as \nmodernizing Medicare, a 35-year-old system, to provide a guaranteed \nprescription drug benefit.\n  I will give another example: a substantial investment in education \nthat will help bring down class sizes and pay teachers more to give \nthem the respect they need in their profession and who ought to have \nthe very best to compete with the private sector, so that we have the \nvery best teaching for our children; an investment in education that \nwill also enable us to make the classrooms more safe and the schools \nsafe.\n  In addition to lowering class sizes, paying teachers more, and making \nthe schools safe, we should have our schools accountable for the \nproduct they produce. That is just another example.\n  Clearly, defense is another important priority: the new systems we \nare going to need, the research and development that will be needed. \nIndeed, what is one of the main reasons for having a National \nGovernment? It is to provide for the common defense, not even speaking \nabout the question of pay for our men and women in our armed forces.\n  I have only listed three, and there are many more. I mentioned \nprescription drugs, education, and defense, all being needs in which, \nover the next decade, this Government is going to have to invest more.\n  The question is: With the available surplus, after we subtract the \nSocial Security surplus and the Medicare trust fund surplus, with what \nis left, what is wise for us then to enact in a tax cut? Should it be \nthe tax cut that is proposed by the administration which, after one \nconsiders the interest cost and the alternative minimum tax, is going \nto be in the range of a $2.2 trillion tax cut over a decade? What that \nwould do is wipe out all of the available remaining surplus over the \nnext decade so there would not be anything left for prescription drugs, \neducation,\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\ndefense, strengthening Social Security, the environment, and I could go \non and on.\n  What I argue in my maiden speech in this august body, of which I am \nso privileged to be a part, is that we approach our budget with \nbalance, that we keep in mind primarily paying down the national debt \nwith the surplus, and that as we make choices, we make them wisely on a \nsubstantial tax cut, but a tax cut that leaves enough of the surplus \nleft to do these other things; plus one more thing, and that is, we \nneed a rainy day fund.\n  We do not know that these budget projections are going to pan out \nover the course of the next 10 years. We ought to have a cushion. We \nought to be conservative in our fiscal planning so that if those budget \nprojections do not turn out to be accurate, then we have a cushion to \nfall back on so we never get back into the situation we were in during \nthe decade of the eighties when, in 1981, we enacted a tax cut that was \nso large--and I voted for it; I admit I am gun shy on this because of \nthe lessons I learned--we had to undo it not once but three times, in \n1983, 1986, and again in 1990 when I had the privilege of serving in \nthe Congress.\n  I argue for balance, I argue for fiscal restraint, I argue for fiscal \ndiscipline, I argue for fiscal conservatism as we make these choices in \nthe budget that we will be adopting over the next several months.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Indeed, I yield with pleasure.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was sitting at my desk poring over my \nmail, watching for grammatical errors, errors in sentence construction, \nand, lo and behold, I heard this voice coming to me. I heard the voice \nsaying this was a maiden speech, so I just stopped everything, and I \nsaid to the other staff people in the office: That man says this is his \nmaiden speech. I am going to go up and listen to him.\n  This is a reminder to me of the old days when Senators gathered \naround close to hear a new Senator's maiden speech. The word would go \nout, and we came. We did not have the public address system. We \ngathered close by so that we could clearly understand the words that \nwere being spoken, and we looked the speaker eye in the eye and he \nlooked us eye in the eye.\n  This reminds me of those days when Senators gathered together to \nlisten to a new Senator. This Senator has greatly impressed me. He \nserves on the Budget Committee with me. We are both newcomers on that \ncommittee. I have had the chance to talk on very few occasions with \nSenator Nelson. I have been impressed by his straightforwardness, his \nhigh sense of purpose in service. He comes to us from Florida. My wife \nand I lived in Florida for 7 months during the last days of the war--\nthe Second World War, that is, not the Civil War.\n  I was a welder in the shipyard at the McClosky shipyard in Tampa. \nSpessard Holland was the Governor of the State of Florida. I later came \nto this body, and, lo and behold, here was Spessard Holland in this \nbody. I went right over there, about the second or third seat in the \nfront row, and I sat down and talked with Spessard Holland the day I \nwas sworn in. I said: Well, Governor, I lived in your State. I was a \nwelder down in your State while you were Governor. I am proud to be \nhere serving with you.\n  Spessard Holland was a very fine Senator. He was always courteous to \na fault and made up his own mind. I think this Senator from Florida \nwill be one who will make up his own mind. That is something we need to \nbe very careful of here. I do not count myself being in a particular \nideological group of Senators. I am an independent Senator--not an \nIndependent but an independent Democrat. Sometimes I differ with my \nother Democratic friends.\n  That is not the point here. I think we have a fine Senator in Senator \nNelson who will be his own man, who will make up his own mind. He will \nstudy things carefully, and he will try to reach a reasoned, balanced--\nI use his word ``balanced'' there--disciplined--he used that word, \ntoo--judgment. I am proud we have such a man coming into the Senate. I \npredict he will be a power in the Senate, and I consider myself very \nfortunate in having the opportunity to serve with Senator Nelson.\n  I was trying to think of a bit of poetry that I wanted to recall for \nthis particular occasion. But aside from that--I may get back to it \nlater--I like what the Senator said. He intends to weigh very carefully \nthis proposed tax cut which is in the nature of $1.6 trillion. That is \n$1,600 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. That is a good way \nto gauge the size of this tax cut: $1,600 for every 60 seconds since \nthe birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n  That is a lot of money, and I am going to weigh it very carefully \nwith him. Yes, we need to think carefully about education. We also must \nremember that the 7 percent contribution we make to the education \nbudgets in the States is not a great deal. And I am not sure how much \ngood what we contribute really does. Probably, we will never be really \nsure.\n  But education is at the local level. We need good teachers, teachers \nwho know the subjects, teachers who are dedicated. We need parents who \nwill back up the teachers. And we need students who want to learn.\n  I was fortunate, coming up in the Great Depression, to have good \nteachers. They didn't make much money, and many times they had to give \n20 to 25 percent of their check in order to get it cashed in the days \nof the Great Depression. But they were dedicated teachers.\n  I started out in a two-room schoolhouse; I am proud of it. I thank \nGod for it. I thank God for the fact that I came through the Great \nDepression. It left some very vivid memories with me.\n  I was born in 1917, and so my recollections of the Great Depression \nare as they were only of yesterday. I remember that little two-room \nschoolhouse at Algonquin in Mercer County. And I remember a little two-\nroom schoolhouse up on Nubbins Ridge where I attended. There were two \nteachers in that little school. One was a man; one was a lady. The man \nwalked, I expect, 4 miles every morning to school. He came from far \ndown the creek, and he came up, walked by my house, and I fell in line \nwhen he came by the house, and I walked on to school with him.\n  I learned in those days. My heroes were the great patriots of the \nAmerican Revolution. And they were men such as George Washington, \nBenjamin Franklin, Francis Marion, the ``Swamp Fox,'' Daniel Morgan, \nand men who lived during the formation of this Republic.\n  Now, I wanted to learn. And the man who raised me never told me he \nwould ever go up and whip the teacher if I came home with a bad report \ncard. He wouldn't go up. And if the teacher gave me a whipping--which \nhe didn't--I was told that I would get another one when I got home. And \nI knew that was the case.\n  I wanted to please the two old people who raised me. They were not my \nfather and mother, but I wanted to please them. I wanted to please the \nteacher, just to get a pat on the back, just to get a little pat on the \ntop of my head from the teacher.\n  I remember I took violin lessons beginning in the seventh grade. And \nat this particular school--it was in a coal mining camp--the principal \nwas a tough disciplinarian, the kind we need in our schools, if they \nwould let teachers discipline children. I don't think they will let \nthem do that anymore. Too bad.\n  But the principal's wife was a music teacher, and an excellent one. \nShe talked me into asking the people who raised me if they would buy a \nviolin for me so I could take music lessons. She thought I might grow \nup to be a violinist.\n\n  So I remember one Saturday night when we all piled into the back of a \nbig truck and went to Beckley 10 or 12 miles away. And there--I always \ncalled him my dad; he was the only dad I ever knew--he bought a violin \nand a case and a fiddle bow. Now I am talking about a fiddle, but it is \nall the same thing. But this whole kit and caboodle cost about $26 or \n$28. That was big money in a coal camp.\n  Anyhow, I went home that night carrying that fiddle case under my arm \nand with visions--old men dream dreams, and young men have visions--of \nmyself being a Fritz Chrysler or a great violinist. Well, I took \nlessons. And in this high school orchestra, I was the first violinist. \nIt so happens, I was the first violinist. I was the first one. I\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\ngot to the point where I thought I had all the lessons down pat, that I \ndidn't have to practice as hard anymore.\n  So one day I went to school, and the teacher had a little tryout. And \nlo and behold, she demoted me to the second chair. I went home a \ncrushed lad, crushed because I had been demoted. I liked that music \nteacher. In all my years of 83, I have lost I think four teeth. It was \non one of those occasions when I had an abscessed tooth that this music \nteacher said to her husband: Now, you take this boy to Sophia. That was \n3 miles away. This was in the wintertime. It was up a steep mountain. \nShe said: You take him up to the dentist. And he took me.\n  I was crushed that night because I had been demoted. But it was my \nfault. I got just a little too overly confident. So that night I \npracticed and I practiced and I practiced and I practiced; and the next \nday I recovered my first chair in that orchestra. Those are the kinds \nof teachers we had.\n  We can put all the money we want into education, but the teachers \nhave to be dedicated teachers. I had dedicated. They didn't make much \nmoney. As I say, they had to give a fourth or a fifth of it away in \norder to get a check cashed in the days of the Depression. But we can't \npay enough money to a good teacher. And it is very disappointing to me \nwhen I see athletes draw down millions of dollars every year. Of \ncourse, I admire good athletes, but I think this country has gone all \nwild over athletes, and it is standing its values on its head. A lot of \nthese athletes go out here and they commit crimes. They are not very \ngood models. Of course, there are people outside athletics who are not \ngood models, too. There have been a few in politics, especially in \nrecent years, perhaps not altogether recent years.\n  Look at some of the anchors on the TV from the networks. They are \ndrawing down $5 million, $6 million, $7 million, $8 million a year. \nThey aren't worth it. They aren't worth it.\n  But we need to stimulate a love and a search for excellence in this \ncountry. Most of that can be done, most of the stimulation of that, the \nmotivation of that; some of it will come from within; some of it starts \nin here. But it also comes from a good teacher, a good parent, who sets \nthe example for that young person and encourages them to study, and \nstudy, and make something out of themselves--to use the words of my own \npeople who raised me, try to make something out of themselves, try to \ncontinue learning.\n  I try to continue learning. I am always trying to learn. Solon, one \nof the seven wise men of Greece, said: ``I grow old in the pursuit of \nlearning.''\n  We can pour out all the money from the Treasury, but it can be poured \ndown a rat hole. The motivation has to be there. The good teacher has \nto be there. We ought to pay those good teachers. After all, they are \ndealing with our most precious resource. They ought to be paid well. \nBut they ought to be held accountable for the work they do. And the \nparents, as I say, ought to strive to stimulate in the child a \nmotivation, a desire to learn, learn, learn.\n  I have gone a long way in my desultory ramblings here, but this \nmatter of education is one that is overly, overly, overly important. As \nI often say to young people, no ball game ever changed the course of \nhistory, not one. And when you have seen one, you have seen them all. \nWhen you have seen one ball game, you have seen them all.\n  I can play every position on the team. I can go through all the \nmotions. I don't say this now in derogation of athletics. I don't do \nthat at all. But we have our values standing on their heads. We have a \njob to do. We do need to think about education, as we think about the \nso-called surpluses. These surpluses, I have seen them on paper. I \nhaven't seen one yet that really glitters because we don't have them in \nhand, and we may never have them in hand. If we go for this big tax \ncut, $1.6 trillion, once we write that law and the President signs it, \nthat money goes out. It is gone. The surpluses won't be in hand, if \never, for some years. It will take a while. So we need to proceed with \ngreat caution.\n  I hope the Senator will forgive me for imposing on his time. I felt \nso proud to see Senator Nelson come to the floor. I have lived more \nthan 83 years. I have been fooled by a few people in my lifetime.\n  My mom used to keep boarders, and I would go to her when we had a new \nboarder, and I would say: Mom, that man is going to cheat you out of \nyour board payment.\n  I didn't do that often, but I think I was about right in every one I \nselected. That man will cheat you out of your board bill; there is \nsomething about him.\n  I think there is something about this man. In any case, he is going \nto be a good Senator, a hard-working one. I am proud to listen to him \nin his maiden speech, and I am delighted to work with him. I thank him \nfor what he has said today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I also appreciate having had the opportunity to listen to \nthe Senator from Florida. We served in the House together. He is just \nas good as the Senator from West Virginia expects him to be.\n  It is a rare occasion that we have on the Senate floor two doctors: \nthe doctor from Colorado and the Presiding Officer who is a doctor. \nThey are both doctors of veterinary medicine. I think we should \nrecognize the fact that they are and recognize that their talents are \nfar beyond their medical training. It is unusual to have two doctors on \nthe floor at the same time.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Colorado and recognize that my \nfriend, the Presiding Officer, is also a doctor of veterinary medicine.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield to me briefly?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am glad to yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did not know that Senator Allard was a doctor. He has \ngone up in stature with me since I have learned that. I have a little \ndog, a little Maltese dog, Billy Byrd. He is approaching his 14th \nbirthday. If I ever saw in this world anything that was made by the \nCreator's hand that is more dedicated, more true, more undeviant, more \nfaithful than this little dog, I am at a loss to state what it is. I \ntake my hat off. My wife and I pay some pretty high bills to some of \nthese veterinarians, but we gladly pay them. We love that little dog. I \ntake my hat off. I wish I could say that I had been a veterinarian. It \nmust be a joy to work with animals, especially with dogs. I believe it \nwas Truman who said: If you want a friend in Washington, buy a dog. \nWell, I have a friend in McLean, and I take my hat off to the \nveterinarians, the two of them, the one in the Chair as well. I am glad \nwe have two here. I did not know this about Senator Allard. I have \nserved with him a while. I am pleased to hear this.\n\n  Thank you for the services you perform on creatures that make us \nhappy and that show us God's love and show us how to be honest and true \nand faithful and guileless.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, as well as the \nSenator from Nevada, and in a moment I will recognize the Senator from \nFlorida to comment, too.\n  I want to invite all of you to join the veterinary caucus with all \nthe favorable comments we are getting here. Before I yield to the \nSenator from Florida, I want to respond that Senator Gregg has a dog by \nthe name of Wags, and Wags comes down the hallway and frequently comes \ninto my office to say hello. We visit with him a little bit. If your \ndog is ever visiting you in your office, bring him down. We love dogs \nand would like to have an opportunity to get to know Senator Byrd's \ndog.\n  I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding \nfor me to make the comment that it is not only a great privilege to \nserve here and to represent my State, but it is doubly a pleasure to \nserve with the quality of Members of this body as exemplified by the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia. He is someone I have naturally \ngravitated to in these first few weeks as someone from whom I can learn \na lot. Of course, I knew of his tremendous talents as one of the best \norators who has ever been produced in the Senate. His reputation \nprecedes him as one of the best fiddlers the Nation has ever produced, \nand now I am delighted to\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nknow how he got started as an expert fiddler by virtue of the story he \ntold us of receiving the gift of a violin as a child.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments, and I thank the Senator for \nyielding.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would also like to join with the Senator in commending \nSenator Byrd for his distinguished service in the Senate. We all \nrespect him. Whether we agree with him or not, he is one of the more \nhonorable Members here, somebody I appreciate. He has joined on the \nBudget Committee; I am new on the Budget Committee. I am looking \nforward to visiting with him about those issues as they come up before \nthe Budget Committee. I think it is going to be a challenging year, and \nit is an important committee. It is an important start for the \nCongress.\n  Hopefully, we will get some legislation quickly reported out of \nthere, as we get the process moving forward.\n  Again, I am glad we have all these animal lovers here in the Senate. \nI talked to Senator Ensign, who is in the Chair, about facetiously \nsetting up a veterinary caucus. With all these comments, I begin to \ntake it more seriously. We would like to perhaps extend an invitation \nto all the dog lovers here in the Senate, to see if they would like to \njoin us.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S695-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S695-S701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JOHN ASHCROFT\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to lend \nmy support to President Bush's nomination of John Ashcroft to be the \nnext United States Attorney General. He is another individual in the \nSenate whom I have always viewed as quite honorable.\n  It is the constitutional right and duty of each President to appoint \nCabinet Members who will help serve the citizens of this great country \nduring their tenure. I believe President Bush has made a wise choice in \nJohn Ashcroft as a member of his Cabinet.\n  John Ashcroft is a man of great honor and high personal integrity. He \nwill bring these much needed characteristics to the office of the U.S. \nAttorney General. I have no doubt about that. He has had a long and \ndistinguished career serving the people of Missouri and the people of \nthe United States. I am confident he has the experience to fulfill the \nduties of this position.\n  Those who defended President Clinton to the death are now attacking \none of the most honorable individuals of the Senate as less than \nhonorable. This was most evident by Senator Ashcroft's gracious \nconcession to his opponent in his Senate race in Missouri.\n  John Ashcroft served as Missouri's attorney general from 1976 to \n1985, where he worked tirelessly to enforce Missouri State laws and \nchaired the National Association of Attorneys General; having been \nsupported in that position, I might add, by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. After serving his home State as their top law enforcement \nagent, he was elected as Missouri's 50th Governor in 1984. He was \nreelected in 1988 to a second term, where he received 64 percent of the \nvote.\n  It was during his second term that he was recognized as a leader \namong his colleagues and was named chairman of the National Governors' \nAssociation. Again, he was supported by both Democrats and Republicans.\n  In 1994, John Ashcroft was elected by the people of Missouri, this \ntime to serve his State in the U.S. Senate. While serving in the \nSenate, Senator John Ashcroft was a member of the Judiciary Committee \nas well as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution. \nHis record has shown a strong commitment to upholding the Constitution \nand the rule of law equally and fairly.\n  Throughout this grueling nomination process, Members on the other \nside of the aisle have questioned John Ashcroft and, in some cases, \neven accused him of allowing race to affect his decision on judicial \nnominees.\n  There is absolutely no evidence that backs up these absurd \nallegations.\n  Let me remind Members of this body that as a United States Senator \nJohn Ashcroft supported 26 of 28 African American Judicial nominees \nsent to the Senate for confirmation by the President.\n  As the Governor of Missouri, John Ashcroft nominated eight African \nAmerican judges, including the first ever to the court of appeals in \nthe state. He appointed three African American members to his cabinet \nwhile he was the chief executive of the state of Missouri. He supported \nand signed into law Missouri's Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. He \nsupported and signed the law that established Scott Joplin's house as \nthe first and only historic site honoring an African American citizen. \nHe led the fight to save independent Lincoln University, founded by \nAfrican American soldiers.\n  He established an award, emphasizing academic excellence, in the name \nof George Washington Carver. I believe John Ashcroft wants equal \nopportunity extended to all.\n  Over the last few weeks we have heard from a number of people who \nhave questioned the nomination of John Ashcroft. I would like to take a \nfew moments to mention some of the groups who have endorsed the nominee \nfor Attorney General:\n  National District Attorney's Association, Fraternal Order of Police, \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, Law Enforcement Alliance \nof America, National Sheriffs Association, Missouri Police Chiefs of \nPolice, National Victims Constitutional Amendment Network, Victims of \nCrime United, Citizens for Law and Order, Justice for Homicide Victims, \nJustice for Murder Victims, National Organization of Parents of \nMurdered Children, National Association of Manufacturers, United States \nof Commerce, Associated Builders and Contractors, American Farm Bureau \nFederation, and the American Insurance Association.\n  I could go on and on and continue to name a total of some 263 groups \nthat have voiced their support for John Ashcroft to be the next \nAttorney General.\n  John Ashcroft is clearly qualified for the job of U.S. Attorney \nGeneral.\n  He understands what is expected of the office. During his hearings he \nsummed up his duties in one statement:\n\n       My responsibility is to uphold the acts of the legislative \n     branch of this government and I would do so and continue to \n     do so in regard to the cases that now exist and further \n     enactments of the Congress.\n\n  John Ashcroft is a man of unquestionably high character and morals \nwho has the knowledge and experience to serve our Nation with justice \nand excellence as our Nation's next Attorney General.\n  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to take just 1 minute to say a \nword of commendation for my colleague, John Ashcroft. As the Judiciary \nCommittee, at this very hour, prepares to meet for a vote on his \nconfirmation, I say that this man of honor and integrity has gone \nthrough an unprecedented ordeal in his desire to serve this country as \nAttorney General.\n  I cannot imagine any person who comes to that position with greater \nqualifications or a greater sense of integrity. I do not believe my \ncolleagues on either side of the aisle would question this man's \ncommitment nor his faith. In fact, I suggest no one would argue but \nthat he is the man of deepest faith in this body, and yet that very \nfaith commitment has been turned on its head to make it an issue \nagainst his confirmation. I find that astounding and very \ndisappointing.\n  The fact that people would ask, can John Ashcroft enforce the laws \nbecause of his religion and his faith--John had the best answer to it \nwhen he said before the Judiciary Committee: I will enforce the laws of \nthis land because of my faith. As someone who shares much of the same \nfaith as John Ashcroft, I can relate to and understand exactly what \nJohn is saying.\n  Though he may hold deep convictions--and he may or may not agree with \nall the laws of this land--it is because of his deep faith that he \nknows he must enforce the laws of this land--and will.\n  Who in this body would question his sincerity or his honesty? And as \nhe stood before the Judiciary Committee, and sat before that Judiciary \nCommittee, and took that oath to tell the\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\ntruth, and said he would enforce the laws of this land--whether he \nagreed with them or not--who would we be and which of my colleagues \nwould dare question his sincerity or his honesty?\n  It was interesting to me, as you look back historically at how we \nhave previously confirmed Democrat nominees for the Cabinet, \noverwhelming votes, without filibusters, and without delay, here is a \nquote about the nomination process worth repeating:\n\n       We must always take our advice and consent responsibilities \n     seriously because they are among the most sacred. But, I \n     think most senators will agree that the standard we apply in \n     the case of executive branch appointments is not as stringent \n     as that for judicial nominees. The president should get to \n     pick his own team. Unless the nominee is incompetent or some \n     other major ethical or investigative problem arises in the \n     course of our carrying out our duties, then the president \n     gets the benefit of the doubt.\n\n  That statement was made by Senator Leahy. He laid down the right \nstandard. He is right. The President should be able to pick his own \nteam. I hope my colleagues recognize that and will support the \nconfirmation of our distinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator John \nAshcroft.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about the \nnomination of Senator John Ashcroft to serve as Attorney General. I \nwant to be very clear. I did not seek this debate. I think it is \nunfortunate that this new Senate has to address such a difficult and \ncontentious nomination that opens up old history and old wounds and old \ndebates, rather than moving forward on issues that unite our country.\n  I do not relish the role of opposing a new President's nominee for \nAttorney General. In fact, quite to the contrary. I believe a new \nPresident should be able to fill his Cabinet with the people he wants. \nUnfortunately, this is not something over which I have control. \nPresident Bush picked Senator Ashcroft and in doing so he brought this \nconflict upon himself and he must accept responsibility for that \ndecision.\n  Senator Ashcroft, too, must accept responsibility for his actions, \nespecially those that have raised doubts about his ability to serve as \nAttorney General. I did not seek this conflict, but under the U.S. \nConstitution the Senate is called upon to provide advice and consent on \nCabinet appointments, and I take that responsibility seriously.\n  I do want to point out that I and all of my colleagues took great \ncare to treat John Ashcroft carefully. In fact, throughout the debate \nover Senator John Ashcroft's nomination I have said that I would only \nmake a decision after Senator Ashcroft had a full and fair hearing. \nThat is what fairness requires.\n  Senator Ashcroft had an opportunity to respond to questions before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. I reviewed the testimony thoroughly and \nthen I reached my decision. I want to share with my colleagues and the \npeople I represent how I reached the conclusion that Senator Ashcroft \nshould not serve as Attorney General.\n  First, I considered the unique responsibility and trust placed in an \nAttorney General. Far more than any other Cabinet officer, the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States has the power to affect the rights and the \nlives of all Americans. For that reason, this nominee must be chosen \nwith great care.\n  I can tell you I spent many days and several long nights thinking \nabout qualities I would want to see in an Attorney General. In addition \nto being honest and independent, that person must actively enforce the \nlaws and ensure the public's confidence in our legal system. The \nAttorney General must also display the highest standards of fairness, \ntrust, and respect for the law. I developed those standards and then I \nlooked at Senator Ashcroft's statements in the Record.\n  As I have looked at the facts, it seems clear that, in his hearing, \nhe obscured his record and did not prove to me that he is qualified to \nbe Attorney General.\n  As I said, I have taken great care to ensure that John Ashcroft had a \nfair opportunity to respond to the questions raised about his \nnomination. Unfortunately, Senator Ashcroft did not extend that same \nstandard of fairness to Judge Ronnie White, and fairness is one of the \ncritical qualities needed in an Attorney General.\n  In the case of Ronnie White, Senator Ashcroft leveled serious charges \nagainst a respected jurist. Through Senator Ashcroft's timing and \nmaneuvering, Judge White was never asked about those charges. Judge \nWhite was never even given an opportunity to defend himself, and that \nis fundamentally unfair.\n\n  In any Senator, such behavior is inappropriate and regrettable. In an \nAttorney General, such behavior can be dangerous.\n  Unfortunately, Ronnie White was not the only nominee that Senator \nAshcroft, in his long tenure, has treated questionably. Senator \nAshcroft's treatment of Ambassador James Hormel is also very troubling \nto me. At the time Senator Ashcroft said he opposed Mr. Hormel's \nselection to be Ambassador to Luxembourg because he actively promoted \nthe gay lifestyle. More recently, however, we heard a different answer \nfrom John Ashcroft. He told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he \nvoted against Mr. Hormel because he knew him personally. But Mr. Hormel \nhas said that he never met Senator Ashcroft, and, further, that Senator \nAshcroft had refused to even meet with him. In fact, John Ashcroft \nwould not even attend the nomination hearing in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee of which he was a member. His treatment of Mr. Hormel, and \nhis varying and contradicted claims about the reason for his decision, \ngive me great pause.\n  It would be easy to give Senator Ashcroft the benefit of the doubt if \nthis were an isolated incident, but in addition to Ronnie White and \nJames Hormel, Senator Ashcroft also treated Bill Lann Lee unfairly. As \nmy colleagues will recall, Bill Lann Lee was nominated to be head of \nthe Justice Department Civil Rights Division. In opposing Lee, Ashcroft \nsaid Lee had an intensity that belongs to advocacy, not the balance \nthat belongs to administration.\n  It seems to me that Senator Ashcroft would not even pass his own \ntest. Senator Ashcroft's treatment of Judge White, Ambassador James \nHormel, Bill Lann Lee, and others does not show the level of fairness \nthat an Attorney General must display. This is not how the U.S. \nattorney general should treat people.\n  Let me turn to the second standard I considered--trust. The Attorney \nGeneral must be someone the American people can trust to vigorously \nprotect their rights.\n  Citizens of this country should feel comfortable that the highest law \nenforcement officer of the land will ensure their basic liberties. \nUnfortunately, for far too many Americans, Senator Ashcroft's record \ncreates fear, not trust. His appointment sends the wrong message to \nAmericans who already face discrimination and unfair treatment in their \ndaily lives.\n  Next I want to turn to integrity because Senator Ashcroft is often \nsaid to be a man of integrity, and I do not challenge his integrity, \nbut I do ask this: If he is true to his beliefs, how can he vigorously \nenforce the laws he has vehemently opposed and sought to overturn \nthroughout his public service?\n  His past history shows he does not believe in and has fought against \nthe laws that strengthen gun safety, protect a woman's right to choose, \nand civil rights. I can only assume that a man who prides himself on \nhis integrity would continue to advocate those views.\n  John Ashcroft is a man of uncommonly strong beliefs. Based on what I \nknow of Senator Ashcroft, he has not convinced me that he can set aside \nthose beliefs to execute fully the laws with which he disagrees.\n  I also considered Senator Ashcroft's willingness to enforce the law, \nespecially those with which he disagreed. Because we are a nation of \nlaws, the Attorney General must actively enforce our laws. This is an \narea where Senator Ashcroft has an extensive record.\n  Unfortunately, as Missouri's attorney general, John Ashcroft was \nselective in his application of the law. Often\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\nhe acted outside the scope of his office. For example, Senator Ashcroft \nrefused several court orders to implement desegregation of public \nschools in St. Louis. In fact, one judge said of Senator Ashcroft's \nefforts representing Missouri:\n\n       The State has, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to \n     defy the authority of this court.\n\n  The St. Louis desegregation case is the most troubling example of \nSenator Ashcroft's refusal to enforce the laws with which he disagreed.\n  Senator Ashcroft has also failed to convince me that he would \nactively enforce the laws that protect a woman's right to choose.\n  Finally, the Attorney General must be someone to whom all Americans \ncan look as their advocate. President Bush has said he wants to unite \nour country, not divide it. This nomination, more than any I have ever \nseen, has divided our country and left many Americans wondering if \ntheir rights will be protected in the Bush administration.\n  I have received literally thousands of calls from a wide variety of \ncitizens in my State asking me to oppose Senator Ashcroft's nomination, \nand they are not just saying oppose Ashcroft and hanging up. These are \npeople who are telling me they have been following the debate and are \nreally concerned that their rights will not be protected if John \nAshcroft becomes Attorney General.\n  I want to say one more thing about the high level of public comment \nwe have heard in recent weeks. Some claim that interest groups are to \nblame for John Ashcroft's problems. I disagree. No interest group made \nJohn Ashcroft mistreat Ronnie White or James Hormel or Bill Lann Lee. \nJohn Ashcroft did that himself, and he has to accept responsibility for \nhis actions.\n  Those are the factors I considered: fairness, trust, ability to \nenforce the law, and ability to represent all Americans and to \nsafeguard their rights.\n  I asked myself: Is John Ashcroft someone whom all Americans can trust \nto treat them fairly and to protect their rights? I have concluded he \nis not.\n  I will vote against John Ashcroft because he has not shown the \nfairness, the trust, or the respect of the law required in America's \nhighest law enforcement officer.\n  Given the likelihood of his confirmation, I hope that John Ashcroft's \nactions in office will prove me wrong. Either way, I will hold \nPresident Bush accountable for his decision.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, President Bush's Cabinet nominees are \nthe finest group of Cabinet nominees I believe we have seen in the last \n100 years. They are extraordinary men and women of accomplishment and \nachievement. They are grownups. They are people who have a proven \nrecord of achievement, and I am proud of them.\n  John Ashcroft is a quality nominee. He is 59 years old. He served \ntwice as attorney general of Missouri, twice as Governor, and he was \nelected to the Senate. He was five times elected to public office in \nthe State of Missouri, a heartland State, a State that is always a \nbellwether for who will win the Presidency.\n  This is not a man who is an extremist. This is one of the finest, \nmost decent men I have ever known. This is a man who tells the truth to \na degree unusual in this Capital, and to have John Ashcroft accused of \nnot telling the truth by the very same people who on this floor \ndefended the former President of the United States, Bill Clinton, for \nbald-faced misrepresentations and lies he has finally admitted to \nmaking is stunning.\n  John Ashcroft is not that kind of person. John Ashcroft is a better \nperson than that. He tells the truth. He does what is right. I have \nseen that aspect of his character exhibited time and time again on this \nfloor. He is one of the most principled and decent Senators I have ever \nknown.\n  As I told some friends of mine back home, I have not met a finer \nperson in my church, in my State, or in Washington than John Ashcroft.\n  It is really disturbing to me to have Members of this body be \nencouraged and pushed by a group of hard-left activists to make \nstatements that are demonstrably untrue. This is especially true when \nthe people parroting these irresponsible statements were not present to \nobserve the hearings that we had on this nomination. In fact, some who \nhave announced their intentions to vote against John Ashcroft did not \neven wait for the Judiciary Committee hearings to begin before making \ntheir rush to judgment.\n  I am a member of the Judiciary Committee, and I was there when we had \nthe hearings concerning this nomination. The committee gave everybody \ntheir say. We had representatives of Planned Parenthood, who oppose \nvirtually any kind of control on abortion. We had representatives of \nthe National Abortion Rights Action League as well. We also had a \nrepresentative from Handgun Control who admitted to me that his \norganization never criticized the Clinton administration when they \nallowed prosecutions of gun crimes to drop 46 percent over the past \neight years.\n  He never criticized the Clinton administration, not even one single \ntime. Yet he has no problem launching attacks on Republicans who would \nnot agree to support more and more regulation of innocent law-abiding \ncitizens who want to possess guns. That is what the gun debate had \nbecome. Whatever bill you agree to pass, these groups want to put \nsomething more extreme out there so that it implicates the second \namendment to a degree that is arguably unconstitutional, thereby giving \nthem ammunition with which to attack the person who will not vote for \nit.\n  They never criticized the Clinton administration for not prosecuting \ngun cases even though Attorney General Reno allowed prosecutions to \nplummet 46 percent over the past eight years. Why was this group \nsilent? If their agenda is truly one of concern about the criminal \nmisuse of firearms, why were they willing to turn a blind eye to the \nDemocratic administrations lax enforcement efforts?\n  The truth is that many of these activist groups are fundamentally \narms of the Democratic National Committee, and they are leaders of the \nhard left in America. They think they can come in and dictate to the \nPresident of the United States that he cannot appoint a decent, \nexceptionally skilled, and fine individual as Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  John Ashcroft went to Yale. He graduated from the University of \nChicago Law School.\n  He is a scholar. I have heard him make speeches that are \nextraordinarily fine in their analytical thought. He follows his \nprinciples to a degree that I think is unsurpassed here. So it is \nreally surprising to me to hear these complaints raised about him.\n  Let's talk about one matter his opponents keep raising. I would like \nto stand here all night debunking the myths that the far left has \nattempted to construct, but for the moment I am just going to talk \nabout a couple of them tonight. The Ronnie White matter is one of the \nfirst myths that the hard left is perpetuating.\n  Let's look at the facts. John Ashcroft voted for every single African \nAmerican judicial nominee who came up for a vote on this floor except \nRonnie White--26 out of 27. Ronnie White was opposed not only from his \nhome State of Missouri by John Ashcroft, he was also opposed by Kit \nBond, the senior Senator from Missouri. Both of the home State Senators \nopposed this nominee. Was this some sort of an extremist position? I \nmean, confirmation is a fact and we need to deal with the cases that \ncome before us.\n  John made a speech on this floor indicating his opposition to that \nnomination. He voted against it in committee. I think it came up in \ncommittee on two different occasions and on both occasions he voted \nagainst it and expressed his opposition to the nominee. But, to his \ncredit, he did let the nominee come to the floor for a final vote. He \nagreed to allow that to happen.\n  So now he has been accused of intentionally mistreating Ronnie White \nbecause he allowed the full Senate to consider the nomination, rather \nthan attempting to quietly defeat the nomination in committee. Let me \ntell you, if you hold a nominee in committee--and I suppose Senator \nBond and Senator Ashcroft could have kept that nominee in committee--\nthe left would\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\nhave been attacking him now for not letting the White nomination come \nto a vote. I am telling you, that is what he would be accused of. I \nhave been here on the floor, and I have seen that.\n  John made a speech delineating some of the reasons--which I am going \nto mention in a moment--that he opposed him. And 54 of the 100 Senators \nin this body voted no.\n  How is that an extreme matter? Why would they vote no? There were \nseveral reasons. Out of the 114 sheriffs in Missouri, 77 of them wrote \nin opposition to the White nomination. Incidentally, many of these \nsheriffs are Democrats. Additionally, the Mercer County District \nAttorney wrote a letter to John Ashcroft stating:\n\n       Judge White's record is unmistakably anti-law enforcement, \n     and we believe his nomination should be defeated. His rulings \n     and dissenting opinions on capital cases and on fourth \n     amendment issues should be disqualifying factors when \n     considering his nomination.\n\n  You have heard another far left myth if you listened to the debate to \ndate in that some opponents of John Ashcroft's nomination claim that \nJohn Ashcroft's members of the Supreme Court voted to dissent on \ncriminal cases more frequently than Judge White. That is a very \ninaccurate statement. Let me tell you why. It is because apples are \nbeing compared to oranges. While the Ashcroft judge Mr. White replaced \ndid vote against the imposition of the death penalty in a number of \ncases that Ashcroft nominee was voting on a series of cases that were \nnot the same cases Judge White was ruling on when he was on the Supreme \nCourt. He was ruling on a different group, with different facts and \ndifferent legal questions involved. It is apples and oranges.\n\n  In order to place Judge White's death penalty dissents in proper \nperspective, it is necessary to compare Judge White's rulings to all \nthe members of the court during the time Judge White sat on the court. \nWhen apples are compared to apples, it is clear that Judge White \ndissented four times more frequently than any other judge on that \ncourt.\n  That is a record that should be examined. That is a cause of concern. \nSome of Judge White's opinions that I have read cause me great concern \nbecause I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years, and an attorney \ngeneral for 2. I know some of the issues that come up with judges. I \nhave spent by far the largest portion of my career in Federal court \nbefore Federal judges.\n  You have to understand something about Federal judges. They are \nappointed for life. They have absolute power in many instances in a \ntrial, power that is unreviewable by any court. The most dramatic of \nthese powers is the ability to grant a judgment of acquittal at the end \nof the prosecution's case.\n  For example, if you present a case against a defendant for murder, or \nsome other fraud or crime, and the prosecution stands up at the end of \nits case and says, ``The prosecution rests,'' immediately now, these \ndays, no matter what the evidence, the defense lawyer will stand up and \nmake a motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  Usually they are denied. Usually these motions are just hot air. They \nare just saying stuff for the record, frankly. Most prosecutors bring \ngood, strong cases. So defense attorneys as a matter of routine move \nfor a judgment of acquittal. If the judge grants that judgment of \nacquittal, it is the same as if a jury had acquitted that defendant. \nJeopardy attaches. Under the Constitution of the United States, you \ncannot twice be held in jeopardy under the law. That defendant is \nacquitted, and he can never be tried again, no matter how guilty he or \nshe may have been of the offenses charged.\n  So a Federal judge with a lifetime appointment in many ways is much \nmore problematic for the system than one member of a seven-member \nsupreme court. John Ashcroft, as a former State attorney general, \nunderstood that.\n  Federal judges also routinely overrule the entire criminal justice \nsystem of a State. You may say that is not routine. I suggest to you it \nis very frequent, and they are often asked to do so.\n  For example, if a case is appealed all the way to the Missouri \nSupreme Court, and the Missouri Supreme Court rules, then the defendant \ncan file post-conviction relief in Federal court and ask the Federal \ncourt to review the State case to see if the Federal Constitution has \nbeen implicated and violated in some way that the defendant was tried.\n  So if you have a Federal judge on the bench who wants to let \ncriminals go or is undisciplined in the responsibilities of his office \nin applying the law, or has demonstrated a bias against law enforcement \nofficers, you can have a real problem.\n  In Alabama, people knew who the judges were who were always letting \ncriminals go. It was not a secret. I am telling you, if you have a \nnominee come up from my State for a lifetime Federal judgeship, I am \ngoing to ensure--because I was an attorney general also--that they are \ngoing to give law enforcement a fair day in court, too. They are going \ngive the prosecutor a fair chance to put on his or her case.\n  That is the way John Ashcroft felt about it. So imagine his concern \nwhen he realized that he had prosecutors in his State opposing the \nWhite nomination. He had a majority of the sheriffs in his state oppose \nthis judge. He even received written opposition from national law \nenforcement organizations, such as the National Sheriffs Association, \nthat wrote in and opposed this judicial nomination.\n\n  So, keeping these facts in mind, John looked at the record, and \nthoroughly examined a number of the opinions Judge White had issued \nwhich concerned these groups. And what he discovered, as he expressed \nin his floor speech at the time of the vote, is that Judge White had \nmade a series of ``procriminal rulings''. The far left analyzes this as \nsome sort of unwarranted attack upon Judge White's character, but it \nwas not. It was simply a description of the opinions involved.\n  This is clear if one bothers to read the statement John made here on \nthis floor. He was referring to his opinions. You can call them liberal \nopinions; you can call them bleeding heart opinions; you can call them \nanti-law-enforcement opinions. You can call them whatever you want to \ncharacterize them. But it is not disqualifying, in my opinion, to be \nAttorney General if you refer to a justice's opinions as procriminal \nwhen they continually rule in favor of criminal defendants.\n  One of the cases that caused the greatest disturbance was the Johnson \ncase. In this case the defendant, Mr. Johnson, was involved in a \ndomestic disturbance. The call went out to the sheriff's department. As \nso often happens, sheriff's deputies go out to those houses in response \nto a domestic call. These missions are considered to be perhaps the \nmost risky and dangerous thing they do. In this case a deputy knocked \non the door, and Johnson appears with a gun. As the deputy tried to get \naway, Johnson shot him in the back. The deputy fell to the ground, and \nJohnson walks over and puts a bullet through his forehead, execution \nstyle.\n  That is not enough to satisfy Johnson's blood lust, however. What \ndoes he do next? After murdering, in cold blood, a deputy doing his \nduty, Johnson goes out and tries to track down the sheriff. The sheriff \nisn't home. But the sheriff's wife is in the home, having a social \ngathering there--and with her own children about--and he shoots the \nwife five times through the window, killing her.\n  Then Johnson continues his rampage by tracking down two other deputy \nsheriffs and killing them.\n  This is one of the most horrible crimes I have seen.\n  At his trial, Johnson's defense lawyers suggest that because he \nserved in Vietnam, the murders were the result of posttraumatic stress \nsyndrome. The trial had all kinds of expert testimony and things of \nthat nature to deal with this issue.\n  The defendant was caught, surrounded in a building, and surrendered. \nHe made a detailed confession. I would say, as a prosecutor, it was a \npowerful demonstration of guilt beyond virtually any doubt that this \ndefendant committed this crime.\n  The defense tried to say this guy thought he was in Vietnam. These \nwere good defense lawyers, they had been award-winning criminal defense \nlawyers. All of them were highly skilled. So, on behalf of their client \nthey claimed he had posttraumatic stress\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nsyndrome. In light of the overwhelming evidence what else could they \ndo? The murders were plain and simple. During the course of the trial, \nthese lawyers made some representations that were not factually \naccurate, but which were not sufficiently egregious for the majority of \nthe Missouri Supreme Court to find any error in their actions.\n  But Judge White felt differently. He concluded that the defense \nattorneys were incompetent, and that Johnson didn't get a fair trial. \nHe also suggested that he wanted to apply an insanity theory that was \ndifferent from established Missouri law. In fact, what White said was \nthat if Johnson didn't meet the legal definition of insanity, he had \nsomething ``akin to madness.''\n  Two of the most significant criminal justice issues in America are \nthe question of insanity and incompetent counsel. That is true because \nso many cases in our criminal justice system are like this case--the \nguilt is clear and overwhelming. So when they go and appoint a paid \nState attorney, a court-appointed attorney--by the way, in this case \nthese attorneys were retained counsel, hired by this defendant or his \nfamily; he hired them; he wanted good attorneys--normally, the appeal \ngoes forward dutifully after conviction because that is what a lawyer \nis expected to do. The State will pay for it. So they make an appeal \nand raise these issues on appeal.\n  When the guilt is overwhelming and the defendant did something \nviolent such as this, what are the two issues you can raise? \nIneffective assistance of counsel and insanity. And in this one \nopinion, Judge White showed clearly that he lacked judicial discipline. \nHe lacked a comprehensive and clear understanding of the importance of \na judge maintaining clear rules on insanity and incompetence of \ncounsel. His dissent, if applied, would have completely destabilized \nthe law in both of those areas for the State of Missouri.\n  Another big factor in cases is, even if the lawyer made a mistake and \ncould in one sense be held to be incompetent, the judge must ask \nhimself, on appeal, would that have had any likelihood of changing the \noutcome of the case. Certainly it would not have in this case, as the \nmajority opinion clearly held.\n  There were a series of other cases such as this one that caused the \nformer attorney general of the State of Missouri to wrestle with his \nconscience about whether or not he could approve this judge. He \nconcluded he could not, that he ought to oppose him. By giving him a \nlifetime-appointed Federal judicial position, the danger would be \ngreat, and he should not be promoted with this kind of anti-law-\nenforcement record. So he made a statement to that effect on the floor, \nand 54 Senators agreed with him.\n  That is not disqualifying. That shows to me a man of courage, because \nhe knew it would be a difficult matter, that many would disagree with \nhim and he would probably be attacked. It showed the kind of courage \nthat prosecutors have to have. It is not always a pleasant task to take \non these cases. You have to do your duty, and John did in this case.\n\n  He did the right thing. Judge White's opinions are, in my opinion, \noutside the mainstream, and he should not have been confirmed--54 \nSenators agreed with this conclusion.\n  The far left has also made allegations about the Bill Lann Lee \nnomination, and they have been attacking Senator Ashcroft for his small \nrole--they don't say small role--in the Bill Lann Lee matter.\n  Bill Lann Lee was nominated by the President for chief of the Civil \nRights Division of the Department of Justice. He had been a career \ncivil rights attorney, a good one, who had filed lawsuits all over the \ncountry. That had been his goal throughout life. He came at the office \nfrom that perspective.\n  That is not disqualifying. As a matter of fact, it could be a good \nquality. In fact, I consider it a good quality that he had litigated \nand had been active in the areas of law which he would be called upon \nto enforce.\n  Many of his cases, however, had obtained rulings or forced agencies \nhe was suing into consent decrees that went beyond what I believe is \njustified under current Supreme Court law. In fact, in recent years the \nU.S. Supreme Court rendered an opinion called the Adarand opinion. It \nwas a very important case. It clarified in many ways the issue \nconcerning quotas and affirmative action programs in terms of what is \nlegitimate and what is not. Basically, the Supreme Court held that the \nGovernment can't have quotas. It cannot say that you get this contract \nfor highway work because of the color of your skin and you don't get it \nbecause of the color of your skin. The Government can have affirmative \naction programs; it can have action to encourage small businesses. It \ncan do a lot of different things to encourage minorities to have the \nopportunity to compete. But it cannot, as a matter of American law and \nfundamental justice, say to one group or another: You can't get this \ncontract because of the color of your skin.\n  We had a hearing on that in the Judiciary Committee. We had Mrs. \nAdarand, the wife of Mr. Adarand, testify how their business had been \ndamaged by a quota system in Federal highway funding. She described \nthat in some detail.\n  We had a lady, a Chinese American from San Francisco, who testified \nabout her daughter who had studied very hard to get into a special \nadvanced quality school in San Francisco for math and science, I \nbelieve. She met the test scores, and they were so excited. Then she \ngot a letter saying they were not accepted.\n  This woman went down to the school's office and said: My daughter \nmade this test score. I thought she would be accepted. Why wasn't she?\n  She said the man to whom she was speaking looked at her and said: She \nwas rejected because there are too many Chinese enrolled already.\n  Even though her child qualified in every way, she was rejected \nbecause of her ethnic, racial background.\n  That is the kind of thing that is happening in America today. It is \nnot a healthy thing. Adarand made clear that those kinds of things are \nnot justified. Adarand holds that there is a presumption in the law \nthat programs based on race, that favor one group or another based on \ntheir race, are unconstitutional and that they fail and cannot be \nenforced unless they pass a strict scrutiny test, which is a very high \ntest.\n  Isn't that true? Isn't that what America is about? Equal opportunity \nfor all, regardless of their race and background, color or creed or \nreligion? Yes, that is what America is about. So this is a seminal \ncase.\n\n  So Mr. Lee came up. It became a really important question as to \nwhether or not he would follow this because his background, \nparticularly in a lot of cases before Adarand was ruled on, was \ncontrary to that. He said he thought Adarand was fine, he would follow \nit. But we questioned him in some detail about how he interpreted \nAdarand, and that was a matter that did not go well for Mr. Lee, in my \nopinion. It troubled the entire committee.\n  The precise questions dealt with the enforcement of Adarand. When \nasked to state the holding of Adarand--we asked him what he thought the \nholding of Adarand was--he testified that racial preference programs \nare permissible ``if conducted in a limited and measured manner.'' \nRacial preferences are permissible in America, he said, if conducted in \na limited and measured manner.\n  But Adarand doesn't say that. That was the problem. Adarand says they \nare presumptively unconstitutional unless they pass strict scrutiny, \nsome specific reason--normally, a clear bias that is being fixed by a \npost-adjudication order. But even when this was pointed out to Mr. Lee, \nhe stayed with his expressed position. That was very troubling.\n  I liked Mr. Lee. I told him I liked him. But I was troubled that he \nwas going to be chief of the Civil Rights Division in the Department of \nJustice, and he wasn't prepared to enforce plain rule, as I saw it, in \nthe Adarand case.\n  Chairman Hatch, who is a constitutional scholar, was also troubled. \nHe came and made a speech on this floor which had the quality of a Law \nReview article dissecting this important seminal case and Mr. Lee's \nresponses to it. He voted no, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nas did eight other members of the Judiciary Committee, of which I was a \nmember. He failed in committee 9-9.\n  They blamed John Ashcroft as being a man who personally blocked this \nperson from that high office. I don't think\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\nthat is right. I think that is wrong. That is deliberate distortion of \nwhat happened. Members of the committee who were there ought to have \nknown better than to criticize John Ashcroft with regards to the Bill \nLann Lee nomination. They should not repeat a false allegation, and \nthey should correct their colleagues who may not know otherwise.\n  It was an honest, professional discussion of the law. It was an \nhonest discussion of what ought to be done for Bill Lann Lee, and we \nconcluded that his understanding of Adarand was different than what we \nunderstood Adarand to be and that he could not fulfill the very heart \nof his office's responsibility if he didn't understand the seminal case \non preferences and quotas in America law, the Adarand case.\n  There are hundreds of Federal programs based on race in America. When \nasked if any of them would fall because of Adarand, Lee suggested maybe \none. I think that is unlikely to be so as the law continues to develop \nin this area. I think we had a real problem there. That is why that \nmatter was decided the way it was.\n  It certainly is unfair to say that this brilliant lawyer, this \nprincipled Senator, this public servant of over 25 years was somehow \nanti-Chinese-Americans because he voted against Bill Lann Lee. He voted \nfor 26 out of 27 African American judges that the Clinton \nadministration sent forward, objecting only to the one in his State \nwhere his sheriffs and police chiefs opposed him. Does that mean that \nhe is anti-black? They are wrong. This is going too far. What is \nhappening here is not right.\n  I was talking to a group, and I acknowledged that John was different \nfrom the rest of us. He doesn't drink, dance or smoke because of his \ndedication to his religious beliefs. He has been married to one wife, \nand he has a fine family. His personal life is conducted on the highest \nstandard of decency and fairness. In many important ways, John Ashcroft \nis different from the rest of us. In many important ways, John Ashcroft \nis better than the rest of us.\n  He has appointed numerous African Americans to the bench in Missouri. \nHe signed into law and supported the Martin Luther King birthday law in \nMissouri at a time when some didn't want to do that. His wife, a law \nprofessor herself, is teaching at the Howard University, a majority \nblack college here in D.C. John has a clear record of fairness and \njustice.\n  It is wrong to allow a series of groups that are not answerable to \nthe American people, that have hard-left agendas, to come in here and \ncaricature his decisions as being somehow anti-civil rights because he \nvoted against Bill Lann Lee; that he is somehow anti-black because he \nvoted against this one judge. To make that kind of caricature of this \ngood man and then ask us to vote against him based on that caricature \nis fundamentally wrong.\n  If you had heard the testimony and heard him answer and explain how \nhe did this and other things in the hearing, you would agree, I \nbelieve, that he made a wonderful case for what he did. It was \nplausible and reasonable and principled and is not in any way extreme \nor outside the mainstream of American law.\n  Another far left myth is that John is against integration because he \nresisted massive Federal Court intervention in the State of Missouri's \nschool systems.\n  Many of you have probably heard of the Kansas City case where a \nFederal judge imposed a tax and ordered a county commission to impose a \ntax to pay for the court's plan for education. John was the attorney \ngeneral of the State of Missouri, the sovereign State of Missouri, that \nhas a constitution that says what State school boards do, what State \nsuperintendents of education do, and how the system is set up. This \nFederal judge came in and ripped it all apart doing what he thought was \njust.\n\n  I am telling you, if the attorney general wants to defend his State, \nwhat is the matter with that? Who is in charge? Is he supposed to stand \nidly by and allow the court to do that?\n  Senator Danforth, one of the most respected Senators who has served \nin this body, is an Episcopal priest, and was attorney general before \nJohn. He opposed these court orders. His successor opposed these \norders. The second successor to John Ashcroft, Jay Nixon--I was \nattorney general, and I knew Jay. Jay opposed those orders exceedingly \nvigorously. But that didn't stop a few of the Members of this body, \nSenators Kennedy and Harkin, from going to Missouri and having a \nfundraiser for Jay Nixon in his race for the Senate.\n  Let me repeat that. Senators Kennedy and Harkin held a political \nfundraiser for Jay Nixon after he opposed these court orders \nvigorously, yet somehow it was improper for then Attorney General \nAshcroft to have opposed them as well.\n  This example is illustrative. Like the integration charge, all the \ncharges made against John are trumped up. This is not fair. John \nAshcroft was doing his duty as an attorney general. He favored school \nintegration, and he has stated that unequivocally. He believes in \nintegration, but he did not agree with the actions taken by the federal \ncourts.\n  This is what was in one of the court orders that John Ashcroft \nresisted as attorney general of Missouri. It ordered the school system \nto have an 8-lane, 50-meter swimming pool, the biggest in the State, \nbigger than any of the universities' swimming pools; a 300-seat Greek \namphitheater with a stage framed with white columns; a planetarium; \ngreenhouses; a dust-free diesel mechanic shop--I worked in my dad's \nmechanic shop. It wasn't dust free. It didn't hurt me, I don't think--\nbroadcast cable radio and TV studios; school animal rooms, including an \nindoor petting zoo; private nature trails; overseas trips for students; \nand a model United Nations with language translation.\n  The attorney general is supposed to sit by and let a Federal judge \ntake over the whole State and issue these kinds of orders? Who is going \nto pay this $1.7 billion? The people of Missouri.\n  Who is this judge? How do judges get to do this? They have to be \ncareful about this. You can't issue orders to remedy a past \ndiscrimination. You can't do that, but judges do it regularly. But many \njudges over reach. Many court rulings have over reached.\n  As attorney general, John Ashcroft thought it was his duty to defend \nMissouri as his predecessor and as his two successors did. That is not \nan extreme position.\n  This is second-guessing somebody and twisting it to make it sound as \nif he opposed integration, which he absolutely did not.\n  There are many more matters that have been charged. The responses to \nthem are just as compelling. In fact, it is clear to me that the case \nagainst John Ashcroft totally collapsed in the hearings that we held. \nWe gave everybody a chance to testify. John responded to all of them. \nHe answered 400 questions propounded to him.\n  There is no case here that shows that he wouldn't be the finest kind \nof Attorney General. I am convinced that he will. I am convinced that \nhe will be a great Attorney General.\n  As one who spent 15 years in the Department of Justice, I dearly love \nand I respect it from my deepest being. It has not been run well in the \nlast 8 years. It really has not. Morale is not where it needs to be. \nThey have not pursued cases effectively, in my view. For long, long \nperiods of time, chief positions such as Criminal Division Chief have \nbeen left vacant. There has not been a focus and a leadership there, \nand it is desperately needed. More than anybody I know, John Ashcroft \ncan fill that role with integrity, with fairness, and with justice to \nrestore the concept of equal justice under the law, even if it means \ndenying pardons to millionaire fugitives who won't come back to face \nthe medicine.\n  He would never have approved a pardon for that kind of case. That \nkind of stuff is rotten to the core. The same people in this body who \nhave defended, excused, and apologized for lies, for unprincipled \noperation of the Department of Justice, or for former President \nClinton's subversion of the law, now see fit to attack a man of \ncharacter and decency. This is tragic, and it speaks volumes about \nJohn's opponents.\n  He is going to be confirmed, because my colleagues know the truth \nabout John Ashcroft. He will be a good Attorney General. Members of \nthis Senate in opposition to this nomination ought to reevaluate their \nconscience about how they have handled this case. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S701-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ELIMINATING FEDERAL BARRIERS\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to enthusiastically applaud \nGeorge W. Bush's community and faith-based initiative which he \nannounced yesterday and is emphasizing and talking about this week. It \nis a very exciting prospect that we have a President who recognizes the \nvast untapped potential of the charitable and faith-based sector and \nwho wants to rally what he calls the ``armies of compassion'' to solve \nthe deeper social problems and the deeper social challenges we face in \nthis Nation.\n  The government can do many things. Some of those things it does well, \nbut there are many things government cannot do. It cannot put hope in \nour hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives. This is done by \nchurches, synagogues, mosques, and charities that warm the cold of \nlife. It is done by the faith-based sector in our society.\n  I am pleased the President has established the Office of Faith-Based \nand Community Initiatives. By creating this office, we now will have a \nclearinghouse in the executive branch to point up where we have \nlegislative and administrative barriers that have been erected to make \nit more difficult for people to encourage and support these faith-based \ninitiatives. It will identify such problems in Federal rules, \npractices, and regulatory and statutory barriers in order that we might \nfind relief and coordinate new Federal initiatives to empower and \npartner with faith-based and community problem solvers.\n  As he rolled out this plan--some of it, I am sure, is going to be \ncontroversial, and that is where the media would like to focus--much of \nwhat the President has rolled out makes common sense if we go beyond \nwelfare reform, passed a few years ago and signed by President Clinton. \nWelfare reform has had a dramatic impact. We have seen the welfare \nroles decline by half across the Nation. All of us involved in the \neffort understood that was but the first step, and if we were \nultimately to get to the deeper problems in a welfare culture, if we \nwere going to deal with the problems of drug dependency, if we were \ngoing to deal with the high rate of recidivism in our prisons that we \nhad to embrace, we had to involve the faith-based sector.\n  The President has suggested we should expand private giving, we \nshould grant a charitable deduction for nonitemizers. The Federal \ncharitable deduction, under the President's plan, will be expanded to \n80 million taxpayers. Seventy percent of all filers do not itemize, and \nthus currently cannot claim this benefit. This initiative will spark \nbillions of dollars in new donations to charitable organizations. He \nhas suggested that we should promote corporate in-kind donations. The \nadministration seeks to limit the liability of corporations that in \ngood faith donate equipment, facilities, vehicles, or aircraft to \ncharitable organizations, thus enhancing the ability of these \norganizations to serve neighborhoods and families. That, I say to my \ncolleagues, is common sense. It should not be controversial. He \nsuggested that we permit charitable contributions from IRAs without \npenalty. Under current law, withdrawals from IRAs are subject to income \ntax. This creates a disincentive for retirees to contribute some or all \nof their IRA funds to charity.\n\n  President Bush supports legislation that would permit individuals, \nover the age of 59, to contribute IRA funds to charities without having \nto pay income tax on their gifts. He promotes a charitable State tax \ncredit. He supports raising the cap on corporate charitable deductions \nand creating a compassion capital fund.\n  All of these are a simple means in which we can use the Tax Code to \nencourage donations to the faith-based and charitable sector and \nunleash this vast source of energy to help solve these very deep-rooted \nproblems that we have in our society.\n  Among the new approaches, he suggests action that would help the \nchildren of prisoners, improving inmate rehabilitation, providing \nsecond chance maternity group homes, and more afterschool \nopportunities.\n  I want to tell one such story from the State of Arkansas that I \nbelieve the President's initiatives will assist. We had a wonderful \norganization started in Little Rock, AR, called PARK. It stands for \nPositive Atmosphere Reaches Kids. It was established by someone whose \nname will be familiar to football fans across this country. It was \nestablished by Keith Jackson. Keith was raised in a single parent \nhousehold in a low-income neighborhood of Little Rock. He held \nsteadfast to his course of finishing high school, playing football, and \nultimately graduating from college. Unfortunately for us, he played \nfootball for the University of Oklahoma. But he went on to the NFL \nwhere he had a stellar career. He returned to Little Rock with this \nburden to help underprivileged children in Little Rock.\n  This is what he said in 1989. He said, while watching an evening \nnewscast, he was struck by the number of stories involving teenagers \nand violent crime. He said: It seemed like every story was about a kid \ngetting shot or robbing a liquor store or being in a gang fight. It \nreally hit me for the first time that somebody had to do something to \nstop this. What we are doing now isn't working.\n  He said the Government programs, as many and as well motivated as \nthey were, were not doing the job. He established PARK. It is a \nwonderful program. It is an afterschool program. From September through \nMay, the program operates 4 days a week. Kids ride schoolbuses to PARK. \nWhen they arrive, they eat a nutritious snack. They participate in the \nrequired academic program which requires homework, tutoring, reading or \nresearch in the library, working in the computer lab that is equipped \nwith software designed to enhance skills in reading, math, and language \narts.\n  Volunteer tutors and mentors come in. After they spend the hour doing \nthe academics, they then get to enjoy the recreation. They have a \nskating rink, a weight room, basketball courts, racquetball courts, and \nan arcade. Some kids may go so they can be involved in the recreation, \nbut they first have to do the academic work. They have a summer \nprogram. They have a community service program. They emphasize parental \ninvolvement.\n  When school is over, the buses take the kids to PARK, where they \nenjoy an extra hour of academic emphasis. Then they have the \nrecreation. They have a nutritious snack. They have parental \ninvolvement. They have mentors and tutors. And they have a college prep \nprogram. All of this is done without one red cent of Government money. \nIt is all from donations. It is all from foundations; not any \nGovernment assistance.\n  Why shouldn't we make it easier for people who believe in programs \nsuch as PARK to be able to give and contribute and have a tax incentive \nto do that? I simply applaud President Bush for seeing this need and \nfor stepping forward and being willing to take some of the barbed \nattacks he has faced, and will continue to face, for this initiative \nbecause it is sorely needed.\n  I want to tell one more example. Here in Washington, DC, a group of \nHill staffers, a few years ago, saw the need of children in \ndisadvantaged homes in the District of Columbia, where many of them did \nnot have the same educational opportunities as children from more \naffluent homes. They went out and they started a school called \nCornerstone. They started it on a shoestring. They had no great \nresources. They had no great endowment. They had no great foundation. \nAll they had was a vision and a dream. They are Hill staffers. They \nhave started a school that is now serving scores of young people here \nin the District of Columbia. While we may argue about vouchers, we \nsurely should not argue about making it easier for people to support \nfaith-based initiatives such as Cornerstone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S701-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I supported Governor Tommy G. Thompson's \nnomination to be Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) because \nhe is a proven leader in reforming welfare, health care, and other \nimportant social policies.\n  As the steward of the Department of Health and Human Services, he \nwill be involved in managing more than 300 separate programs and the \nlargest budget of any cabinet agency, more than $400 billion per year. \nIn this position, it is my hope that he will make providing affordable, \nuniversal prescription drug coverage to every Medicare beneficiary, and \nreforming the Medicare program to ensure its long-term fiscal solvency \nat the top of his agenda.\n  Also, I would hope that under his leadership, HHS will take an active \nrole in working to address continued funding and access shortfalls in \nthe rural health care system, particularly as they relate to Medicare \nreform. This is especially important in my state of North Dakota, where \nhealth care providers are struggling to offer quality services to \nseniors living in rural areas. In addition, we know that Governor \nThompson has fought hard to expand health care coverage for low-income \nparents and children in the state of Wisconsin. It is my hope that he \nwill continue this effort at the federal level, with a firm commitment \nto retaining a strong federal role in important programs such as \nMedicaid and the State-Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I look forward to working with Governor Thompson in the coming years \nto improve health care and income security for all Americans.\n\n\n                      Confirmation of Mel Martinez\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I supported Mel Martinez as Secretary of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development. I believe that Mr. \nMartinez will contribute both his knowledge of housing policy and \npersonal experience toward increasing home ownership among all \nAmericans. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Martinez said that he \nknows the value of home ownership, because he has witnessed its great \npower throughout his entire life. It is true that the foundation of \ncommunity involvement and prosperity is built upon home ownership, \nwhich is a critical element of the American Dream.\n  I am pleased that Mr. Martinez has voiced his support for the \nPresident's proposal to provide $1.7 billion in tax credits over five \nyears to build and renovate single-family homes in poor communities and \nto allocate another $1 billion in tax credits to assist up to 650,000 \nfamilies attain their dreams of becoming homeowners.\n  Having emigrated to the United States at the age of 15 and \nsuccessfully risen to the post of Chairman of Orange County, Florida, \nMr. Martinez has proved his mettle and displayed his commitment to \npublic service. I look forward to working with Mr. Martinez in his \ncapacity as our nation's newest Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n\n\n            Norman Mineta to be Secretary of Transportation\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was very pleased to support the \nnomination of Norman Mineta to be Secretary of Transportation.\n  Mr. Mineta has had a long and distinguished career in public service. \nMost recently, he served with distinction as Secretary of Commerce. \nBefore that, he served for many years in the House of Representatives, \nwhere he rose to become Chairman of the Transportation Committee. With \nthat background, Mr. Mineta could not be better prepared for the \nchallenges he will face.\n  One of this country's great competitive advantages in the global \neconomy has been our transportation infrastructure, which allows us to \nmove raw materials to processing plants and finished products to \nmarkets around the world with great efficiency. However, our \ninfrastructure is starting to show its age. Our roads and airports, in \nparticular, are increasingly congested, and delays are costing our \neconomy tens of billions of dollars annually. In recent years, the \nCongress has dramatically increased our national commitment to highway \nand airport funding to make sure our infrastructure is up to the \nstandards and challenges of the twenty-first century. Our next \nSecretary of Transportation will have the important task of \nimplementing these legislative initiatives as well as helping to \nnegotiate the next highway bill.\n  As he takes on these challenges, I hope Secretary Mineta will keep in \nmind some of the concerns of primarily rural states like North Dakota. \nIn my state, Essential Air Service is critically important to \npreserving air service to mid-size communities and helping to foster \neconomic development in those communities. More generally, federal \nfunding is essential to maintaining the hundreds of miles of highways \nthat bridge the distances between population centers. Finally, I had \nthe opportunity to talk with Mr. Mineta the other day about the unique \nsituation in the Devils Lake region in my state and the need to come up \nwith an innovative solution that will maintain the road network in the \nface of continued flooding of Devils Lake.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Mineta on these many issues \nand wish him well in his new position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S702-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FH CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, later today I plan to introduce \nlegislation that will be a very important part of our tax bill and also \npart of the effort to encourage people to give more to charitable \ninstitutions. This bill was passed by Congress last session, and it was \nvetoed by the President. Senator Durbin and I are going to reintroduce \nit. It is the IRA charity rollover bill.\n  It will allow simply anyone 59\\1/2\\ or older to take money from their \nIRA that they find they do not need for the lifestyle in which they \nwish to live in retirement and give it directly to charity without \nhaving to pay taxes on it. This will give more money to the charity, it \nwill allow that person to choose where his or her money will go, and it \nwill certainly continue to encourage people to save for their \nretirement security. It will also give them flexibility, an option, if \nthey have saved in good faith and find they now can be more generous \nand would like to help the charity of their choice.\n  The charity IRA rollover bill will be introduced by Senator Durbin \nand myself this afternoon. I am very pleased it also is going to be \npart of President Bush's tax package. Now I know that when we pass this \nbill, it will be signed by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S702-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALAN CRANSTON\n\n  Mr. CLELAND.

The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2001 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. \nRes. 290).\n  The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $33.9 billion in budget authority and by $21.8 billion in \noutlays. Current level is $14.1 billion above the revenue floor in \n2001.\n  This is my first report for fiscal year 2001, and my first report for \nthe first session of the 107th Congress.\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2001.\n     Hon.

     \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JERE W. GLOVER\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today to praise Jere Glover, \nformer Chief Counsel for Advocacy at the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, for almost seven years of outstanding work in that \nposition.\n  The United States Senate confirmed President Clinton's appointment of \nMr. Glover as Chief Counsel for Advocacy on May 4, 1994. Mr. Glover \nserved as Chief Counsel until January 20, 2001. The following briefly \nhighlights some of the Office of Advocacy's achievements during Mr. \nGlover's leadership.\n  Mr. Glover was instrumental in making the third national White House \nConference on Small Business a success. Held in June of 1995 in \nWashington, DC, it was attended by nearly 2,000 delegates. Some 20,000 \nsmall businesses participated in 59 state conferences and six regional \nconferences leading to the national conference. In the legislation \nauthorizing the conference, the Congress mandated that SBA monitor and \nreport to the delegates on the progress made to implement their \nrecommendations. Under Mr. Glover, the Office of Advocacy established \nnetworks of delegates and provided information through ``regional issue \nchairs.'' In the month of September in 1996, 1997, and, finally, 2000, \nthe Office of Advocacy sent annual implementation reports to Congress, \nthe President and the delegates. These reports indicated the \nunprecedented progress, compared with previous conferences, in \nimplementing the recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on \nSmall Business.\n  Following up on the recommendations of the 1995 White House \nConference on Small Business, the Office of Advocacy provided research \nand testimony in support of a number of laws designed to reduce small \nbusiness tax, regulatory, and paperwork burdens. In addition to the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, the Office \nof Advocacy supported provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, \nthe Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996, the American Inventors \nProtection Act, the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act and others, \nall of which incorporated the Conference recommendations.\n  Since the enactment of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) in 1980, \nthe Office of Advocacy has had an oversight role in monitoring \ncompliance with the law. The RFA requires federal agencies to determine \nwhether a proposed rule will have a disproportionate effect on small \nfirms and other small entities and, if so, to explore equally effective \nalternative regulatory solutions. In 1996, Congress expanded the Office \nof Advocacy's role by passing the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA). This law provides new avenues for small \nbusinesses to participate in and have access to the federal regulatory \narena.\n  The Office of Advocacy held briefings for more than 600 federal \nofficials on the requirements and procedures mandated by this amendment \nto the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Office of Advocacy held a \nspecial conference for the economic analysts in each agency on how to \nanalyze the economic impact of agency regulations on small business and \nwas successful in challenging violations of the RFA and SBREFA in \ncourt.\n  Under Jere Glover, the Office of Advocacy pursued the mandates of \nSBREFA in over 20 EPA and OSHA small business advocacy review panels. \nThe panels reviewed proposals that would impose burdens on small \nbusiness and recommended changes. The work of these panels helped craft \nstronger, more equitable regulations. Even in cases where agreement \nwasn't reached, small businesses were better informed of regulatory \nburdens and requirements.\n  At the beginning of this year, the Office of Advocacy published its \n20th Anniversary Regulatory Flexibility Act Report. Chief among the \nreport's findings is the estimate that in the 1998-2000 period, \nregulatory changes supported by the Office of Advocacy saved small \nbusinesses about $20 billion in annual and one-time compliance costs.\n  In addition to the Regulatory Flexibility Report, the Office of \nAdvocacy has completed its fourth annual report focusing on small \nbusiness lending activities of the nation's commercial bank lenders. \nThis study analyzes information in the ``call'' reports filed by all \nfederally regulated banks. The national and state-by-state analyses of \nthe data show which banks, large and small, are most likely to lend to \nsmall businesses. The Office of Advocacy reports also categorize the \nbanks by the percentage and dollar volume of their lending to small \nbusinesses.\n  Additionally, under Mr. Glover's tenure, the Office of Advocacy has \ndeveloped, or assisted in the development of a number of databases to \naddress the critical gap in equity capital financing, aide public and \nprivate contracting officers seeking small business contractors, \nsubcontractors and partnership opportunities and, measure job creation \nby small business. Using this data, the Office of Advocacy estimates \nthat small businesses created more than 12 million net new jobs between \n1992 and 1996.\n  Mr. President, as the Ranking Democratic Member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business, I would like to extend my congratulations \nto Mr. Glover for his successes while Chief Counsel for Advocacy and \nwish him well in his future endeavors.\n  I ask that a letter from business groups around the country, thanking \nMr. Glover for his hard work and support of America's small businesses, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                      A Tribute To Jere W. Glover\n\n       Jere W. Glover is a great American.\n       Each of us, the undersigned, has had an opportunity to work \n     closely with Jere Glover over the last six years, and we \n     would like to share with America some of our unique \n     experiences and accomplishments with him as the Chief Counsel \n     for Advocacy of the U.S. Small Business Administration. On \n     January 20, he will leave behind a significant legacy in the \n     regulatory arena.\n       Jere Glover advanced the cause of small business by \n     decades, by being one of the driving forces behind one of the \n     most significant changes to the Regulatory Flexibility Act \n     (RFA): the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel process. The \n     Panel process enables the Chief Counsel, with the advice of \n     the small business community, to review and evaluate the \n     basis for certain regulations at an early stage of the \n     process. These are regulations that could have a significant \n     economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, \n     small nonprofit organizations, and/or small governments. The \n     Panel process led to a number of significant improvements to \n     regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     (OSHA) in recent years.\n       Perhaps the largest part of his legacy, the work Jere \n     Glover has done with EPA rules affecting the petroleum \n     refining industry, has been most effective. Thanks to Jere \n     Glover, there will continue to be a significant small \n     business presence in this industry.\n       For example, EPA was planning to propose a significantly \n     more stringent regulation of sulfur in gasoline, but Jere \n     helped to persuade EPA that such a decision would be \n     unnecessary and unduly costly to the consumer. EPA eventually \n     signed a rule that would delay the final standards for four \n     to six years for small businesses, allowing them to make more \n     manageable reductions in sulfur over a longer period of time.\n       The same is true about EPA's recent rule to control \n     hazardous air pollutants from mobile sources. Due largely to \n     Jere's counsel, EPA backed away from initial plans for a more \n     stringent rule to commit to a no-cost approach at proposal. \n     His continued interest and advocacy led to further changes to \n     the final rule, which helped the Agency to ensure that it \n     would meet its twin goals of a no-cost rule that, at the same \n     time, maintains the significant air quality improvements over \n     the last several years.\n       Jere Glover was also successful in persuading EPA to build \n     some flexibility into the rule for the control of sulfur in \n     highway diesel fuel, so that small refiners could stage \n     significant investments in the diesel and gasoline sulfur \n     rules.\n       In the safety arena, Jere Glover has been a real watchdog \n     for the rights of small business under the RFA. While there \n     have been only three SBREFA panels at OSHA, Jere Glover was \n     closely involved with each one, ensuring that the concerns of \n     small business were heard. Without the input of Jere and that \n     of small employers, OSHA would not have revised its economic \n     impact analysis of the Ergonomics rule, nor added provisions \n     such as the Quick Fix option, which gave flexibility to small \n     entities.\n       Jere Glover has been a true advocate for the millions of \n     small employers affected by\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\n     both the Ergonomics rule and the Safety and Health proposed \n     rule. He insisted that OSHA take into consideration not only \n     how differently small employers operate their workplaces, but \n     also how burdensome and costly government regulations are on \n     those employers. With Jere's constant commitment to small \n     business, he was able to argue convincingly that OSHA's cost \n     estimates in both the Ergonomics rule and the Safety and \n     Health program standard were significantly underestimated.\n       And Jere Glover did not stop there. He was instrumental in \n     persuading the EPA not to finalize national wastewater \n     discharge standards for the textile supply and service \n     industry (industrial launderers). By pointing to existing \n     local regulations, Jere was able to convince the EPA that the \n     industry's voluntary pollution prevention and resource \n     conservation program was a more appropriate course of action.\n       He also managed to persuade EPA to provide significant \n     flexibility in the Transportation Equipment Cleaning Industry \n     wastewater regulation.\n       And last, when did EPA learn that the public already knew \n     that there was actually gasoline at gas stations? When Jere \n     Glover pointed it out. The Agency had been insisting that gas \n     station owner/operators should annually complete more \n     paperwork on gasoline to serve the public's right-to-know \n     about environmental hazards. But Jere Glover helped them to \n     see that EPA could use existing paperwork, the underground \n     storage tank forms, to accomplish the same goal at less cost \n     and less burden.\n       The small business community salutes you, Jere Glover. We \n     will miss you, Jere, and your invaluable contributions to our \n     cause. Good luck to you in your future endeavors.

CLEVELAND\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Elder \nE.E. Cleveland, a civic and religious leader for over 50 years with the \nSeventh-day Adventist Church. A graduate and an eventual professor at \nOakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, Elder Cleveland is a shining \nexample of a man whose devotion to principle and belief can serve to \ninspire and influence others. In honor of the new Bradford Cleveland \nInstitute for Continuing Education located at Oakwood College, I wanted \nto take this opportunity to recognize a man who has been a pioneer in \nreligious and community involvement.\n  After graduating from Oakwood College in 1941, and being ordained in \n1946, Elder Cleveland embarked on a remarkable path which has taken him \nall over the United States, across 6 continents, and 67 countries. He \nhas conducted over 60 public Evangelism campaigns, trained over 1,100 \npastors world-wide, and held scores of church revivals. In fact, Elder \nCleveland was the first black church leader sent to Asia, Europe, South \nAmerica and Australia, and has preached to integrated audiences in Cape \nTown and South Africa. He has authored sixteen published books and two \nSabbath School Lesson Quarterlies, and served as a Contributing and \nAssociate Editor to numerous religious journals and publications. In \nfact, Elder Cleveland was presented with an award by Governor Guy Hunt \nin 1989, for being the most distinguished Black Clergyman in the State \nof Alabama.\n  It can truly be said that Elder Cleveland has touched the lives of \nmany throughout the world. This broad sense of community is \ndemonstrated in his involvement in many areas. Elder Cleveland \nparticipated in the First March on Washington in 1957 with Dr. Martin \nLuther King, and organized the NAACP Chapter for students on the \nOakwood College Campus. He also was a member of the Washington, D.C. \nBranch of the Organizing Committee of the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference's ``Poor People's March'' on Washington in 1968. In \naddition, he has conducted ``Feed the Hungry'' programs in over 20 \ncities in the U.S. and helped to establish a feeding depot in \nWashington, DC.\n  Elder Cleveland remains a great Evangelist, teacher, author, and \nleader. He has received over 100 awards, honors and citations for his \nvarious achievements. Currently, Elder Cleveland lives with his wife, \nCelia Abney Cleveland, in semi-retirement in Huntsville, Alabama. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to commend Elder Cleveland for his \ncommitment to his moral principles and his unwavering dedication to \nhelping those less fortunate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S705-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT OF THE PROGRAM ENTITLED ``RALLY THE ARMIES OF COMPASSION''--\n                    MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 2\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Enclosed please find the blueprint for my program to ``Rally the \nArmies of Compassion.''

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan above-the-line deduction for qualified professional development \nexpenses of elementary and secondary school teachers and to allow a \ncredit against income tax to elementary and secondary school teachers \nwho provide classroom materials; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, to introduce the Teacher Support Act of \n2001. We are very pleased to be joined by our good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Landrieu, in proposing this legislation.\n  Senator Kyl and I crafted this bill to help our teachers when they \npursue professional development or pay for supplies for their \nclassrooms.\n  Our legislation has two major provisions.\n  First, it will allow teachers and teacher aides to take an above-the-\nline deduction for their professional development expenses. Thus, \neducators who don't itemize their deductions will still be able to \nbenefit from tax-favored treatment for their professional development.\n  Second, the legislation will grant educators a tax credit of up to \n$100 for books, supplies, and other materials that they purchase for \ntheir classrooms. According to a study by the National Education \nAssociation, the average public school teacher spends more than $400 \nannually on classroom supplies. This sacrifice, I think, is typical of \nthe dedication of many of our schoolteachers toward their students.\n  While our legislation provides some financial assistance to \neducators, its ultimate beneficiaries will be their students. Other \nthan involved parents, a well-qualified teacher is the most important \nprerequisite for students' success. Educational researchers have \ndemonstrated over and over again the close relationship between \nqualified educators and successful students. Moreover, educators \nthemselves understand how important professional development is to \nmaintaining and extending their level of competence.\n  Mr. President, when I meet with teachers from my State of Maine, they \nrepeatedly tell me of their need for more professional development and \nthe scarcity of financial support for this worthy pursuit. As President \nBush has put it, ``Teachers sometimes lead with their hearts and pay \nwith their wallets.''\n  The willingness of Maine's teachers to fund their own professional \ndevelopment activities has deeply impressed me. For example, an English \nteacher, who serves on my education advisory committee, told me of \nspending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She then came \nback and shared her new knowledge with all of the teachers in her \ndepartment at Bangor High School. She is typical of the many educators \nwho generously reach into their own pockets to pay for professional \ndevelopment and to purchase materials to enhance their teaching.\n  Let me explain how our legislation works in terms of real dollars. In \nmy home State, the average yearly starting salary of a public school \nteacher is about $23,300. Under the current law, even a teacher who is \nearning this modest salary cannot deduct the first $466 in professional \ndevelopment expenses that he or she paid for out-of-pocket. That is \nbecause of the requirement in the current law that sets a floor of 2 \npercent that has to be reached before the cost of the course or other \nprofessional development is deductible. Moreover, under current law, \nprofessional development expenses above $466 can be deducted only if \nthe teacher itemizes his or her deductions. Only about one-third of our \nNation's schoolteachers do itemize their tax deductions.\n  Our legislation would enable all educators, regardless of whether or \nnot they itemize deductions, to receive tax relief for professional \ndevelopment expenses.\n\n  I greatly admire the many educators who have voluntarily financed \nadditional education to improve their skills so that they may better \nserve their students. I admire those teachers who purchase books, \nsupplies, equipment, and other materials for their students in order to \nenhance their teaching.\n  I hope this change in our Tax Code will encourage educators to \ncontinue their formal course work in the subject matter they teach and \nto attend conferences to give them new ideas for presenting course work \nin a challenging manner. This bill will reimburse educators for a small \npart of what they invest in our children's future. This money would be \nwell spent. Investing in education helps us to build one of the most \nimportant assets for our country's future--a well educated population. \nWe need to ensure that our\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\npublic schools have the very best educators possible in order to bring \nout the very best in our students.\n  Last year, Senator Kyl and I offered a similar version of this \nlegislation as an amendment to the Affordable Education Act of \n2000. Our amendment enjoyed overwhelming support and passed the Senate \nby a vote of 98-0. Unfortunately, the underlying bill was not taken up \nby the House of Representatives.\n\n  This year, we are very pleased that President Bush has made the \nclassroom supplies portion of our bill part of his education platform, \nand that our legislation has received the support of the National \nEducation Association. Our hope is that the bill will become law before \nthe end of the year. We urge our colleagues to join us in supporting \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I was an original cosponsor of the Teacher \nSupport Act of 2001. Working together last year, Senator Collins and I, \nwith invaluable assistance from our departed colleague Paul Coverdell, \npersuaded the Senate to pass almost identical legislation by a vote of \n98-0.\n  Like the amendment approved by the Senate last year, the Teacher \nSupport Act would provide an annual tax credit of up to $100 for \nteachers' un-reimbursed classroom expenditures that are qualified under \nthe Internal Revenue Code. For amounts over $100, teachers would \ncontinue to use the deductions allowed for such expenses under current \nlaw.\n  We know the need this legislation addresses is real. According to a \nrecent\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\nstudy by the NEA, the average K-12 teacher spent $408 every year on \nclassroom materials needed for education but not supplied by the \nschools. These materials include everything from books, workbooks, \nerasers, paper, pens, equipment related to classroom instruction, and \nprofessional enrichment programs.\n  In my discussions with teachers--public and private--I have been \namazed to learn that many use their own money to cover the cost of \nclassroom materials that are not supplied by their school or school \ndistrict.\n  I have attended intense meetings in which Arizona teachers have \nrelated to me, in confidence, that they have used money from the family \nbudget, without telling their spouses, for needed classroom supplies, \nand that though they feel wracked with guilt, they would do it again \nfor their students. The Teacher Support Act stands for the idea that \nteachers should not feel compelled to make such sacrifices.\n  Though there is no absolute linkage between personal contributions \nfor school supplies and the quality of the teaching, there likely is \nsome correlation, given the degree of commitment evidenced by these \nteachers who are spending their own money. To the extent this is true, \nthe proposal will have the effect of encouraging instruction of the \nhighest quality.\n  I am pleased that President Bush campaigned on a similar proposal \nlast year, and that he has included it in the education package he \nannounced last week. This legislation, sends a much-needed message to \nthe hard-working teachers of this country that they have our support, \nand that, working together, we can improve education for America's \nchildren.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as you well know, the need for reform in \nthe American education system is a priority for many members of \nCongress, as well as for President Bush and his newly assembled \nadministration. While there still is some debate over a few remaining \nissues such as annual testing and private school vouchers, it is clear \nthat there is much that we agree must be addressed if our children are \nto receive the type of education necessary to be competitive in the \n21st century. Almost no one disagrees that focused efforts to recruit \nand retain qualified teachers are the key to increasing student \nachievement. Today, research is confirming what common sense has \nsuggested all along. A skilled and knowledgeable teacher can make \nenormous difference in how well students learn. One Tennessee study \nfound that the students who had good teachers three years in a row \nscored significantly higher on state tests and made far greater gains \nthan students with a series of ineffective teachers. Another study \nconducted at Stanford found that the strongest indicator of how a \nstate's students performed on National assessments was the percentage \nof well qualified teachers.\n  The Department of Education estimates that 2,000,000 new teachers \nwill have to be hired in the next decade. Yet, each year, only 60,000 \ncollege graduates enter into teaching. In my home state of Louisiana, \nalmost one in five of our teachers has not completed the standard \nregimen for teaching. One of the main detractors for qualified \nprofessionals to choose to enter the profession of teaching is simply \nthat the salaries cover little more than life's daily expenses. While \nthe amount of salary a teacher makes is not determined by the federal \ngovernment, that does not preclude us from putting forth innovative \nstrategies to address the gaps left by these salaries. In fact, I think \nit is our responsibility to do all that we can to assist states in \ntheir efforts to bring the best and the brightest teachers into our \nnation's classrooms. The federal tax code provides us with several \nopportunities to acknowledge and reward teachers for the work that they \ndo for our children everyday.\n  I am proud to join Senator Collins in introducing the ``Teacher \nSupport Act of 2001''. This bill allows educators to receive a tax \ncredit for some of the costs associated with furthering their \nprofessional development. Specifically, it will allow educators to \ndeduct professional development expenses, without requiring the \ndeduction to be subject to the existing two percent floor. In addition, \nthis legislation creates an above the line deduction, allowing for \nteachers who do not itemize their taxes to take advantage of these \nhelpful benefits. And finally, it allows educators to claim a tax \ncredit of up to $100 for books, supplies, and equipment that they \npurchase for their students.\n  This is the first of the many steps we as a body must take toward \nbuilding a system of supports for our teachers. This small investment \nwill have an inordinate impact on their ability to provide effective \ninstruction to our nation's school children. Henry B. Adams once said \n``A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell, where his influence \nstops.'' With this in mind, I ask you to support this bill and others \nlike it, so that we can truly affect the future of education in \nAmerica.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 205. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to waive \nthe income inclusion on a distribution from an individual retirement \naccount to the extent that the distribution is contributed for \ncharitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will enhance and encourage charitable contributions in the United \nStates.\n  As many know, this week, the President is set to unveil a number of \ninitiatives to promote charitable giving and to expand the role that \ncharities and faith-based institutions play in attacking social \nproblems in the United States.\n  Government alone is incapable of solving society's most vexing \nproblems. In fact, government programs often fail in their missions. \nThe old welfare system is a perfect example of what often goes wrong. \nUnder the old system, we encouraged people to stay on welfare. We \nencouraged out-of-wedlock births. We encouraged fathers to live out of \nthe home. We ended this with our welfare reform bill. Welfare rolls \nhave now dropped by half across the United States.\n  The track record of charitable organizations have been far superior \nthan the government's in tackling social ills. America's top charities \ncover a broad range of problems, from the Salvation Army to the YMCA, \nand the American Cancer Society to the Red Cross. Each is playing a \nrole in improving America's health, education and welfare. How \nsuccessful can they be? It has been known that mentors in the Big \nBrothers/Big Sisters program can cut drug abuse by 50 percent.\n  Americans appreciate the role of these groups. They are actively \ninvolved in charitable causes. Nearly half of all Americans volunteer \nin some capacity on a regular basis.\n  Nearly 25 percent of all Americans are active in their religion on a \nvolunteer basis. This is why it is so logical to use faith-based \norganizations as means of accomplishing objectives at which the \ngovernment has failed. The Chicago Tribune recently noted that \n``churches, temples and prayer halls cannot replace the mammoth task of \nhelping the needy. But, they do a better and more efficient job of \nunderstanding their communities and meeting the need of their \ncitizens.''\n  The legislation I am introducing today will make it easier for \ncharitable contributions to the made and for charitable organizations \nto pursue their missions. Under this bill, individuals age 59\\1/2\\ and \nolder will be able to move assets penalty-free from an IRA directly to \na charity or into a qualifying deferred charitable gift plan, such as a \ncharitable remainder trust, pooled income fund or gift annuity. Current \nlaw requires taxpayers to first withdraw the IRA proceeds, pay the \ntaxes due and then contribute the funds to a charity. Taxes can be \noffset by the current charitable deduction, but only to an extent.\n  Americans currently hold well over $1 trillion in assets in IRAs, and \nnearly half of America's families have IRAs. This bill will allow \nsenior citizens who have provided for their retirement--but find that \nthey do not need their entire IRA for living expenses--to transfer IRA \nfunds to charity without dilution. This will cut bureaucratic obstacles \nto charitable giving and unlock a substantial amount of new funds that \ncould flow to America's charitable organizations.\n  I first introduced this legislation in 1998, and it was folded into \nour tax bill\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\nin 1999. Regrettably, it was vetoed by the President. But, given our \nnew leadership in the White House, this is an idea whose times has \ncome. In fact, President Bush made this part of his tax plan when it \nwas unveiled in 1999.\n  This is also not a partisan proposal. Senator Durbin was an original \nco-sponsor of this legislation. I look forward to working with him, and \nthe White House on this bill. It also has the support of numerous \nuniversities and charitable groups, including the Charitable Accord and \nthe Council of Foundations, two umbrella organizations representing \nmore than 2,000 organizations and associations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison, the charitable IRA Rollover Act of 2001. \nWe introduced this legislation in the last Congress. While it was \nincluded in last year's year-end tax bill, our provision was \nunfortunately stripped out at the last minute Senator Hutchison and I \nsincerely hope that this legislation will become law this year.\n  The IRA Charitable Rollover Act has the support of numerous \ncharitable organizations across the United States. The effect of this \nbill would be to unlock billions of dollars in savings Americans hold \nand make them available to charities. Our legislation will allow \nindividuals to roll assets from an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) \ninto a charity or a deferred charitable gift plan without incurring any \nincome tax consequences. Thus, the donation would be made to charity \nwithout every withdrawing it as income and paying tax on it.\n  Americans currently hold well over $1 trillion in assets in IRAs. \nNearly half of America's families have IRAs. Recent studies show that \nassets of qualified retirement plans comprise a substantial part of the \nnet worth of many persons. Many of these individuals would like to give \na portion of these assets to charity.\n  Under our current law, if an IRA is transferred into a charitable \nremainder trust, donors are required to recognize that as income. \nTherefore, absent the changes called for in the legislation, the donor \nwill have taxable income in the year the gift is funded. This is a huge \ndisincentive contained in our complicated and burdensome tax code. This \nlegislation will unleash a critical source of funding for our nation's \ncharities. This legislation will provide millions of Americans with a \ncommon sense way to remove obstacles to private charitable giving.\n  Under the Hutchison-Durbin plan, an individual, upon reaching age \n59\\1/2\\, could move assets penalty-free from an IRA directly to charity \nor into a qualifying deferred charitable gift plan--e.g. charitable \nremainder trusts, pooled income funds and gift annuities. In the latter \ncase the donor would be able to receive an income stream from the \nretirement plan assets, which would be taxed according to normal rules. \nUpon the death of the individual, the remainder would be transferred to \ncharity.\n  There are numerous supporters of this legislation including \nGeorgetown University, the Art Institute of Chicago, the University of \nChicago, the Field Museum, the Catholic Diocese of Peoria, Northwestern \nUniversity, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and others. There are over \n100 groups in Illinois alone that support this sensible legislation.\n  I hope the Senate will join in this bi-partisan effort to provide a \nvaluable new source of philanthropy for our nation's charities. I hope \nthat our colleagues will co-sponsor this important piece of legislation \nand that it will be enacted into law this year. I thank the Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Hutchison, for working with me and my staff in this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Shelby (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Gramm, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lott, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 206. A bill to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of \n1935, to enact the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2001, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act of 2001. This bipartisan bill is designed \nto help America's energy consumers by repealing an antiquated law that \nis keeping the benefits of competition from reaching our citizens. I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Gramm and Sarbanes, chairman and \nranking member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \nSenator Murkowski, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Majority Leader Lott, and Senators Dodd, Craig, and Crapo in \nintroducing this important legislation. Our bill, which closely tracks \nlegislation voted out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan \nsupport in the 106th Congress, repeals the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act of 1935, PUHCA.\n  The original PUHCA legislation passed over 60 years ago in 1935. At \nthat time, a few large holding companies controlled a great majority of \nthe electric utilities and gas pipelines. However, such a limited \nnumber of providers no longer offer a majority of the utility service. \nIn fact, over 80 percent of the utility holding companies are currently \nexempt from PUHCA.\n  This legislation implements the recommendations that the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, SEC made first in 1981 and then again in 1995 \nfollowing an extensive study of the effects of this antiquated law on \nour energy markets. In the 1995 report entitled. ``The Regulation of \nPublic-Utility Holding Companies,'' the Division of Investment \nManagement recommended that Congress conditionally repeal the Act since \n``the current regulatory system imposes significant costs, indirect \nadministrative charges and foregone economies of scale and scope . . \n.'' In the end, the report serves to highlight the fact that the \nregulatory restraints imposed by PUHCA on our electric and gas \nindustries are counterproductive in today's competitive environment and \nare based on historical assumptions and industry models that are no \nlonger valid.\n  In order to ensure that ratepayers are protected, this bill provides \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the States access to the \nbooks and records of holding company systems that are relevant to the \ncosts incurred by jurisdictional public utility companies. As a result, \nthe regulatory framework to protect consumers is not only protected in \nthis bill, but enhanced.\n  Let me be clear about the effect of PUHCA repeal: it eliminates \nredundant and burdensome regulation while enhancing existing consumer \nprotections.\n  Mr. President, we are at a time in our nation's history when we are \ngoing to have to make some critical choices regarding our national \nenergy policy. The fact is, future technological innovation and \neconomic growth is contingent upon this country's ability to meet its \never increasing demand for energy. In order to do this, we need to \nmodernize production systems, increase market competition, and strip \naway unnecessary regulations. Achieving these goals is going to be a \ndifficult and time consuming process. However, repeal of this law would \nbe the first step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, it has been a very long time since it first became \nclear that this out dated, Depression-era law had become an unnecessary \nconstraint on the ability of American gas and electric utilities to \ncompete. Unfortunately, the many bipartisan efforts to repeal PUHCA \nhave not been successful. However, strong support still exists for its \nelimination. I believe that it is imperative that we achieve this goal \nin the 107th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 206\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was \n     intended to facilitate the work of Federal and State \n     regulators by placing certain constraints on the activities \n     of holding company systems;\n       (2) developments since 1935, including changes in other \n     regulation and in the electric and gas industries, have \n     called into question the continued relevance of the model of \n     regulation established by that Act;\n       (3) there is a continuing need for State regulation in \n     order to ensure the rate protection of utility customers; and\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\n       (4) limited Federal regulation is necessary to supplement \n     the work of State commissions for the continued rate \n     protection of electric and gas utility customers.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to eliminate unnecessary regulation, yet continue to \n     provide for consumer protection by facilitating existing rate \n     regulatory authority through improved Federal and State \n     commission access to books and records of all companies in a \n     holding company system, to the extent that such information \n     is relevant to rates paid by utility customers, while \n     affording companies the flexibility required to compete in \n     the energy markets; and\n       (2) to address protection of electric and gas utility \n     customers by providing for Federal and State access to books \n     and records of all companies in a holding company system that \n     are relevant to utility rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reduce health care costs and promote improved \nhealth care by providing supplemental grants for additional preventive \nhealth services for women; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, although we often think of cardiovascular \ndisease as a men's health issue, the American Heart Association \nestimates that nearly one in two women will die of heart disease or \nstroke. However, because of its historically male stereotype, most \nwomen do not realize that they are at such high risk for cardiovascular \ndisease even though cardiovascular diseases kills nearly 50,000 more \nwomen each year than men. Even more alarming is data reported by the \nSociety for Women's Health Research which revealed that not all \nphysicians know that cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of \ndeath among American women.\n  Each year nearly half a million women lose their lives as a result of \nheart disease and stroke. Fortunately, men have experienced a decline \nin deaths due to cardiovascular diseases since 1984; but women have \nnot, and many of these tragic deaths could have been prevented had \nthese women known they were at risk. For instance, they could have \ntaken preventive measures by not smoking, lowering their cholesterol or \nblood pressure, or by eating more nutritiously, and perhaps avoided \nbecoming a victim of heart disease or stroke. For many women, \nprevention is truly the only cure, since it has been reported that as \nmany as two-thirds of women who die from heart attacks have no warning \nsymptoms of any kind.\n  Cardiovascular diseases kill more American females each year than the \nnext 14 causes of death combined, including all forms of cancers. Over \nhalf of all cardiovascular deaths each year are women, and in 1997 \nalone heart diseases claimed the lives of more than half a million \nwomen. My own home state of Tennessee has the second highest death rate \nfrom heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in the \nnation and the 13th highest ranking state in women's heart deaths. In \n1997, 10,884 Tennessee women died from these two cardiovascular \ndiseases alone. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) reports that women in the rural South are more likely \nto die of heart disease than those in other parts of the country.\n  Fortunately, some preventive measures, such as physical activity and \nbetter nutrition, can be taken by women to reduce their risk for \ncardiovascular diseases, as well as other preventable diseases, such as \nosteoporosis--a disease that affects one out of every two women over 50 \nand threatens roughly 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are \nwomen.\n  To continue to draw greater awareness to health issues among American \nwomen, particularly cardiovascular diseases, I am very pleased to \nreintroduce legislation which I introduced last Congress, the \n``WISEWOMAN Expansion Act of 2001,'' with Senator Harkin. Our goal in \nexpanding this program is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular \ndiseases, and other preventable diseases, and to increase access to \nscreening and other preventive measures for low-income and underinsured \nwomen. In addition to making cardiovascular diseases screening \naccessible to underserved women, this program will also educate them \nabout their risk for cardiovascular diseases and how to make lifestyle \nchanges--thereby giving them the power to prevent these diseases.\n  The CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program \n(NBCCEDP) is an example of a successful program that has provided \ncritical services to help prevent major diseases affecting American \nwomen. The NBCCEDP has done an outstanding job of reaching out to low-\nincome underinsured women--women who are generally too young for \nMedicare and unable to qualify for Medicaid or other state programs--\nand providing them with preventive screenings for breast and cervical \ncancers. These women would likely otherwise fall through the cracks in \nour health system.\n  Our bill provides for the expansion of the WISEWOMAN (Well-Integrated \nScreening and Evaluation for Women in Massachusetts, Arizona, and North \nCarolina) demonstration project, which is run by the CDC in conjunction \nwith the NBCCEDP, to additional states. The WISEWOMAN program \ncapitalizes on the highly successful infrastructure of the NBCCEDP to \noffer ``one-stop shopping'' screening and preventive services for \nuninsured and low-income women. In addition to these very important \nbreast and cervical cancer screenings, WISEWOMAN screens for \ncardiovascular disease risk factors and provides health counseling and \nlifestyle interventions to help women reduce behavioral risk factors. \nThe program addresses risk factors such as elevated cholesterol, high \nblood pressure, obesity and smoking and provides important additional \nintervention and educational services to women who would not otherwise \nhave access to cardiovascular disease screening or prevention. This \nbill also adds flexibility to the program language that would allow \nscreenings and other preventive measures for diseases in addition to \ncardiovascular diseases, such as osteoporosis, as more preventive \ntechnology is developed.\n  I would like to thank Judy Womack and Dr. Joy Cox of the Tennessee \nDepartment of Health for their counsel and assistance on this \nlegislation and for their efforts in helping Tennesseans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that three letters supporting the WISEWOMAN \nExpansion Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       American Heart Association,\n\n\n                                    Office of Public Advocacy,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Bill Frist, M.D.,\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Harkin: Heart attack, stroke and \n     other cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of \n     death of women in the United States. Heart disease, alone, is \n     the number one killer of American women and stroke is the \n     number three killer. In fact, low-income women are at an even \n     higher risk of heart disease and stroke than other women, and \n     they have a higher prevalence of risk factors contributing to \n     these diseases. The American Heart Association is very \n     grateful for the support you and other members of the United \n     States Congress have given to the WISEWOMAN demonstration \n     program which uses the National Breast and Cervical Cancer \n     Early Detection Program network to provide heart disease and \n     stroke screening services, as well as diet and physical \n     activity interventions and appropriate referrals.\n       The American Heart Association applauds the WISEWOMAN \n     program and we are anticipating even greater results in the \n     battle against heart disease and stroke as the program \n     expands to serve more women throughout the United States. The \n     Frist-Harkin ``WISEWOMAN Expansion Act of 2001'' will expand \n     WISEWOMAN's heart disease and stroke screenings beyond its \n     current limit, which we believe will have a tremendous \n     positive impact to the cardiovascular health of women who \n     live in states served by the program.\n       The American Heart Association recommends increased funding \n     and expansion of the WISEWOMAN program during fiscal year \n     2002. Also, because of the solid scientific evidence that \n     cardiovascular screenings can help prevent heart disease and \n     stroke in women, we believe cardiovascular screenings \n     provided by WISEWOMAN should be expanded before using the \n     demonstration program to provide screenings for other \n     diseases affecting women.\n       We thank you for your commitment to fighting heart disease \n     and stroke, and look forward to your continued support in the \n     future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Rose Marie Robertson, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       Society for\n\n\n                                      Women's Health Research,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Public Health, Committee on Health, \n         Education, Labor, and Pensions, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Public Health, Committee on \n         Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Harkin: On behalf of the Society \n     for Women's Health Research, we express our appreciation for \n     your leadership on the introduction of the ``WISEWOMAN \n     Expansion Act of 2001.'' In addition to a strong national \n     research program, disease prevention is vital to our nation's \n     health. Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, \n     diabetes, and osteoporosis are among the most prevalent, \n     costly, and preventable of all health problems.\n       As you know, women tend to live longer but not necessarily \n     better than men. They have more chronic health conditions and \n     are more economically insecure. Safety net programs often are \n     the difference between life and death. The WISEWOMAN \n     Expansion Act is building on a foundation that has provided \n     positive feedback and will allow additional states to provide \n     prevention services to those women in need. We applaud the \n     flexibility of the legislation. With the passage of time, as \n     new technologies develop, as disease burdens shift, and as \n     lifestyles change, the program can address women's most \n     critical health needs.\n       We thank you for your commitment to improving the nation's \n     health through prevention. By focusing on the health of \n     women, you ultimately will be improving the health of the \n     nation's families.\n           Sincerely,\n     Phyliss Greenberger,\n       President and CEO.\n     Roberta Biegel,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Osteoporosis Foundation,\n\n                                                 January 29, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Frist: On behalf of the National \n     Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), I commend you on the \n     introduction of the bipartisan WISEWOMAN Expansion Act of \n     2001 that supports your effort to provide additional \n     preventive health services, including osteoporosis screening, \n     to low-income and uninsured women.\n       As you know, osteoporosis is a major health threat for more \n     than 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women. In \n     the United States today, 10 million individuals already have \n     the disease and 18 million more have low bone mass, placing \n     them at increased risk for osteoporosis. Also, one out of \n     every two women over 50 will have an osteoporosis-related \n     fracture in their lifetime. It is estimated that the direct \n     hospital and nursing home costs of osteoporosis are over \n     $13.8 billion annually, with much of that attributed to the \n     more than 1.5 million osteoporosis-related fractures that \n     occur annually.\n       The health care services included in the WISEWOMAN program \n     have provided positive results for many women who have \n     participated and ultimately cost-savings for the states that \n     have participated. Expansion of the WISEWOMAN model to \n     additional states and for additional preventive services, \n     such as screening for osteoporosis, should enhance positive \n     results for both the women and states participating in the \n     program.\n       The National Osteoporosis Foundation is most appreciative \n     of your efforts to promote improved both health and endorse \n     the WISEWOMAN Expansion Act of 2001.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Sandra C. Raymond,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Frist today \nto introduce the ``WISEWOMAN Expansion Act.'' This bill will help \nthousands of women have access to basic preventive health care they may \notherwise not receive. The legislation builds on a successful \ndemonstration program and expands screening services and preventive \ncare for uninsured and low-income women across the nation.\n  Beginning in 1990, I worked as Chairman of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education Appropriation Subcommittee to provide the \nfunding for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \nProgram, NBCCEDP, run through the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. In Iowa alone, the program has successfully served close to \n9000 women through 618 provider-based breast and cervical cancer \nscreening sites.\n  Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently run \nthe WISEWOMAN program through the NBCCEDP as a demonstration project. \nThe program has successfully built upon the framework of the NBCCEDP to \ntarget other chronic diseases among women, including heart disease, the \nleading cause of death among women, and osteoporosis. The programs \naddress risk factors such as elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, \nobesity and smoking and provide important intervention services.\n  This demonstration project has been successful. It is now time to \nexpand the program to additional states, and eventually make it \nnationwide. As the brother of two sisters lost to breast cancer and the \nfather of two daughters, I know first hand the importance of making \nwomen's health initiatives a top priority. The first step to fighting a \nchronic disease like cancer, heart disease or osteoporosis is early \ndetection. All women deserve to benefit from the early detection and \nprevention made possible by the latest advances in medicine. This bill \nensures a place for lower income woman at the health care table.\n  The majority of Americans associate cardiovascular disease with men, \nbut the American Heart Association estimates that nearly one in two \nwomen will die of heart disease or stroke. In fact, cardiovascular \ndiseases kills nearly 50,000 more women each year than men. In my own \nstate of Iowa, cardiovascular disease accounts for 44 percent of all \ndeaths in Iowa. Close to 7,000 women die annually in Iowa from \ncardiovascular disease. Each year, nearly half a million women lose \ntheir lives as a result of heart disease and stroke. Sadly, with \nappropriate screening and interventions, many of these deaths could \nhave been prevented.\n  Osteoporosis is also a preventable disease and affects one out of \nevery two women over the age of 50. Fortunately, some of the preventive \nmeasures women can take to reduce their risk for cardiovascular \ndiseases, such as eating more nutritious foods and exercising, can also \nreduce their risk for osteoporosis.\n  Our bill would do the following:\n  Expand the current WISEWOMAN demonstration project to additional \nstates;\n  Add flexibility to program language that would allow screenings and \nother preventive measures for diseases in addition to cardiovascular \ndiseases;\n  Allow flexibility for the WISEWOMAN program to grow and adapt with \nthe changing needs of individual states and our better understanding of \nnew preventive strategies; and\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\n  Ensure continued full collaboration of the WISEWOMAN program with the \nNBCCEDP; Authorize the CDC to make competitive grants to states to \ncarry out additional preventive health services to the breast and \ncervical cancer screenings at NBCCEDP programs, such as: screenings for \nblood pressure, cholesterol, and osteoporosis; health education and \ncounseling; lifestyle interventions to change behavioral risk factors \nsuch as smoking, lack of exercise, poor nutrition, and sedentary \nlifestyle; and appropriate referrals for medical treatment and follow-\nup services.\n  In order to be eligible for this program, states are required to \nalready participate in the NBCCEDP and to agree to operate their \nWISEWOMAN program in collaboration with the NBCCEDP.\n  This bipartisan legislation has the support of the National \nOsteoporosis Foundation, the American Heart Association, the American \nCancer Society and the Komen Foundation, among others. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 210. A bill to authorize the integration and consolidation of \nalcohol and substance abuse programs and services provided by Indian \ntribal governments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by the \nVice Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs Senator Daniel K. \nInouye in introducing the Native American Alcohol and Substance Abuse \nProgram Consolidation Act of 2001. This important legislation will \nauthorize Indian Tribes to consolidate and integrate alcohol, substance \nabuse prevention and treatment and mental health programs to provide \nmore comprehensive treatment and services to Native Americans across \nthe country.\n  More often than not, individuals with alcohol and substance abuse \nproblems are also hobbled with mental health problems, and this bill \nauthorizes tribes to make mental health services available as well.\n  Native Americans have higher rates of alcohol and drug use than any \nother racial or ethnic group in the United States. Despite previous \ntreatment and preventive efforts, alcoholism and substance abuse \ncontinue to be prevalent among Native youth: 82 percent of Native \nadolescents admitted to having used alcohol, compared with 66 percent \nof non-Native youth.\n  Alcohol continues to be an important risk factor associated with the \ntop three killers of Native youngsters--accidents, suicide, and \nhomicide.\n  Based on 1993 data, the rate of mortality due to alcoholism among \nNative youth ages 15 to 24 was 5.2 per 100,000, which is 17 times the \nrate for whites in the same age group.\n  In a 1994 school-based study, 39 percent of Native high school \nseniors reported having ``gotten drunk'' and 39 percent of Native kids \nadmitted to using marijuana.\n  Alcohol and substance abuse also contribute to other social problems \nincluding sexually transmitted diseases, child and spousal abuse, poor \nschool achievement and dropout, unemployment, drunk-driving and \nvehicular deaths, mental health problems, hopelessness and suicide.\n  Alcohol, substance abuse, and mental health program funds are \navailable to tribes from virtually every agency in the federal \ngovernment including the Departments of Education, Health and Human \nServices, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, and \nTransportation.\n  To help Tribes slice through the bureaucracy, this bill authorizes \nTribal governments and inter-Tribal organizations to: 1, consolidate \nthese programs through a single federal office in the Department of \nHealth and Human Services--Indian Health Services, IHS; and 2, use a \nsingle plan to reduce the administrative and bureaucratic processes, \nresulting in better services to Native Americans.\n  This bill tries to replicate the success of the widely-hailed ``477 \nmodel'' that Tribes have used to effectively coordinate employment \ntraining and related services through the Indian Employment Training \nand Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992, Pub. Law 102-477.\n  Under the ``477 model,'' and applicant Tribe files a single plan to \ndraw and coordinate resources from the spectrum of federal agencies and \nadminister them through one office. I am hopeful that armed with this \ncreative tool, Tribes can begin to bring an end to the devastation of \nalcohol and drug abuse in their communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Education Amendments of 1978 and the \nTribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 to improve education for \nIndians, Native Hawaiians, and Alaskan Natives; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by the \nVice Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Daniel K. \nInouye, in introducing legislation to improve the education delivery \nsystems in Indian schools so that the President's goal that ``no child \nbe left behind'' is as true for Native youngsters as for all Americans.\n  Grounded in the Constitution, treaties, federal statutes and court \ndecisions, the United States has a unique role in the education of \nNative people. This is especially true for the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nschool system for schools on or near reservations built and designed by \nthe federal government. The only other school system in which the \nfederal role is so significant is with Department of Defense schools \nfor the children of those serving our nation in the armed forces.\n  As a youngster from a troubled background and a former teacher \nmyself, I firmly believe that more than ever a quality education holds \nthe key to a brighter and more hopeful future. I also know that the \nlife-blood of Native people and the best chance they have for improving \nthe lives of all their members lies in a well-educated community. In \nshort, I believe community development starts with individual \ndevelopment and education is the key.\n  Like President Bush, I believe that education reform stands at the \ntop of our national agenda. Education reform in Indian country is \ncritical if this nation's Native people are to make the kind of \nadvancement that is so clearly needed.\n  The geography of much of Indian country is difficult: from wintry \nAlaska, to the windswept Plains, to the searing heat of the Southwest, \nthe terrain often makes it hard to get to school, let alone do well in \nschool. I believe this reality must be acknowledged as we work to \nimprove Native school systems.\n  Members of the Committee on Indian Affairs know all too well that the \nconditions in many, if not most, Indian schools is appalling: crumbling \nfacilities, asbestos and PCBs, lead paint, lack of heat and other \nproblems combine to make the schools nearly uninhabitable. Most \nmembers, indeed most Americans, would probably pull their children from \nschool if they were subjected to these conditions.\n  We made a solid start at facilities replacement and repair with the \nFiscal Year 2001 Interior appropriations bill which provided nearly \n$300 million in funds for these purposes.\n  Nevertheless, the backlog in school construction needs is still in \nthe $800 to 900 million range.\n  I am very encouraged by President Bush's plan to establish an Indian \ntribal school capital improvement fund of more than $900 million to \nrectify the facilities crisis.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Native American Educational \nImprovement Act of 2001, will improve education for Native people in a \nvariety of ways.\n  Title I of the bill will amend the Education Amendments of 1978 in \nseveral respects. This legislation was enacted to provide a \ncomprehensive structure for the BIA funded schools system including \ngrant, contract and BIA operated schools.\n  The bill addresses most aspects of the BIA school system including \nstandards and accreditation, facilities and various funding issues. It \nalso provides guidance for how funding should be allocated by \nestablishing a formula to effect a more equitable distribution of \nfunds. The formula is based on weighted student units with extra weight \ngiven for such things as disabilities of gifted and talented abilities.\n  In keeping with the policy of Indian Self Determination, the bill \ncarves out a key role for Indian Tribes by requiring that actions \nundertaken pursuant to the Act be done in consultation with the Tribes. \nThis emphasis on maximizing local, Indian involvement is witnessed in \nthe bill in several respects including the use of negotiated rule-\nmaking in proposing and developing regulations to carry out the Act.\n  There is no single federal policy more successful than the \ncontracting and compacting opportunities provided by the Indian Self \nDetermination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, as amended.\n\n  Tribes and Tribal consortia have demonstrated that when they are \nprovided the resources and flexibility to design and implement programs \nand services formerly provided by the Federal government, good things \nhappen: 1, the quality of those services is refined; 2, the Tribe or \nconsortium enhances its administrative and managerial abilities; and 3, \nfederal resources are used more efficiently and effectively.\n  In keeping with this pattern, the bill authorizes Tribal contractors \nto perform all functions that are not inherently federal.\n  The bill will unshackle local authorities from the constraints of \ncentralized management by authorizing Tribes to waive BIA school \nstandards and design and implement standards that will better meet the \nneeds of that Tribe's students.\n  Standards, flexibility and accreditation are important aspects of any \ngood school system, but so is a sufficient pool of resources.\n  This bill will help evaluate whether funding levels for BIA schools \nare sufficient and seeks a review by the General Accounting Office to \nthat effect.\n  While the core purpose of the Act is to provide a blueprint for the \nBIA school system, the bill I introduce today incorporates Tribal \ndepartments of education as well as early childhood development \nprograms that provide services to meet the needs of parents and \nchildren under age six.\n  Title II of the bill amends the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of \n1988, TCSA, by expanding the opportunities for Tribal operation of \nschools that would otherwise be run by the BIA.\n  Passage of the TCSA in 1988 grew out of dissatisfaction with the \nmethod of contracting educational services under the Indian Self \nDetermination and Education Assistance Act, P.L. 93-638, ISDEAA.\n  While many services were being successfully contracted by Tribes \nunder ISDEAA, education continued to be plagued with problems and \nTribes were looking for an alternative to contracts.\n  The bill I am introducing today is grounded in the concept of ``lump-\nsum'' financing to Indian Tribes. This approach is intended to address \nsome of the problems faced by ISDEAA contractors. That is, if a Tribe \nwants to operate a school pursuant to contract, it would be forced to \nnegotiate a separate contract for each of the various school functions. \nA separate contract was required for transportation, for programs, for \noperations and maintenance, and other functions. This bill will \nconsolidate these and other functions into one contract.\n  The grant schools operated by Tribes are provided considerable \nlatitude in managing their finances provided that four specific \nrequirements are met: As long as a grant school 1, submits an annual \nprogram report; 2, submits an evaluation report; 3, is accredited; and \n4, adheres to the federal Single Audit Act, then that school may \ncontinue to enjoy the flexibility afforded it under P.L. 100-297.\n  Last, to ensure that Tribal initiative and creativity are not \nthwarted unnecessarily, this bill prohibits regulations from being \nestablished unless specifically authorized.\n  I have highlighted but a few of the major provisions included in this \nbill and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \ninitiative. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 211\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nrevise and extend such Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by the \nVice Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Daniel K. \nInouye, and former Chairman, Senator John McCain in introducing \nimportant legislation to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct of 1976, the ``IHCIA'' or the ``Act''.\n  The United States first provided health services to Indians in 1824 \nas part of the War Department's handling of Indian affairs. In 1849 \nthis responsibility went to the newly-created Department of the \nInterior where it rested until 1955 when it was transferred to the \nPublic Health Service's Indian Health Agency.\n  The evolution of the Indian Health Service from an ad hoc service \nprovided to Indians by the BIA to a specialized agency within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services was completed with the passage \nof the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976.\n  In 1970, President Nixon issued his now-famous ``Special Message to \nCongress on Indian Affairs'' laying out the rationale for a more \nenlightened Federal Indian Policy: Indian Self-Determination.\n  Self-Determination is the core principle embodied in the IHCIA the \nmain purposes of which are to improve the health status of Indian \npeople and to increase the number of Indians involved in the health \nprofessions.\n  The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, \nthe IHCIA, and the amendments to each over the years can all be traced \ndirectly to the fundamental changes first proposed in 1970.\n  I am proud to say that legislation I proposed in the 106th Congress, \nthe Indian Tribal Self-Governance Amendments of 2000, were enacted into \nlaw as Public Law 106-260. The bill we introduce today builds on this \nnew law in important respects.\n  By introducing the IHCIA reauthorization bill, we re-affirm Indian \nSelf-Determination and the principles of the IHCIA (1) that the \nprovision of Federal health services is consistent with the federal-\ntribal relationship; (2) that a goal of the U.S. is to provide the \nquantity and quality of services to raise the health status of Indians; \n(3) that Indian participation in the planning and management of health \nservices should be maximized; and (4) that the numbers of American \nIndians and Alaska Natives trained in health professions be maximized.\n  Before the passage of the Act in 1976 the mortality rate for Indian \ninfants was 25 percent higher than that of non-Indian babies. The death \nrates for mothers was 82 percent higher and the mortality rates from \ninfectious disease-causing diarrhea and dehydration was 138 percent \ngreater.\n  Today we can see marked improvements. Infant mortality rates have \nbeen reduced by 54 percent, maternal mortality rates have been reduced \nby 65 percent, tuberculosis mortality by 80 percent and overall \nmortality rates have been reduced by 42 percent.\n  While encouraging, these statistics mask the fact that the health \nstatus of Native people in America is still poor and below that of all \nother racial and ethnic groups.\n  While we will continue to push forward on all fronts in seeking to \nimprove Indian health services, I believe that there are three emergent \nissues that we need to address; urban Indian health care; Indian health \nfacilities construction needs; and the booming problem of diabetes.\n  Undoubtedly the 2000 decennial census will likely show what past \ncounts have shown--that more than one-half of the 2.3 million American \nIndians and Alaska Natives reside off-reservation and are referred to \nas ``urban Indians.'' Though the health services framework that now \nexists has slowly begun to acknowledge this trend, I am concerned that \nurban Indian health care needs require a more focused and vigorous \napproach.\n  Another problem that must be addressed is the growing backlog in \nhealth care facilities construction. Recent estimates show that there \nis some $900 million in unmet facilities needs. The dogged approach to \neliminating this backlog by relying on federal appropriations will not \nwork, and I strongly believe that innovative proposals need to be made, \nrefined and perfected in order to accomplish our common goal.\n  I am heartened by the cooperative federal-tribal efforts in making \nthe Joint Venture Program a success and look forward to building on \nthis success in the coming years.\n  Ailments of affluence continue to seep into Native communities and \nerode the quality of life and very social fabric that holds these \ncommunities together. Alcohol and substance abuse continue to take a \nheavy toll and diabetes is reaching alarmingly high rates. Most \ntroubling is the increasing obesity and diabetes that is occurring with \nalarming frequency in Native youngsters.\n  It is now time to make the extra effort to look at the positive \nthings we have accomplished and build upon them.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction on these and other health \nmatters. The bill we introduced last year was the product of months-\nlong consultations by a group of very dedicated individuals consisting \nof Indian Tribal leaders, health and legal professionals, and \nrepresentatives of the private and public health care sectors. The \ngroup reviewed existing law and has proposed changes to improve the \ncurrent system by stressing local flexibility and choice, and making it \nmore responsive to the health needs of Indian people.\n  I am hopeful that in moving forward this year we can draw from the \nhearing record built after no fewer than five hearings on the bill that \nwas introduced in the 106th Congress, S. 2526.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this key measure. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

In death rates for example, Indian \n     people suffer a death rate for diabetes mellitus that is 249 \n     percent higher than the death rate for all races in the \n     United States, a pneumonia and influenza death rate that is \n     71 percent higher, a tuberculosis death rate that is 533 \n     percent higher, and a death rate from alcoholism that is 627 \n     percent higher.\n\n     ``SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to update the \nfeasibility and suitability studies of 4 national historic trails and \nprovide for possible additions to such trails; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to \nthe National Trails System Act which would update the feasibility and \nsuitability studies of four national historic trails and allow possible \nadditions to them. The trails in question are the Oregon, the Mormon, \nthe Pony Express and the California National Historic Trails.\n  In 1978, the Oregon and Mormon trails were established by the \nNational Trails System Act. At that time the language of the bill \ndefined these trails as ``point to point,'' limiting them to one \nbeginning point and one destination. The Mormon Pioneer National \nHistoric Trail at that time was defined as the route Brigham Young took \nin 1846 through Iowa and then to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. The \nOregon Trail was defined narrowly as the route taken by settlers from \nIndependence, Missouri, to Oregon City from 1841 to 1848. It, too, was \nlimited to a single trail with only three variants.\n  Later, in 1992, Congress passed an amendment for the establishment of \nthe California and Pony Express National Historic Trails. This \namendment broadened the possibility of trail variants for the \nCalifornia Trail and provided a more accurate depiction of the original \ntrail. However, the legislation I am introducing today will provide \nadditional authority for variations to these trails.\n  To those of us in the West, these trails are the highways of our \nhistory. With this legislation, I hope to capture the stories made \nalong the side roads, as well. In many cases, our most interesting and \ntelling history was made along the variations of the main trails. Since \nthe enactment of the National Trails System Act in 1978, there has been \na great deal of support to broaden the Act to include these side roads \nto history.\n  Not every pioneer company embarked on their journey from Omaha, \nNebraska or Independence, Missouri. Tens of thousands of settlers began \nfrom other starting points. These trail variations and alternate routes \nshow the ingenuity and adaptability of the poineers as they were forced \nto contend with inclement weather, lack of water, difficult terrain, \nand hostile Native American tribes. The variant routes taken by the \npioneers tell important stories that would otherwise slip through the \ncracks under a strict interpretation of the National Trails System Act.\n  The Act requires that comprehensive management and use plans be \nprepared for all historic trails. In 1981, such plans were completed \nfor the Mormon and Oregon trails. Since that time, however, endless \nhours of research by the Park Service and trails organizations have \nproduced a more complete picture of the westward expansion. The \nNational Park Service has determined, however, that legislation is \nrequired to update the trails with this newfound history.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today. This bill would \nauthorize the study of further important additions to the California, \nMormon Pioneer, Oregon, and Pony Express National Historic Trails and \nallow for a more complete story to be told of our history in the West.\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this issue today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Daschle, \n        and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 214. A bill to elevate the position of Director of the Indian \nHealth Service within the Department of Health and Human Services to \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Health, and for other purposes; to \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \ndesignate the Director of the Indian Health Service as an Assistant \nSecretary for Indian Health within the Department of Health and Human \nServices. My colleagues, Senators Inouye, Conrad, Daschle and Campbell \nare joining me in this effort as original co-sponsors. I am pleased to \nnote that Congressman Nethercutt from Washington will introduce \ncompanion legislation on the House side.\n  The purpose of this legislation is simple. It will redesignate the \ncurrent Director of the Indian Health Service, IHS, as a new Assistant \nSecretary within the Department of Health and Human Services to be \nresponsible for Indian health policy and budgetary matters.\n  As the primary health care delivery system, the Indian Health Service \nis the principal advocate for Indian health care needs, both on the \nreservation level and for urban populations. More than 1.5 million \nIndian people are served every year by the IHS. At its current \ncapacity, the IHS estimates that it can only meet about 60 percent of \ntribal health care needs. The IHS will continue to be challenged by a \ngrowing Indian population as well as an increasing disparity between \nthe health status of Indian people as compared to other Americans. \nThousands of Indian people continue to suffer from the worst imaginable \nhealth care conditions in Indian country--from diabetes to cancer to \ninfant mortality. In nearly every category, the health status of Native \nAmericans falls far below the national standard.\n  The purpose of this bill is to respond to the desire by Indian people \nfor a stronger leadership and policy role within the primary health \ncare agency, the Department of Health and Human Services. The Assistant \nSecretary for Indian Health will ensure that critical policy and \nbudgetary decisions will be made with the full involvement and \nconsultation of not only the Indian Health Service, but also the direct \ninvolvement of the Tribal governments.\n  This legislation is long overdue in bringing focus and national \nattention to the health care status of Indian people and fulfilling the \nfederal trust responsibility toward Indian tribes. Implementation of \nthis bill is intended to support the long-standing policies of Indian \nself-determination and tribal self-governance and assist Indian tribes \nwho are making positive strides in providing direct health care to \ntheir own communities.\n  Tribal communities are in dire need of a senior policy official who \nis knowledgeable about the programs administered by the IHS and who can \nprovide the leadership for the health care needs of American Indians \nand Alaska Natives. We continue to pursue passage of this legislation \nas many believe that the priority of Indian health issues within the \nDepartment should be raised to the highest levels within our federal \ngovernment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and the new Administration to ensure prompt passage of this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \npermit importation in personal baggage and by mail of certain covered \nproducts for personal use from certain foreign countries and to correct \nimpediments in implementation of the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety \nAct of 2000; to the\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce my first bill \nin the Senate, the Medication Equity and Drug Savings Act, or the MEDS \nAct.\n  On January 22, a little over a week ago, I had the privilege of \naddressing my colleagues in my first speech on the Senate floor. The \ntopic of the speech was health care, specifically the need to pass a \nstrong Patients' Bill of Rights. I pledged my commitment to making \nhealth care a priority during my tenure in this esteemed body.\n  Today, I am pleased to share with my colleagues that I am taking the \nnext step in keeping my promise by introducing a bill that addresses \nanother priority health care issue: the price of prescription drugs. We \nall know that providing prescription drugs for seniors has become a \nvery important issue for the American public. In fact, this was a key \nissue in many campaigns throughout the country, including my own.\n  On a fundamental level, I believe everyone should have access to \naffordable prescription drugs, especially senior citizens enrolled in \nMedicare and the disabled. It is an outrage that not only must those \nseniors, who rely solely on Medicare for their health insurance, pay \nfor all of their medications out of their own pockets, but that in many \ninstances they pay more for the same drug than their counterparts with \nother insurance.\n  So we have situations where those without insurance, and most often \nthis falls on our seniors--but anyone without insurance is most often \nwalking into the pharmacy and paying more. We did a study in my State \nthat showed, on average, they paid twice as much as someone with \ninsurance for the very same medications.\n  I have conducted several prescription drug price studies in Michigan, \nand I have learned that, in fact, there is a genuine problem that \ntouches the lives of so many people whom I represent. My concerns have \nbeen confirmed by literally thousands of letters and e-mails and phone \ncalls from seniors and families who cannot afford to buy their \nmedications.\n  I have been saddened by the sheer number of seniors who confided in \nme that the cost of their drugs is so high that they are often forced \nto give up their meals or are not able to heat their homes. In Michigan \nthat can be very serious in the wintertime. This is in order to buy \ntheir medications.\n  These are not new stories. I know my colleagues have heard these \nstories as well, but they are real. They are not just stories. They are \naffecting people today. As we speak, there are seniors somewhere \ndeciding whether or not they are going to skip their meals to get their \nmedicine, or whether they are going to eat and not have the medications \nthey need.\n  I also know from hearing from doctors in my district who are worried \nabout seniors, who decided to do their own self-regulation. They cannot \nafford all their pills, so they will skip a couple of pills, or they \nwill take them every other day, or cut them in half. Oftentimes they \nhave been placed in serious jeopardy as to their health because they \nhave not been able to afford their medications and they have taken them \ninappropriately.\n  The bottom line is that Medicare should include a defined, voluntary \nprescription drug benefit to help cover the costs of prescription drugs \nfor seniors and the disabled. I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues across the aisle, and the administration, to finish what we \nstarted last year and create this new component of Medicare that is \nabsolutely critical. Without it, we are not fulfilling the promise of \nuniversal health care for those over the age of 65, or the disabled. If \nwe do not cover medications, we are not providing health care in the \ntruest sense for those individuals.\n  In fact, one of the very first bills I cosponsored this year was S. \n10, a bill that would create this important benefit in the Medicare \nprogram. I am ready to work with my colleagues to make sure that we do \nwhatever it takes to update Medicare and create a defined benefit that \nwill make such an incredible difference in the lives of seniors and \ntheir families in my great State of Michigan and all across the \ncountry. As we work on this complex issue, there are other approaches \nwe can take in a more immediate sense to cut the costs of prescription \ndrugs.\n  Last year, Congress passed and the President signed into law an \nimportant new Act that would permit U.S. manufactured, FDA approved \ndrugs to be reimported back into the United States by wholesalers. I \nfirmly believe that implementing this Act could substantially reduce \nthe cost of drugs, not just for seniors, but for everyone.\n  Many of my colleagues may remember that during my campaign I \norganized several bus trips to Canada. As you know, Canada is just a \nshort trip over a bridge or through a tunnel for many residents of \nMichigan. What I discovered on my bus trips was almost unbelievable.\n  With just a short drive across the border, U.S. citizens can \nsubstantially reduce the cost of their medications by purchasing them \nin Canadian pharmacies. The difference in price for medications was \nabsolutely shocking. A price study I conducted, comparing the price of \nseveral drugs purchased in the U.S. to the Canadian prices, conformed \nwhat we saw happening on our bus trips--the price of the same drug \npurchased in Canada is substantially lower than the average U.S. price.\n  I have brought a chart to the floor to show my colleagues some of the \nincredible differences between the average price in Canada and the \naverage price in Michigan. I would like to point those out today.\n  Zocor, a drug to reduce cholesterol, costs $109.73 in Michigan for \n50, 5 milligram tablets. The same drug costs only $46.17 in Canada. \nThat is a 138 percent difference in price.\n  Prilosec, a drug to treat ulcers $115.37 in Michigan for 20, 20 \nmilligram capsules. The same drug costs only $55.10 in Canada. That is \na 109 percent difference in price.\n  Procardia XL, a drug to treat heart problems, costs $133.36 for 100, \n30 milligram tablets in Michigan. The same drug costs only $74.25 in \nCanada. That is an 80 percent difference in price.\n  Norvasc, a drug to treat high blood pressure, costs $116.79 for 90, 5 \nmilligram tablets. The same drug costs only $89.91 in Canada. That is a \n30 percent difference in price.\n  Tamoxifen, a drug to treat breast cancer, costs $136.50 in Michigan \nfor a one month supply. The same drug costs only $15.92 in Canada. That \nis an 88 percent savings in price.\n  Zoloft, a drug to treat depression, costs $220.64 for 100, 50 \nmilligram tablets in Michigan. The same drug costs $129.05 in Canada. \nThat is a 30 percent difference in price.\n  These are all drugs that have been manufactured in the United States \nand have met all FDA manufacturing, safety and purity requirements. \nFurthermore, because these are U.S. drugs, the companies developing and \nmanufacturing them have all benefited from substantial assistance from \nthe U.S. government, including NIH supported research and the Research \nand Development tax credit. Furthermore, a great deal of this research \nis conducted in state universities.\n  I believe that U.S. citizens should have access to these U.S. drugs \nthat are sold at lower prices in other countries. Competition is key to \nensuring prices that consumers are willing to pay. Keeping the Canadian \nborder, as well as other borders, closed is an obstacle to competition \nand is serving to maintain artificially high prices for drugs in the \nUnited States. I believe that permitting U.S. wholesalers, such as \npharmacies, to bring lower priced drugs back into this country could \nreduce the price of drugs for every American.\n  As my colleagues know, the Secretary of Health and Human Services was \ngiven broad discretion in implementing the wholesale reimportation \nprovision of the Act. The former Secretary expressed concerns that the \nprovision may not provide cost savings and could pose risks to the \npublic health and opted not to promulgate rules. I understand that my \ncolleagues are urging the new Secretary to reconsider this decision and \nto begin the implementation process. I am hopeful this may happen and \nwould like to work with my colleagues to forward this effort.\n  Nonetheless, I recognize that there are some concerns with the law \nenacted last year. My bill addresses these concerns by correcting these \nimpediments that may delay the Secretary from promulgating regulations \nand\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\npermitting reimportation. Furthermore, my bill directs the Secretary to \ndispense with the delay and instructs him to begin the rulemaking \nprocess within 30 days of enactment of the bill.\n  The first of the concerns about wholesale reimportation addressed by \nmy bill is the sunset provision. My bill would lift the 5 year sunset \nimposed in the Act. Critics argued that sunsetting the provision would \nbe a disincentive for distributors to develop ways to comply with the \nreimportation requirements when there was the possibility that \nreimportation could be prohibited again in the near future.\n  Careful thought was put into the requirements to ensure consumers \nwould be protected. I believe reimporters should be given every \nopportunity to meet these requirement and that removing the sunset will \ngive these distributors what they need.\n  Further, I believe consumers should always have access to U.S. \nmanufactured drugs as long as they comply with FDA safety requirements \nand there is no need for a sunset. If Congress or the administration \nidentifies safety concerns in the future, they should be addressed by \nrevising the reimportation safety requirements, not sunsetting the \nentire provision of the law.\n  The act also did not specify that reimorters could use the \nmanufacturers' FDA-approved labels. These labels are required by law if \nthe products are to be sold in the United States. My bill would make \nthose labels available to the reimporters from the manufacturers for a \nsmall fee.\n  Finally, while the act prohibited manufacturers from entering into \nagreements with distributors that would interfere with reimportation of \ndrugs, critics argue this provision was not strong enough to work. My \nlegislation tightens up this section by prohibiting manufacturers from \ndiscriminating against wholesalers simply because they intend to \nreimport the product.\n  The bill also has stronger language prohibiting price fixing. \nWholesale reimportation of prescription drugs is only half the story. \nWhile I think it is critical that wholesalers be permitted to bring \nU.S.-manufactured drugs back into the country to reduce the price for \nconsumers, I also believe individuals should be able to cross the \nborder and purchase medication for themselves.\n  The act we passed last year did not change the current law which \nprohibits individuals from bringing medications across the border for \ntheir own use. That is why my bill also makes personal reimportation \nlegal. I believe individuals should be able to cross the border and \npurchase prescription drugs at a lower price for their own use.\n  The FDA currently has an enforcement policy that permits individuals \nwho meet specific requirements to bring a 90-day supply of medication \nwith them into the United States from another country, and my \nlegislation would codify the current enforcement policy into law. It \nrequires essentially the same safety precautions currently expected of \nindividuals who bring medication over the border under the FDA's \nenforcement policy.\n  The bill also recognizes that some individuals may be too ill to \ncross the borders themselves and permits them to designate a proxy to \nbring the medication back for them as long as they provide a letter \nfrom their doctor indicating that the trip to another country would \nendanger their health.\n  The bill also provides opportunities for individuals to order \nmedication over the Internet--there are other new sites being \ndeveloped--and other means--hotlines, et cetera--in order to also have \nprescription drugs delivered by mail.\n  I am committed to this issue of making prescription drugs more \naffordable for everyone. This is a matter of fairness. This bill is a \nmatter of fairness to Americans, young and old, who need to have access \nto affordable prescription drugs. We as Americans ought not to be \nunderwriting the research and at the same time, after the medications, \nas great as they are, are developed, manufactured, and sold, have \nAmericans paying on average twice as much as those in other countries. \nThat makes no sense to me.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. I appreciate the time I have been given today. This is a \ncritical issue. I cannot think of a more serious issue affecting \nparticularly older people today than the issue of access to \nmedications. I think it is shameful that we have even one senior who is \nhaving to choose today, tomorrow, or next week between eating or taking \ntheir medicine. We can fix that. One way is to start with this \nlegislation which opens our borders and allows real competition for the \nbest price for American citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Commission for the comprehensive study \nof voting procedures in Federal, State, and local elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation which seeks to modernize Federal election voting procedures \nthroughout the United States. The 2000 election saga is now over and, \nin the words of President John F. Kennedy, ``Our task now is not to fix \nthe blame for the past, but to fix the course for the future.''\n  I believe that had we studied our country's voting and monitoring \nprocedures after President Kennedy's election, we would have in place \ntoday a uniform Federal election system that would have avoided the \nvery problem presented in Florida. The presidential election of the \nyear 2000 has drawn attention to several issues relating to current \nvoting technologies. The central question is, how can we ensure fair, \nreliable, prompt and secure voting procedures?\n  In this electronic age--in a nation that has put a man on the moon \nand an ATM machine on every corner --we have no excuse not to ensure \nthat we have an accurate voting system in which every person's vote \ncounts. Thousands of my Pennsylvania constituents raise similar \nquestions relating to the paradox of the ``Internet age'' and \nantiquated voting procedures. In order to move the voting process to \nthe point we expect in the 21st century, we must establish a system \nthat will improve the integrity of elections and facilitate faster, \nmore accurate results and overcome the weaknesses of older election \ntechnology.\n  It is not really practical for someone to layout an entire bill with \nthe precise procedures to implement these objectives, but it seems to \nme that it will be useful to establish a Commission which would take up \nthe question of how to reform our Federal election procedures. On \nNovember 14, 2000, the first legislative day following the presidential \nelection, I introduced legislation addressing the issue of modernizing \nour voting procedures. Today, I am reintroducing essentially the same \nbill with my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, as the lead \ncosponsor. This bill would establish a Commission for the Comprehensive \nStudy of Voting Procedures which would take up the very question of the \nbest methods to ensure accurate, electronic, and timely reporting of \nvote counts. The Commission would then submit a report to the President \nand Congress which would include recommendations to reform or augment \ncurrent voting procedures for Federal elections. Further, this bill \nwould authorize matching grants for States and localities to implement \nthe Commission's recommendations in relation to Federal elections. \nCongress should address this issue as least as to Federal elections, \nleaving the matters of State and local elections to State officials \nunder Federalist concepts.\n  Specifically, my bill would create a 6 member Commission with the \nPresident, Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader, Speaker of \nthe House, and House Minority Leader each appointing one member; and \nthe Director of the Office of Election Administration of the Federal \nElection Commission serving as a advisory, non-voting member. The \nCommission would conduct a thorough study of all issues relating to \nvoting procedures in Federal, State, and local elections, including the \nfollowing: (1) Voting procedures in Federal, State, and local \ngovernment elections; (2) Current voting procedures which represent the \nbest practices in Federal, State, and local government elections; (3) \nCurrent legislation and regulatory efforts which affect voting \nprocedures; (4) Implementing standardized voting procedures, including \ntechnology, for Federal, State, and local government elections; (5) \nSpeed and timeliness of reporting vote counts in Federal, State, and \nlocal government elections; (6) Accuracy of vote counts in Federal, \nState, and local government elections; (7) Security of voting \nprocedures in Federal, State, and local\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\ngovernment elections; (8) Accessibility of voting procedures for \nindividuals with disabilities and the elderly; and (9) Level of \nmatching grant funding necessary to enable States and localities to \nimplement the recommendations of the Commission for the modernization \nof State and local voting procedures. The details of this bill are \nincorporated in the attached section-by-section analysis.\n  Studies have shown that more than half of the nation's registered \nvoters are currently using outdated voting systems. A recent USA Today \narticle noted that most voters across our country still punch paper \nballots, even though experts say that system is more vulnerable to \nvoter error than any other. In addition, approximately 20% of voters \nuse mechanical-lever machines that are no longer manufactured, while \nmore than 25% of voters fill in a circle, square, or arrow next to \ntheir choice of candidates on a ballot.\n  My bill is necessary to prevent a recurrence of the problems that \nthreatened the 2000 presidential election whose problems could have \nbeen avoided if we had modernized voting and monitoring procedures. \nVoting is the fundamental safeguard of our democracy and we have the \ntechnological power to ensure that every person's vote does count. The \ntime is now to repair the problems of our patchwork system in order to \nrestore the faith of American voters in our Federal election process. \nMr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill and a section by \nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on the \n     Comprehensive Study of Voting Procedures Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Americans are increasingly concerned about current \n     voting procedures;\n       (2) Americans are increasingly concerned about the speed \n     and timeliness of vote counts;\n       (3) Americans are increasingly concerned about the accuracy \n     of vote counts;\n       (4) Americans are increasingly concerned about the security \n     of voting procedures;\n       (5) the shift in the United States is to the increasing use \n     of technology which calls for a reassessment of the use of \n     standardized technology for Federal elections; and\n       (6) there is a need for Congress to establish a method for \n     standardizing voting procedures in order to ensure the \n     integrity of Federal elections.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Specter \non the introduction of the Commission on the Comprehensive Study of \nVoting Procedures Act of 2001. This measure is very similar to the one \nwe introduced soon after last year's election. I think that we can all \nagree that this year's Presidential election has exposed a number of \nserious flaws in Florida's voting system, as well as in those of many \nstates around the country.\n  First, thousands of ballots were not counted due to voter error. Some \npeople voted for two candidates. Some voted for no candidate. And \nthousands who voted for just one candidate did so in such a way that \ntheir ballots could not be accurately read by vote-counting machines.\n  Second, the systems we traditionally use to decide elections--systems \nthat can determine the results of an election that is won by one \npercent or two percent or five percent of the vote--simply aren't \naccurate enough to decide an election based on a margin of just \nhundredths of one percent. For example, ask any election expert in the \ncountry, and they'll tell you that punch card machines just aren't up \nto such a task. The press late last year was filled with reports and \nanalysis showing that punch card systems have a far greater proportion \nof undercounted votes than other systems.\n  We also now know that butterfly ballots were not the wisest idea. And \nit's not just a matter of avoiding that particular design. We've also \ngot to develop a mechanism to ensure that ballots are designed in ways \nthat voter error is minimized. In addition, we learned that some \nFloridians thought they were registered to vote. However, when they \narrived at the polls, they found that their names were not listed on \nthe registration roles. These citizens were not allowed to vote in \nFlorida.\n  Clearly, our voting system has flaws. However there's nothing wrong \nwith our voting system that can't be fixed by what's right with it. For \nexample, in Iowa, we have a law that allows any potential voter who is \nnot found on the registration roles to cast a ``challenged ballot.'' \nThis challenged ballot is like an absentee ballot. It's put in an \nenvelope, and election officials spend the days immediately after the \nelection rechecking registration roles for clerical errors.\n  If an error was made, and a person was indeed registered to vote, \nthen his or her challenged ballot is counted. This isn't a perfect \nsolution, but it ensures that fewer people fall through the\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\ncracks. And there are more creative answers like this just waiting to \nbe discovered in innovative, forward-thinking counties throughout \nAmerica. That's why Senator Specter and I have introduced a bill \ndesigned to revamp our election systems to make them as clear, \naccessible and accurate as possible.\n\n  The Specter-Harkin bill establishes a bipartisan commission which \nwould spend one year examining election practices throughout America. \nThe Commission would seek to discover the strengths and weaknesses in \nour election system in order to determine the best course of action for \nthe future.\n  The Commission would specifically be responsible for studying the \nfollowing:\n  (1) Voting procedures in Federal, State, and local government \nelections.\n  (2) Voting procedures that represent the best practices in Federal, \nState, and local government elections.\n  (3) Legislation and regulatory efforts that affect voting procedures \nissues.\n  (4) The implementation of standardized voting procedures, including \nstandardized technology for Federal, State, and local government \nelections.\n  (5) The speed and timeliness of vote counts in Federal, State and \nlocal elections.\n  (6) The accuracy of vote counts in Federal, State and local \nelections.\n  (7) The security of voting procedures in Federal, State and local \nelections.\n  (8) The accessibility of voting procedures for individuals with \ndisabilities and the elderly.\n  (9) The level of matching grant funding necessary to implement the \nCommission's recommendations.\n  Lastly, the bill authorizes a one-to-one matching grant program \nsubject to the appropriation of the funds.\n  The commission would seek to answer questions like the following: \nWhat are the latest innovations in voting technology? What are the best \nfailsafe systems we can install to alert voters that they've voted for \ntoo many candidates or too few? Are we doing everything we can to make \nour voting system accessible to the elderly, people with disabilities, \nand others with special needs?\n  The next Presidential election is less than four years away. By \nallotting 12 full months for the Commission to study our voting \nsystems, we'll leave time for the Commission to finish a report and \nsubmit it to Congress for review and passage, and to allow Federal, \nState and local governments to pass and implement new voting \nlegislation. But the timeline is tight, and we must move forward \nquickly.\n  Clearly, when it comes to voting, local officials should have \ndiscretion in their precincts. But at the very least, we must establish \nminimum standards for accessibility and accuracy in order to ensure a \nfull, fair and precise count. We also need clear guidelines regarding \nthe recounting of votes in very close elections. Each vote is an \nexpression of one American's will, and we cannot deny anyone that \nfundamental right to shape our democracy.\n  There will always be conflicting views about what happened in \nFlorida. And we'll probably never come to complete agreement on the \nresults. But let us move forward and work together to minimize voting \ninaccuracies in the future and ensure every American's right to be \nheard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Dodd, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 217. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na uniform dollar limitation for all types of transportation fringe \nbenefits excludable from gross income, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues--\nSenators Warner, Durbin, Chafee, Sarbanes, Santorum, Dodd, Kerry, \nVoinovich, and Mikulski today to introduce the Commuter Benefits Equity \nAct of 2001. This bill corrects an inequity in the tax code and has the \npotential to draw hundreds of thousands of commuters out of their cars \nand onto our nation's transit and commuter rail systems.\n  The inequity I am speaking about is the largely ignored difference in \nthe amount of ``pretax'' compensation that current law permits \nemployers to give employees to cover parking and transit costs. At \npresent, a company may provide a worker with $175 per month to cover \nparking expenses. That limit is set at $65 per employee for mass \ntransit expenses.\n  At a time when our nation's highways and bridges are under \nunprecedented strain, it is hard to believe that federal law provides a \ngreater incentive for workers to drive to work than to leave their cars \nat home.\n  The Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2001 would raise the monthly cap \nto $175 for transit and provide ``cost of living'' increases for both \nbenefits in the future. I would note that the parking benefit just \nreceived a $5 COLA.\n  It is often said that people love their cars and simply will not ride \nmass transit to work. Many times this view is asserted as if it were an \nincontrovertible fact. I don't believe it at all, and recent ridership \nincreases show how untrue such statements are.\n  According to the American Public Transportation Association, \nAmericans took over 9.4 billion trips on public transportation last \nyear--a 320 million ride increase over 1999. This figure marks the \nhighest ridership number in more than forty years. It also signifies a \n20 percent increase over the last five years.\n  Clearly, Americans are willing to use mass transportation. I suspect \nthat if the federal government were to remove barriers like the current \ndisparity in the parking and transit benefits, even more would abandon \ntheir cars.\n  It certainly is a goal worth pursuing.\n  According to the Texas Transportation Institute, between 1982 and \n1997 the average delays faced by commuters in our metropolitan areas \nincreased by alarming percentages. Over that fifteen-year period, \ncommuters in New York endured a 158-percent increase in the amount of \ntime they spent stuck in traffic. And that, comparatively speaking, is \nlow. The figure for Detroit commuters was 182 percent. In Dallas it was \n300 percent. Denver commuters faced a grim 337-percent increase.\n  The monthly cap on the federal transit benefit must be raised because \nit is far below the average costs incurred by the suburban commuters \nwho use mass transportation. For instance, it costs a Westchester, New \nYork commuter over $170 per month to take MetroNorth into the City. In \nChicago, the average cost is approximately $148. In suburban Seattle \nthat cost can exceed $200. Many commuters who would prefer to ride a \ntrain into work versus sitting in traffic probably can't afford to do \nso. This is because the choice between paying the majority of their own \nmass transportation costs or sitting in traffic and getting heavily \nsubsidized parking is one they cannot justify economically.\n  My colleagues and I believe that by creating a more level playing \nfield between the transit and parking benefits, mass transportation use \nin this country will rise more rapidly. We also anticipate that our \nnation's urban highways will operate more efficiently. This view is \nshared by groups such as the Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, and \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, who have endorsed the Commuter Benefits \nEquity Act of 2001.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any comments relating to \nthis bill appear in the Record following my remarks as well as the text \nof the Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2001.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 217\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, to introduce \nthe Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2001.\n  Transportation gridlock in the metropolitan Washington region is \ndramatic and well documented. The average commuter spends about 76 \nhours a year idling on our area roads. The average speed on the Capital \nBeltway has decreased from 47 miles per hour to 23 miles per hour \ntoday. This wasted time in cars results in lost work productivity, lost \ntime with families and degraded air quality. The quality of life for \ncommuters is significantly reduced all across the country. I firmly \nbelieve the strength of our economy will be jeopardized if the growing \nrate of congestion in our communities remains unchecked.\n  Yes, the construction of new roads and the expansion of existing \nroads must occur. But, this alone is not the answer to our problems. \nRelief from our growing gridlock will not come from any one solution. \nIt will only come from an integrated policy of options that provide \nshort-term, immediate solutions, together with long-term planning for \nnew transportation facilities, both roads and transit.\n  For these reasons, I have worked over the years to provide commuters \nwith greater incentives to use mass transit, bus or rail, and to join \nvanpools. Increased transit ridership, extension of the Metro system, \nthe Dulles Rapid Transit System, and expanded telecommuting \nopportunities are critical to providing temporary short-term solutions. \nGreater transit use and broader telework options are measures we can \nimplement today that will deliver results tomorrow.\n  The measure I am introducing today with Senator Schumer will provide \nparity in the tax code for those who enjoy employer-provided parking \nand those who elect to commute by mass transit.\n  Today, the tax code provides two benefits for employers to offer \ntheir employees, both Federal employees and those in the private \nsector. Employers can offer employees a cash benefit of $65 per month \nfor commuting expenses, or employers can set aside up to $65 per month \nof an employee's pre-tax income to pay for commuting costs. Under the \ntax code, however, the employer-provided parking benefit is valued at \n$175 per month.\n  The legislation introduced today will increase the transit/vanpool \nbenefit to $175 per month to be on par with the value of the parking \nbenefit.\n  Last year, I authored a provision in the FY 2001 Department of \nDefense Authorization bill requiring the Department of Defense to offer \nthe cash commuting benefit to all DOD employees working in areas that \ndo not meet the Federal air quality standards. With a total \nmetropolitan Washington regional federal workforce of 323,000 persons, \nthe Department of Defense is, by far, the single largest federal \nemployer with 65,000 persons.\n  The implementation of this benefit by the Federal agencies will \nimprove employee satisfaction and have a positive effect on retention \nrates in the Federal workforce. This measure, however, is not limited \nto Federal employees. It does extend the benefit to private sector \nemployees as well.\n  Equally important are the resulting air quality benefits from \nincreased transit use. According to the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the metropolitan Washington area is an air quality non-\nattainment area, categorized as severe, under the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990. Mobile sources are responsible for the majority of \nour air quality violations.\n  Mr. President, I commend this legislation to my colleagues for their \nattention. It's costs are modest, and the benefits to our society are \nsignificant.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenators Schumer and Warner in introducing the Commuter Benefits Equity \nAct of 2001. This measure is another important step forward in our \nefforts to make transit services more accessible and improve the \nquality of life for commuters throughout the nation.\n  All across the nation, congestion and gridlock are taking their toll \nin terms of economic loss, environmental impacts, and personal \nfrustration. According to the Texas Transportation Institute's Annual \nMobility Report, in 1997, Americans in 68 urban areas spent 4.3 billion \nhours stuck in traffic, with an estimated cost to the nation of $72 \nbillion in lost time and wasted fuel, and the problem is growing. One \nway in which federal, state, and local governments are responding to \nthis problem is by promoting greater use of transit as a commuting \noption. The American Public Transportation Association estimates that \nlast year, Americans took over 9.4 billion trips on transit, the \nhighest level in more than 40 years. But we need to do more to \nencourage people to get out of their cars and onto public \ntransportation.\n  The Internal Revenue Code currently allows employers to provide a \ntax-free transit benefit to their employees. Under this ``Commuter \nChoice'' program, employers can set aside up to $65 per month of an \nemployee's pre-tax income to pay for the cost of commuting by public \ntransportation or vanpool. Alternatively, an employer can choose to \noffer the same amount as a tax-free benefit in addition to an \nemployee's salary. This program is designed to encourage Americans to \nleave their cars behind when commuting to work.\n  By all accounts, this program is working. In the Washington area, for \nexample, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reports \nthat 168,500 commuters take advantage of transit pass programs offered \nby their employers. That means fewer cars on our congested streets and \nhighways.\n  Employees of the federal government account for a large percentage of \nthose benefitting from this program in the Washington area. Under an \nExecutive Order issued by President Clinton, all federal agencies in \nthe National Capital Region, which includes Montgomery, Prince \nGeorge's, and Frederick Counties, Maryland, as well as several counties \nin Northern Virginia, are required to offer this transit benefit to \ntheir employees. The Commuter Choice program is now being used by \n115,000 Washington-area federal employees who are choosing to take \ntransit to work.\n  However, despite the success of the Commuter Choice program in taking \ncars off the road, our tax laws still reflect a bias toward driving. \nThe Internal Revenue Code allows employers to offer a tax-free parking \nbenefit to their employees of up to $175 per month. The striking \ndisparity between the amount allowed for parking--$175 per month--and \nthe amount allowed for transit--$65 per month--undermines our \ncommitment to supporting public transportation use.\n  The Commuter Benefits Equity Act would address this discrepancy by \nraising the maximum monthly transit benefit to $175, equal to the \nparking benefit. The federal government should not reward those who \ndrive to work more richly than those who take public transportation. \nIndeed, since the passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991, federal transportation policy has endeavored to \ncreate a level playing field between highways and transit, favoring \nneither mode above the other. The Commuter Benefits Equity Act would \nensure that our tax laws reflect this balanced approach.\n  In addition, the Commuter Benefits Equity Act would remedy another \ninconsistency in current law. Private-sector employers can offer their \nemployees the transit benefit in tandem with the parking benefit, to \nhelp employees pay for the costs of parking at transit facilities, \ncommuter rail stations, or other locations which serve public \ntransportation or vanpool commuters. However, under current law, \nfederal agencies cannot offer a parking benefit to their employees who \nuse park-and-ride lots or other remote parking locations. The Commuter \nBenefits Equity Act would remove this restriction, allowing federal \nemployees access to the same benefits enjoyed by their private-sector \ncounterparts.\n  The Washington Metropolitan Region is home to thousands of federal \nemployees. It is also one of the nation's most highly congested areas, \nwith the second longest average commute time\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\nin the country. This area ranks third in the nation in the number of \nworkers commuting more than 60 minutes to work, and has the highest per \nvehicle congestion cost and the second highest per capita congestion \ncost in the nation. It is clearly in our interest to support programs \nwhich encourage federal employees to make greater use of public \ntransportation for their commuting needs.\n  The simple change made by the Commuter Benefits Equity Act would \nprovide a significant benefit to those federal employees whose commute \nto work includes parking at a transit facility. For example, a commuter \nwho rides the Metrorail System to work and parks at the Wheaton park-\nand-ride lot pays about $50 monthly for parking, on top of the cost of \nriding the train. A private-sector employee whose employer provides the \nparking benefit in addition to salary could receive $600 a year tax \nfree to help pay these parking costs. Federal government employees \nshould be allowed the same benefit.\n  I support the Commuter Benefits Equity Act because it creates \nparity--parity in the tax code between the parking and transit \nbenefits, and parity for federal employees with their private-sector \ncounterparts. Both of these improvements will aid our efforts to fight \ncongestion and pollution by supporting public transportation. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the Commuter Benefits \nEquity Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mrs. Feinstein, \n        Mr. Allard, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Reid, and Mr. Roberts).\n  S. 218. A bill to establish an Election Administration Commission to \nstudy Federal, State, and local voting procedures and election \nadministration and provide grants to modernize voting procedures and \nelection administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce along with \nSenators Torricelli, Feinstein, Allard, Smith, Breaux, Burns, Reid, \nBennett, Landrie, Santorum, Roberts, Hutchinson, and Warner meaningful, \nbipartisan legislation to reform the administration of our nation's \nelections. I ask that the entire text of my statement and the text of \nthe legislation appear in the record.\n  As we move into the twenty-first century it is inexcusable that the \nworld's most advanced democracy relies on voting systems designed \nshortly after the Second World War. The goal of our legislation is \nrather simple: that no American ever again be forced to hear the \nphrases dimpled chad, hanging chad or pregnant chad. The Election \nReform Act will ensure that our nation's electoral process is brought \nup to twenty-first century standards.\n  By combining the Federal Election Commission's Election Clearinghouse \nand the Department of Defenses' Office of Voting Assistance, which \nfacilitates voting by American civilians and servicemen overseas, into \nthe Election Administration Commission, the bill will create one agency \nthat can bring focuses expertise to bear on the administration of \nelections. This Commission will consist of four Commissioners appointed \nby the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It will \ncontinue to carry out the functions of the two entities that are being \ncombined to create it.\n  In addition, the new Commission will engage in ongoing study and make \nperiodic recommendations on the best practices relating to voting \ntechnology and ballot design as well as polling place accessibility for \nthe disabled. The Commission will also study and recommend ways to \nimprove voter registration, verification of registration, and the \nmaintenance and accuracy of voter rolls. This is of special urgency in \nview of the allegations surfacing in this election of hundreds of \nfelons being listed on voting rolls and illegally voting, as reported \nin the Miami Herald, while other law abiding citizens who allegedly \nregistered were not included on the voting rolls and were unable to \nvote. Such revelations from this year's elections coupled with the \nwell-knows report by ``60 Minutes'' of the prevalence of dead people \nand pets both registering and voting in past elections make clear the \nneed for thoughtful study and recommendations to ensure that everyone \nwho is legally entitled to vote is able to do so and that everyone who \nvotes is legally entitled to do so--and does so only once.\n  In addition to its studies and recommendations, the Commission will \nprovide matching grants to states working to improve election \nadministration. During the first four years, low-income communities \nwill get priority for these grants and low-income communities are \npermanently exempted from the requirement to provide matching funds. \nThe legislation also ensure that states comply with the provisions in \nthe Uniformed Overseas Voting Act designed to facilitate voting by \nmembers of the armed forces stationed overseas.\n  Finally, I am pleased also to announce that Representative Tom Davis, \nalong with Representatives Rothman, Dreier, and Hastings are re-\nintroducing the House companion to our bill today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 219. A bill to suspend for two years the certification procedures \nunder section 490(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 in order to \nfoster greater multilateral cooperation in international \ncounternarcotics programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I send to the desk legislation on \nbehalf of myself, Senators McCain, Hollings and Hagel. The purpose of \nthe bill we are introducing today is to help the incoming Bush \nadministration in its efforts to strengthen international cooperation \nin combating international drug trafficking and drug-related crimes.\n  As you know, the issue of how best to construct and implement an \neffective international counter narcotics policy has been the subject \nof much debate in this Chamber over the years, and I would add much \ndisagreement. Our intention in introducing this legislation is to try \nto see if there is some way to end what has become a stale annual \ndebate that has not brought us any closer to mounting a credible effort \nto eliminate or even contain the international drug mafia. We all can \nagree that drugs are a problem--a big problem. We can agree as well \nthat the international drug trade poses a direct threat to the United \nStates and to international efforts to promote democracy, economic \nstability, human rights, and the rule of law throughout the world, but \nmost especially in our own hemisphere.\n  While the international impact is serious and of great concern, of \neven greater concern to me personally are effects it is having here at \nhome. Last year Americans spent more than $60 billion to purchase \nillegal drugs. Nearly 15 million Americans (twelve years of age and \nolder) use illegal drugs, including 1.5 million cocaine users, 208,000 \nheroin addicts, and more than 11 million smokers of marijuana. This \nmenace isn't just confined to inner cities or the poor. Illegal drug \nuse occurs among members of every ethnic and socioeconomic group in the \nUnited States.\n  The human and economic costs of illegal drug consumption by Americans \nare enormous. More than 16,000 people die annual as a result of drug \ninduced deaths. Drug related illness, death, and crime cost the United \nStates approximately over $100 billion annually, including costs for \nlost productivity, premature death, and incarceration.\n  This is an enormously lucrative business--drug trafficking generates \nestimated revenues of $400 billion annually. The United States has \nspent more than $30 billion in foreign interdiction and source country \ncounter narcotics programs since 1981, and despite impressive seizures \nat the border, on the high seas, and in other countries, foreign drugs \nare cheaper and more readily available in the United States today than \ntwo decades ago.\n  We think that for a variety of reasons, that the time is right to \ngive the incoming Bush administration some flexibility with respect to \nthe annual certification process, so that it can determine whether this \nis the best mechanism for producing the kind of international \ncooperation and partnership that is needed to contain this \ntransnational menace. I believe that\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\ngovernment leaders, particularly in this hemisphere, have come to \nrecognize that illegal drug production and consumption are increasingly \nthreats to political stability within their national borders. Clearly \nPresident Pastrana of Colombia has acknowledged that fact and has \nsought to work very closely with the United States in implementing Plan \nColombia. Similarly President Vincente Fox of Mexico has made \ninternational counter narcotics cooperation a high priority since \nassuming office last December. These leaders also feel strongly, \nhowever, that unilateral efforts by the United States to grade their \ngovernments' performance in this area is a major irritant in the \nbilateral relationship and counterproductive to their efforts to \ninstill a cooperative spirit in their own bureaucracies.\n  The legislation we are introducing today recognizes that illicit drug \nproduction, distribution and consumption are national security threats \nto many governments around the globe, and especially many of those in \nour own hemisphere, including Mexico, Colombia, and other countries in \nthe Andean region. It urges the Administration to develop an enhanced \nmultilateral strategy for addressing these threats from both the supply \nand demand side of the equation. It calls upon the President to \nconsider convening a conference of heads of state, at an early date, to \nreview on a country-by-country basis, national strategies for drug \nreduction and prevention, and agree upon a time table for action. It \nalso recommends that the President submit any legislative changes to \nexisting law which he deems necessary in order to implement this \ninternational program within one year from the enactment of this \nlegislation.\n\n  In order to create the kind of international cooperation and mutual \nrespect that must be present if the Bush administration's effort is to \nproduce results, the bill would also suspend the annual drug \ncertification procedure for a period of 2 years, while efforts are \nongoing to develop and implement this enhanced multilateral strategy. I \nbelieve it is fair to say that while the certification procedure may \nhave had merit when it was enacted into law in 1986, it has now become \na hurdle to furthering bilateral and multilateral cooperation with \nother governments, particularly those in our own hemisphere such as \nMexico and Colombia--governments whose cooperation is critical if we \nare to succeed in stemming the flow of drugs across our borders.\n  Let me make clear however, that while we would not be ``grading'' \nother governments on whether they have ``cooperated fully'' during the \ntwo year ``suspension'' period, the detailed reporting requirements \ncurrently required by law concerning what each government has done to \ncooperate in the areas of eradication, extradition, asset seizure, \nmoney laundering and demand reduction during the previous calendar year \nwill remain in force. We will be fully informed as to whether \ngovernments are following short of their national and international \nobligations. Moreover, if the President determines during the two year \nsuspension period that the certification process may be useful in order \nto elicit more cooperation from a particular government he may go ahead \nand issue the annual certification decision with respect to that \ncountry. The annual determination as to which countries are major \nproducers or transit sources of illegal drugs will also continue to be \nrequired by law.\n  I believe that we need to reach out to other governments who share \nour concerns about the threat that drugs pose to the very fabric of \ntheir societies and our own. It is arrogant to assume we are the only \nNation that cares about such matters. We need to sit down and figure \nout what each of us can do better to make it harder for drug \ntraffickers to ply their trade. It is in that spirit that we urge our \ncolleagues to give this proposal serious consideration. Together, \nworking collectively we can defeat the traffickers. But if we expend \nour energies playing the blame game, we are certainly not going to \neffectively address this threat. We aren't going to stop one additional \nteenager from becoming hooked on drugs, or one more citizen from being \nmugged outside his home by some drug crazed thief.\n  During the Clinton Administration, Barry McCaffrey, the Director of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy did a fine job in attempting \nto forge more cooperative relations with Colombia, Mexico and other \ncountries in our own hemisphere. The OAS has also done some important \nwork over the last several years in putting in place an institutional \nframework for dealing with the complexities of compiling national \nstatistics so that we can better understand what needs to be done. The \nUnited Nations, through its Office for Drug Control and Crime \nPrevention has also made some important contributions in furthering \ninternational cooperation in this area. However, still more needs to be \ndone. We believe that this legislation will build upon that progress. I \nwould urge my colleagues to give some thought and attention to our \nlegislative initiative. We believe that if they do, that they will come \nto the conclusion that it is worthy of their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record at the conclusion of these \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 219\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TWO-YEAR SUSPENSION OF DRUG CERTIFICATION \n                   PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The international drug trade poses a direct threat to \n     the United States and to international efforts to promote \n     democracy, economic stability, human rights, and the rule of \n     law.\n       (2) The United States has a vital national interest in \n     combating the financial and other resources of the \n     multinational drug cartels, which resources threaten the \n     integrity of political and financial institutions both in the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (3) Illegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic \n     and socioeconomic group in the United States.\n       (4) Worldwide drug trafficking generates revenues estimated \n     at $400,000,000,000 annually.\n       (5) The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 \n     Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 \n     Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and \n     Psychotropic Substances form the legal framework for \n     international dung control cooperation.\n       (6) The United Nations International Drug Control Program, \n     the International Narcotics Control Board, and the \n     Organization of American States can play important roles in \n     facilitating the development and implementation of more \n     effective multilateral programs to combat both domestic and \n     international drug trafficking and consumption.\n       (7) The annual certification process required by section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     which has been in effect since 1986, does not currently \n     foster effective and consistent bilateral or multilateral \n     cooperation with United States counternarcotics programs \n     because its provisions are vague and inconsistently applied \n     and in many cases have been superseded by subsequent \n     bilateral and multilateral agreements and because it \n     alienates the very allies whose cooperation we seek.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) many governments are extremely concerned by the \n     national security threat posed by illicit drug production, \n     distribution, and consumption, and crimes related thereto, \n     particularly those in the Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) an enhanced multilateral strategy should be developed \n     among drug producing, transit, and consuming nations designed \n     to improve cooperation with respect to the investigation and \n     prosecution of drug related crimes, and to make available \n     information on effective drug education and drug treatment;\n       (3) the President should at the earliest feasible date in \n     2001 convene a conference of heads of state of major illicit \n     drug producing countries, major drug transit countries, and \n     major money laundering countries to present and review \n     country by country drug reduction and prevention strategies \n     relevant to the specific circumstances of each country, and \n     agree to a program and timetable for implementation of such \n     strategies; and\n       (4) not later than one year after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the President should transmit to Congress \n     legislation to implement a proposed multilateral strategy to \n     achieve the goals referred to in paragraph (2), including any \n     amendments to existing law that may be required to implement \n     that strategy.\n       (c) Two-Year Suspension of Drug Certification Process.--(1) \n     Subsections (a) through (g) of section 490 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), relating to annual \n     certification procedures for assistance for certain drug-\n     producing countries and drug-transit countries, shall not \n     apply in the first 2 calendar years beginning after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\n       (2) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (1), section \n     489 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291h), \n     relating to the international narcotics control strategy \n     report, and section 490(h) of that Act (22 U.S.C. 2291j(h)), \n     relating to determinations of major drug-transit countries \n     and major illicit drug producing countries, shall continue to \n     apply in the 2 calendar years referred to in that paragraph.\n       (3) The President may waive the applicability of paragraph \n     (1) to one or more countries in one or both of the calendar \n     years referred to in that paragraph if the President \n     determines that bilateral counternarcotics cooperation would \n     be enhanced by the applicability of subsections (a) through \n     (g) of section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \n     such country or countries in such calendar year.\n       (d) Applicability.--(1) Except as provided in paragraph \n     (2), the provisions of subsection (c) shall take effect on \n     the date of the enactment of this Act and apply with respect \n     to certifications otherwise required under section 490 of the \n     Foreign Assistance of 1961 in the first two fiscal years \n     beginning after that date.\n       (2) If this Act is enacted on or before February 28, 2001, \n     the provisions of subsection (c) shall take effect on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act and apply with respect to \n     certifications otherwise required under section 490 of the \n     Foreign Assistance of 1961 in fiscal years 2001 and 2002.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend \nSenator Dodd, and our distinguished colleagues Senator Hagel and \nChairman McCain, in cosponsoring an important piece of legislation with \nfar-reaching effects in our struggle to combat drug trafficking. Our \nbill calls for the development of a multilateral strategy among major \nillicit drug producing, transit, drug demand, and consuming countries \nto improve cooperation with respect to the investigation and \nprosecution of drug related crimes. Intelligence reports have shown \nthat sophisticated cartels operate on a truly global scale. America's \ndrug demand problems may feed Europe's money laundering problems which \nare related to Asia's organized crime problems or street-crime in Latin \nAmerica. All the states of the world are under attack from a common, \nsophisticated enemy. Our bill encourages the President of the United \nStates to bring the heads of state together to review individual \ncountry strategies and develop a new multilateral approach. This bill \nrequires the President to submit to Congress legislation to implement a \nmultilateral strategy devised through the consultation process \ndescribed above.\n  Drug trafficking becomes harder to fight as the world becomes \nincreasingly interconnected. I am united with my colleagues to remain \nvigilant in fighting the proliferation of drugs on the streets of the \nUnited States. The last time I checked, the United States does not \nproduce one ounce of cocaine, or one ounce of heroin. This bill \nrecognizes the essential truth of drug trafficking--it is a \nmultinational, multifaceted criminal plague that respects no borders.\n  With this in mind, I rise to support a 2-year moratorium of the \nannual U.S. certification procedures which require the President to \ncertify that other nations qualify as ``partners'' in combating drug \ntrafficking. This certification is required for the release of certain \nU.S. bilateral assistance, as well as for the release of multilateral \ndevelopment aid from institutions where the United States is a voting \nmember. This practice stymies multilateral cooperation in combating \ndrug trafficking and has not yielded any measurable results--unless one \ncounts the resentment of our neighbors. We need a new approach and new \nstrategic partners. This legislation will direct President Bush to seek \nout new approaches and new partners rather than wasting time and energy \non certification.\n  Officials from Mexico, our neighbor and close ally, have routinely \nappealed to the President of the United States and to Congress to \nsuspend the drug certification process. They argue it is detrimental to \nbilateral cooperation in enforcement and interdiction, it is bad for \nthe morale of law enforcement, and it serves to absolve the United \nStates from its responsibility in the proliferation of drug \ntrafficking. Americans spend an estimated $110 billion a year on \nillegal drugs--the equivalent of one-tenth the value of the country's \nentire industrial production. Unfortunately, the dedicated and \nhardworking efforts of our law enforcement and customs officials to \ngain control of drugs entering our country from Mexico are to date \nunsuccessful. The Mexican police have been overwhelmed by the sheer \nvolume of drugs transhipped through their country (The DEA estimated \nthat, in 1999, 55 percent of the cocaine and 14 percent of the heroin \nwhich enter the United States came from Mexico, as did 3,700 metric \ntons of marijuana). The situation is further complicated by the \nexisting corruption in Mexican police ranks. By way of example, in \nDecember 1999 the Government of Mexico reported that between 1997 and \n1999 more than 1,400 federal police officers had been fired for \ncorruption and that 357 of the officers had been prosecuted. Given the \npervasive scale of the problem, the Federal Preventive Police (FPP) was \ncreated to investigate and root out crooked officers in the federal \npolice. By the winter of 2000, several agents of the FPP were under \ninvestigation themselves for corruption.\n\n  Despite these grim examples there are clear signs of hope. In July \n2000 Mexico turned a corner in history and ended seven decades of one-\nparty rule by sending opposition candidate Vincente Fox to Los Pinos. \nFox cast a wide net in the Mexican mainstream with themes of inclusion \nand governmental responsiveness in a historic campaign. ``Democracy is \na starting point--it is the process by which society becomes organized \nand gains its own voice'' said Fox. ``Democracy provides the legitimacy \nnecessary for the country to meet the historic challenges in the areas \nof development, social justice, and the reduction of inequality.''\n  President Fox represents a clean break with the institutionalized \ncorruption and graft that carried Mexico to the brink of Chaos in 1994 \nwhen PRI presidential candidate Donaldo Colosio was assassinated. \nPresident Fox inherited a judicial system and a federal police force \nrocked by scandal and largely ineffectual in combating drug \ntrafficking. Mexico ranked 4th in the World Bank's 2000 list of most \ncorrupt governments. Backed with a popular mandate for change, Fox put \nfighting corruption as the overarching goal in all his policy \ninitiatives. The task will not be easy. Last Friday, January 19th, for \nexample, it was reported that convicted drug kingpin Joaquin Guzman \nLoera escaped from a maximum security prison in Jalisco. Guzman is a \nleader of the Felix Gallardo drug family, which authorities say is \ndeeply involved in shipping illegal drugs to the United States.\n  While I am sobered by the accounts of the Guzman escape, it is \nencouraging that the Mexican Supreme Court reversed its decision on \nextraditions for drug crimes and agreed to turn over drug kingpins \nwanted in the United States. We must further these confidence-building \ninitiatives between the United States and Mexico. One way to do this is \nto grant Mexico a two-year moratorium from the drug certification \nprocess to allow President Fox to organize his Administration and to \nset his course. We should not evaluate President Fox for the corruption \nof his predecessors. We must allow him to address the endemic \ncorruption that plaques the Mexican state.\n  This legislation does not cede Congress' role in the so-called drug \nwar. It call for new energy and a new multilateral approach. It \nemphasizes Congress' interest in building real partnerships and looking \nfor new answers in this difficult struggle. This legislation will give \nus a fresh start with our neighbor to the south and build confidence \nbetween our people. President Fox is committed to reforming Mexico and \nI intend to urge my colleagues to help this vibrant new leader to \nachieve his goal. He has brought the liberating force of democracy to \nhis people, but his work is not done. President Fox has to use his \npower to transform the state. He has an old order to dismantle, a new \none to build, and 6 years to do it. I have confidence in Mr. Fox and \nhis able cabinet. My colleagues and I are reaching out to the Fox \nAdministration and the Mexican people; we want to build a partnership \nand seek new ways to address common problems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 221. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to make loans \nthrough a revolving loan fund for States to construct electricity \ngeneration facilities for use in electricity supply emergencies.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since last week, I have introduced several \nbills to help California deal with the\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\nelectricity crisis and to help prevent such emergencies from occurring \nin other States in the future. Today, I am introducing another such \nbill--the State Electricity Reserve Fund Act.\n  Current electricity generating capacity is tied to the expected need. \nPrivate generating companies have no incentive to build or maintain \nfacilities that would generate capacity greater than what is needed to \nmeet consumer demand. The plants would be idle most of the time. As a \nresult, electricity shortages can occur.\n  A lack of rainfall, which means that hydroelectric facilities cannot \nbe operated as often, as well as unseasonably hot or cold temperatures, \nor rapid population increases in a State can all result in a demand for \nelectricity unexpectedly exceeding supply. But with supply tied to \nexpected demand, this can result in devastatingly large price increases \nfor consumers and/or electricity shortages, which in turn could cause \nbrownouts or blackouts.\n  This is exactly what has happened in California. In the late 1980's, \nthe California Public Utilities Commission required utilities to \ndetermine demand for new power generating capacity. At that time, the \nstate recognized that generation needs could increase. However, the \nutilities argued that no new capacity would be needed in California \nuntil 2005. The utilities fought the attempt by the state to make them \nbuild more generating capacity. The utilities argued it was not needed.\n  It turned out that it was needed. And whether the utilities should \nhave known is another argument for another day. But the point here is \nthat we cannot rely on the private sector to create a ``rainy day \nfund'' of electricity in the event of emergencies.\n  So, the State Electricity Reserve Fund Act would create a revolving \nloan fund for states to use to help pay for the creation of an \nelectricity reserve capacity. These loans could be used by states to \nbuild electricity generation facilities that would be controlled by the \nstate and would be kept in reserve unless the Governor of the State \ndeclares an electricity emergency.\n  Mr. President, it is not an unusual thing for the federal government \nto prepare for energy emergencies. We have the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve in the case of oil shortages, and last year we established the \nHome Heating Oil Reserve for the Northeastern States. My bill is based \non the same premise.\n  True, we cannot store electricity like we can store petroleum and \nheating oil. But we can financially help States build a reserve \nfacility, including a reserve of the fuel that is needed to generate \nelectricity, to be used in the case of electricity emergencies. If such \na reserve had existed in California, we would not have reached State \nIII emergencies and rolling blackouts over the past couple of weeks.\n  Mr. President, I think being prepared for emergencies is always a \ngood policy. Helping States be prepared for electricity emergencies is \nno different.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 221\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State Electricity Reserve \n     Fund Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to assist States in creating \n     electric generating capacity to be used in the event of an \n     electricity emergency.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Con. Res. 5\n\n       Whereas since the War of American Independence, nurses have \n     served the Armed Forces of the United States in peace and in \n     war;\n       Whereas on February 2, 1901, Congress authorized the \n     establishment of a permanent nurse corps;\n       Whereas for the past 100 years the United States Army Nurse \n     Corps has served with distinction at home and on distant \n     battlefields;\n       Whereas over 21,000 Army nurses served in World War I, and \n     many of them were noted in British Army dispatches for their \n     meritorious service;\n       Whereas in World War II, over 57,000 Army nurses again \n     served with distinction, including 67 who were captured in \n     the Philippines and held as prisoners of war for 3 years \n     before their liberation in February 1945;\n       Whereas Army nurses served in hostilities in Korea, \n     Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Kuwait, and Somalia;\n       Whereas Army nurses were there to care for United States \n     soldiers, wherever those soldiers were fighting, thereby \n     winning extraordinary distinction and respect for the Nation \n     and the United States Army;\n       Whereas on this 100th Anniversary of the United States Army \n     Nurse Corps, nurses in the Army Reserve, the Army National \n     Guard, and the Regular Army are deployed to over 15 \n     countries, including to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the motto of Army nurses, ``Ready, Caring, Proud'' \n     is more than mere words, it is the creed by which the Army \n     nurse lives and serves;\n       Whereas it is certain that Army nurses, selflessly serving \n     the Nation, will continue to be the credentials of our Army, \n     even though no one can predict the cause, location, or \n     magnitude of future battles; and\n       Whereas the United States Army Nurse Corps is committed to \n     providing quality care in peace and war, at anytime and in \n     any place: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the valor, commitment, and sacrifice that \n     United States Army nurses have made throughout the history of \n     the Nation;\n       (2) commends the United States Army Nurse Corps for 100 \n     years of selfless service;\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     recognizing the 100th anniversary of the United States Army \n     Nurse Corps on February 2, 2001; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     that anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to \ncommemorate the 100th anniversary of the United States Army Nurse \nCorps.\n  As a proud supporter of the Army Nurse Corps, both the officers and \nthe many enlisted and civilian personnel who work with them, I am \npleased that we are taking time today to recognize their contributions \nto our army and our nation.\n  Since the War of Independence, nurses have served our military in \npeace and in war, but it was not until 1901 that a bill came before the \nCongress to establish a permanent Nurse Corps. The Nurse Corps became a \npermanent corps of the medical department under the Army Reorganization \nAct passed by the Congress on February 2, 1901. At that time, the Nurse \ncorps was composed of only women.\n  The Army Nurse Corps has a proud history. More than 21,000 nurses \nserved during World War I, many of them named in British Army \ndispatches for their meritorious service. In World War II, more than \n57,000 Army nurses again served with distinction. Sixty-six of those \nnurses were captured in the Philippines and held as prisoners of war \nfor three years before their liberation in February 1945. There is not \nenough time to describe all of the heroic actions of the nurses who \nwaded ashore on the Anzio beachhead and many other locations throughout \nthe war. One nurse, Lieutenant Frances Y. Slinger from Roxbury, \nMassachusetts, wrote a letter to Stars and Stripes from her tent in \nBelgium:\n\n       Sure we rough it. But compared to the way you men are \n     taking it, we can't complain, nor do we feel that bouquets \n     are due us. . . . It is to you we doff our helmets. To every \n     G.I. wearing the American uniform-for you we have the \n     greatest admiration and respect.\n\n  Seventeen days later, on October 21, 1944, Lieutenant Slanger died of \nwounds caused by the shelling of her tented hospital area. Hundreds of \nsoldiers replied:\n\n       To all Army nurses overseas: We men were not given the \n     choice of working in the battlefield or the home front. We \n     cannot take any credit for being here. We are here because we \n     have to be. You are here because you felt you were needed. \n     So, when an injured man opens his eyes to see one of you . . \n     . . Concerned with his welfare, he can't but be overcome by \n     the very thought that you are doing it because you want to . \n     . . you endure whatever hardships you must be where you can \n     do us the most good.\n\n  Eventually, on August 9, 1955, Public Law 294 authorized commissions \nfor male nurses in the U.S. Army Reserve. Army Nurses went to serve our \nnation in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Operation Desert Shield/\nDesert Storm, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo and other far away destinations. \nArmy Nurses are currently deployed to more than 15 countries, and there \nare nurses in the Army Reserves, Army National Guard and the Active \nForce.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the Baltimore Ravens' \n     owner, Art Modell, and to the Ravens' head coach, Brian \n     Billick.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I introduce \nthis resolution congratulating the Baltimore Ravens on their remarkable \nchampionship season. On Super Bowl Sunday, the Baltimore Ravens \ncompleted an incredible season, beating the New York Giants by a score \nof 34 to 7 to become the 2000-2001 National Football League Champions.\n  At the beginning of the season, very few of the experts thought the \nRavens would have a chance at glory. And as the team endured a five \ngame stretch without a touchdown, the nay sayers grew and many wrote \nthe Ravens off entirely. But during the season's early rough spots, \nwhen the team could have fallen to pieces, no one pointed fingers or \nassigned blame. Instead, under the leadership of a great coaching \nstaff, they grew together and formed a remarkable bond not only amongst \neach other but also with the fans of Baltimore.\n  And then, with the NFL's best defense leading the way, the Baltimore \nRavens began to string together win after win. The victories weren't \nalways pretty, but the team always found a way to win--with a new hero \nstepping forward to make something happen. Week in and week out, Matt \nStover, Quadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe, Duane Starks, Jamal Lewis, \nJermaine Lewis, Ray Lewis, Trent Dilfer, Rod Woodson, Tony Siragusa, \nSam Adams, Jonathan Ogden, and countless others took it upon themselves \nto make the big play.\n  Still, even through the playoffs, the experts kept scratching their \nheads wondering how the Ravens were beating their highly acclaimed \nopponents. To the very end, the doubters outweighed the believers. Only \nthe Ravens themselves and the fans of Baltimore truly dared to believe \nthat a Championship season was possible. Finally, after a hard fought, \nplayoff run--on the road--against the AFC's finest, the Ravens have \nbrought the Lombardi Trophy home to Baltimore. And now the experts \nbelieve.\n  The game was a defensive masterpiece as those who know and have \nfollowed the Ravens would expect. But what makes this victory \nparticularly special is that the Ravens played as a team, with \nremarkable cohesiveness and spirit. And in the world spotlight, they \nwere able to display their diverse, but largely unsung, talents. Jamie \nSharper's interception, Jermaine Lewis's terrific kickoff return, \nBrandon Stokely's outstanding touchdown reception, Jamal Lewis's diving \ntouchdown run, Trent Dilfer's pain-filled, but error-free game, Kyle \nRichardson's coffin corner punts and Ray Lewis's MVP Award-winning \nperformance, are just a few of the individual efforts that combined to \nsecure this victory. The list goes on and on.\n  And Finally, I want to take a moment to recognize the leadership of \nCoach Brian Billick who is in his second year as head coach of the \nRavens. We all know that to be champions requires a strong commitment \nto working harder than the rest. The Ravens' Super Bowl win is a credit \nto an extraordinary effort by the entire Baltimore Ravens' \norganization, from Art Modell down--but I would be remiss if I didn't \nmention the motivational push, level head and remarkable football mind \ndemonstrated by Coach Billick and his coaching staff throughout the \nseason, and especially during the playoff run. Most importantly, he \nhelped Baltimore believe through thick and thin.\n  There is a statue of Edgar Allen Poe located in the plaza of the \nUniversity of Baltimore Law School not too far from PSiNet Stadium, \nwith an engraving that reads, ``Dreaming dreams that no mortal ever \ndared to dream before; To thee the laurels belong''.\n  Today the Lombardi Trophy belongs to the Baltimore Ravens because \nthey dared to dream when no one else believed a championship was \npossible. I congratulate them and their worthy opponents, the New York \nGiants, on a tremendous season and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S787-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S787-S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENT SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR HEAD START TEACHERS ACT OF 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT NO. 1\n\n  (Ordered referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her \nto the bill (S. 123) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nextend loan forgiveness for certain loans to Head Start teachers; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\n       (d) Direct Student Loan Forgiveness.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 460 of the Higher Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C 1087j) is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (b)(1), by amending subparagraph (A) to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(A)(i) has been employed--\n       ``(I) as a full-time teacher for 5 consecutive complete \n     school years in a school that qualifies under section \n     465(a)(2)(A) for loan cancellation for Perkins loan \n     recipients who teach in such a school; or\n       ``(II) as a Head Start teacher for 5 consecutive complete \n     program years under the Head Start Act; and\n       ``(ii)(I) if employed as a secondary school teacher, is \n     teaching a subject area that is relevant to the borrower's \n     academic major as certified by the chief administrative \n     officer of the public or nonprofit private secondary school \n     in which the borrower is employed;\n       ``(II) if employed as an elementary school teacher, has \n     demonstrated, as certified by the chief administrative \n     officer of the public or nonprofit private elementary school \n     in which the borrower is employed, knowledge and teaching \n     skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and other areas of \n     the elementary school curriculum; and\n       ``(III) if employed as a Head Start teacher, has \n     demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, \n     writing, early childhood development, and other areas of a \n     preschool curriculum, with a focus on cognitive learning; \n     and'';\n       (B) in subsection (g), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Head start.--An individual shall be eligible for loan \n     forgiveness under this section for service described in \n     subclause (II) of subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) only if such \n     individual received a baccalaureate or graduate degree on or \n     after the date of enactment of the Loan Forgiveness for Head \n     Start Teachers Act of 2001.''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary \n     for fiscal year 2007 and succeeding fiscal years to carry out \n     loan repayment under this section for service described in \n     subclause (II) of subsection (b)(1)(A)(i).''.\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--Section 460 of such Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 1087j) is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (c)(1), by inserting ``or fifth complete \n     program year'' after ``fifth complete school year of \n     teaching'';\n       (B) in subsection (f), by striking ``subsection (b)'' and \n     inserting ``subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)(I)'';\n       (C) in subsection (g)(1)(A), by striking ``subsection \n     (b)(1)(A)'' and inserting ``subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)(I)''; and\n       (D) in subsection (h), by inserting ``except as part of the \n     term `program year','' before ``where''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/30/senate-section/article/S788-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
