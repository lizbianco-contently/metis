Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1731, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1731) to strengthen the safety net for \n     agricultural producers, to enhance resource conservation and \n     rural development, to provide for farm credit, agricultural \n     research, nutrition, and related programs, to ensure \n     consumers abundant food and fiber, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Daschle (for Harkin) amendment No. 2471, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Daschle motion to reconsider the vote (Vote No. 377--107th \n     Congress, 1st session) by which the second motion to invoke \n     cloture on Daschle (for Harkin) amendment No. 2471 (listed \n     above) was not agreed to.\n       Durbin/Lugar amendment No. 2821, to restrict commodity and \n     crop insurance payments to land that has a cropping history\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\n     and to restore food stamp benefits to legal immigrants who \n     have lived in the United States for 5 years or more.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2821\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased that in a few moments the \nSenate will vote on the Durbin amendment that restores benefits to \nlegal immigrants in our country. We had a good debate last evening \nwhich illuminated the fact that there are as many as 500,000 Americans \nwho are able to meet the criteria of having lived in this country 5 \nyears or having had a work experience for 4 years who--and most \nimportantly their children--due to confusion of the regulations \nfrequently have not had the Food Stamp Program and the proper nutrition \nthat might come from that. But we are going to change that. It is a \nstrong bipartisan force.\n  The President of the United States has spoken forcefully on these \nissues and has commended the activity that is encapsulated so well in \nthe amendment of the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  I am pleased to join him in hoping that we will have if not, a \nunanimous vote, a nearly unanimous vote. It is both a humanitarian \ncause and a fairness cause and a considerable extension of the \nnutrition safety net for all Americans.\n  This seems to me to be a very important objective of this farm bill \nbecause we are the Senate Committee of Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry and we have taken the nutrition title very seriously.\n  The Senator from Illinois has found ways that we can enhance that \ntitle very substantially. I commend that effort and ask all Senators to \nvote in favor of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I, first, thank my colleague from the \nState of Indiana. This is a great day. We have this great alliance of \ntwo adjoining States--Illinois and Indiana--for the good of people all \nacross the United States. I thank the Senator for his very kind words.\n  Before I address the merits of the bill, the substance, there are two \nmodifications which have been proposed. I would like to offer one from \nSenator Dorgan, and I ask the Senator from Indiana if he would do the \nsame for Senator Gramm of Texas, who has offered a modification.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 2821\n\n  Mr. President, I send this modification to the desk of the amendment \nwhich has been offered. I ask unanimous consent it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike line 13 and replace with the following:\n       ``(a) Definitions.--\n       On page 2, after line 21 insert the following:\n       ``(3) In general.--The term `considered planted' shall \n     include cropland that has been prevented from being planted \n     at least 8 out of the past 10 years due to disaster related \n     conditions as determined by the Secretary.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me make a correction for the Record. Senator Conrad \noffered this modification, I believe, not Senator Dorgan. I believe the \nSenator from Indiana may offer a modification on behalf of the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the distinguished Senator for that invitation.\n\n\n               Further Modification To Amendment No. 2821\n\n  Mr. President, I do send to the desk the modification from Senator \nGramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 6 strike lines 4 through 12 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(M) Food stamp exception for certain qualified aliens.--\n       ``(i) With respect to eligibility for benefits for the \n     specified Federal program described in paragraph (3)(B), \n     paragraph (1) shall not apply, subject to the exclusion in \n     clause (ii), to any individual who has continuously resided \n     in the United States as a qualified alien for a period of 5 \n     years or more beginning on the date on which the qualified \n     alien entered the United States.\n       ``(ii) No alien who enters the country illegally and \n     remains in the United States illegally for a period of one \n     year or longer, or has been in the United States as an \n     illegal alien for a period of one year or longer, regardless \n     of their status upon entering the country or their current \n     status as a qualified alien, shall be eligible under clause \n     (i) for benefits for the specified Federal program described \n     in paragraph (3)(B).\n       ``(iii) Clause (ii) shall not apply to a qualified alien \n     who has continuously resided in the United States for a \n     period of 5 years or more as of the date of enactment of this \n     Act.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that the \nmodification requested by Senator Conrad is one that merely defines a \nterm within the bill and does it in a fashion that I think is entirely \nreasonable. It says that if land has not been cropped or planted \nbecause it has been in a disaster status, certainly, that will not be \ncovered by the amendment which I have limiting the opportunities for \nFederal payment. This is entirely reasonable. I am happy to accept it.\n  On the modification by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, I have \nagreed to this, even though I have serious misgivings about it. But I \nhave the assurance of the Senator from Texas, and all Senators who are \nnow engaged in this debate, that we will continue to look at this \nextremely closely as we approach the conference committee to make \ncertain we have done something that is fair and reasonable.\n  But it is in the spirit of moving this forward for the 260,000 legal \nimmigrants who will now be eligible for food stamps in our country that \nI have agreed to and accept this second-degree amendment.\n  As the Senator from Indiana has alluded to, what we have done is \ntwofold. What we have said is, if you have cropland in America that has \nnot been planted, or you have not produced on that land at least 1 year \nout of the last 5, or 3 out of the last 10, in that circumstance, you \ncannot qualify for Federal assistance.\n  That is an effort to make certain we don't encourage overproduction \nfor Federal subsidy. The farmer still has the opportunity to plant the \nland and to harvest the crop and make a profit, if he sees fit. But \nunder this amendment, he would be limited. He would not be able to \nreceive Government subsidy or Government support. We make specific \nexceptions, which I described yesterday in the debate.\n  The second part of this amendment takes the savings of $1.4 billion \nand uses it to provide eligibility for food stamps for legal \nimmigrants. This is something that was changed in 1996. It is a change \nwhich has worked a great hardship, particularly on poor children across \nAmerica. I remind all listening to the debate, we are only talking \nabout legal immigrants being eligible for this relief.\n  President Bush in his budget message has endorsed this concept. Even \nformer Speaker Gingrich, who was the author of the original legislation \nprohibiting food stamps, has come around to the position that we should \nchange it. We now have the appropriate moment in time to move forward \nwith what is a very humane and positive thing for children across \nAmerica, particularly for families of legal immigrants.\n  We do two things in this legislation. We provide for a limitation on \nGovernment spending when it comes to farm programs so that new land is \nnot brought into production to take advantage of Federal programs. We \ntake the savings from that amendment and use it to provide food stamps \nfor children across America.\n  Last night it was my great fortune to be at an event honoring former \nSenators George McGovern and Bob Dole for their work in the field of \nnutrition and their cooperation over many decades. They pointed with \ngreat pride to the creation of the Food Stamp Program which has, with \nthe School Lunch Program and a few other commitments by the Federal \nGovernment, helped the poorest of the poor in America to receive basic \nnutrition and sustenance. The purpose of this Durbin amendment, \nsupported by Senators Harkin, Lugar, Wellstone and many others, is to \ncontinue in that tradition.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I stress again that the amendment is \nidentical to President Bush's budget proposal. I think all Senators \nappreciate that. I want to establish that again.\n  Secondly, I want to establish that the amendment does not affect in \nany way a producer's eligibility for conservation programs. It applies \nonly to\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\ncommodity programs and crop insurance. I point out that the land which \nexists in the Conservation Reserve Program would be eligible, and the \nanswer is, yes, CRP land specifically is exempted from the commodity \nprograms and crop insurance.\n  These questions have been raised because they are material to the \nsavings in the bill that are now to be applied for this important food \nstamp reform.\n  Having said that, I commend the amendment again to Senators, and I am \nhopeful we will have a strong vote in support.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is an important expansion \nof the Committee's nutrition title and I am proud to be a co-sponsor of \nthe Durbin amendment along with Senator Lugar and others. It builds on \nour provisions to restore benefits to legal immigrant children without \nthe 5 year waiting period and apply more reasonable food stamp \neligibility rules to working, tax paying immigrants. The amendment will \ncorrect an aspect of welfare reform that went too far.\n  Legal immigrants have made countless contributions to our country but \nmany are now in trouble. They are disproportionately represented in the \nservice jobs that have been hardest hit in the current recession. So \nnow is an opportune time to make improvements to immigrant eligibility \nin the Food Stamp Program.\n  I also want to focus on children for a minute. We have also heard \nthat from 1994 to 1998, 1 million poor citizen children of immigrant \nparents, left the program . . . a 74 percent decline for this group. \nThese are children who are entitled to participate in the program but \nwhose parents were confused about eligibility.\n  Do not be mistaken, this issue affects most States in our country. \nFor example, more than half of all low-income children in California \nlive with a non-citizen adult. Some of these children are citizens and \nothers are immigrants. Between 30 percent and 40 percent of low income \nchildren in Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, and New \nYork live in families with a non-citizen. In my own State of Iowa, \napproximately 14 percent of low income children live in families with a \nnon-citizen. We have seen time and again that in households where there \nare Food Stamp eligible children who live with a non-citizen adult, \noften time the adult does not seek out the assistance for the child.\n  Taken together, the 1998 bill that restored benefits to some children \nwhich I supported, along with this amendment and our immigrant \nprovisions in the underlying bill, will immediately help to prevent \nmany children from going to bed hungry at night. Their parents, will \nalso be able to participate in the program once they have worked in \nthis country for at least 4 years or have resided in the U.S. for at \nleast 5 years.\n  Now, for anyone who argues that people would move to this country to \nwait five years to receive a ``generous'' food stamp benefit, I want to \nremind all of us that the average household received a benefit of $175 \nper month in 2000. A family of 3 working 30 hours a week in a minimum \nwage job got just over $250 per month. That same family working 40 \nhours per week at $7.50 an hour received under $70 per week. In fact, \nUSDA just reported that food stamp recipients spend about 70 percent of \ntheir monthly benefits the first week and 90 percent by the end of the \nsecond week. People who participate in the Food Stamp Program are not \nliving ``high on the hog'' and they are certainly not coming to this \ncountry for that benefit.\n  Now, others before me have mentioned that 16 States spend their own \nfunds to provide food assistance to legal immigrants made ineligible by \nwelfare reform. Under this proposal, those States would now be able to \ndevote their State dollars to other worthwhile and much needed \ninitiatives.\n  Finally, I, too, want to commend the President for including this \nprovision in his 2003 budget proposal and Newt Gingrich who indicated \nthat welfare reform went too far when it removed the ability of legal \nimmigrants to participate in the Food Stamp Program.\n  Again, I am pleased to join Senators Durbin, Lugar, and others in co-\nsponsoring this amendment that will help provide nutrition for this \nvaluable group of people in our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLevin and Corzine be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield back that time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement, that we proceed. I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \nDurbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. There is a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2821, as modified.

Mr. President, I will be sending an amendment to the desk \non behalf of myself, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and joined by \ncosponsors Mr. Hagel, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. \nNelson, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \nKohl, and Mr. Brownback. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota, [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n     Fitzgerald, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n     Brownback, proposes an amendment numbered 2826 to amendment \n     No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand there is 1 hour 45 minutes evenly divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arkansas, \nMrs. Lincoln, be in control of the time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to offer the amendment. \nI ask I be allowed as much time as I may consume, following which I \nexpect Senator Grassley, who has worked with me in constructing this \namendment, will be recognized.\n  This amendment is about limitation on payments in the farm program. \nWe always have people coming to the floor of the Senate talking about \nthe requirement to help family farmers in our country. The reason I \nsupport a farm bill, the reason I fight so hard to try to get good farm \npolicy, is to help family farmers.\n  What do I mean by family farmers? I am talking about people out there \nliving under a yard light trying to raise a family and trying to \noperate a family farm and raise food. They go to town and buy their \nsupplies. I am talking about a network of food producers scattered \nacross this country that represents, in my judgment, food security for \nour country.\n  This issue of helping family farmers with a safety net in the form of \nfarm program payments during tough times is something that has become \nmuch different over a long period of time. It is not the case that we \nare fighting over farm program payments for family farmers. There is \nsome of that in the farm bill, but all of us recognize there is in this \nfarm bill substantial payments to some of the biggest operators in the \ncountry that have nothing to do with families, nothing to do with \nfamily farming.\n  Let me cite some examples of who gets farm program payments. Fortune \n500 companies get payments under the farm program; not much about \nfamilies there. City dwellers who have millions of dollars, who need \nthe farm program the least and do not have anything to do with the \nfamily farm, get farm program payments. Chase Manhattan Bank, farm \nprogram payments; colleges and universities--the list goes on forever.\n  This is about family farming, in my judgment. I am sure those who \nsupport this amendment, and there are many in the Chamber, are always \nasked the question: If you talk about family farmers, what do you mean \nby family? Define a family farm, they say. I defy you to tell me what \nit is.\n  If we took 10 minutes, we could agree on what it is not. Michelangelo \nonce sculpted David. They asked: How did you sculpt David?\n  He said: Easy; I took a block of marble and chipped away everything \nthat was not David.\n  We can chip away everything that is not a family farm and have a \ndecent idea of what a family farm is not. Is it a New York bank \noperating land in one of our States? I don't think so. Is a family \nfarmer a piece of ground owned by somebody who has lived in Los Angeles \nfor 40 years and the only time that person has come back to the family \nfarm area is for Thanksgiving, twice in 40 years; is that a family \nfarmer? I don't think so.\n  Is that where you want farm program payments to go? Or do you want, \nin small towns on Saturday night, to have a vibrant Main Street where \npeople come to town to buy supplies and park their vehicles? They are \nfamilies living on the farm and farming our land and raising our food, \nproducing our food and doing it by creating a network of broad-based \neconomic ownership on America's farms. Is that what we are talking \nabout? I think so.\n  What is this amendment? This amendment provides a $275,000 payment \nlimit. Some will roll their eyes and say: Are you kidding me? Two \nhundred seventy-five thousand dollars and you think that is a limit? \nThey will say it ought to be much lower than that. We will have trouble \ngetting this passed today because there are people who want it much \nhigher and some want no limits at all.\n  We propose $275,000. On direct and countercyclical payments there is \na $75,000 limit; marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments, a \n$150,000 limit; a husband and wife allowance, $50,000--for a total \nlimitation of $275,000.\n  Now, this Senate bill has a $500,000 limit, but it does not get rid \nof triple entities so you can collect more than that. Current law is \n$460,000, which means you can collect more than that because of triple \nentity rules and other things. The House bill is $550,000, and again we \nallow triple entities and so on. So these are not real limits. Ours is \na real limit.\n\n  We just talk about payments going to a tax ID, and we determine who \nthe taxpayer is here--this is not about taxes but it is determining who \nthe individual is--and we have a limitation.\n  We have seen a lot of these stories--incidentally, these are the \nkinds of stories which I think will ruin the climate in which we do \nfarm bills in the future. If we do not do something about this, the \nAmerican people and taxpayers generally are going to say that is not \nwhy we are paying taxes. We really support family farms. We believe \nfamily farms are important for America. But we believe we are not \npaying taxes so you can transfer money to the tune of millions, \nhundreds of millions, perhaps billions of dollars, to those who need it \nleast and ought not be getting farm payments.\n  This talks about a farm operation, a 61,000-acre spread, $30.8 \nmillion in sales last year, receiving $38 million in Federal crop \nsubsidies in 5 years. Is that what we are here for? Is that what this \nfight is about, to try to help family farmers? I do not think so. That \nis not why I am interested in this business.\n  Here is a letter from a North Dakota farmer, a person I have known \nfor some while. He is a good farmer. His son also started farming.\n\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: I know you are aware of the really \n     large operations in rural areas that are getting the big farm \n     payments. I feel strongly against these large payments which \n     are set forth in the current law. I hope you can fix this in \n     the farm bill.\n       The biggest operations keep getting the bulk of the farm \n     benefits while the small farmers are getting squeezed out of \n     the rural areas. When this happens, the family farm operation \n     can't compete with the larger enterprises because of the \n     financial disadvantages. Cash rents go up because of the huge \n     payments to these big operations, causing smaller farms to \n     quit.\n\n  In my judgment, if our goal is not to preserve a network of family \nproducers on America's farms, then we don't need a farm program, we \ndon't need a Department of Agriculture; get rid of it all. The \nDepartment of Agriculture started under Abraham Lincoln and had nine \nemployees. Now it has become this behemoth organization. But if our \ngoal is not to try to protect, nurture, and assist family farmers over \nprice valleys because they are too small to be able to survive these \nprecipitous international price drops for their crops, if our goal \nisn't to do that, get rid of the whole thing.\n  If that is our goal--and I believe it ought to be; I believe that is \nwhy the American people support a farm program--then let's shape this \nfarm program in a way that really does target the help to family \nproducers.\n  I have told so many stories about family farmers and why I believe \npassionately about what this issue should mean to our country. In \nEurope they\n\n[[Page S445]]\n\nhave a vibrant rural economy. Go to a small town in Europe on Saturday \nnight and see the main street full of pickup trucks and small cars. Do \nyou know why? Because Europe has said we have been hungry before and we \ndon't want to be hungry again and part of our national security is our \nfood security and part of that is rooted in the notion of trying to \npreserve a network of family producers on the land in Europe. They have \na farm program that does it. We ought not to disparage their farm \nprogram, we ought to applaud it, to say the goal of keeping small \nfamily producers, family operations, on the farm to produce a food \nsupply is a laudable goal.\n\n  Some in this Chamber will say this notion of a family farm is like \nthe little old diner that got left behind when the interstate came \nthrough. It is really fun to talk about it, but it is not real and it \nis not today's economy.\n  We can have the kind of economy we want. We can have the kind of \neconomy we choose. With farm policy, we can decide that our future is \nin 61,000-acre operations where we give $38 million in farm price \nsupports from the taxpayer to the biggest agrifactories in the country, \nor we can decide that those people out there--mothers, fathers, sons, \ndaughters--with 500 acres, 2,000 acres, yes, 8,000 acres, 10,000 acres, \ntrying to make a living, families trying to make a living out there on \nAmerica's farms are what are really important to this Senate and this \nCongress. We can do that in public policy, but we can only do that if \nwe pass this payment limitation amendment.\n  There is a lot to talk about. We will have people stand up and say: \nThis is outrageous; you are trying to penalize people who got big. That \nis not the case at all. We only have a certain amount of money. My \npoint is, let's layer it in from the bottom up to help those who need \nhelp the most. It doesn't penalize anybody. It just says: Here is the \nkind of economy we want. Here is what we want to invest in for \nAmerica's future. Here is what we want to do to help family farmers in \nour country.\n  Let me conclude by saying I represent a farm State. There are some in \nmy State who will be aggravated by this amendment. They are the ones \nwho would be affected by the limit. This is important and good public \npolicy so we can provide the best possible price supports during tough \ntimes to families who are farming America's land. That is the purpose. \nIt is not to penalize anybody. It is just to invest as best we can in \nthose family farmers struggling during price depressions, which have \nexisted now for some years, and to say to them: We care about you; we \ncare about the future; we want you to hang on because we want family \nfarming as a part of America's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  I assume the opponents have an equal amount of time. I believe \nSenator Grassley will be recognized next, on our side, as soon as an \nopponent is recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Under the order, time is \nequally divided. The Senator from Arkansas controls the time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the \nunderlying amendment on payment limitations. It seems that lately there \nhas been a lot of talk about this issue in newspapers, in the Halls of \nCongress, and in rural coffee shops around the country. We have all \nheard the horror stories about plutocrats getting rich off the Federal \ndole, some of which my colleague has mentioned.\n\n  Most of these stories are generated by groups that claim to represent \nthe interests of the family farmer but, in truth, could not care less \nabout the family farmer. Instead, they wouldn't shed a tear to see \nAmerican agriculture dead and buried and the land that our fathers have \nfarmed left to lie fallow forever.\n  It is shameful enough that those who spread these stories claim to do \nso in the name of the farmer while in fact working to remove him from \nthe very land he farms. But it is downright vile that they do so by \nhawking misleading information and creating a false impression of the \npersons on the land. This misleading tone has unfortunately served as \nan undercurrent for these hallway and rural coffee shop debates.\n  The people hurt by these misleading deceptions are the same farmers \nand their families that we in Congress say we are trying to protect. \nThese are the families who produce our food and fiber.\n  I am proud that Arkansas is home to thousands of these families, and \nI am committed to serving their needs. While America is not the \nagrarian society it once was, there are still areas of our country, \nlike much of my State, where agriculture is the economy, where whole \ncommunities celebrate harvests with festivals--rice festivals and \ncotton festivals--where farmers take great pride in producing our \ncountry's food supply. That is why these false impressions bother me so \nmuch. It is not the plutocrat who is getting hurt by these false \nimpressions. He doesn't exist anymore; he is a myth. But even though he \nis a myth, everyone has been led to believe in him, so much so that now \nwe are literally debating how big a farm is allowed to be in order to \nreceive our dint of approval.\n  But how can we in Congress decide what size a farm should be? The \nproblem with setting some arbitrary level for farm size, which this \namendment would do, is that ``big'' means different things to different \nfarmers in different parts of our country.\n  One farming couple, Gary and Pam Bradlow of England, AR, are listed \nby one Web site as the top recipient of farm payments in their area. \nSurely, then, the Bradlows must operate a huge farm. Surely they are \nwealthy plutocrats, jet-setting about the Caribbean on their yacht. In \nfact, the Bradlows are struggling to keep their heads above water. They \nfarm 2,000 acres--probably a large farm in the minds of many people, \nbut in truth, on this farm they barely achieve the economy of scale \nthey need to survive. This is because they happen to grow rice, which \nis the most expensive, capital-intensive program crop a farmer can \ngrow.\n  The other most expensive, capital-intensive crop, of course, is \ncotton, which happens to be the other main crop of my State of \nArkansas. In fact, rice and cotton are significantly more costly to \ngrow than any program crops.\n  As this chart shows, the average input cost of production per acre \nfor rise is $697.\n  For cotton it is $538 per acre.\n  What are these input costs? Things such as seed and fertilizer, or a \n200 horsepower tractor that costs almost $100,000, or a $125,000 \ncombine; many of these are things that every farmer has to buy. But \nsome of these input costs are specific to rice and cotton cultivation: \nThings such as a 9976 six-row cotton picker, which costs $285,000 at a \ndealership in Blytheville, AR; or the tremendous costs required to \nmanage all the water needed to successfully raise a rice crop, a cost \nwhich could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars for even a \nrelatively small farm.\n  These unique costs are significant and they push the cost of \nproduction for rice and cotton to levels far above that for other \nprogram crops.\n  Let's look at another crop, say, sorghum. The average input cost of \nproduction per acre for sorghum is only $161 per acre.\n  Even for corn, the average input cost per acre is only $356, almost \nhalf the average input cost to produce rice.\n  Let me point out that it is not my purpose in showing these \ndisparities to argue that farmers of these other crops do not also \ndeserve support--far to the contrary. Farmers of these other crops need \nfarm support because they also have to deal with rising costs, sinking \nprices, and unfair trade for overseas. My purpose in pointing out these \ndisparities in the average input costs of production is to illustrate \nwhy payment limitations generally affect the farmers of rice and cotton \nin my state, and across the South, before they affect farmers of other \ncrops. But make no mistake about it, this amendment would devastate \nfarmers of every program crop, and then some. That is why the major \ncommodity associations representing every program crop strongly oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I have a copy of a letter here signed by these organizations: The \nAmerican Cotton Shippers Association, the American Society of Farm \nManagers and Rural Appraisers, the Alabama Farmers Federation, the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S446]]\n\nFarm Bureau, the American Soybean Association, the Agricultural Retail \nAssociation, the Wheat Growers, Barley Growers, Corn Growers, the \nCotton Council, Grain, Sorghum, Sunflower, Rice Millers, Peanut \nFarmers, Canola, and U.S. Rice Producers Group.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Tim Hutchinson,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchinson: The organizations listed below \n     represent a significant majority of the production of food \n     and fiber in the United States. We are writing to urge you \n     and your colleagues to oppose amendments to new farm \n     legislation, which would further reduce limitations on farm \n     program benefits below levels included in the Committee's \n     bill (S. 1731). In testimony presented to Congress concerning \n     new farm legislation virtually every commodity and farm \n     organization opposed payment limitations.\n       One of the primary objectives of new farm legislation is to \n     improve the financial safety net available to farmers and to \n     eliminate the need for annual emergency assistance packages. \n     If limitations on benefits are made more restrictive than \n     those in S. 1731, a significant number of farmers will not \n     benefit from the improved safety net. Simply stated, payment \n     limits bite hardest when commodity prices are lowest. The \n     addition of new crops (i.e. peanuts and soybeans) to the list \n     of those eligible for fixed and counter-cyclical payments \n     will mean even more producers are adversely affected by new \n     limitations.\n       Proponents of tighter, more restrictive limitations will \n     argue that farm programs cause farmers to enlarge their \n     operations and that a few are receiving most of the benefits. \n     Farmers expand in order to achieve economy of scale and to be \n     competitive in domestic and international markets. Randomly \n     established limitations and increased regulatory burdens do \n     not promote efficiency or competitiveness, but they do \n     increase costs and increase the workload for USDA employees.\n       One of the most popular results of the last farm bill was \n     that producers could spend less time at their county FSA \n     office and more time managing their farming operations. \n     Farmers felt the government had stopped micro-managing their \n     business plans. With passage of the Grassley or Dorgan \n     amendments, farmers can look forward to many more trips to \n     their county FSA office. In all likelihood they will be \n     required to provide their private tax records to USDA to \n     prove they do not meet an arbitrary means-test income limit \n     that disqualifies them from participating in all federal farm \n     programs.\n       Please consider the following:\n       If row-crop producers are forced to reduce plantings due to \n     tighter payment limitations, acreage will likely switch to \n     specialty crops. Increased production could drastically \n     impact specialty crop markets.\n       A means test, at any level, disadvantages high value crop \n     producers and livestock operators.\n       Congress enacted legislation requiring program participants \n     to meet actively-engaged-in-farming rules and established the \n     3-entity rule to further limit benefits.\n       Marketing loans are designed to encourage producers to \n     aggressively market crops; limitations on the operation of \n     the marketing loan would contradict its primary objective; \n     there was no limit on the marketing loan program in 1985; \n     since then Congress has reduced the limit to $200,000 (for \n     all crops) and then to $75,000 before temporarily increasing \n     the limit to $150,000 in recent years to ensure that the \n     program could achieve its objectives in times of \n     extraordinarily low prices.\n       A stringent payment limit amendment will overwhelm FSA \n     employees who will be asked to implement new farm law in \n     record time and administer these draconian new limitations.\n       The actively engaged provisions contained in the Grassley \n     and Dorgan amendments would prevent many widowed farm wives \n     from participating in government price support programs.\n       Recent statistics released by environmental groups \n     overstate payments by aggregating 5 years of data and failing \n     to account for the sharing of those payments to individuals \n     in families; cooperatives, partnerships and corporations \n     listed as recipients.\n       The existing limitations in S. 1731 on direct payments, new \n     counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan gains are not \n     insignificant. Further, the regulations requiring recipients \n     to meet actively engaged criteria remain in place and are \n     enforced by the Department of Agriculture.\n       We strongly urge the Senate to defeat the Grassley and \n     Dorgan amendments as well as any other proposals to limit \n     eligibility for economic assistance during times of low \n     prices when farmers need it most.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, this letter points out one of the \nworst things about payment limits, that they bite hardest when \ncommodity prices are lowest.\n  How would farmers be hurt? One way they would be hurt is because this \namendment would discontinue availability of generic commodity \ncertificates which offer farmers better access to the marketing loan \nprogram.\n  Marketing loan support is most important when prices are low. Let's \nsay there is a year in which the global market is swamped, in large \npart because of foreign farmers who are much more heavily subsidized. \nAmerican farmers have fewer global markets, so now the domestic market \nbecomes oversupplied. The price plummets, just as it has for every \nprogram crop over the past several years. Because the price is lower, \nthe value of loan deficiency payments would be higher, and farmers \nwould hit their new payment limitation sooner. This means that a larger \nportion of their crop is now unavailable for marketing loan support. \nBecause prices are so low, they cannot possibly recoup their cost of \nproduction through the market. If they are lucky, they only fall into \ndeeper debt. If they are unlucky, then they are forced to default on \ntheir loans and the bank seizes whatever assets they have: their \nequipment, their land, their house.\n  Generic certificates would offer these farmers more access to the \nmarketing loan program, but this amendment would eliminate that \nbenefit.\n  In what other ways would they be hurt? Well, this amendment would \ntake away the 3-entity rule. Why is that important?\n  To understand this, let's look back to why the 3-entity rule was \ncreated in the first place.\n  The 1985 farm bill created the marketing loan program with no payment \nlimitations. Later, Congress decided in its infinite wisdom that, even \nthough farmers were going out of business and people were leaving farms \nand rural towns in dramatic numbers, it had made it too easy for \nfarmers to make a handsome living. So it decided to begin placing \ndollar limits on payments, even though it unfairly disadvantaged \nfarmers who, with higher value crops, reached these limits much faster \nthan farmers of other crops. But it was apparent that to do that would \nquickly put even more people out of business, so Congress tried to \ncushion the blow by allowing farmers to apply for payments through up \nto three entities. This allowed people who farmed with their wives and \nchildren to get enough support to keep the family farm viable.\n  So, from the beginning, the 3-entity rule was put in place to avoid \nthe massive bankruptcies that would otherwise occur if payment \nlimitations were imposed without it. But even though farmers continued \nto go out of business, and rural communities continued to decline, \nCongress decided to lower payment limits again. Then, Congress passed \nFreedom to Farm and all heck broke loose. Prices plummeted, farmers \nbegan dropping like flies, and Congress was forced to begin passing \nemergency relief bills--4 years in a row--to keep rural America from \nfalling stone dead.\n  Now, in the wake of all this, comes this amendment that wants to lay \nthat one last straw on the camel's back by taking away the 3-entity \nrule--the one thing that has kept thousands of farmers hanging on. And \nit comes at a time when farmers are suffering about as bad as they ever \nhave. It comes at a time when virtually every farmer and every farm \norganization is coming to Congress in droves begging, pleading with us \nto increase farm support. And, remember, it isn't just farmers of the \nhigh-value crops like cotton and rice who are in need.\n  It's also the corn farmers, soybean farmers, wheat farmers, and \nfarmers of just about every other crop. They are all suffering. And \nthis is very important to remember, because this amendment will hurt \nthese farmers, too--even the farmers of specialty crops; they don't \nparticipate in these programs.\n  Specialty crop farmers will be significantly hurt because tightened \npayment limitations force farmers to reduce plantings of the program \ncrops. In many parts of the country where they grow specialty crops, \nplaces such as California and the Far West, Florida, and many of the \nAtlantic States, and many of the Mountain states, much of the land that \nis currently planted in program crops will soon be switched to \nspecialty crops. When that happens you will see the prices of these \nspecialty crops dive even lower than they are now, and then these \nfarmers will be forced out of business.\n\n[[Page S447]]\n\n  So it isn't just farmers of rice and cotton. Nevertheless, it is this \ndisparity in cost of production between the high-value crops such as \nrice and cotton and the lower value crops that provides the clue to \nunderstanding why this amendment is so dangerous, and would be so \ndevastating, to the farmers in my State and to farmers across the \ncountry. Yet, this point is only one of the many mysteries and myths \nthat cloud this issue.\n  I would like to try to paint a clearer picture, to bring some clarity \nto this confusion, and perhaps it would be easiest to do this by \npointing out what freedom to farm sought to accomplish.\n  The main premise behind freedom to farm was that farmers had become \naddicted to subsidies, and that they needed to be liberated into the \nglorious free market that we would soon create within the ambit of the \nWorld Trade Organization. Farmers were told they needed to make their \noperations more market-oriented, that they needed to learn to respond \nto free market signals.\n  We set in motion a plan to wean farmers from government support.\n  We gave them planting flexibility. We told them we would negotiate \naway the trade barriers overseas competitors erected to block them. We \ntold them the world would follow our example if only we would lead by \nexample and unilaterally disarm.\n  Well, we disarmed. We began to lower our farm support, but the world \ndid not follow. The result has been 6 years of disaster. Prices have \nplummeted in virtually every commodity, even while input costs continue \nto rise. Farmers are going out of business and rural towns are heading \nfor the abyss.\n  So we, in Congress, have tried to respond with a new farm bill. \nChairman Harkin has introduced a very good bill that seeks to answer \nthe needs of our farmers. I compliment him on his hard work, his \ndiligence, and his patience in bringing us a bill from the Senate \nAgriculture Committee that does just that in its diversity and its \nattention to assisting farmers. It is a bill that renews the \nGovernment's commitment to farmers in the rural economy, one that \noffers a bedrock, strong safety net.\n  But let us not lie to ourselves. This is not a complete fix, by any \nstretch. Prices are still in the tank. It will take some time for those \nprices to rebound, even if the rural economy responds immediately and \npositively to our new farm policy. Until then, our farmers will \ncontinue to struggle under the burden of low prices.\n  How low have the prices sunk? As this next chart shows, the price of \ncotton last year sank to its lowest level in more than two decades.\n  For rice--shown on our next chart--the story is even worse. Last year \nrice prices sank to a level lower than they were in 1947. Yet cotton \nand rice farmers still have to wrestle with an ever-rising cost of \nproduction.\n  As this next chart shows--and it is actually my favorite chart--input \ncosts have risen steadily while prices have remained flat or even \ndropped. This point is never mentioned in those horror stories that we \nsee in newspapers and on the Web sites. Talking about the unbelievable \namounts of money these farmers are getting, we never hear one single \nmention of what these producers are spending.\n  Farmers need more support and higher prices because their costs are \nforever rising. Let's think about what this means. What products do we \nbuy in our everyday lives for which the prices are just as low today as \nthey were in 1947?\n  Imagine trying to support your family in the 21st century--with the \ncost of housing as it is today, with energy prices shooting through the \nroof, as they did last year, with cars, clothes, everything you can \nthink of that you have to buy costing as much as they do today--imagine \ndoing all of that on the amount of money your father or grandfather \nearned in 1947. You could not do it.\n  That is what rice farmers face. And that is what cotton farmers face. \nAnd that is what soybean farmers and corn farmers and wheat farmers and \nall of the others face, too.\n  That is why every organization, representing every program crop, and \nseveral others on top of all of that, strongly oppose this amendment. \nThey know they will have to continue to face the squeeze between \nplummeting farm prices and the ever-rising farm costs of production. \nYet even as they are squeezed, we tell our farmers they must still go \nout and wrestle with the heavily distorted global marketplace--a \nmarketplace distorted beyond recognition by foreign subsidies so high \nthey would be unrecognizable to us.\n  We tell our farmers they must still find ways to be market oriented, \nto be more responsive to the market signals--in a word: to be more \ncompetitive.\n  What does any business have to do to become more competitive? It must \nfind ways to lower its per unit cost of production. To do this, most \nbusinesses find it necessary to increase their economies of scale. That \nis how the marketplace works. That is what our farmers in Arkansas have \nhad to do.\n  Mr. Greg Day, a constituent of mine who farms in Grady, AR, used to \nfarm cotton on only 1,700 acres. But because of the declining health of \nthe farm economy, because of the changing world in which he lives, he \nhas had to double his acreage to 3,400 acres in order to spread out his \ncosts, just to maintain the level of revenue he needs to keep his head \nabove water.\n  And now along comes an amendment that tells him that we want to \ndiscourage the very course of action he has had to follow to survive. \nIt says to farmers: Do not do what you have to do to become more \ncompetitive.\n  It is as if Congress is, on the one hand, telling farmers to \nparticipate in the real business world where the most competitive \nsurvive, but, on the other hand, telling them not to do what will make \nthem more competitive.\n  Congress has sent contradicting signals to farmers because it is \nstill clouded by these false pictures, these myths of what is the \naverage farmer.\n  We still impose upon farmers this mythic, old-fashioned notion that, \nwhile the rest of us live in the 21st century, farmers ought to make a \nliving as our grandfathers did 75 or 100 years ago. But our \ngrandfathers were never asked to meet the regulations of today's EPA or \nthe Corps of Engineers and wetland regulations. Our grandfathers were \nnever asked to meet the regulations for chemical application, \nfertilizer application--all of the other really positive ideas that \nhave come out of agriculture in ways that we can be more efficient and \nmore sensitive to the environment. Our grandfathers never operated \nunder those restrictions.\n  And that myth imagines that we ought to stamp out anybody and \nanything that looks too big, anything that looks too global, anything \nthat looks too corporate. But, colleagues, there are no big, faceless \ncorporations arriving in our small towns from the big cities and \npushing our families off the farms, eating up all the land, and ruining \nthe rural landscape. That is just another myth as well.\n  Many of those mentioned by my colleague--large banks, millionaires--\nsome of them are landowners through a default on loans. Some of them \nare large landowners because they are age-old families. Some of them \nhave acquired land because they purchased it.\n  The farm families who are farming these lands are the same families \nwho were farming it back when our grandfathers were farming. They are \njust families like yours and mine. There are fewer of them, \nunfortunately, but not because big corporations from big office towers, \nwith wealthy shareholders, took their place. There are fewer farmers \nbecause, for too long, we have let inadequate policy and crushing low \nprices push them out. And you do not remedy this situation by outlawing \nthe farmers who grow higher value crops and who need bigger farms. If \nyou do that, then all we will have accomplished in this body is to \ncreate a policy that puts both the smaller farmer and the bigger farmer \nout of business.\n  Smaller farmers are not going out of business because bigger farmers \nare hogging a disproportionate share of Government support. Smaller \nfarmers are going out of business because the world is changing, \nbecause we have a global marketplace, because there is global \ncompetition from more heavily subsidized farmers overseas.\n  You are not going to fix that by simply saying: We don't want bigger \nfarms. You are not going to fix the North Dakota wheat farmer's \nproblems by putting the Arkansas rice farmer out of business. The Iowa \ngrain farmer isn't going to do better because the Louisiana cotton \nfarmer went out of business.\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\n  But this amendment will make it so much harder on the Arkansas rice \nfarmer and the Louisiana cotton farmer to make ends meet, just as it \nwill eventually hurt soybean farmers in Missouri and Maryland, and corn \nfarmers in Indiana and Kansas, and wheat farmers in Wyoming, and so on. \nAll of these farmers are in this boat together. That is why all of \nthese commodity organizations are banding together to oppose this \namendment.\n  Simply put, approving this amendment will accomplish nothing more \nthan targeting these cotton and rice farmers and making it harder for \nthem to get the farm support they need to simply survive. Who would \nfarm in my State then? It will not be any of the farmers whose stories \nI have told you today. And it will not be their children.\n  I come from a seventh generation farm family. I am a sister, \ndaughter, and granddaughter of a rice farmer.\n  My grandfather passed on to his grandchildren land that had been in \nour family for generations. Of the nine grandchildren he had, only two \nof us still want to try and make a go at farming. Once they drop out, \nthe Lambert family will be out of farming perhaps totally. These \nnewspaper articles that have spread misinformation about me and many \nothers never tell that side of the story. These interest groups, Web \nsites that claim to speak on behalf of the family farmer, all of these \neditorial writers who publish arguments as if they know anything about \nfarming, they never tell you about the farmer who cannot afford to get \nout because all of his debt and his only assets are both tied up in \nland, but who cannot afford to keep farming either because every year a \nlittle bit more of his grandfather's legacy slips away into red ink.\n  They never tell you about the town that will dry up because Congress, \nin its infinite wisdom, decided to play God and arbitrarily decide that \nall the farmers in that town should go out of business because somebody \nup in Washington did not like how they got bigger, even though they got \nbigger because that same Congress also told them to act like an \nordinary business and get more efficient.\n  Who is going to keep revenue coming into that rural town that is \ndrying up? Who is going to provide jobs and keep the property tax bases \nlow so there is money to fund the schools? I don't think we can afford \nto take the risk necessary to find out.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and reserve the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, when I read the list of the cosponsors, \nI was mistaken to read Senator Cochran's name. He is not a cosponsor of \nthis amendment. The amendment was originally drafted to be submitted as \na second-degree amendment to the Cochran amendment to the commodity \ntitle in December. I read from a list that included his name on the \nbottom. He certainly is not a cosponsor. It was my mistake. My \napologies to Senator Cochran.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cochran's name be stricken from \nthe Record in that section where I identified cosponsors. He is not and \nhas not been a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield as much time as he may consume to the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I take the opportunity at this point to yield to the \nSenator from Nebraska 5 minutes or as much as he might use of that \namount.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Nebraska \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Iowa.\n  I rise this morning as a cosponsor of the Dorgan-Grassley amendment. \nWe have heard and will hear this morning about large farms, small \nfarms, medium-sized farms, baby farms, grandpa farms, a lot of farms. \nThe fact is, large farms gain additional subsidies for every new acre \nthey buy and every new bushel of grain they produce. In fact, the \ntaxpayer, the Federal Government, subsidizes this transaction.\n  Recently, the North Platte, Nebraska Telegraph wrote an excellent \neditorial pointing out the problems with the current farm payment \nsystem. I ask unanimous consent to print the full text of this \neditorial in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HAGEL. The North Platte Nebraska editorial stated in part:\n\n       Fortified with subsidy money, the largest farms continue to \n     plant millions of acres of crops, bidding up the price of \n     land to do so. That creates more surpluses, low grain prices, \n     continued low grain prices and a false land market.\n       Present farm policy discourages small- and medium-sized \n     farm operations, and it discourages young people from \n     entering the business.\n\n  Those of us in farm country recall the difficulties of the 1980s and \nwhat the agricultural community in this country went through. Partly \nthat was a result of a false floor as a result of inflation in bidding \nup land prices. When it crashed, everything crashed. I suspect we are \nheading for such a time, unless we correct and address exactly what the \nNorth Platte Telegraph talked about in their editorial.\n  Consider that since passage of the 1996 farm bill, we have spent a \ntotal of $62.3 billion in direct payments to producers, and that in \nfiscal year 2000, 63 percent of that $62.3 billion in direct payments \nto producers went to the largest 10 percent of farmers. I don't know, \nbecause I wasn't around 70 years ago when we established a farm policy \nin this country, but I think I do understand that there was a general \nintent not for this kind of misplacement of taxpayers' dollars to \ncontinue. The point is, this was never the intent of farm policy 70 \nyears ago.\n  A recent poll conducted by land grant universities showed that 81 \npercent of farmers want stricter payment limits. In my State of \nNebraska, 85 percent agreed with tougher limits. This year, the \nNebraska Farm Bureau for the first time voted to support payment \nlimits.\n  The amendment we are proposing would still allow for very generous \nfarm payments, but it would remove the loopholes that allow a handful \nof large farmers to receive unlimited payments. This amendment will \nmake certain that Federal commodity payments are structured to help \nthose who need it, those whom these programs were in fact intended to \nhelp--the real farmers. It will also help ensure that those who receive \nFederal agricultural payments are actually involved in agricultural \nproduction. That would be novel.\n  That, again, was the original purpose, the intent of farm support \nprograms. This is the kind of reform I believe strengthens a new farm \nbill.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, made an interesting \npoint in referencing the Washington Post editorial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. The question might be asked: What does the Washington Post \nknow about farm policy? That is a legitimate question. Probably very \nlittle. The point made in that editorial is a very real point in that \nthe continued support of the Congress, representatives of the people of \nthis country, to pay for another $63 billion in additional farm subsidy \nprograms isn't going to continue to be there. Until we bring some \nreality and common sense to our system, to our program, then \npolitically it becomes more and more difficult each year to sustain \nthat subsidy program.\n  It is worth noting also that this payment limitation reform would \nsave $1.3 billion, according to CBO. And some of those savings would be \nreinvested in agriculture--increasing funding for the Beginning Farmers \nand Ranchers Loan Program--that is very important for new farmers and \nranchers--expanding the Crop Insurance Program, which is, in fact, the \nway to eventually go in securing and sustaining the ability of farmers \nto produce and survive and prosper. It would boost nutrition programs.\n\n[[Page S449]]\n\n  Farm support programs are vital, of course, to our farm families and \nour agricultural communities. We are not arguing that point. But \nwithout real payment limitation reform, we will continue to weaken the \nsame farmers we claim we want to help.\n  I appreciate the work done by my colleagues from North Dakota and \nIowa and others on this issue and support their efforts to bring some \naccountability and common sense to agricultural policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Dorgan-Grassley amendment. I am \nproud to stand with their efforts today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            [From the North Platte Telegraph, Dec. 16, 2001]\n\n     To Too Few, Too Much--Government Needs To Limit Farm Subsidies\n\n       As the U.S. Senate debated the farm bill this week, there \n     was at least one thing on which senators seemed to agree: \n     federal farm payments to the largest farmers are too large.\n       Even farm-state senators decry the problem.\n       Nebraska Sens. Ben Nelson and Chuck Hagel, along with \n     colleagues from Iowa and the Dakotas, have worked on \n     amendments to curb the excess.\n       The problem, simply stated, is that more than two-thirds of \n     federal farm payments go to fewer than 10 percent of farms.\n       Fortified with subsidy money, the largest farms nationwide \n     continue to plant millions of acres of crops, bidding up the \n     price of land to do so. That creates more surpluses, low \n     grain prices and a false land market.\n       On hearing the news, the first thought is to urge that \n     subsidies be eliminated. That would take care of the abuse \n     and save tax-payers money.\n       But farm subsidies are necessary. With abundant farmland \n     and hardworking and talented farmers, the United States \n     constantly produces more food than its people can consume.\n       The excess goes to buyers in other nations. But when \n     foreign markets for farm products fall to materialize, such \n     as in 1999 when Asian economies collapsed, U.S. farmers need \n     federal assistance. That help is vital here in Nebraska, \n     where the economy is dependent on agriculture.\n       The challenge of federal subsidies is in their design. The \n     law is complex. Flaws are magnified.\n       Here's a flaw everyone agrees on: virtually unlimited farm \n     payments make for too few farmers.\n       Once, farming was a lifestyle choice. Now, it has become a \n     big business. Unlimited federal farm payments make the \n     problem worse.\n       Present farm policy discourages small and medium-sized farm \n     operations, and it discourages young people from entering the \n     business.\n       For years, farmers and city folks alike have grumbled about \n     the farm program. That grumbling has been amplified by an \n     environmental group willing to get the facts.\n       At www.ewg.org, the Environmental Working Group lists \n     virtually every farmer in the nation that received federal \n     dollars during the past five years. It lists every dollar the \n     farmer received--and from what federal program.\n       The list is a stunning achievement, assembled from public \n     records by diligent people. And the content is stunning.\n       Click on the information for Nebraska and you can see the \n     money received by more than 35,000 farmers.\n       From 1996 to 2000, the largest farmer received $2.65 \n     million. The 10th largest got about half that amount, $1.32 \n     million. Many received sizable sums. The 100th largest got \n     $625,000.\n       Hagel, along with senators from North Dakota, South Dakota \n     and Iowa, has proposed an absolute maximum cap of $275,000 in \n     any one year. If farms are big enough to net $2.5 million in \n     profits during three years, they would get nothing.\n       Those limits aren't enough.\n       Only a fraction of the nation's farmers could net $2.5 \n     million in three years. Limiting the maximum payment in any \n     one year to about $275,000 would cut funds for only the \n     largest 100 or so farms last year.\n       Farmers, speaking through a poll taken a few months ago, \n     said a limit of about $60,000 would be fine.\n       While that limit would drastically cut into large-scale \n     agribusinesses that have grown up around the farm program \n     during times of record-low grain prices, it is a worthy \n     target.\n\n\n                  big winners in farm subsidy policies\n\n       (These figures, taken from the Environmental Working Group \n     Web site, show the top-50 recipients of federal farm \n     subsidies in Nebraska for the last four years.)\n       Here are the top Nebraska recipients of federal farm aid \n     between the years 1996 and 2000.\n       Rank, name, location, and total.\n       1.

The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nHutchinson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I thank the \nSenator from Arkansas for her excellent statement in opposition to this \namendment. I rise in strong opposition.\n  This past weekend I was in Lawrence County, AR, at a farm auction in \nPortia where three farmers were selling out. They were selling their \nequipment. They put it up for auction. As I stood there and heard their \nstories, these were not--and I emphasize to my colleagues these were \nnot--small farmers, depending on how you define ``small.'' They had a \nlot of acreage but did not have a lot of income. In fact, the story was \nthey could not make the cash flow, and they were calling it quits.\n  They told me that within a 6-mile radius of where that farm auction \nwas going on there had been 10 other farmers who had auctioned their \nfarms off, they had gone out of business in the previous month. So when \nwe hear what my colleague calls plutocrats, a few getting these vast \namounts of money, it simply does not reflect the reality of rural \nArkansas. It does not reflect the reality of what my constituents are \nfacing when we see these Web pages and see how much was received in \npayments. It does not reflect their net income. It does not tell us \nwhat their input cost was. It does not tell us the reality farmers in \nthe delta, the poorest part of this country, are facing today.\n  Farm programs are not and they have never been considered means \ntesting programs. They were never supposed to be for the benefit of a \ncertain economic class or based upon the size of the farm or upon the \nsize of a person's house or what their bank account balance might be or \nhow much they paid in income taxes or some other measure of financial \ncondition.\n  That is not the way our farm program was intended to operate. It was \nto ensure that Americans have a safe, reliable, and affordable food \nsupply and that our farmers, who are some of the most technologically \nadvanced and environmentally sound producers in the world, are able to \ncompete.\n\n[[Page S450]]\n\n  It has worked. Is it perfect? No. Are there inequities? Yes. Are \nthere competitions between regions of the country? Yes. But it has \nprovided this country a cheap, affordable, reliable, safe, and \nenvironmentally protected food supply. And what the proponents of this \namendment are seeking to do is to absolutely pull the rug out from \nunder the producers who have provided this great condition in this \ncountry.\n  In Arkansas, agriculture is 25 percent of the State's economy, but \nthat does not even tell the story because it does not account for the \nthousands of jobs that are related to agricultural production, such as \nbankers, car dealers, implement dealers, schools, restaurants, and may \nI say even churches that are dependent upon the survival of the farm \neconomy. Farming is the lifeblood of my State, as it is with many rural \nStates.\n  The farm program and the subsidies have been made necessary by a \nmarket that is not functioning properly for several reasons: due to \nhigh foreign subsidies, high foreign tariffs, and very strict domestic \nenvironmental regulations.\n  Senator Conrad has reminded us many times that in the European Union \nproducers receive an average of about $360 per acre while U.S. \nproducers receive an average of about $60 per acre, one-sixth what they \nget in Europe.\n\n  U.S. agricultural products are subjected to an average tariff of \nabout 60 percent, whereas agricultural products coming into the U.S. \nare only subjected to an average tariff of 14 percent. Whether it is \nsubsidies, whether it is the tariffs, or whether it is the \nenvironmental regulations--the very stringent environmental \nregulations, the most stringent in the world with which our producers \nmust comply--they are at this great disadvantage in competition. That \nis why we have to sustain and preserve these programs.\n  The United States has two choices: We can support our farmers and \nretain our position as the world's most productive and environmentally \nsound producer of agricultural products or we can cede this important \nmarket to our European competitors or Third World developing nations \nand become as reliant on foreign food as we are right now on foreign \noil.\n  In my mind, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, this is not \njust saving rural Arkansas, this is not just preserving a farm economy; \nit is a national security issue because if we rip the heart out of our \nagricultural programs, our farm programs in this country with the kind \nof payment limitation amendment before us today, we will eventually \nsubject ourselves and make ourselves reliant upon and dependent upon \nforeign agricultural products, suppliers, and producers.\n  It appears many of the environmental groups have chosen to support \nthis effort in the hope that if you get the commodity title of the farm \nbill through this amendment, more money will be available for \nconservation programs. We need to think about that a little bit.\n  If we take our productive lands out of production or force our \nproducers into bankruptcy, other countries that are more highly \nsubsidized or Third World developing nations that do not have any type \nof environmental regulations in place will simply put more land in \nproduction, and the end result for our world will be a less \nenvironmentally safe place.\n  It is very shortsighted to adopt this amendment. Basically, taking \nour producers off the land will cede an important market to our \ncompetitors, will lead to more land going into production, will not \nresult in better prices, and, in fact, will lead to greater threats to \nour environment.\n  Conservation programs are very good and very practical, but taking \nour most productive lands out of production and putting our best \nproducers out of business is a misguided and improper policy.\n  In Arkansas, my farmers, both large and small, my constituents have \nbeen very clear that this amendment will spell disaster for farmers in \nArkansas. What I saw on Saturday in Portia, AK, will be replicated over \nand over. The Dorgan-Grassley amendment diverts attention from \nconstructive debate about how to improve farm policy and restore the \nopportunities for farmers to regain profitability.\n  This amendment will not help farmers, but it will delay or reduce \nassistance to them as we will have to at that point oppose a bill that \nwill be counterproductive to agriculture in this country.\n  This amendment will only result in a divisive debate over which \nfarmers should be eligible for benefits, what constitutes ``need,'' and \nhow large should farms be. They may be issues we need to consider, but \nthis is not going to improve rural communities or address the issues \nfacing our Nation's producers.\n  I found it interesting that the sponsor of this amendment spoke of \nthe size and the growth of the Department of Agriculture. I say to my \ncolleagues, this amendment will increase USDA's administrative costs, \nrequire more Government employees, cause our farmers to spend scarce \nfinancial resources on compliance with redtape rather than making them \nmore competitive. This is going to result in the growth of the \nAgriculture Department and more bureaucracy and redtape for cotton \nfarmers, rice farmers, and peanut farmers.\n  The adoption of the Grassley amendment will mean the Senate's farm \nbill will offer far less assistance than current law, which, in itself, \nhas proven to be woefully ineffective in times of low prices.\n  This is not a free vote for Senators who expect the House is going to \nfix it. House and Senate conferees will be under extreme pressure to \nfinish the conference quickly, compromise in such a way that we will \nnot see the elimination of this amendment in conference, and it will be \ndisastrous for Southern agriculture.\n  The means test this amendment includes would require every farmer to \ntake his or her tax return to an FSA office to prove eligibility. \nAdding another level of redtape and bureaucracy will only compound the \nproblem, limit the support, and make the implementation of a new farm \nbill almost impossible. Who is that going to benefit? Certainly not the \nfarmers.\n  This amendment will overwhelm FSA employees who will be asked to \nimplement new farm laws in record time and administer these new \nlimitations.\n  There are different regions of the country with different needs, but \nthis arbitrary limitation is nothing less than war on Southern farmers. \nIt is aimed at Southern farmers.\n  I end my remarks by saying we must not turn our backs on rural \nAmerica. This amendment will gut our Nation's most productive farmers \nand force rural America into a financial crisis that our Nation has not \nexperienced in decades.\n  I am glad I was in Lawrence County this weekend. I was glad I was \nthere to see firsthand the suffering, to see farmers who are calling it \nquits, to see the ads in the newspapers saying four more farmers \nquitting today; to see hundreds of farmers lined up to see if they \ncould buy a bargain, because they cannot afford new implements, to see \nif they could buy from those who are going out of business.\n  I do not know what they may face in Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, or \nSouth Dakota, but I know what they are facing in Arkansas. I know what \nthey are facing in the South, and it is not as it has been portrayed by \nthe Washington Post.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a second look before they support a \nmisguided, though well-meaning, amendment. I ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Dorgan-Grassley payment limitation amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota. \nSenator Lugar would be the next person I would go to, and then Senator \nNickles wanted some time. I want to make sure he knows I reserved him \nsome time, too. We are going back and forth, I know, but that is the \norder I want my side to know that I am yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I thank my friend from Iowa for \nyielding me this time. I rise to offer support for this bipartisan \namendment Senator Dorgan and Senator Grassley have sponsored.\n  This is truly an astonishing debate. People all around America must \nbe\n\n[[Page S451]]\n\nshaking their heads as they listen to this debate about whether a \nbusiness that is being subsidized to the tune of $275,000 by the \ntaxpayers should regard that as inadequate, and that we should be told \nwe are pulling the rug out from under a business because they are only \ngetting a $275,000 taxpayer-paid subsidy, that they need a $550,000 \nsubsidy in order to cashflow.\n  Has it really come to this? Is this what American agricultural policy \nis all about, half-million-dollar subsidies and anything less is \nregarded as somehow inadequate? This is amazing. I think it is time for \nus to recognize the current structure of the farm program payments has \nin fact failed rural communities and family-sized farmers and ranchers.\n  The advocates of the amendment, including myself, would suggest that \nanyone who wishes to farm the entire county is free to do so. This is a \nfree country. Farm however much they wish, but there should be some \nreasonable limitation as to how much the taxpayers ought to be expected \nto assist with their cashflow, and $275,000 strikes me as a generous \nlevel of support. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  We are talking about modifications to the 1996 farm bill, which I \nbelieve especially hurts beginning farmers because it increases the \ncost of getting started in farming. As long as huge farms can count on \nlarger and larger Government checks every time they add another farm, \nthey will bid those Government payments into higher cash rents and \nhigher land purchase prices. By reducing the number of middle-sized and \nbeginning farmers, the current payment structure has deprived rural \ncommunities and institutions of the population base they need in order \nto thrive.\n  I believe the single most effective thing Congress can do to \nstrengthen the fabric of rural communities and family farms across the \nNation is to stop subsidizing megafarms that drive their neighbors out \nof business by bidding land away from everybody else.\n  This amendment aims to place some commonsense payment limitations on \nthe various price supports contained in the farm bill proposal.\n  The question of implementation was raised. There are farm program \npayment limits now that need to be implemented. We do not change that. \nWe simply put the limitation levels at a far more reasonable level.\n  The distribution of benefits from farm programs has been a hot topic \nin recent months, as we find that almost half the farm program payments \nare going to families who make over $135,000 per year. We need to \nmodify that. We need to recognize what we are doing is not working.\n  I, too, am concerned that the millions and millions of dollars going \nto individual megafarm operators and absentee landowners will \neventually ruin public support for the farm program.\n  Today, with our amendment, we have an opportunity to close certain \nloopholes that exist in the farm bill that allow enormously large \noperators to receive millions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies.\n  It is our duty, I believe, to tighten the rules on who qualifies for \nfarm programs and to make sure those people who do receive benefits \nare, in fact, actively farming.\n\n  First, it would limit an individual's or entity's total amount of \ndirect payments and countercyclical payments to $75,000 in any fiscal \nyear.\n  The current farm bill permits individuals to receive $80,000. The \nHouse farm bill allows individuals to reap $125,000; and the Senate \nbill, as it is before us, allows a $100,000 payment.\n  Second, our amendment limits an individual's or entity's total amount \nof payments under a marketing assistance loan, or LDPs, to $150,000 per \ncrop per year.\n  Third, our amendment puts some real teeth into the application of the \ntriple entity rule, which virtually doubles the statutory payment \nlimitation for certain entities.\n  Our amendment tracks the new limitations on farm program payments \nthrough sole proprietorships or individuals, entities, partnerships, or \nother arrangements directly to the individuals.\n  With the implementation of a direct attribution of benefits, we \neliminate the application of the triple entity rule to participate in \nmultiple entities for the purpose of gaining more and still more \nsubsidies from the farm program.\n  To address situations where a husband and wife are indeed both active \non the farm, we allow for a $50,000 add-on over the combined total of \nlimits for individuals, resulting in this $275,000 limit. Simply put, \nour amendment cuts by 50 percent the huge subsidies permitted under the \nHouse farm bill proposal, and under the 1996 farm bill the total \npayment limit is $460,000. Under the Senate proposal, it is $500,000; \nand under the House bill, it is $550,000. We come up with $275,000.\n  Savings from the payment limits go to an array of needed areas: to \nhelp beginning farmers, to help with rural development, to help with \nnutrition and commodities programs, and to assist with crop insurance--\nalmost $1.3 billion over the lifetime of this effort.\n  If we want to have a farm program that has credibility with the \nNation at large, and if we want to direct farm benefit programs to the \npeople who most need them, we need to pass this amendment. I believe \nthat is one of the key reforms that is required for a farm program to \nhave the kind of public support it deserves to have in this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to talk \non this issue. Our phones have been ringing off the hook from farmers \nin Alabama. I think in the last day or so, we have had 60 calls. People \nare very concerned about this amendment, and it has become clear it has \na real potential to damage agriculture, particularly in the southern \nregion.\n  The fact is that cotton, one of Alabama's top cash crops--the top \ncash crop--is expensive to grow, $350 an acre. The cost of a new cotton \npicker is $300,000-plus. That is a significant investment. As the years \nhave gone by, cotton farmers have realized they cannot make a living on \n200 acres, and they cannot pay the cost of their equipment and all the \ninvestment in producing cotton on smaller acreage farms.\n  What has happened is they have leased farms from elderly people who \ndo not have the ability any longer to farm, but renting their land \nproduces some income for them in their retirement age. Widows who do \nnot choose to farm the land make a little income from renting. Then \nthere is the whole infrastructure around it.\n  My personal history has been in the farm community. That is where I \ngrew up. The first 12 years of my life, my father had a county store. \nHe had a grist mill in that store and actually ground corn for farmers \nin the neighborhood. He sold them horse collars and nails and \neverything else, including all their groceries, as they did their \nfarming in the community.\n  Later, he bought a farm equipment company, sold International \nHarvester equipment--hay balers, bush cutters, cotton pickers, and all \nthe tractors and line of equipment that go with that, pickup trucks and \nso forth.\n  There are a lot of people involved in agriculture. For us to say we \nare going to limit the size of farms in an odd way by not allowing them \nto receive the same benefit that a smaller farm does is a mistake if we \nthink that is going to somehow create more small farms.\n  What will happen? We are going to lose a lot of the infrastructure \nthat goes with agriculture in our rural areas. It will impact the farm \nequipment dealer. It will impact the grocery store. It will impact the \nhardware store, the feed seller, the seed seller, the fertilizer \nseller, the pesticide dealer, the herbicide dealer--all of that \ninfrastructure will be reduced.\n  I am concerned that through a back-door effort that some have various \nreasons to support--some because they think it does not impact their \nregion and some because they believe it will reduce production in \nAmerica and therefore somehow help in other ways--all of these are \nback-door efforts that ought not to be accomplished in this method.\n  If we want to debate, let's debate. I don't believe this is the way \nto accomplish it. I think this amendment will\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\nhave a tremendous adverse impact, particularly on the farmers who are \ncalling me. I have talked to them personally. I have been traveling the \nState and talking with farmers personally. They are very concerned \nabout this amendment. It could hurt substantially.\n  I join with the remarks of Senator Hutchinson and Senator Lincoln and \nappreciate their eloquent thoughts. I wanted to share that additional \ninsight. I also appreciate the insight of Senator Cochran, who will be \nspeaking on this amendment as well.\n  We are at a point where we can do some real damage to agriculture in \nAlabama and the South. I urge the Senate not to do that. I urge \nSenators to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Republican \nleader of this legislation, Senator Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, this is a modest amendment. I stress \n``modest.'' In the event that Senators still wish to discuss the issue, \nI will have another amendment following this which has a much more \nstriking possibility for reform.\n  Nevertheless, this is important. I am surprised at the vehemence and \ndifficulty in the debate I have heard thus far. I say this after trying \nto determine, at least in my State, what the implication will be from \nthe amendment. I went, as many have, to the Environmental Working Group \nWeb site and reviewed a printout of the last 5 years, 1996 to 2000, and \nwho in Indiana might even be slightly affected by this. The Web site \npoints out there were 98,835 recipients of farm subsidies in Indiana \nduring that period of time. There are 6, out of 98,000, who would be \naffected by this amendment.\n  Our State is not inconsequential in agriculture. As a matter of fact, \nwith the number of farmers we have, it does not rank, as it turns out, \nin the top six States that receive farm subsidies, but we receive quite \na bit. To find there are only 6 entities that could slightly be \naffected by this seems to me to make my point because 98,000-plus \nothers would not be affected.\n  This is not unique to the State of Indiana. Simply using my own home \nbase to make the point again and again that two-thirds of the subsidies \nstill go to 10 percent of farmers, there is still a high concentration \nin my State of where the subsidies go, and that is generally \nreflective, plus or minus in some places 55 percent, up to 75 percent \nin States across the Union, going to the top 10 percent.\n\n  I examined the Web site for the State of Arkansas, having heard the \neloquence of my distinguished colleague from Arkansas. There the \nskewing of the payments is slightly greater: 73 percent of the money \ngoes to just 10 percent of the farms. The database indicates 4,822 \nrecipients average $430,000 each in a 5-year period of time. That took \nup 73 percent of the money. Arkansas, as a matter of fact, received \nslightly more money than Indiana during the 5-year period of time--\nsomething close to $2.8 billion as opposed to $2.7 billion, with only \nhalf as many farmers.\n  Leaving aside that anomaly of the farm bill, I then went to the same \ndatabase to try to find out how many farmers would be affected. In \nIndiana, as I pointed out, only 6 would be above the $275,000 times 5, \nwhich would be the relevant standard for the 5 years that are given \nhere, 1996 to 2002. The printout in Arkansas indicates there are 583 \nfarms that would have been affected in the 1996-2000 period. That is \nquite a few more than six. Therefore, I understand the eloquence of the \ndistinguished Senators from Arkansas who have received calls from each \nof the 583 recipients who have jammed the switchboard.\n  Let me point out that even if one accepts the fact that this is quite \na quantum leap, there are 48,000 farmers in Arkansas. These farmers \nrepresent slightly more than 1 percent of the farmers of that State.\n  Again and again we will have to face the fact we have a system which \nis so skewed toward the extraordinarily wealthy, toward the huge farms. \nI am not one to go into demagoguing because a farm is big, but I think \ntaxpayers have an interest in whether that bigness is rewarded by \nextraordinary millions of dollars of farm subsidies while, at the same \ntime, all of us plead for the family farmer for retention of that \ntradition, this honest person trying to till the soil, when in fact we \nare talking about entities that are sophisticated. Thank goodness that \nis so. I pray each one of our farms will become more so in world \ncompetition. However, it is another thing to move from hopes that we \nbecome more sophisticated and competitive to the thought that we ought \nto subsidize, in a very skewed way, the wealthiest of all farm \nentities. I think that is fundamentally wrong. I hope it is stopped.\n  This amendment is only going to clip it at the top. Six farms in \nIndiana, for example. We are not unique. Taking a look at data in South \nDakota, fewer than two dozen farms would find problems. That State \nreceives about the same amount of money in subsidies as does Indiana, \nand a great many fewer farmers likewise. Even then, in the skewing of \nSouth Dakota, the top 10 percent get 55 percent of the payments, \nsomewhat more leveled off, but well over half at just 10 percent. Again \nand again this is replicated.\n  There are some distinct benefits of this amendment that have not been \nilluminated as we have been discussing the wealthy and how they make it \nin this case. As a matter of fact, the money that would be saved, even \nfrom this small clipping, would increase the initiatives for future \nagriculture and food systems in our agriculture bill from $120 million \nof research a year to $225 million beginning in fiscal year 2003 and \ncontinuing through 2006. In terms of overall agriculture--all the \nfarmers of this country, the competitiveness of our system--clearly \nthat is a better expenditure than putting money on farmers who already \nhave extraordinary success and who are accumulating more as we proceed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nDorgan-Grassley amendment regarding payment limitations.\n  Last year, as many as twenty Fortune 500 companies received farm \nsubsidies, while hard-working family farmers struggled to survive near \nrecord low commodity prices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports \nthe largest 18 percent of farms receive 74 percent of federal farm \nprogram payments, and the Associated Press recently reported that over \n150 people were paid more than one million dollars in farm subsidies in \n2000. In 1999, 47 percent of farm payments went to large commercial \nfarms, which had an average household income of $135,000.\n  I believe that these payments disparities need to be addressed. In \nAugust of last year, President Bush even recognized this problem. \n``There's a lot of medium-sized farmers that need help, and one of the \nthings that we are going to make sure of as we restructure the farm \nprogram next year is that the money goes to the people it is meant to \nhelp,'' he concluded.\n  Recently, I joined my colleagues Senators Grassley and Dorgan as an \noriginal co-sponsor of the pending amendment to cap annual federal farm \npayments at $225,000 per individual and $275,000 per married couple.\n  This amendment would help ensure that only active farmers receive \nfarm payments. Common sense should dictate that you should be required \nto be an active participant in ``farming'' to receive ``farm'' \npayments. This requirement should help ensure that corporations and \nmultimillionaire tycoons no longer feed at the federal trough. If you \ndon't till the soil or drive a combine at harvest, you shouldn't be \ntaking advantage of a program intended for farmers who need the \nassistance.\n  While the current farm bill establishes caps on government payments \nto producers, unfortunately, these payment ``limits'' have been \ncircumvented via a loophole known as general commodity certificates. In \nfact, according to the Congressional Research Service, ``while \npurported to discourage commodity forfeitures, certificates effectively \nserve to circumvent the payment limitation.''\n  Unlimited farm payments jeopardize the long-term viability of the \nU.S. farm economy by diminishing our competitiveness and artificially \ninflating land prices and rental rates. Thus, farm payments often go to \nlandowners and not the farm operators who need them most. In fact, \nthese higher land\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\ncosts add to producers' cost of production and decrease their \ncompetitiveness in world markets. If large commercial farmers know that \nthey can only receive a fixed amount of federal farm payments, they \nwill be less likely to bid up farmland rental rates and be less likely \nto outbid their neighbors or young beginning farmers at farmland \nauctions.\n  Large farm subsidy payments to super-wealthy individuals and \ncompanies has led to close public scrutiny of our farm programs and \nthreatens to undermine public support for these programs. I believe \nthis amendment to the farm bill is a positive step not only toward \nensuring those families who most need federal assistance receive it, \nbut also to reaffirming public confidence that farm programs are vital \nto our nation's agricultural community.\n  We owe it to our nation's farmers to ensure that farm payments are \ngoing to those most in need. We owe it to taxpayers to protect their \ninvestment in our agricultural economy. The amendment proposed today is \na positive step towards ensuring more fairness in our valuable farm \nsubsidy program.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today as a supporter and a \ncosponsor of the amendment introduced by Senators Dorgan and Grassley.\n  The Dorgan/Grassley amendment would limit the amount of direct and \ncounter cyclical payments to $75,000 annually, limit marketing loans \nand loan deficiency payments to $150,000 annually; and provide a \nhusband and wife allowance of $50,000 annually. Also, I might add, \nindividuals who earn more than $2.5 million in adjusted gross income \n(net) would not be eligible for payments.\n  In short, the proposal would reduce the ceiling on annual crop \npayments to individual farmers from $460,000, under current law to \n$275,000. Furthermore, the amendment is expected to save approximately \n$1.2 billion over 10 years.\n  The savings of this amendment would go to important things like: \nfunding for nutrition by raising the standard deduction for food stamp \neligibility; farm profitability with emphasis on small and moderate \nsized farms; risk management for producers of specialty crops that \ncurrently have no coverage; and research for programs that provide \ncompetitive grants for biotech, genomics, food safety, new uses, \nnatural resources.\n  In short, the Dorgan/Grassley amendment would level the playing field \nwith regard to the distribution of farm subsidies, and prevent many of \nthe nation's largest farms from getting a lion-share of the federal \nsubsidies.\n  Thank you, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Dorgan/Grassley \namendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I am pleased to rise this afternoon with \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Grassley in support of this important \namendment to the farm bill regarding payment limitations.\n  Agriculture is the backbone of America's rural economy, and for \nWisconsin it is the backbone of the State's economy. Nearly 18,000 \nsmall- and medium-sized dairy farms make up Wisconsin's rural \nlandscape. Their survival in a volatile market is one of my top \npriorities. I am pleased that the Senate version of the farm bill \nrecognizes the importance of dairy and creates a safety net for \nproducers during periods of depressed prices. One important component \nof this new dairy program is that payments are capped to a producer's \nfirst 8 million pounds of production--that is the average production \nfrom a herd of about 400 cows. While I would have liked to see a lower \ncap--Wisconsin's average herd size is closer to 70 cows--this provision \nwill help to target payments to those who really need the assistance.\n  The same cannot be said of payments made to producers of traditional \nrow crops under the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill. It was supposed to limit \nproducers of row crops to a maximum of $460,000 in government payments \nper year. However, loopholes in the law have allowed large producers to \nreceive much more than that. A comprehensive review of past farm \npayments show that 10 percent of the producers--those with the largest \nfarms--received almost 70 percent of the total assistance. How can we \nsupport millions in government assistance to a very few rich farmers in \na very few States?\n  The House-passed version of the farm bill exacerbates this situation. \nIt raises the payment limitation to $550,000 per year without closing \nthe loopholes--loopholes that allow rural reverse Robin Hoods to \ncontinue sucking government payments away from family farms and onto \nmillion-dollar plantations. The bill that we are debating today in the \nSenate provides for a limit of $500,000 per year, again preserving the \nloopholes that allow a few producers to receive much more. The Dorgan-\nGrassley amendment not only closes the loopholes but also limits total \nbenefits to $275,000 per year per producer.\n  Current law and both the House and Senate version of the farm bill \nalso allow for payments to go to absentee landlords not living on their \nfarms or involved in their day-to-day operation. The Dorgan-Grassley \namendment fixes that injustice by requiring recipients of federal \npayments to provide 1,000 hours per year in work related to the \noperation of that farm. Further, individuals with more than $2.5 \nmillion in adjusted gross income will not be eligible for assistance. I \ncannot believe that anyone would oppose this provision. Who advocates \nmaking farm payments to farmers who don't farm, or even live on a farm? \nWho is in favor of providing income security for individuals' with some \nof the highest incomes in the Nation?\n  With an uncertain economic future, a possible return to deficit \nspending, a war on terrorism and an immediate need to strengthen our \nhomeland defense, we have even more of an obligation to spend our farm \ndollars wisely. Now is the time to make sure farm payments go only to \nfarmers who need the money to farm--not to millionaires who need to \nmake mortgage payments on their city penthouses. The Dorgan-Grassley \namendment restores integrity to our farm programs, reduces pressure on \nland rents and prices, dampens overproduction and raises farm income \nfor our small- and medium-sized family farmers.\n  I am proud to support this amendment in the name of taxpayers and \nstruggling family farmers in Wisconsin and across our nation, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Dorgan and Senator Grassley that would limit farm \nsupport payments.\n  The best way to think about this amendment is to understand its three \ncomponents. The amendment would:\n  (1) Establish a payment limitation ensuring that government support \nwill provide only a true safety net for the needy farmer;\n  (2) Require individuals receiving farm support payments to be \nfarmers; and\n  (3) Exclude millionaires from receiving any farm payment.\n  First, this amendment will reduce already existing payment \nlimitations. A limit on the total annual payments a person can receive \nwas first enacted in the 1970 farm bill and has remained in place \nsince. Under current law, payments are limited to $460,000 per farm. \nThe Senate Farm Bill would slightly increase this payment limitation to \n$500,000.\n  Farm groups object to any further reduction in the payment \nlimitation--as the Dorgan-Grassley amendment proposes--because of the \nhigh input costs that large farms with high value crops have. For \nindividual farmers, the Dorgan-Grassley amendment would limit payments \nto $225,000. For married couples, the limit would be $275,000. I \nbelieve this is a reasonable amount.\n  Right now, about 10 percent of the farms get 60 percent of the \ngovernment payments. Last year, the Federal government paid California \nfarmers $780 million in subsidies, with primarily large cotton and \nrice-producing farms receiving 51 percent of the money. But only 9 \npercent of California's farmers get crop payments.\n  Second, the Dorgan-Grassley amendment requires the person receiving \nthe payment to be a farmer. A tenant must supply at least 50 percent of \nthe labor or 1,000 hours, whichever is less, for a farm in order to \ncollect a payment.\n  This means family members receiving payments have to be actively \nfarming, not living in New York City and listed as a ``farmer'' for the \nsole purpose of doubling the current payment limitation.\n  These farm payments are real dollars paid for by taxpayers. And there \nhave\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\nbeen a flood of newspaper articles recently to shed light on exactly \nwho is receiving them.\n  Third, under this amendment, an owner or producer will not be \neligible for a payment or loan if the owner's income for the previous 3 \ntaxable years exceeds $2.5 million. Nothing in current law prevents \nmillionaires from receiving federal payments. Farm groups object to \nthis because they object to any ``net income'' test.\n  This amendment would save $1,295 billion over 10 years, which will \nalternatively fund the following:\n  $810 million for various nutrition programs, including: $250 million \nto raise the standard deduction for food stamp eligibility to \nhouseholds with children. $515 million to increase the shelter expense \ndeduction. And $34 million to help with participant expenses in \neducation and training programs.\n  $330 million for the Initiative for Future Food and Agriculture \nSystems, which the University of California benefits from. This \ninitiative provides competitive grants for biotechnology, genomics, \nfood safety, natural resources, and farm profitability.\n  $101 million for research and development for a specialty crop \ninsurance initiative. $5 million for Beginning Farmer & Rancher \nOwnership Loan Account Funds. And $46 million for Non-program farm Loan \nDeficiency Payment eligibility and to Restore Beneficial Interest with \nregards to LDPs for the 2001 crop.\n  I will vote for payment limits to restrict millionaires from \nreceiving federal farm payments when they obviously do not need them. I \nbelieve we should ensure farm payments provide a safety net for the \ntruly needy.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise today in support of Senator \nDorgan's amendment to the farm bill, S. 1731. This amendment closes a \nloophole that in the past allowed people who were not farmers to \ncollect subsidy payments. I support farm policy that requires a farmer \nto supply at least 50 percent of the labor or 1000 hours of work, \nwhichever is less, in order to collect a farm subsidy. In addition this \namendment includes a net income test so that farmers who have adjusted \ngross income of over $2.5 million three years in a row are not eligible \nfor federal payments.\n  Senator Dorgan's amendment ensures that farm aid will target the \npeople who need it the most, the small family farmers that actually \nwork the land and are the lifeblood or our rural communities. It is a \npleasure to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator has 13 minutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam Chairman, I have tremendous respect for my \ncolleagues from Iowa, North Dakota, and Indiana. But I must rise in \nstrong opposition to this amendment because it would not only cripple \nthe agricultural community across this Nation, it would wipe out \nagriculture as we know it in the South. Passage of this amendment would \nresult in many traditional family farms going out of business in many \nStates.\n  Do you know what this amendment says to the South? It says: Hold \nstill, little catfish, all I'm going to do is just gut you. Hold still. \nIt says to the South: Step right up. Here's a new and improved farm \nbill. But because you had to expand and because you had to diversify to \nstay in business, you are not going to be eligible.\n  This is trying to change the rules in the eighth inning. A change in \nthe rules this late in the game would create tremendous strains on \nproducers to meet the new compliance standards. The Farm Service Agency \nis already going to be overwhelmed by many of the new programs included \nin this bill. This amendment would result in increased costs, both to \nthe Government and to farmers.\n  Supporters of this amendment say that these payments go to the few \nand the big. I could not disagree more. This amendment punishes the \nfarmer and his family who depend solely on the farm for their \nlivelihood. In my part of the country, a farmer must have a substantial \noperation just to make ends meet. Don't let these big numbers fool you; \nthese farmers each year take risks equal to or greater than those of \ntheir brethren with smaller operations. In fact, I would argue that \nthey are in greater need of support because they are forced to be big \nin order to be competitive.\n\n  Some argue that these payments go to a small number of big farms. \nThose who say that need to look at the USDA statistics manual. It shows \nthat by far the same big farms produce 80 percent of our agricultural \nproducts. We should be supporting those who are fueling this economic \nengine, not hobby farmers who paint a Norman Rockwell picture of rural \nAmerica that has passed us by.\n  We pay a lot of lip service to wanting this country to compete \ninternationally. It is wrong to punish those who pursue economies of \nscale in order to do what we preach in our speeches.\n  I hate to say it, but this amendment is not just about changing farm \npolicy; it is about changing social policy. Unfortunately, there are \nsome organizations that want to intimidate or embarrass family farmers \nby disclosing personal financial information. Then there are some \nenvironmental groups that, I am also sorry to say, release statements \nthat are both overstated and misleading.\n  In the name of common sense, why should anyone want to punish family \nfarmers who have made investments, large investments, in order to \nbecome competitive in an international marketplace? Why are we trying \nto hurt farmers who only wish to provide a decent living for their \nfamilies, even though they are facing soaring costs of production? They \ndo not deserve that kind of treatment. They are already facing the \nlowest commodity prices in decades. Why, why, would anyone want to \nlimit assistance during this time, a time when our farmers really need \nit the most?\n  This is a diverse and distinguished Senate with Members who have all \nkinds of experience. But I doubt there is a single Member of this \nSenate who has ever bought a cotton picker. Do you know what a cotton \npicker costs today? The average price for a new cotton picker off the \nJohn Deere lot in Albany, GA, is about a quarter of a million dollars, \nand if you are an average farmer in south Georgia, you are going to \nneed two of them--and that is just the beginning of the equipment \nneeds. There are tractors and grain carts and trucks--all are needed to \nget a crop out.\n  By the way, do you know where those cotton pickers are made? In a \ngreat State--Iowa. I wonder if those employees of that manufacturing \nplant support this amendment.\n  The cost of producing crops today is several hundred dollars per \nacre. Reduced payment limits and increased benefit targeting fly in the \nface of skyrocketing production costs and record low commodity prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MILLER. I ask unanimous consent to have 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MILLER. I will close by saying this. We have a pretty simple \nquestion here, and it really goes to the heart of this amendment, and \nit goes to the heart of each individual Senator. Are we going to reduce \nGovernment support when farmers need it the most? Today, in this land \nof plenty, our farmers who produce that plenty are looking into a \ndouble-barreled shotgun. I plead with this Senate not to pull the \ntrigger. If you vote for this amendment, you will.\n  In fact, this amendment would give less support to southern farmers \nthan the current farm bill does. It would limit individual rights to \npursue an adequate way of life in many regions of the country, and it \nwould result in widespread failure for thousands of American family \nfarmers. Let's face it, this amendment is a poison pill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Madam President, today in New Hartford, IA, at a local cooperative, \nthe price of our corn would be $1.79.\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\nThe price of our soybeans would be $3.96. So, obviously, with these \nhistorically low prices, we have to have a farm bill, a farm safety \nnet. I want my colleagues to know I take into consideration the plight \nof the family farmer when I support legislation such as this.\n  Since there was the accusation that this might be social engineering, \nI think I ought to start with my explanation of a family farm. It could \nbe a 30-acre truck farm in New Jersey. It could be several thousands of \nacres of ranchland in Wyoming, where it takes 20 acres to feed a cow-\ncalf unit. A family farm, to me, is a farm, not judged by size, not \njudged by income--a family farm is determined by, first, whether or not \nthe family controls the capital; second, the family does most or all \nthe labor--and I would include in that those people getting dirt under \ntheir fingernails most of the time--and, third, that they are going to \nmake all the management decisions.\n  That is as opposed to the nonfamily farm. It could be a corporate \nfarm, but I don't want to denigrate the word ``corporate.'' Anyway, a \ncorporate farm, a nonfamily farm, is where somebody provides the \ncapital, they hire the management, and somebody else does the labor.\n  So we are talking about, in our family, where I don't get to help \nmuch but I try to help, my son does most of the work. He has an 18-\nyear-old son in high school who helps. And once in awhile in the spring \nand in the fall, there is a neighbor, a young neighbor man who works in \ntown, who will come out and maybe work into the night 1 or 2 hours a \nnight, for that person to earn a little more money but also to help \nbring the crop in quickly, because you have to.\n  That is the kind of family farm I talk about when I talk about the \nfamily farm. I don't denigrate anybody else's definition of a family \nfarm. I just want you to know what I am talking about.\n  When I talk about targeting farm programs to medium and small family \nfarmers, I am not talking about something that is new. I am doing it in \nwhat is my understanding of the historical approach of farm programs \nfor 70 years. The first 40 years of that 70 years we didn't have dollar \nlimitations, but we really had lost--when 30 percent of the people were \nfarming, we had a lot of small family farms. There was not any need to \nput a dollar limit on it. But in 1976 we put a $50,000 limit on it. In \n1996, there was a $40,000 limit. Then there were people who figured \nout, How can I get around the $50,000? How can I get around the \n$40,000?\n  You can't write a bill, with the English language the way it is, that \nis perfect, that covers every instance. So we come back now and come \nback in a way that I think is historically targeting the farm program \ntowards the medium and smaller farmers.\n  I don't disagree with everything Senator Lincoln said, because she \nsaid there are some groups out there trying to hit family farmers \npretty hard while they claim to defend the family farm. But I want \nSenator Lincoln to understand where I am coming from and what I define \nas the family farm. I don't want to be doing something by subterfuge as \ndo people who really want to hurt the family farm. I simply believe \nthat $225,000 is enough.\n  But, more importantly, I have to ask the question: If we don't do \nthis, where will it stop? The 1996 farm bill, even with the $450,000 \nlimit, had other ways in which you could get up to $460,000. The \nmanagers' amendment in the bill that is before us sets this at \n$500,000. The House version is even worse. A Republican version, let me \nsay, is even worse--$550,000. That doesn't even include the back-door \nthings that can be used, such as through generic certificates that can \ngo way above these already high limits to bring in the millions and \nmillions that have been talked about here for some units.\n  I think we have to be very concerned in agriculture when we say we \nwant a safety net for farmers. A sound safety net for farmers is good \nfor everything that Senator Hutchinson said about social and economic \nstability. It is all about national security as well. But we are \nspending lots of taxpayer money.\n  We have to maintain urban support for our farm safety net. Maybe you \ncan say if we pass this bill that we might not have to worry about it \nagain for 10 years. But if you go on for 10 years with the bad \npublicity about what farm programs have been receiving because 10 \npercent of the farmers are getting 60 percent of all the benefit, where \nare Senator Lincoln and I going to be, if we are fortunate to be in the \nSenate, when the next farm bill comes up if we lose public support \nbecause of the outrageous payments that are being received?\n  We have to start asking ourselves: When is enough enough? How long \nwill the American public put up with programs that send out billions of \ndollars to the biggest farm entities? All this does is damage our \nability to help people we originally intended to help--the small- and \nmedium-sized producers.\n  Look back at the intent of our first farm bills. We have never \nintended to subsidize every single acre and every single bushel. Our \nintent was to bolster the agricultural economy and keep people on the \nfarm. Lowering limits to these reasonable levels that Senator Dorgan \nand I have done will not chase one small- or medium-sized producer off \nthe farm. But the large entities will have to look to the market for \ntheir additional income above the $275,000, if you include a spouse.\n  If you do not believe me, let us turn this question over to farmers \nand ask them their judgment. You have heard my colleague, Senator \nLincoln, talk about letters of opposition from certain farm commodity \ngroups. But what do farmers actually think?\n  I had an opportunity during the break in January to hold 10 or 11 \ntown meetings in my State just on the agriculture bill. I went through \nthis amendment as intellectually honestly as I could, explaining to my \nconstituents really what I wanted to do. I had 1 farmer out of those 10 \nmeetings who said he disagreed with what I was trying to do. Do you \nknow what happened after that meeting? People evidently didn't want to \nsay it publicly. They came up to me afterwards and said they heard this \nother farmer say that he disagreed and that you shouldn't have these \nlimits. He is an example of the very reason you have to have the limits \nthat are in the Dorgan-Grassley amendment.\n  Probably more to your liking, if I don't talk about just Iowa, or my \n10 town meetings, last year 27 of the Nation's land grant colleges from \nall the Nation's regions came together to poll farmers and ranchers on \ntheir opinions on the farm bill on the issue before us today. On this \namendment, there was enormous consensus.\n  Nationwide, 81 percent of the farmers and ranchers agreed that farm \nincome support payments should be limited to smaller farmers. Even when \nthe results from farmers with less than $100,000 income were excluded, \n61 percent of the Nation's farmers agreed that farm income support \npayments should be targeted to small farmers; that is, support across \nregional lines.\n  I will maintain the rest of my minute and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I speak in opposition to the Dorgan-\nGrassley amendment. I have the greatest respect for my colleagues from \nIowa and North Dakota. I know they have put forward this amendment in \ngood faith. I oppose this amendment because there is a great balance in \nthis bill which was very difficult to put together. It represents all \nof our farming interests from different geographic areas of this \nNation.\n  With this amendment, our farmers in the South--particularly Louisiana \nfarmers who have cotton, and soybeans, but particularly our cotton \nfarmers--would be hard hit by this amendment because cotton is an \nexpensive crop to grow. These price caps will be very detrimental to \nfamily farmers in Louisiana.\n  In addition, this amendment, while it attempts to put on price caps, \nwould not necessarily help farmers in other parts of the country. It \nwould simply hurt the farmers in the South and in Louisiana.\n  Cotton and rice are very expensive crops to grow. We need to have \nthese crops covered when the price turns down.\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\n  Finally, while price supports drift over to the larger farmers, it is \nalso the larger farmers who produce most of the crops under the \nprogram. I realize some of these numbers are very large, but so is the \nunderlying acreage under production, and so are the ownership interests \nof these farms.\n  I support Senator Lincoln and oppose the amendment on the floor.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute 35 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I respect those who disagree with this \namendment. They make compelling arguments from their standpoint.\n  But I would just ask this: If payment limits are not appropriate at \nany point, then will we end up at some point with no family farmers \nfarming in America but only the largest agrifactories from California \nto Maine and still be making payments? For what purpose?\n  My interest in trying to help family farmers survive during tough \ntimes is to say to them: You matter because you live out in the \ncountry. You are living under a yard light, trying to raise a family \nand raise crops, taking all the risks, and we want you to be part of \nour economic future. We want to have broad-based economic ownership on \nAmerican family farms. That promotes food security in our country. It \npromotes the kind of cultural and economic society we want. It is not a \ncase of just picking and choosing because we don't have enough money. \nLet us have the best price support possible, and when we run out of \nmoney, we run out of money. That is the purpose of having a payment \nlimit amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has run out of time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, is the Senator from Oklahoma ready to be \nrecognized?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Arkansas is going to yield time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I would like to add to what the \nSenator said.\n  Obviously, the problem with the bill is that it completely devalues \nthe land for the farmers we represent. The banks are not allowing them \nto borrow money on the land any longer.\n  Out of the 130 loans that were presented to one of our local bankers, \nonly 3 of them have been approved. They are waiting to see what happens \nwith this farm bill, particularly this amendment.\n  Madam President, at this time I yield time to my distinguished \ncolleague and neighbor, the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate is working to \npass a farm bill. We need to complete action on this bill as soon as \npossible to send a signal that we could have a new farm bill \nimplemented for the 2002 crop-year.\n  One of the primary objectives of new farm legislation should be to \nimprove the predictability and effectiveness of the financial safety \nnet available to farmers and to eliminate the need for annual emergency \nassistance. Unfortunately, the payment limitation amendment that we are \ndebating now will have the opposite effect.\n  If this amendment is adopted, it will be a very serious and unfair--\neven punitive--act that will be catastrophic for southern agricultural \ninterests. The costs of production of cotton and rice are much higher \nthan corn or soybeans. According to agricultural economics analysts at \nMississippi State University, the cost of producing 1 acre of cotton is \napproximately $550, while the cost of producing 1 acre of corn is about \n$350, and for soybeans it is only about $100 per acre.\n  On a 1,000-acre cotton farm, the production costs would be $200,000 a \nyear higher than for corn, and $450,000 higher than for soybeans. This \namendment clearly would be unfair to farmers who produce high-cost \ncrops such as cotton and rice.\n  Since 1985, the marketing loan program has been the centerpiece of \nour Nation's farm policy. It provides reliable and predictable income \nsupport for farmers while allowing U.S. commodities to be competitive \nin the global market. If this amendment is adopted, the marketing loan \nprogram will be undermined and essentially will become useless.\n  It is expected by the prognosticators that farm commodity prices will \nremain low and net farm income will be $8 billion less this year than \nlast year. Considering this bleak forecast for our farm economy, it \ndoes not stand to reason that Congress should impose new rules and \nregulations that unduly restrict Government assistance at this time of \nserious economic distress.\n  Many southern farmers work larger tracts of land because the tight \nprofit margins lead to efforts to enhance efficiency through economies \nof scale. And cooperative farming also helps improve efficiency for \nsome.\n  I heard the complaint that as much as 80 percent of the payments go \nto only 20 percent of the farmers. But these farmers are producing 80 \npercent of our Nation's farm output. If limitations on support are made \nmore restrictive, a significant number of farmers will not be able to \nparticipate in the farm program. If this amendment is adopted, I \npredict the pressures for emergency assistance will build and will end \nup being more costly in the future.\n  Madam President, I strongly urge the Senate to reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for his \namendment, and also Senator Dorgan as well.\n  I have great respect for Senator Cochran. When it comes to \nagricultural policy, I look to Senator Cochran for advice. I just \nhappen to disagree with him on this amendment. I am going to vote for \nhis substitute. But I do think a limitation is in order.\n  I was kind of shocked to find out that, in some cases, some farms \nhave been farming the Government quite well, and they make more money \nfrom the Government than they do from the marketplace. There has to be \nsome limit. If not, are we going to allow people to just make millions \noff these programs?\n  To a lot of us, this agricultural policy is kind of arcane, and maybe \nit is hard to understand. If you are not from an agricultural State and \nyou do not wrestle with it a lot, it is kind of difficult to \nunderstand. I have tried to understand a little bit of it, and I do \nunderstand a few things: A few people are doing a lot and getting a lot \nof money from the Federal Government. That does not mean that their net \nis good. They may lose a lot of money. They may get a lot of money from \nthe Federal Government and lose a lot of money. I do not doubt that \nthat happens. It happens a lot.\n  But how much should Uncle Sam be writing in checks to individual \nfarmers and/or their families? Shouldn't there be a limit? I happen to \nthink there should be a limit.\n  I know I have some constituents who are listening right now who are \nvery disappointed in what I am saying because it is going to cost them \na lot of money if this amendment is adopted. They have told me that. I \nrespect them. And some of them are family farmers. But there has to be \nsome limit.\n  I made my career in business. I did not get Government help and did \nnot want Government help. But if we are getting Government help, there \nstill should be some limit on what Uncle Sam is going to do.\n  Looking at some of the charts--just looking at the top 10 farm \nsubsidy recipients--my colleague says, a couple of those are co-ops, \nbut they were averaging almost $10 million a year. And it goes on down \nto different farms. Maybe some of those are individual farms, but they \nare in the millions of dollars a year.\n  Should Uncle Sam be writing checks to different groups, \norganizations, family farms, and so on, in the millions? I have a \ncouple of Oklahomans getting in the millions. I do not think we should \ndo that.\n  Let's look at the present farm bill. The present farm bill has \nbasically a\n\n[[Page S457]]\n\ncap of about $460,000. You have the flexibility contracts of $80,000, \nloan deficiency payments of $150,000. That is $230,000. You can have \ntwo other farm entities and get half of those again, and so that is \nanother $115,000. Adding $115,000 twice to that totals $460,000.\n  But also under the present farm bill some people may say, wait a \nminute, I thought some people were getting millions. You have no limits \non what are called certificate gains, so you can get well above \n$460,000. That is present law. That is the reason we find some \nrecipients doing quite well. I say ``doing quite well,'' meaning \ngetting a lot of money. They may not be doing very well, but they get a \nlot of money from Uncle Sam.\n  Looking at the proposal by Senator Harkin, the underlying bill, they \ncan do better. Present law is $460,000. Now that level goes up from \n$75,000 to $100,000. So now it is $250,000. You still have the two \nother farms that can get 50 percent of that. So the combination of \nthree farming entities can get $500,000.\n\n  Also, under Senator Harkin's bill, there are no limits on the \ncertificate gains, no caps, so they can get more than $500,000.\n  So if you look at the charts from the Environmental Working Group \nthat say some people are making this much, they can get a lot more \nunder the Harkin bill than they could last year, and there is still no \nlimit, no cap. So you have almost unlimited payments. If somebody \nhappens to be farming--and you have market prices below loan prices--\nthey can get hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  Let's look at the Grassley amendment. The Grassley amendment says we \nought to have a limitation. So he has flexibility contracts at $75,000, \nloan deficiency payments of $150,000, for a total of $225,000, and if \nyou made another $50,000, that would be a total of $275,000. But guess \nwhat. The certificate gains are included in that $275,000, whereas \nunder the Harkin bill, and under present law, the certificate gains are \nnot counted.\n  So there is a cap under present law. Under the Harkin bill, there is \nno cap. This is saying $275,000. Well, $275,000 is a lot of money. \nGranted, if somebody is losing $400,000, they may say: I am still \nlosing money.\n  I am sympathetic to that. I just don't think there should be an \nunlimited amount we are going to be writing in checks. Somebody can \nsay: Write us a check for $5 million; I just lost $6 million. Where are \nwe going to stop? I am not a big fan, as some people know, of loan \nguarantees, whether we are talking about steel or airplanes. I have \nsome reservations about the Federal Government making loan guarantees, \nsubsidizing business, and so on.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Iowa makes good sense. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a chart that shows the \npercentage of payments made by income. It shows the upper 1 percent \ngetting 19 percent of the payments, and the upper 10 percent getting 67 \npercent of payments in agriculture.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Concentration of payments for farms in the United States--\n     from 1996 through 2000, the top 10 percent of recipients in \n     the United States were paid 67 percent of all USDA subsidies:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Percent                                  Payment\n                    Percent of recipients                        of      Number of   Total payments,      per\n                                                              payments  recipients      1996-2000      recipient\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTop 1.......................................................       19       24,111    $13,470,787,292   $558,698\nTop 2.......................................................       29       48,221     20,841,600,894    432,210\nTop 3.......................................................       37       72,331     26,561,357,813    367,219\nTop 4.......................................................       44       96,441     31,231,049,012    323,835\nTop 5.......................................................       49      120,552     35,155,503,844    291,621\nTop 6.......................................................       54      144,662     38,515,289,723    266,243\nTop 7.......................................................       58      168,772     41,427,212,217    245,462\nTop 8.......................................................       61      192,883     43,974,881,921    227,987\nTop 9.......................................................       65      216,993     46,228,199,437    213,040\nTop 10......................................................       67      241,103     48,231,602,648    200,045\nTop 11......................................................       70      265,213     50,023,935,434    188,617\nTop 12......................................................       72      289,324     51,637,374,388    178,475\nTop 13......................................................       74      313,434     53,094,589,890    169,396\nTop 14......................................................       76      337,544     54,416,196,177    161,212\nTop 15......................................................       78      361,654     55,619,113,574    153,790\nTop 16......................................................       79      385,765     56,717,246,985    147,025\nTop 17......................................................       81      409,875     57,722,841,911    140,830\nTop 18......................................................       82      433,985     58,646,414,190    135,134\nTop 19......................................................       83      458,096     59,497,316,971    129,879\nTop 20......................................................       84      482,206     60,284,320,451    125,017\nRemaining 80 percent of recipients..........................       16    1,928,821     11,245,676,109      5,830\nAll recipients..............................................      100    2,411,027     71,529,996,560     29,667\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining in opposition. \nThere is 1 minute 36 seconds remaining on the proponents' side.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself the remaining time on \nour side.\n  We have an opportunity to do what has been a part of farm programs \nfor 70 years: try to target the safety net for farmers to medium and \nsmaller family farmers. We have an opportunity to save the taxpayers \nsome money that would go to big corporate farms. We have an opportunity \nto bring money into the Food Stamp Program, and we are adjusting the \nformulas to reflect higher payments for shelter and for utilities and \nfor heating homes so that the Northeast of the United States will be \nable to help some of their low-income people to a greater extent than \nthey have been through the present formula, the Food Stamp Program. \nThat is the use of the money.\n  The most important thing is targeting assistance to the family \nfarmers. The legislation before us disproportionately benefits the \nNation's largest farmers and in most cases nonfamily farmers. In fact, \nthis farm bill unnecessarily increases payment limitations established \nin the present farm program which already allows up to $460,000.\n  We have a chance to do a very good thing from the standpoint of \nbipartisanship that has traditionally been such a part of the farm \nprogram. We have had several bipartisan amendments--for concentration \nand arbitration, and now for the payment limitation. Let's see what we \ncan do to develop a bipartisan farm bill. Voting for this amendment \nwill be one more bipartisan amendment to be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2827 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIndiana is recognized to offer an amendment regarding payment \nmechanism. There will be 2 hours of debate prior to a vote in relation \nthereto.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I alert all Members and staff as they \nprepare to go to lunch, we will have a debate for the next 2 hours and \nvote at approximately 3:05.\n  This amendment is a radical adjustment. I am hopeful Senators will be \nalert to the particulars as well as to the general philosophy of the \namendment. It deals with the commodity title. As I have stated on other \noccasions, the other titles of the bill have had strong bipartisan \nsupport. As a matter of fact, we have improved them in the amendment \nprocess, especially a nutrition amendment that Senator Durbin addressed \nthis morning in his amendment.\n  My criticism of the commodity area of the farm bill is substantial. \nIt comes down to the first point that we are debating this bill at a \ntime in which our Nation is apparently in deficit finance, which means \nessentially we are spending more money as a government than we are \ntaking in. That means each dollar of additional deficit comes from the \nSocial Security trust fund. Most lament that; both parties, through a \nlockbox strategy or through pledges, want that sacrosanct and recognize \nthe public as a whole does not like the idea of the Social Security \ntrust fund being invaded. That dislike is compounded by predictions \nthat it will occur perhaps for many years, not simply for the year we \nare in or, as a matter of fact, the year we just concluded.\n  I make that point not to say we should not proceed with the farm \nbill. We are going to do that. I support that. We are working with the \ndistinguished chairman to try to finalize amendments and get a roadmap \nof how to do that. We are prepared to spend some money. However, we had \nbetter be thoughtful and prudent. I am suggesting that the current \ncommodity title that lies before the Senate, plus or minus whatever \nadjustment amendments are brought to it, is about a $44 billion \nexpenditure over 5 years of time. It is frontloaded into those 5 years \nof time. The Secretary of Agriculture already has expressed objection \non the part of the administration to that.\n  The amendment I will offer today is a $25 billion payment for a 5-\nyear period, as opposed to $44 billion. This is for 5 years. It is a \nvery substantial change. It is a prudent change, in my judgment.\n  Now the second point I want to make is, if the first was not \nimperative enough in terms of deficit finance and money we do not have, \nthe money that would be spent in the Daschle-Harkin bill would go--as \nwe have heard again and again in the debate, approximately two-thirds \nof the money would go to approximately 10 percent of the farmers.\n  It is even more concentrated than that. In fact, the bills we have \nhad in the past, and this bill, essentially deal with the basic row \ncrops of cotton, rice, soybeans, corn, and wheat. That has been the \ncase since the New Deal days in the 1930s and still remains the case in \nthis bill. There are smaller amounts of money, from time to time, to \nvegetable crops--to dairy, to tobacco, to peanuts--but essentially the \nmoney is on the row crops.\n  That means that essentially six States receive half of the money \nbecause these are large States and they have row crops as opposed to \nagriculture of different sorts. So the bill is highly skewed. It is not \noriginal in that respect. That has been true of this legislation for \nmany years. Nevertheless, we compound that problem in this bill.\n  To lay it out so all of us can understand it, 60 percent of farmers, \nmore or less, do not receive any subsidies; 40 percent receive all the \nsubsidies. Of the 40 percent, 10 percent of those receive two-thirds of \nthe subsidies.\n  As I illustrated in debating the last amendment with regard to the \nlimitation of $275,000 for a husband and wife or $225,000 for a single \nfarmer, in my State of Indiana we have a very different result than was \nthe case in the State of Arkansas, the proponents of the legislation. \nBut in either case there are very few people who benefit--who receive, \nactually, more than $275,000 now. Only six farmers in Indiana, \napparently 583 in the last iteration in Arkansas. We have 98,000 \nrecipients of subsidies in Indiana; Arkansas has 48,000. So any way you \nlook at it, 6 or 583, those particular farmers receive extraordinary \nsums of money, which skews the payment situation in a way that strikes \nmost persons who are talking about retaining the family farm and \nsupporting the modest farmer as very strange.\n  If in fact our intent was to save the family farmer, to cashflow \nthose farms that are in trouble, it would appear that we could probably \ndo better than have one-third of the money going to 90 percent of the \nfarmers. As a matter of fact, it becomes even more progressive in the \nother way as you proceed down through the ranks.\n  So I add that thought. Not only are we in deficit finance, but we \nhave a formula that, by its very nature, is going to reward those who \nare very large. Some would say, Why is that a bad idea? Is it not the \nAmerican ideal, as a matter of fact, to succeed, to accumulate more \nland, to have more crops? Indeed, it is. The basic question is not one \nof merit. No one is being prohibited from becoming big and succeeding. \nThe question is whether subsidies that were meant to save family farms \ncontribute to that process.\n  The third point I want to make is there is strong evidence that our \npast farm bills--the immediate one we are working on now, the bill of \n1996, the one of 1991 before that--have offered incentives to produce \nmore. Why is that bad? Because we almost guarantee that, absent a huge \nweather problem or a total breakdown in the world trading system \nbecause of war or pestilence or disaster, we will have more of each of \nthe basic row crops almost every year.\n  There are good incentives, in fact, to produce more, because each \nbushel of production brings its reward in higher subsidies. Therefore, \nSenators come to the floor and lament the fact that prices have never \nbeen so low. Well, of course. The very bills that we are passing almost \nguarantee they will be stomped down every year. It is impossible to \nthink of a scenario in which we are more likely to have this problem.\n  Mr. President, I got so carried away in my arguments, I failed to \ncall up the amendment. So, as a result, I will do that at this point, \nhopefully having whetted the appetite of the Chair.\n  I call up the Lugar amendment and ask the clock start running on \ndebate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2827 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'']\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the dilemma for the small farmer is \ncompounded because, in essence, as overproduction occurs, prices remain \nvery low. That hurts large farmers, too. But, as a matter of fact, many \nlarge farmers are large because they are efficient farmers. They do the \nresearch. They learn about the marketing tools available in futures \ncontracts, forward contracts. They employ the proper conservation \nprocedures and have the capital to do so.\n  As a result, it is not surprising that despite each of our farm \nbills--and the argument has been made every 5 years or 6 years, or \nhowever often we do this, that we are going to save the family farm--\nthat in fact there are fewer family farms each time around. That, some \nwould point out, has been true from 1900 onward--perhaps before that \ntime.\n  One of the strange things about farm statistics presently--and I will \nnot analyze this in depth--is there has been an increase in farms that \nare fairly small. These apparently are farms that are purchased by \nprofessional persons who want some room around their residences. If \nthey produce on those premises at least $1,000 worth of agricultural \nproduce or animals, then they qualify as a farm in the sense of this\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\ndefinition. So this has led to a certain expansion, in some States, in \nwhich this would be counterintuitive.\n  But the heart of the matter is that about 350,000 farmers out of the \n1.9 million who do at least $1,000 or more, those 350,000 do roughly \nfive-sixths of the bill, all of it, in terms of crops or livestock. So \nessentially some have said farm policy is aimed toward them.\n  But at that point, very clearly, Senators rise and say: Hold on. That \nleaves 1.6 million entities out there, and some of these are family \nfarmers. I know them. They are my constituents.\n  I would simply say the degree of concentration, often lamented, \ncontinues fairly rapidly. It does so, in part, because our farm bills, \nwith very generous subsidies, support loans from banks and they have \napparently led to an increase in land values in most States. That I \nwitnessed with regard to estimates and appraisals on my own property in \nIndiana from 1956 onward. I have had responsibility for that farm. It \nis exciting to watch. Thank goodness we did not have to buy and sell \nduring that time; we could simply watch the changes in the balance \nsheet.\n  But clearly it was an exciting experience throughout the 1970s, \nwatching land values, as Purdue estimated them, go up and go up, \nsometimes by double digits in a single year. So as I took a look at my \n604 acres and began to multiply by 2 or 3 those values, that was pretty \nexciting.\n  It was pretty depressing; after Paul Volcker and others put the skids \non interest rates to try to take the Federal Government off in a \ndifferent way, the value of farmland in Indiana plunged by as much as \n50 percent to 70 percent.\n  That kind of jarring situation, many farmers who have lived a long \ntime have become used to. But we are now, much more mildly than in the \n1970s, but progressively, seeing those land values increase. For the \ngeneral public, this seems strange.\n  The general public looks in on farming, and they ask: Why are farmers \ncoming into the Senate pointing out that the prices have never been so \nlow? The prospects have rarely been so dim with people lined up at the \ncountry banker failing to get loans, and all the signs are that even \nfarmers who appear to be fairly prosperous are near bankruptcy.\n  The USDA illustrates this fine point. They point out that as you look \nat the balance sheet for all of American agriculture, the assets have \nbeen rising throughout the last 5 years. As a matter of fact, the net \nworth of farmers has been increasing. How can this be if operating \nresults are so dismal?\n  In fact, operating results have not been that dismal. In the year we \njust finished, 2001, it appears that cash income is $59 billion for all \nof American agriculture. That is plus-$59 billion--not negative. But \nthe real change comes in the asset value of farmland. With the pricing \nof land moving up, it is apparent that on paper the net worth of \nfarmers is increasing substantially.\n  I make that point because many bankers, as you visit with them--as \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer certainly has--would say we are \ncounting on these farm bills to keep those values up. Why do you think \nwe are prepared to loan more money or even any money without some \nassurance that farmland not only retains its value but nevertheless has \na robust quality to it?\n  We then get into a problem in which farmers say: Hang on. Whatever \nmay be the justice or injustice of the farm bill, if you tinker around \nwith that bill very much, you are going to create anxiety with country \nbankers. They may not make loans. At that point, then we have a real \nproblem.\n  It is not my purpose today to try to precipitate a decline in land \nvalues. That would be destructive not only of my own farm but to all my \nneighbors. I just observe, however, that without describing a bubble \nphenomenon--because it is not that; farms are not dot.coms and not \nelectronic situations--there is value there. But we need to be \nthoughtful in terms of our policies as to how much steam we want to \ngenerate into what some would call false values--increases clearly not \njustified by implied income flow coming from those properties.\n  The dilemma, of course, for the young farmer we have talked about--we \nhave a section in our farm bill that tries to address credit for young \nfarmers--is that it is extremely important if we are to have entry of \nour young people. As most have pointed out, the average age of farmers \nseems to increase every year. Demographers indicate it has been true \nfor quite some time. It has been proceeding towards the high 50s. That \nis not a healthy situation. That is not a healthy situation for a \ngrowing, prosperous industry, but it reflects the realities of young \npeople coming through our agricultural schools.\n  The vast majority go into what might be loosely called agribusiness--\nnot production farming. They are dealing with products that come from \nthat, or marketing, or the espousal of farm interests in foreign trade, \nwhat have you. These are valuable skills. But the number of persons \nheading back to head up these family farms to keep the continuity going \nappears to be fairly limited. Some years are better than others.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer has visited the excellent \nagricultural facilities with educational opportunities in Georgia, as I \nhave at Purdue in our State. We encourage young people to farm. Some \ndo. Some years are better than others. But for some years, there \nappears to be very few candidates for that.\n\n  One reason is it is very hard for a young farmer to get credit and to \nestablish a landhold. If you are in a family farm now, that is your \nbest bet. As inheritance tax reforms have occurred, many of us have \npointed out they needed to occur because the family farmer is 15 times \nmore likely to be visited by the inheritance tax than other ordinary \ncitizens. The assets are tied up in the land, in the buildings, the \nvisible assets. But if a family can work that out, there is some \npossibility for the young person. These are fairly small percentages of \nsituations. I think that is a disturbing trend but one that current \nfarm bills, I believe, have accelerated.\n  There is also the fact that as we discussed the last amendment on \nlimits, some pointed out that farmers, in fact, are renting land from \nthose who have estates, or elderly persons, retired farmers, and \nothers. Indeed, a lot of renting does go on.\n  The 120-page USDA booklet indicates that 42 percent of farmers who \nare now involved in production are renting land. Only 58 percent own \nthe land they are farming. That is a fairly large number.\n  Our farm bills have the tendency to raise the rents in the same way \nthat they have raised the land values; in the same way they raise the \npossibility for larger loans for expansion or for accumulation of other \nfarmland. None of these trends are new and none should be shocking. \nMany farmers, as well as Senators, say that is just the way the world \nworks. These are trends that are in place, and we are only going to \ntweak the system a little bit and hopefully not disturb it a lot, \nalthough some Senators have greater ambitions for the farm bill.\n  They believe, in fact, that a very sizable change is going to occur \nif over a 10-year period of time, as the House of Representatives looks \nat it, you put $73.5 billion of additional money into American \nagriculture on top of the baseline of the regular programs we now have. \nSo a lot of our debate in November and December revolved around the \n$73.5 billion, as Budget Chairman Conrad said it is. Ultimately, the \nBush administration said: Well, we are going to acknowledge that it is \nthere now, and in this year, and so forth. But there now appears to \nhave been an argument over the situation. But some of us looking into \nthis--I am one of them--said it wasn't in November, and it isn't there \nnow. We do not have the money, and, therefore, we have to be thoughtful \nabout it.\n  I simply add that everybody--the President and Senators in both \nparties--wants a farm bill. The question we are discussing today is not \nwhether we should have a bill or not.\n  The amendment that I have offered substituting for the total \ncommodity package still, by my own admission, is that it is going to \ncost $25 billion over 5 years--not $44 billion over 5 years but $25 \nbillion. But it is still a sizable sum.\n  The basic difference in my approach is that I take seriously the \nthought that we ought to have equity in the payments. By that, I mean \nthey ought to be available to any farm family wherever that family may \nbe in America and whatever that family produces.\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nThat would be a revolutionary step. That is what I am proposing.\n  I started by saying 60 percent of farmers are outside the game \naltogether. I want to bring them in.\n  They will occasionally come in when we have disaster relief debates--\nperhaps a strawberry crop in a State or a peach crop or a problem of \ncranberries in New England comes to the fore. Senators in that State \nsay we have had a disaster brought about by weather, usually, or some \nother problem. Therefore, we need relief.\n  On an ad hoc basis, the Senate from time to time in the \nappropriations process plugs in some money for what is known as \nspecialty crops or crops other than these five major row crops. From \ntime to time, we have done something for livestock but not very much. \nWe had a debate yesterday about the EQIP program. This has been a way \nof trying to bring some money so that manure could be controlled and \nother environmental circumstances surrounding a livestock operation.\n  The bill that the distinguished occupant of the Chair and I have been \ninvolved in on the Agriculture Committee does a lot more for the EQIP \nprogram. There has been a long line of people waiting to make those \nchanges, so that will be helpful both to production in livestock as \nwell as the environment and the counties that surround it. But at the \nsame time, livestock people, aside from the pork dilemmas of 2 or 3 \nyears ago when prices reached rock bottom, have not gotten the subsidy.\n  Sometimes people have wondered historically, why not? They were back \nin the 1930s when all this began to be passed out. Why haven't we been \nin that tradition? But, nevertheless, some, by diversifying, have corn \nfarms, say, and get the money in that route, by spreading at least the \nrisk, and they have imbibed in the farm subsidies in some fashion. All \nI am saying is, there is no equity, farm by farm, in the farm bill as \nwe have known it. So I want to provide that.\n  I want to say, in essence, three things. One is that my bill would \nsend money to any farm entity that has at least $20,000 of gross \nagricultural income coming from it, not the $1,000 which has been the \ndefinition of the family farmer. That is too low. It picks up what I \nthink are clearly the so-called hobby farms or the almost incidental \nfarming that occurs.\n  Some might say: But $20,000 is not much of an activity. Nevertheless, \nin some parts of the country--and given the history of some farms--that \nappears, to me, and to many economists who have looked at the subject, \na reasonable threshold point.\n  So let's say I am a farmer--male or female--on a farm anywhere in \nAmerica, producing anything I want to produce, and I can sell it for \n$20,000. I would qualify, under my amendment, for a $7,000 payment from \nthe Federal Government each year for 4 years, starting with fiscal year \n2003, and going through 2006, so long as I continue in the business. I \nwould have to do the $20,000 each of the 4 years. This would not be a \nhistorical record but an actual record that I am a farmer and I am \ndoing that kind of business.\n  And the question is raised, what if you have a situation in which \nthere are two factors here--one a landlord and one a tenant or two farm \nfamilies, one owns the land and the other provides the machinery and \nsome of the labor, or what have you. Both of these entities could \nqualify for the $7,000 payment if both are at risk. If the landlord is \nsimply getting the rent, without risk, then the landlord does not get \nthe $7,000. The tenant gets the $7,000. He has the risk. So it is a \nquestion of being at risk and with at least $20,000 of income. Then you \nreceive $7,000.\n  I make the point that this finally, then, gets us to the threshold \nquestion of why we have farm bills and why we have income security. My \nidea is that we provide income security for the vast majority of \nfarmers in this way. It means the very large farmer still gets the \n$7,000. We will not be having a debate about $275,000, however. That \nreally moves off into past history. I am talking about $7,000 for each \nfarm family at this point.\n  That raises the question for skeptics of all programs: Why do you \nsend $7,000 to a person in America because he or she is a farmer? We \nhave settled that, I suppose, by all of us saying, several times, that \nwe understand there are abnormal risks from weather, from foreign \ntrade, from all the vagaries of history. It may or may not be totally \njust to those people who make their money at the retail store on Main \nSquare or to those who venture capital into new businesses and lose it \nor to a whole lot of people who make livings in various ways, but what \nwe are saying is we believe it is important to have a safety net.\n  What I am saying is, it should be just that, a safety net, not an \nincentive to produce more and, thus, depress prices, or an incentive to \naccumulate land using abnormal land values to borrow money, knowing \nthat at some point this cascade is almost bound to lead to difficulty.\n\n  It ought not to be a program that excludes young farmers and one that \nis purely prejudiced against those who rent. And it ought not to be a \nprogram in which six States receive 50 percent of the money. This \nreally does indicate in every State there are agricultural interests, \nbut they are diverse and they are different. Where there are more \nfarmers, the State will get more money. That is true of distributions \nof all sorts.\n  Having sort of recited the outline of where I am headed with this, \nlet me say I believe the amendment I have offered will achieve each of \nthe goals I have in mind: less money paid by the taxpayer, greater \nequity to all farmers, a genuine safety net, a policy that does not \ndistort land values, does not depress prices, and, finally, does not \nlead to real problems with our trading partners, whether it be in the \nWTO or any other trading arrangement.\n  We debated that issue yesterday as to whether the current text of the \nfarm bill, before amendment, leads to bumping up against the $19 \nbillion cap. In my judgment, and that of many others, we risk that. The \nFAPRI group--the research people at Iowa State and Missouri--said there \nis a 30.3-percent chance that will occur in 2002, as a matter of fact. \nThat really does jeopardize American agriculture.\n  We can say we do not care what the rest of the world thinks about all \nthis and, after all, that the Europeans are subsidizing in a big way--\nmaybe some others--but we need every dollar of export income. We cannot \nhave countervailing suits or retaliatory mechanisms that abnormally \naffect certain crops as countries try to find where we are vulnerable \nand arbitrarily knock out one group of farmers while they are trying to \nhit the whole system.\n  Furthermore, we are the leaders in world trade. We are the people who \nreally want to expand this. We have to do that if we are genuinely \nthoughtful about the future of American agriculture. To take some type \nof a myopic view that we simply deal with ourselves leads, finally, to \nthe fact that is all we will be doing, and it is a limited market.\n  So given the extra incentives, prices will inevitably go down and \nstay down because there is no outlet in terms of American agricultural \ngenius.\n  Let me point out that agricultural subsidies have been distributed \naccording to acreage. Some have said that is the way it ought to be: \nYou do more, you get more. I understand that. To some extent, I \nrecognize, as the Presiding Officer does, that this has led to a \nsituation of roughly two-thirds of the payments going to 10 percent of \nthe farms. USDA--more graphically getting down to this 350,000 I talked \nabout--says 47 percent of all the money went to them, almost half to a \nvery isolated group of people. They are very good farmers, but if that \nis the purpose of the farm bill, that is not what the rhetoric we have \nbeen hearing would bring about.\n  The Daschle-Harkin bill spends the bulk of $120 billion on new fixed \nfarm payments, on new countercyclical payments, on higher marketing \nassistance loan rates for program crops. It, likewise, extends, for \ndairy, the milk price support of $9.90 per hundredweight through 2006. \nIt also creates a new national income support program. Overall, the \ndairy provisions are expected to cost $2.3 billion over and above the \nbaseline.\n  A new target price is created for peanut producers, and that is \nexpected to cost $4.2 billion over 10 years, and nearly $700 million \nmore than the House-passed peanut provisions.\n  The CBO projects the Daschle-Harkin bill may cost $120 billion over \n10 years,\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\nbut its actual cost could be 25 percent or even 50 percent larger if \ncommodity prices fail to rise. That is a pretty good bet. I don't see \nhow they rise under these conditions.\n  I am going to have another amendment in due course in the debate that \nwill suggest we take the average payments of the last 3 years of the \nfarm bill. Those have included not only the regular payments, baseline, \nAMTA, and so forth, but the supplemental legislation we passed each \nsummer. These have been pretty heady sums of money all told. I am going \nto offer an amendment that will suggest that the payments, if we adopt \nthe Harkin-Daschle approach, shall not exceed that average of the last \n3 years, just so there are some stoppers with regard to some fiscal \nsanity in this bill.\n  This becomes an entitlement. If you are out there and you produce the \nbushel, you expect to get the loan or the payment and not a lecture \nthat, after all, we only budgeted $120 billion.\n  That is not a part of this amendment, part of the next one, in the \nevent I am not successful with this amendment. But if I am successful \nwith this amendment, we have solved the problem. There is no doubt as \nto what the cost is going to be at that point, nor any incentive to \noverproduce. In fact, it is very likely that prices will rise as people \nmake rational decisions on what to plant.\n  Let me conclude this initial presentation by pointing out, for those \nwho have not followed it from the beginning, that this is a complete \nsubstitute for the commodities title of the bill. That means all the \nprograms involved in the commodities title would no longer be there \nand, in fact, in place is a payment of $7,000 to each farmer in America \nor each entity at risk of $7,000 for a 4-year period of time, providing \nthe safety net I believe we want, with strong bipartisan support for \nthat in a very predictable and equitable manner.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce I have received a \nletter from the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, dated \nFebruary 7, 2002. The letter states:\n\n       Dear Senator Lugar: On behalf of the more than one million \n     members and supporters of the Council for Citizens Against \n     Government Waste, I am writing to inform you of our support \n     for your amendment to S. 1731, the Farm Bill, which would \n     replace current farm program payments with fixed annual \n     equity payments to eligible farmers beginning in 2003.\n       Your amendment provides equitable Federal assistance to all \n     U.S. farmers and ranchers, and it saves taxpayers \n     approximately $20 billion over the next five years. Current \n     farm policy allocates two out of every three farm subsidy \n     dollars to the top 10 percent of subsidy recipients, while \n     completely shutting 60 percent of farmers out of subsidy \n     programs.\n       Your amendment will provide a more equitable farm program, \n     a significant improvement over the present system, which \n     provides the overwhelming percentage of government payments \n     to large farms rather than smaller farms that are most in \n     need of assistance.\n       [The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste] will \n     consider a vote on your amendment in the 2002 Congressional \n     Ratings.\n\n  It is signed by Mr. Thomas Schatz, president.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time \nequally charged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, USDA's Economic Research Service estimates \nthat in calendar year 2000, the latest year for which this data is \navailable, there were, in fact, 764,000 farms in America with an annual \ngross farm income of $20,000 or more. I cite that figure to give some \nidea of the number of farms that, given this threshold, we are \ndiscussing in this amendment.\n  As I mentioned, on some of these farms there are at least two \nentities--maybe more--sharing production risk and having $20,000 at \nstake in terms of gross income. Each of these entities would qualify \nfor a $7,000 payment.\n  This means that those who have been scoring the amendment estimate \nthere could be, under the widest interpretation, as many as 1.3 million \npayments of $7,000 a year.\n  That is the basis upon which we arrive at the $25 million sum for all \nof the commodity section over a 5-year period of time. I make that \npoint simply to undergird, for Senators who are listening to the \nargument, the financial aspects.\n  I think it is of interest as to how this works out in real life. I \ncite once again the Environmental Working Group Web site with regard to \nmy home State of Indiana. For the years 1996 to the year 2000, it \nbreaks down the annual payments, not the 5-year total but the annual \npayments of farmers in my State. I cited earlier that in this \nparticular situation, almost 100,000 farms receiving some payment have \nbeen identified. It is interesting that in Indiana about 75,800 of \nthese farms received no more than $5,000 on an annual basis during this \nperiod of time. So this means, even if one extrapolates up into the \nnext group, $5,000 to $10,000 where there were 9,500 more farmers, \nsplitting that in half, roughly 80 percent of the farmers of Indiana, \n80 percent who were receiving farm payments, received less than $7,000 \nin this period of time. That is why $7,000 per farm entity makes a \nsignificant difference to a large majority of farmers in my State.\n  I think most Senators will find, if they do the arithmetic, $7,000 \nfor a farm entity of $20,000 at risk, $20,000 gross but the farmer at \nrisk, means anywhere from three-quarters upwards of actual farmers in \nthe Senator's State will do better under my amendment than under the \nDaschle/Grassley bill.\n  I hope Senators understand that. I am certain at some point farmers \nwill understand that, and farmers presumably will hold Senators \nresponsible for looking after their interests.\n  So to underline the obvious, again, my statement is that roughly 75 \nto 80 percent of farmers who now would receive $7,000 in each of 4 \nyears if they continue in farming will do better than the payments they \nwould receive under the farm bill that is now before us. Clearly, if we \nare deeply interested in the majority of American farmers, especially \nthose farmers who are most in jeopardy of losing their enterprises, we \nwill be interested in this group. This is the safety net that is \nprovided by my amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally divided against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, might I inquire of the situation. I \nunderstand the pending Lugar amendment is 60 minutes evenly divided. \nCould the Chair inform us about how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 52 minutes, and the \nSenator from Indiana has 70 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I have, as the Senator from Indiana knows, great \nrespect for him. We have had a great working relationship on the \nAgriculture Committee. I daresay, without any fear of contradiction, \nthat perhaps in most, if not almost all, of the present focus that we \nhave on agricultural research and the changes that were made in \nresearch were because of the leadership of Senator Lugar.\n  My friend from Indiana has been unafraid in what I call pushing the \nenvelope in trying to think outside the box on agriculture, and maybe \nin some ways we find ourselves in a box on agriculture. I might be one \nof the first to admit that. We have over 60 years of Federal farm \nprograms that have been designed, in essence, to try and support our \nfarmers, our farm families, during periods of low prices, during \nperiods when their income would fall basically due to no fault of their \nown.\n  A lot of times my urban friends will ask me why do I have all of \nthese farm\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\nprograms. There is not the same thing for a hardware store, or the dry \ncleaning shop, or a number of other main street businesses. I always \nhave to bring them through the process of why we are where we are, and \nthat agriculture is really unlike a Main Street business in that there \nare so many variable factors beyond the farmer's control.\n  We know the classic ones, of course: weather, the droughts, the hail, \nthe rain, the cold, the heat, whatever it might be, those vagaries of \nweather. Now, to a certain extent we have over the years attempted to \nprotect the farmer from those vagaries with different forms of \ninsurance programs, but then sometimes those insurance programs do not \nmeet all the needs.\n  First, it was hail and fire. Now, we have gotten into all-crop, all-\nperil, all-risk insurance. We are doing that now so that has been \nhelpful.\n  So there is weather. Then there are the other vagaries of \nagriculture, and that is basically on the world market in which we now \nfind ourselves. What one country might do, as in Brazil, in Argentina, \nor the countries of Europe, might drastically affect what happens to \nthe farmers in this country. We do not have much control over that.\n  Then there are the other vagaries of disease and pestilence, and so \nforth, that affect our livestock industries in this country. Of course, \nwe continue to do research and to support APHIS, the Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service, and others, to help us in our continual \nbattle against the infestation of either disease or pests in our crops \nand livestock. Put all of these things together and that individual \nfarmer has literally no control over the marketplace, none whatsoever.\n  It has often been said the farmer is the only person who buys retail \nand sells wholesale and pays the freight both ways. That basically is \ntrue. So we build up this elaborate network of farm support \nprograms, to me, different vagaries of farming as we go through the \nyears; different now than it was 30, 40, or 50 years ago.\n\n  Our programs change, but they have the essential underpinning of \nensuring that, No. 1, we will have an adequate supply of food and fiber \nfor the citizens of this country, that we will have that food and fiber \nin a way that will ensure no one really goes hungry in this country. On \nthat side of the ledger we have built up quite a system, also, of \nnutrition programs. The most famous is school lunch. But there are a \nlot of others. So we made it possible for this country to be the best \nfed and to have the largest variety and the most quantity at the \ncheapest prices of all sorts of food, especially wholesome food. There \nis some food that is not too wholesome, but at least in the wholesome \nfoods that is true.\n  That is a reason we have dairy programs. We found through the history \nof the dairy programs, when we had the spring flush, prices would go to \nnothing. A lot of farmers found that they could not make it. But in the \nmiddle of the winter, the price of milk would skyrocket and kids would \nbe left without milk. We wanted to even this out. We came up with dairy \nprograms to even that out. They have worked quite well overall.\n  It is true we have an elaborate system of support programs. If we \nwere starting over and we had a clean slate, we might start a system of \nequity such as the Senator is talking about. We are not starting with \nthat clean slate. We have to take into account what has happened with \nland prices, what has happened in the local communities, what this \nwould mean if we were to yank the rug out all of a sudden from under \nthese programs.\n  If our experience under the last farm bill, under the Freedom to Farm \nbill, had been different and we had some reason to believe that farm \nprograms would be phased down and eliminated, maybe this would have \nbeen the right approach. We saw that was not going to happen under \nFreedom to Farm. So all of these programs have been woven into the \nfabric not only of our farms but of our rural communities, our schools, \nour businesses, our colleges, our transportation.\n  Earlier we mentioned the value of land. Some may argue, rightfully \nso, we have a land bubble out there; we have prices of land, and the \nvalue of the commodity for that land cannot support that price. This is \nnot speculative land, land near a city waiting to be developed. To a \ncertain extent, some of the payments we have put out there in the past, \nin the last farm bill and the one before that and the one before that, \ngoing back for quite a ways, have had a more perverse effect than what \nwe intended. It has, in fact, increased the price of land beyond what \nthe productive capacity of that land could support. This has not \ncreated a good situation.\n  We just had a vote on payment limitations, which I support. What has \nhappened--I see it in my own State the way the farm program is \nstructured--the bigger you are, the more you get; the smaller you are, \nthe less you get. The payments go to the larger farmers. They then go \nout and bid up the value of the land above what the smaller farmers can \nget, or a beginning farm can do, and you get bigger and bigger farms.\n  Since I was a kid, I have been watching farms get larger in my \nbackyard. I come from a town of 150 people. I still live there. All the \nfarms around my hometown are getting bigger all the time. Some of that \nwas inevitable, due to mechanization, better equipment, better seed, \nbetter fertilizer, better control over pests. So the production kept \ngoing. That kept the price of our food very cheap in this country. It \nwas inevitable that farmers would not stay with 40 acres and a mule; \nfarms would get bigger.\n\n  Over the last few years--I don't know if I could use a cutoff date, \nmaybe 15 or 20 years--our farm programs have accelerated the process \nand have added to it and have made it worse, exacerbated it. We do have \na land bubble. One might say we should not have a land bubble; land \nought to be worth what it can produce or whatever it can bring on the \nmarket for speculative purposes but not based upon Government payments. \nI can accept that argument.\n  What I cannot accept is pulling the rug out right now. We cannot do \nthat. This has been built up over 60 years of time, and accelerated \nover the last perhaps dozen years, 15 or so years, maybe more. We have \nto be very careful how we approach modifying and changing what we do in \nagriculture and how we support our farmers. To make this drastic change \nright now would cause a collapse of land prices which would devastate a \nlot of farmers.\n  In rural America, it is often said most farmers live poor and die \nrich. That has basically been true throughout my life. That is their \nretirement. The farm they have is their retirement. If we pull that out \nfrom underneath them, it will be like all the people with their \npensions in Enron. Pull the rug out from underneath our farmers, let \nthose land prices collapse, and we have treated them like Ken Lay \ntreated the people at Enron. We do not want to do that. That would \ndevastate our public schools that rely on the property tax in rural \nareas and our small towns.\n  What to do, then, if that is the situation? Do we take a drastic \nturn, as my friend from Indiana wants to do? I hope not. That would be \ndevastating. In other words, what we ought to do is try to work within \nthe structure that we have and start to move this engine a little bit, \njust to move it a little bit, and start to change the way we do support \nagriculture. The bill before the Senate is a balanced bill in that \nregard. Yes, we do spend more money on commodity programs. We do \nbecause farmers need it.\n  The Department of Agriculture estimated a couple weeks ago there will \nbe a 20-percent drop in net farm income this year unless we come in \nwith some kind of a payment. I ask anyone listening or watching to \nthink of your own situation. What would you do for your family if this \nyear you had a 20-percent drop in your net income? What would you do \nwith your lives? What would happen to your kids? What would happen to \nyour car? What would happen? Think of the farmers with a net income \ndrop of 20 percent this year. I wish it were not so, but that is the \nfact.\n  So we have more money on the commodity programs this year. However--\nand this is a big but--this bill, developed with a lot of bipartisan \ninput, through the committee process, amended on the floor as it has \nbeen amended and probably will be in the next couple of days, this bill \nputs more money in commodity programs, but we spend more on a broader \nagricultural constituency. We provide new--and more--conservation \nspending. That is\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\nincome to farmers in a way that has never been done before.\n\n  Before, we would say to the farmer: If you take your land out of \nproduction, we will pay you for it. That has sort of reached its \nlimits. So now we say to the farmer: You be a good steward of the soil, \nyou keep your soil from running off; you, livestock producer, make sure \nyou don't have the manure runoff that is killing fish in the streams \nand fouling underground water; you, row cropper, cropping the hills, \nput in some buffer strips along the streams, put in some grass \nwaterways; you on the plains, cut down on the wind, put in some \nwindbreaks, do things like that, rather than plowing up the land; do \nridge tilling, hold the soil down--we will pay you for it.\n  That is a conservation security program to begin paying farmers to be \ngood stewards.\n  Many farmers are already doing that and this bill would not cut them \nout. This would not say they would have to do anything different. They \nwould just have to continue what they are doing and they will get paid \nfor it.\n  That is a change. There are some in this Chamber--there were some in \nour committee--there are some who do not want to do that. The Cochran-\nRoberts bill that was offered as a substitute took that conservation \nout and threw it out the window. Fortunately, it only received 40 \nvotes. But I think there is great support for that movement of \nbeginning to pay all kinds of farmers, whether they grow row crops or \nlivestock, orchards, vegetables, fruits--whatever it might be--to \nsupport their income in a way that provides a payoff and a better \nenvironment. So that is in this bill.\n  We also have, for the first time, an energy title in this farm bill. \nIf September 11 taught us anything, it ought to have taught us that we \nhave to cut the oil pipeline to the Mideast. Again, do we want to cut \nit this year? No, we can't do that this year or next year because our \nenergy system in this country is too dependent on it. But we ought to \nbegin planning and doing things now that will get us off that oil \npipeline.\n  I daresay drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \nnot one way to do that. That will still keep us hooked up to the oil \npipeline. What we have to do is begin to look at our farms and our \nfields as the substitutes.\n  Anything that can be produced from a barrel of oil can be produced \nfrom a bushel of soybeans or cottonseed or corn and other products.\n  I visited a relatively small farm in northeast Iowa last weekend. The \nfarm family there had agreed with the University of Northern Iowa that \nthey would participate in a project to make axle grease out of soybean \noil. If you look at it, it looks just like grease. Already they are \nworking with large trucking companies to buy this grease for their \nfifth wheel, and working with I think the Norfolk Southern and other \nrailroads to grease the railroad tracks with it. Why? Because it is \ntotally biodegradable. Hydraulic fluids can all be made from soybean \noil. In Cedar Rapids right now we have over 30 buses running on soy \ndiesel.\n  I think we have broken through a little bit on soy diesel, I say to \nmy friend from North Carolina, because last week--I didn't see this, \nbut I heard about it--on ``West Wing'' the television show ``West \nWing'' that has to do with the President, I guess the President in \n``West Wing'' was taking a trip to Cedar Rapids, IA. He said to his \nstaff: Are we going to get picked up by one of those diesels running on \nsoybeans?\n\n  So we are making a breakthrough. People are now beginning to pay \nattention that buses can run on soybeans. It is all biodegradable.\n  We have an energy title in this bill to try to start moving in that \ndirection, $550 million, half a billion dollars in 5 years--I hope we \ncan keep it--again, to begin to develop that, whether it is diesel or \nhydraulic fluids, grease, or ethanol. We haven't even scratched the \nsurface on ethanol use in this country. We can do a lot more with \nethanol, and the feed co-products can be used in feedlots.\n  Biomass energy--we have a project in Iowa right now that we started a \nfew years ago. I was able to get a modest change in the law to allow \nbiomass production on conservation reserve program land, we set aside \n4,000 acres in southern Iowa to grow switch grass. That switch grass is \ncut and then it is taken over to the Ottumwa, IA, coal-fired powerplant \nand put right in there with the coal to burn at the powerplant.\n  See, a pound of switch grass has more Btus than a pound of coal. The \nproblem is, a pound of switch grass is this big, and a pound of coal is \nthat big. But they burned it last year in the boiler. It worked just \nfine. So now John Deere is working on developing new kinds of equipment \nthat will cut the switch grass and put it in little bundles so it will \nmake it easier to transport and put in the furnaces. Biomass energy, \nrenewable every year. It will cleanup the environment and give farmers \nsome additional source of income.\n  Wind energy--the largest wind farm in the world is located in Iowa. \nInterestingly enough, it was built by Enron. But it is there. So there \nare provisions in our bill--we have an energy title in our bill to \nbegin to promote that and give a new market for farm products.\n  That is what we have to do. We have to find new markets for what \nthese farmers grow. One of the biggest markets out there--a huge market \nthat can absorb a lot of our commodities--is the energy market. So why \nshould we be paying all this money to Saudi Arabia and the Mideast or \ngo up and drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, when we have it \nright here on our lands. So that is another part of the bill that \nbegins to move us in some different directions.\n  We have a strong rural development program in this bill to provide \nfor broadband access to our small towns and communities. Those are \nthings that will help bring jobs to smaller towns in rural America.\n  All in all, what I am trying to say is in this bill we tried to \nbalance a lot of things. I say to my friend from Indiana, if I were a \ndictator, would I have written a different bill? I probably would. He \nwould have, too. But we have a lot of interests here that we have to \ntry to balance.\n  All in all, I believe the bill is a balanced bill and it will support \nfarm income with countercyclical payments. That is another new \nprovision in this bill, a countercyclical program. When prices go down, \nwe support farm income. We don't let farm income go below a certain \nlevel. Then we have direct payments also, which we hope will phase out, \nphase down, and bring in the countercyclical. That was the problem with \nFreedom to Farm. They were phasing down the direct payments, but they \nnever replaced them with anything, so every year we would come in and \nappropriate new money. In our bill, if prices fall, the countercyclical \npayments would kick in.\n  So I will oppose the amendment of my friend only because of that \nreason. I think to make that big of a change right now could really \ndisrupt a lot of rural America. I say to my friend, I think sometimes--\nwhat is that old saying?--when you are up to your eyeballs in \nalligators, it is hard to remember who forgot to drain the swamp. You \njust want to get out of there.\n  Maybe it is a little hard to think about how did we get in this mess. \nWe are faced with a situation where we have to save our farms and rural \nAmerica, and that is what we are attempting to do in this bill. I hope, \nworking together this year, next year, and in the ensuing years, we can \nbegin to examine some other changes that we might make in the structure \nof agricultural programs, with the goal being, I hope, continuing to \nprovide abundant food and fiber to our people at a reasonable price but \nalso with the goal of enlivening and rebuilding rural America. In every \npoll I have ever seen, when people are asked if they would rather live \nin a large city or a smaller community, all other things being equal, \noverwhelmingly people would rather live in the smaller community. But \nif you do not have good schools, decent jobs, decent recreation, and \ndecent transportation, then things aren't equal. So people tend to \ngravitate towards larger communities.\n\n  I hope our view for the future is of enlivening and rebuilding rural \nAmerica, and enabling younger people to go into farming. We have some \nof the finest agricultural schools in America--including those in \nIndiana and Iowa. When you go to those agricultural schools, you see \nyoung people who are smart. They know how to do things. A lot of them \nhave experience working on\n\n[[Page S464]]\n\nthe farms--maybe their family farms, or lives in a rural area. They are \ntaking animal or plant science courses, or farm management courses. Ask \nany one of them if they are going to go into farming, and if they are \ngoing to be a farmer--only a very few, if they have parents with a farm \nfree and clear that they hope to inherit--will they say yes. But if \ntheir parents have a little bit of land and they are renting more land, \nthey are not going to be farmers. They are going to go into some kind \nof management, or some kind of agribusiness management. But they are \nnot going to be a farmer.\n  Ask them if they want to be a farmer. Would you like to be a farmer? \nWould you like to have land out there and do the things your parents \nand grandparents did? Almost 100 percent say yes. But the decks are \nstacked against them.\n  I hope that is what we can look at as to how to revise and rebuild \nsome of these farm programs in the future.\n  I listened to the distinguished Senator from Indiana, my good friend. \nHe went through his long dissertation on his amendment. I thought it \nwas very thoughtful. As I say, there are a lot of things on which I \nagree with him. But I just do not think this is the time to do that. I \nthink we ought to be thinking about how to change some of these things. \nBut, as usual, my friend from Indiana is very thoughtful and provokes \nour thinking. In that way, I think this adds to this debate. But I hope \nthat all in all we will not approve of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his \ngenerous comments about my work and about my amendment, even though he \nhas risen in opposition.\n  Let me try to offer a word of assurance to the Senator as to the \nimplications because it is certainly not my purpose to try to bring \nland values down or banking crises.\n  I make this point once again citing from the Environmental Working \nGroup Web site because it has very detailed figures on how much money \npeople get now.\n  For example, in my home State of Indiana, during the 1996-2000 \nperiod, 76,000 farmers out of the 100,000 who received money received \nless than $5,000. By definition, under this program, if they have \n$20,000 of income--that is the threshold--they are going to get $7,000. \nAs you reach into the next bracket of $1,000 to $10,000, if you take \nhalf of those, we are up to 82 percent who are going to do better and \n18 percent will not do so well.\n  The fact is, if there are to be changes profoundly useful to four-\nfifths of my farmers, the other one-fifth might say they can't count on \nthis subsidy. Indiana is not as skewed as many States are with abnormal \npayments, as I cited in the last debate. Only six farmers in Indiana \nwould be affected by the $275,000 limit--not more than that. But out of \n100,000, we affected six farmers.\n  We are talking, it seems to me, in ranges that are not as cataclysmic \nas they may seem, but they do benefit three-quarters to four-fifths of \nthe farmers of my State. The farmers I hear the most from are the other \nfifth. That may be true of the distinguished Senator from Iowa. \nUnderstandably, they are more aggressive, more articulate, and they \nhave greater resources. If fact, their influence with the major farm \ngroups seems to be substantially greater than the other three-quarters \nor four-fifths of my farmers.\n  But, nonetheless, for Senators who are trying to decide what kind of \njarring change this makes, I think it makes a sizable change for a \nlarge majority of farmers. Others would have to accommodate to the fact \nthat they are already more successful, and the safety net was not meant \nfor them specifically.\n  Let me also mention that although I admit to the fact that all the \nmoney we are talking about is in deficit finance, I still indicated \nthat I am prepared to advocate spending money. I would say that the \nfarm bill--I may have left some confusion, and I want to clarify this--\nI am in favor of. That would include all the titles the chairman talked \nabout, plus the commodity title comes out to $25 billion in my \namendment for 5 years at a time. The commodity portion of that turns \nout to be a net increase of only $7 billion. That is true because we \nare phasing out a whole raft of programs but not adopting many programs \nthat are in the Daschle-Harkin bill escalating the current baseline.\n  It is a fair question to always ask. Even if on paper the economics \nand the equities are right, what sort of jarring effect does this have \non society? Probably there are people who want to walk around this a \nbit. Of course, that is the purpose of their debate: to define what we \nhave to try to find. At least something is likely to be better not only \nfor farmers--I think this amendment is better for three-quarters of the \nfarmers--but also for taxpayers and for the general fiscal condition of \nthe country. We are in a war and recession.\n  I would simply ameliorate the associations made that this is likely \nto cause very jarring changes. I think there will be changes, but I \nthink they are constructive. Essentially, we move the money in a safety \nnet to a large majority of farmers, those whom I think are probably \nmost in need and are most likely to go out of farming, as a matter of \nfact, without some type of subsidy.\n\n  The distinguished chairman and I have generally agreed--and we had \nwitnesses before the committee--that there is some equity at least in \npaying these moneys only if somebody is actually farming. That is one \nprovision. In order to receive the $7,000, you have to produce $20,000 \nof gross income from the farming operation. You can't drop out for 2 or \n3 years and on the basis of past history continue to collect the money.\n  I am not going to argue about the philosophy of the AMTA payments and \nthe idea that those would be phased out from one type of farm \nphilosophy to another. It may not have worked out that way. But that \nwas the general idea. I am not talking about a phaseout, but the idea \nthat you really need to farm and be a productive farmer at risk in a \nfarm entity to collect the money.\n  I think that makes more sense to the American people as opposed to \nthe many stories of moneys going to persons who have been out of the \nfarming business for some time but had a history that fits these last \nfarmers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend, I \nunderstand what he is saying. Only a fifth of the farms in Indiana \nwould be affected by this. It is probably about the same, I suppose, in \nIowa. I do not know. But I still see that, again, these tend to be the \nbigger farms that have a lot of land. I still submit this could cause \nsome derogation in the land values, and even though those at the bottom \nare getting a little bit more, their land prices might be affected by \nthe bigger ones. So if those land prices go down, I think it might have \na cascading effect on this.\n\n  I say to my friend--I think we discussed this in the past--some land \nprices may be inflated by farm programs, but if the support has to be \nbrought down, I think it has to be brought down over maybe a several \nyear period of time, or something such as that. That is why I was \nhoping to get away from some kind of direct payment system to a \ncountercyclical payment that is only based on prices at the time and to \nput more into conservation, put more into energy, and put more into \nprograms that require producers to act.\n  If there is something you have to do, then you can get paid for it, \nbut it does not build into the land value. Because if you sell it to \nsomebody else, and they do not do it, they do not get the payment. We \nhave to try to get off the programs that continue to provide for an \nartificial land bubble out there--it is there; we have to recognize \nit--but I would be very careful about how we try to bring it down to \nsome level in regard to what the productive capacity of that land is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate this colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator because I think we are probably dealing with \nvalues and issues which are very important even in the midst of an \nempty Chamber. I am hopeful other colleagues are listening in from time \nto time to this dialog.\n  The dilemma we face, it seems to me, is not that the land values are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\ncome down, but rather that farmers will now have to plant for actual \nmarkets as opposed to planting for the Government. I think the prices, \nin fact, have some chance, under my idea, of going up again, in large \npart because I believe the policies we might adopt in the Daschle-\nHarkin bill are likely to depress prices. The hope is that will not be \nso and maybe world conditions or weather conditions, or something, \nmight change. But it seems to me there is a history of stimulating \noverproduction and lower prices. That affects big farmers as well as \nsmall farmers.\n  As I take a look at my own operation, we are somewhere in between. I \nsort of fit into the group that, according to the Environmental Working \nGroup, would get about $9,000 a year under the current situation. I \nthink the Web site lists the Lugar farm as 22nd in the batting order in \nMarion County, but that is in the Indianapolis area where there are \njust 240-some farms involved. But it is roughly $9,000 a year over a 5-\nyear period of time we are talking about. It is a 604-acre farm, \nprobably in the top sixth barely of the size of farms in the State.\n  This is sort of the cutting edge when I am talking about the \nbeneficiaries being maybe 80 percent. We are a little above that, and \nso, as a result, we are likely to lose a little money.\n  My own view is that I am likely to make money because I think that \nprobably the price of corn is more likely to go up, likewise the price \nof soybeans; therefore, in regular markets, as opposed to markets that \nare subsidized or have artificial stimulants in them, I am going to \nmake more money. I think that will sustain my land value without a \nbubble and will make that price a healthier one. Of course, there are \nother factors in land values: proximity to cities, whether highways go \nthrough them, as the chairman knows--all sorts of reasons why that \nhappens. But, nevertheless, our two States--Iowa and Indiana--have many \ncharacteristics. During my more intense experiences in Iowa in 1995 and \n1996, I discovered that going county by county.\n\n  I am sympathetic to the thought that change which is really \nridiculous ought not to be entertained. It seems to me we are at a \npoint where the idea that I have brought forward benefits a very large \nmajority of farmers, and I think without harm to those who are more \nefficient because my guess is they will benefit the most from higher \nprices. They, by and large, have lower costs through research and \nthrough the methods they have adopted. This is likely to lead to more \nof a golden age for agriculture than what might be sort of a descending \nsituation that many of us have been describing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If my friend would yield for a little colloquy, I just \nask my colleague again if he will elaborate a little longer on why the \nprices would tend to go up under the scenario he just described. I \nwould think they would go down. But why does the Senator think the \nprices will go up?\n  Mr. LUGAR. My theory is that less will be planted; fewer acres of \ncorn will be planted and fewer acres of soybeans will be planted.\n  I believe the current system, plus the additions that your bill would \nprovide, offer incentives to plant more acres. I believe, given new, \nmodern methods, and the research that we are both for, that is going to \nlead to higher yields--besides more acres--more bushels, and lower \nprices. That could change if we had a worldwide boom and our exporting \nthing works or El Nino knocked out half of one country's production. So \nthese things happen from time to time.\n  My guess is, to answer the Senator truthfully, many farmers, despite \nthe Freedom to Farm, still have incentives to do basic row crops. That \nis where the money is.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Indiana, I believe what he is \nsaying is that farmers will get market signals. In other words, they \nare out there, and if the price goes down, they will plant less. So \nthen you have a drop in prices, and farmers will plant less, and then \nthe price will go back up. I assume that is what the Senator is saying.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. For example, on my farm, we know that a bushel of \nsoybeans is going to get about $5.43 no matter what the market price \nis. People lament that beans have been down close to $4 a bushel. \nIndeed, they are, but not for our farm, or for anybody else who really \nis involved in the farm program involving soybeans. So I want to \nmaximize production irrelevant to whatever the market signals are \nbecause I know for every bushel of those beans I am going to get the \n$5.43.\n  This is the way the world works. This is one reason why soybean \nproduction has been booming while prices have been falling. It need not \nalways be the case. If there were no such loan, if I were not \nguaranteed the $5.43, then I really would have to be thoughtful about \nhow many acres of soybeans I would plant. I would really have to begin \nto calculate how the world works in terms of markets as opposed to \nGovernment programs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask my friend: OK, if you are not going to plant that, \nwhat would the Senator plant? You have land. You have fixed costs.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. I would have to find an alternative crop that looked \nbetter for me. For the moment, my guess is that I would probably go to \nmore corn, just as a practical matter. Corn is not so heavily \nsubsidized. The $1.89 I am guaranteed is not as attractive as the $5.40 \nfor the other situation. On the other hand, other farmers have \ncalculated that, too. So they have planted less corn, not added more \nbeans. They all might shift back, so it makes agriculture interesting.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is the concern I have.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In a system such as that, my concern is the boom-and-bust \ncycle: Prices go all to heck for soybeans. So farmers say: OK, we are \nnot going to plant soybeans. We are going to go to corn. So the price \nof soybeans booms up and then the price of corn goes down, and then \nthey jump out of that and, say, get back into beans again. So you get \nthese huge fluctuations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So we are trying to keep at least some stability in there \nso you do not have those wild swings in prices.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will make another radical suggestion. This is purely \nanecdotal from our farm experience. But I planted, over the last 18 \nyears, 60 acres of black walnut trees. This is on acreage that I found \nwas submarginal. We used to plant more, but it appears that sort of is \na grandfather's dream. I will not be there.\n  But you have, at least it seems to me--by all the calculations by the \nforesters who measure the growth year by year--more of a return from \nthe walnut trees than I am getting from the corn. That is a very long-\nrange vision.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sometime down the road.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. You asked for alternatives. Clearly, there are a good \nnumber of people who are family farmers who intend or at least hope \nthat their farms will be family farms for a long time. They are doing \nalternative planning.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree, to the extent there are alternatives people can \nuse. Obviously, though, as the Senator has said, the return you get off \nthat is sometime down the road, not right now.\n  And I think, just again, being a little bit parochial about it, in \nour area of the country, in the upper Midwest, there is a reason why we \nplant corn and beans.\n  It is very suitable for that. There is some wheat, a little bit, some \nsmaller grains, maybe up in Minnesota, the northern part up there, but \nin our area we are corn and beans. We plant those crops because that is \nwhat the land is productive for in that area of the country. It is very \nhard. We don't grow rice. Wheat is OK. We can get wheat, but that will \njust depress the price of wheat. We could grow wheat. But there is just \nnot much else.\n  When I was a kid--I am sure for the Senator as well--we had orchards. \nWe had a lot of orchards, vegetable gardens, a short growing season. It \nwas OK for the family, but to really make a living out of it wasn't too \nviable. So we are sort of stuck on corn, beans, maybe alfalfa, some \nhay, things like that, some sorghum--basically corn and beans. And then \nyou have all your land tied up. You have your land and then your \nmachinery, your equipment. You have all that fixed cost already there. \nI have a big combine. I put a lot of money in it, and it doesn't do \nmuch to plant black walnut trees. I can't get much money out of that to \ndo that.\n\n[[Page S466]]\n\n  I ask the Senator to think about something that was said to me at one \ntime. I don't know if it is true, but it made sense to me \neconomically--why agricultural economics is a little bit different.\n  The farmer is sitting out there--think about your own land--the \nfarmer is sitting out there, fixed land, has his equipment. Let's just \ntake the farmer who doesn't have all the land paid for, may own some, \nand rent some. That is usually the case. He has equipment, some paid \nfor, probably some he is still paying for. If the price of the \ncommodity he is growing--let's say in this case corn or beans--goes \ndown, the normal thought process is, other people would say, if the \nprice goes down, the farmer would be a darn fool to plant any more of \nthat.\n  But the farmer goes out and plants more corn. Is he a darn fool? My \nresponse is, no. Because what he is thinking is: OK, I have my land out \nthere. I have my equipment. I have all those fixed costs. The marginal \ncost of planting an additional acre always approaches zero. He doesn't \nknow that, but that is what it is. So if I plant 100 acres, my cost may \nbe whatever. If I add an additional 10 acres, the cost to plant that \nadditional 10 acres is not as much as the first 100. If I plant an \nadditional acre on the side of that, its cost is even less because I \nalready have my equipment and all that stuff. The time involved is not \nthat much.\n  The farmer says: I have all that equipment. So if the price is down, \nI have to produce more. So if I was getting $2.50 for my corn, and now \nI am getting $1.80, I will just grow more corn.\n  So it really is a perverse economic kind of thing, sort of counter \nintuitive--I ask my friend from Indiana if that might not be the case--\nbecause farmers don't have control over everything. If I controlled \neverything, like General Motors, I could say, yes, I will cut down \nproduction. But each individual farmer out there with that fixed land, \nthe equipment, his costs, his sunk costs, he says: If prices are down, \nI had better grow more.\n  Does the Senator from Indiana have some sense that that happens \nsometimes?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would respond to my friend that that probably frequently \nhappens. Probably a majority of farmers will continue to plant about \nwhat they are doing now. What I am discussing really is at the margins, \nthat overproduction has seemingly continued and maybe accelerated as \nthe farm bill has progressed--not just the one we are in but the one \nbefore that. The control factor is something that the Senator and I \nhave considered during our work on the Agriculture Committee with the \ncrop insurance innovations.\n\n  For example, this gives the farmer a lot of control. I would say in \nmy own situation, I purchased the 85 percent crop revenue insurance \nthis year. Before I planted, I knew I was going to get 85 percent of \nthe income from my beans and corn of the last 5 years or the average \nperiod that was a part of the premium I paid. That is a lot of \nassurance. Then I can go more aggressively into the futures market, \nsell corn that I don't even have in the ground, or not planted it in \nthe event that it appears to me circumstances are adverse.\n  Farmers in the past didn't have those sorts of options. Some are not \ntaking advantage of them now. Nothing in this amendment affects the \ncrop insurance situation, which remains a very important part of this \nmanagement of risk and control that we now have.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand. The Senator is right. His amendment doesn't \ntouch crop insurance. I understand that. I am concerned about this idea \nthat somehow farmers will get these market signals and they will plant \naccordingly. I still think there has to be a role for the big bad \ngovernment to play through the Department of Agriculture, through us \nhere in the Senate and House, to help to try to stabilize it somewhat, \nand to provide for some constancy out there in terms of what to expect \nin terms of price supports.\n  I guess it is my own personal belief, based upon my studies and being \nhere for a long time and looking at what has happened to agriculture, \nwe could get into a period where we have some violent swings. Then I \nthink we might be in a situation where we would find--I am loath to say \nthis to my friend from Indiana because it always sounds as if we are \ndoing the bad foreign baiting type of thing--if we don't do this, the \nforeigners will do it.\n  I don't necessarily buy that, but to a certain extent I think we get \ninto a situation where we have those fluctuations like that. We might \nencourage more of our competitors around the world to be growing these \ncrops and maybe taking some of their marginal lands out of production \nin growing crops, which I don't think would be good for the environment \nor anything else. I wonder about that also.\n  Again, as I said, those are just the concerns I have with the \namendment of the Senator in terms of land prices and violent swings in \ncommodity prices. And perhaps we just have a different philosophy on \nwhat the role should be. I believe there should be a role for the \nGovernment to try to keep wild swings from happening and prop up these \nprices a little bit in the marketplace. I don't want to provide the \nultimate security, but some security out there, to say, it will go \ndown, but it is not going to go any lower than this.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The chairman and I have been in entire agreement that we \nought to be devoting more of our resources in this bill to research, to \nagricultural community development--really the bulk of the rural people \nare not farmers who are going to benefit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The educational process for the young, as well as loans, \nand this important energy research. Clearly, if our country adopted an \nenergy policy that featured the biomass, the ethanol, or other products \nthat come from that, we would have a different farm scene. I pray that \nwill occur, as does the Senator. But it won't, really, without a great \ndeal of effort on our part.\n\n  These are hopeful signs for the future. I think we both agree, we \ndon't want to bump up against the WTO ceilings because that really \nwould jeopardize our export position. And I have offered a prudent step \nthat takes us way back from that apparently. I have a lot of government \nstill here: $7,000 for maybe 1.3 million entities is a lot of \ngovernment but, at the same time, a level that I think will not \nperversely accelerate the land value, overproduction, and really \nfinally does cost a lot less money at a time that we are in deficit \nfinance.\n  I appreciate the Senator's thoughtful objections to this, but I \npersist nonetheless and ask for support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with the \ntime evenly divided. How much time remains on both sides, if I may \ninquire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 2 minutes 8 \nseconds; the Senator from Iowa controls 14 minutes 26 seconds.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Indiana, I want to \nbe honest, so for the record, according to my staff who did this \nresearch, about two-thirds of those receiving payments in Iowa get less \nthan $7,000. The Senator's is one-fifth? Ours is one-third.\n  Mr. LUGAR. At least three-quarters receiving less than $7,000.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have about 160,000 farmers or entities receiving \npayments. Iowa farmers who get more than $7,000 are about 55,000 out of \nthat 160,000--that is about a third--farmers getting less than $7,000, \n105,000; farmers getting more than $15,000 are just under 30,000; and \nfarmers getting less than $15,000, fewer than 130,000. It would be \n105,000 farmers getting less than $7,000, and about 55,000 would be \ngetting more than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have determined from conversing with the \ntwo managers of the bill that they are going to yield back their time \non this amendment. That being the case, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be considered yielded back and that following 5 minutes for \nthe Senator from\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\nNew Jersey on an unrelated matter, the Senate begin voting on the Lugar \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Torricelli are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mrs. Carnahan], for herself and \n     Mr. Hutchinson, proposes an amendment numbered 2830 to \n     amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To permanently reenact chapter 12 of title 11, United States \n                                 Code)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . REENACTMENT OF FAMILY FARMER BANKRUPTCY PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Reenactment.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, chapter 12 of title 11, United States Code, is hereby \n     reenacted.\n       (b) Conforming Repeal.--Section 303(f) of Public Law 99-554 \n     (100 Stat. 3124) is repealed.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section shall be deemed to have \n     taken effect on October 1, 2001.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I ask unanimous consent Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas \nbe added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, let me commend the two managers of this \nbill, Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar. Trying to forge a consensus on \na farm bill is a daunting task. The work is absolutely critical for \nfamily farmers in Missouri and throughout the Nation.\n  This amendment is designed specifically to help ailing family \nfarmers. It will make permanent chapter 12 of the bankruptcy law. \nChapter 12 offers an expedited bankruptcy procedure to family farmers \nin an effort to accommodate their special needs. It was first enacted \nin 1986 and has been extended several times since then--in fact, twice \nlast year.\n  The provisions of chapter 12 allow family farmers to reorganize their \ndebts as opposed to liquidating their assets. These provisions can be \ninvaluable to farmers struggling to stay in business during difficult \ntimes. Unfortunately, chapter 12 expired on October 1 of last year. The \nCarnahan-Hutchinson amendment seeks to make permanent these bankruptcy \nprovisions and reinstates them retroactively to the date when they last \nexpired. The retroactivity will ensure there are no gaps in \navailability of these procedures.\n  The larger bankruptcy reform bill currently pending before the House-\nSenate conference committee includes a permanent extension of chapter \n12. Nevertheless, America's family farmers should not have to wait for \nus to complete our work on the bankruptcy reform bill. Farmers and farm \ngroups across Missouri have urged me to try to get these provisions \nreenacted as quickly as possible. They stress how important chapter 12 \ncan be during tough times.\n  This amendment is also important because the retroactivity will \neliminate uncertainty for farmers who have cases already pending.\n  Legislation extending these provisions passed the House of \nRepresentatives twice last year by votes of 411 to 1 and 408 to 2. \nThese laws were both subsequently approved by the Senate by unanimous \nconsent. It is my hope we can approve this amendment and complete our \nwork on the farm bill quickly.\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend Senator Carnahan for her \nexcellent statement and for introducing this amendment. I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor.\n  Earlier today I filed amendment No. 2828 which did precisely this, \nmaking permanent chapter 12 provisions and making them retroactive. \nObviously, there is no need to pursue that amendment. I am very pleased \nto be able to cosponsor this amendment with Senator Carnahan. I look \nforward to its quick passage as well.\n  I was very disappointed earlier today in the payment limitation \namendment being adopted and the consequences I believe it will have for \nsouthern agriculture. I know other parts of the country do not face \nthat problem and will not see the impact we will see in Arkansas, \nMississippi, Alabama, and across the South. Consequences will be real \nand severe. That is why the permanent extension of the chapter 12 \nbankruptcy for farmers is so essential. It is unfortunate it is so \nessential.\n  We talk of our farm bill having a safety net. That safety net expired \nlast year, and the enactment of chapter 12 bankruptcy is critical. The \ntemporary basis of past law has Members again seeking to protect our \nNation's farmers. This law was enacted on a temporary basis because \nCongress did not know whether it would work. We now know it does work \nand it should be permanently enacted. It was passed back in 1986. In \nthe past 14 years, 20,000 American farmers have filed to reorganize \ntheir debts under its protection. It was designed to help farmers who \nreceive more than half of their income from farming and have total \ndebts of less than $1.5 million. It hopefully allows them to stay in \nfarming. It has worked very well.\n  It is unfortunate so many of our farmers are being forced into \nbankruptcy. I join my colleagues in pointing out this disturbing fact. \nI ask those same colleagues to join me in doing something. Between 1999 \nand 2001, the Farm Service Agency in Arkansas has seen a 28-percent \nincrease in filings for chapter 12 bankruptcy. I mentioned earlier I \nattended one of those farm auctions this weekend. The newspaper ad \nannouncing the auction said: Three more farmers calling it quits.\n  That is what we are seeing over and over again across the South--\ncalling it quits, not being able to make a go of it under the current \ncommodity prices and in the absence of a predictable farm policy. There \nhas been a 28-percent increase in filings for chapter 12 in Arkansas. \nChapter 12 helps farmers get through bad times without having to give \nup the farm and helps them, hopefully, to get on their feet.\n  Before chapter 12, banks would not negotiate with farmers and they \nwould be forced to sell the farm. Chapter 12 provides farmers the \nability to have more flexibility to reorganize their financial affairs. \nFarming requires a tremendous amount of capital investment. Under most \nother provisions of bankruptcy, farmers would be required to sell a lot \nof their machinery and oftentimes sell their property also. This sends \nthese farmers spiraling toward collapse because it nearly eliminates \nthe chance farmers could work themselves out of their financial \nsituation.\n  This legislation is currently tied up in the bankruptcy reform \nconference. It has been there now for 6 months. All the while, farmers \nare going out of business, forced to sell their equipment, and sell \ntheir assets, and sell their property.\n  Our country is in a recession. The agricultural community has been in \na recession for several years. Many commodity prices are at their \nlowest point in nearly 50 years. In the past, we have supported short-\nterm, short-sighted extensions. It is time to permanently enact these \nbankruptcy provisions. In this time of economic uncertainty, forcing \nfarmers to liquidate their assets is not the answer. The answer is \npermanent enactment of chapter 12 bankruptcy, allowing farmers the \nability and freedom to reorganize their debt and stay in farming.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Carnahan for filing and offering this \namendment. I am glad to cosponsor the amendment. I hope for its quick \npassage this afternoon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment by \nSenator Carnahan to retroactively renew family farmer bankruptcy \nprotection and make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code. \nI commend Senator Carnahan for her continued leadership in protecting \nfamily farms across the country.\n  Unfortunately, too many family farmers have been left in legal limbo \nin bankruptcy courts across the country since Chapter 12 of the \nBankruptcy Code expired on October 1, 2001. Congress needs to move \nquickly to restore this safety net for America's family farmers.\n  This is the third time in the last year that this Congress must act \nto retroactively restore basic bankruptcy safeguards for family farmers \nbecause Chapter 12 is still a temporary provision despite its first \npassage into law in 1986. Our family farmers do not deserve these \nlapses in bankruptcy law that could mean the difference between \nforeclosure and farming.\n  In 2000 and into last year, for example, the Senate, then controlled \nby the other party, failed to take up a House-passed bill to \nretroactively renew Chapter 12 and, as a result, family farmers lost \nChapter 12 bankruptcy protection for 8 months. The current lapse of \nChapter 12 has lasted more than 4 months. Enough is enough. It is past \ntime for Congress to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy \nCode to provide a stable safety net for our nation's family farmers.\n  In the current bankruptcy reform conference, I am hopeful Congress \nwill update and expand the coverage of Chapter 12 as Senator Feingold \nhas proposed in the Senate-passed reform bill.\n  In the meantime, the Senate should take the lead and quickly restore \nand make permanent this basic bankruptcy protection for our family \nfarmers across the country by adopting the Carnahan amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I'm a strong supporter of Chapter 12. I \nwrote it; I believe in it. But I believe it belongs in the bankruptcy \nbill which is currently in conference. I hope that the Majority Leader \nwill step up to the plate and help move this conference along. The \nbankruptcy bill contains many provisions that would make life better \nfor farmers and it would be a serious mistake not to enact the \nbankruptcy bill soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Arkansas and \nthe Senator from Missouri in supporting this amendment. I compliment \nboth Members for addressing this issue. I compliment the Senator from \nMissouri for offering this amendment and the Senator from Arkansas. \nThis is something sorely needed. I hope it will have strong support.\n  I hear a lot about this in the countryside. Quite frankly, in these \ntough times, more and more I think we will need the benefit of chapter \n12.\n  As I understand it, this does go back retroactively to last \nSeptember, if I am not mistaken, and it will cover a number of farmers \nusing chapter 12 proceedings and making it permanent. At least it lets \nthem know it is going to be there from now on and we will not have to \nkeep reauthorizing it. I ask to be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join the chairman in commending the \ndistinguished Senators from Missouri and Arkansas for a very \nconstructive amendment. I am hopeful it will have universal support.\n  Let me add a point of procedure. Senator Hatch wants to speak on the \namendment. He is not visible for the moment. At a certain proper time, \nI will consult with the chairman. We may want to set this amendment \naside so we have floor activity. I know of no opposition, but Senator \nHatch is still to be heard from, so we want to reserve the opportunity \nfor him to speak if possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLeahy be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have conferred with Senators Lugar and \nHarkin, the two managers of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the vote on or in relation to the Carnahan amendment occur at 5:40 \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment, that of Senator Carnahan, be set aside and that Senator \nCrapo be allowed to offer his amendment. For the information of \nMembers, he would offer this amendment, speak until 5:40. There are \nother Members who probably wish to speak on this amendment. Then the \nagreement between Senator Crapo and the two managers and I would be \nthat when the debate is finished on his amendment this evening, the \namendment would be laid aside and we would take it up again next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2533\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2533.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo], for himself and Mr. \n     Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 2533.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To strike the water conservation program)\n\n       Strike section 215.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this amendment strikes section 215 of the \nWater Conservation Program from this bill. I have introduced this \namendment on behalf of not only myself but Senator Craig, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Thomas, Senator Ensign, Senator Allard, Senator \nCampbell, Senator Hagel, Senator Enzi, Senator Burns, and Senators \nHatch and Bennett of Utah.\n  This amendment is essentially a debate over whether the Federal \nGovernment should make an unprecedented move into the management, \nallocation, and use of water nationwide through the farm bill.\n  Historically we have had some very successful programs in the farm \nbill dealing with conservation. In fact, I have often stated, as I talk \naround the country about the farm bill, that in addition to creating \nour domestic farm policy, the farm bill has many other incredibly \nimportant provisions, not the least of which is its conservation title. \nIt is probably the most important environmental piece of legislation \nthis Congress considers on a regular basis.\n  One of those important environmental programs is the Conservation \nReserve Program. This is a program that is time honored and has worked \nfor many years in a way that has assisted farmers while at the same \ntime assisted those who seek to improve the habitat for fish and \nwildlife around our country and to protect and preserve and strengthen \nour environment.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program is one which, in essence, allows a \nfarmer to put his or her land into the program and idle it, allowing \nfor more and better growth and development of habitat for wild species \nwhile at the same time allowing the farmer to receive some compensation \nfor the agreement to do the effort of working to develop a habitat and \nprotect it.\n  It is a program, as I say, that has been very successful and very \nwell received, and in this farm bill there are proposals to improve and \nincrease the availability of the CRP to those in the agricultural \narena.\n  I have worked for months now on developing a very strong conservation \ntitle that can be a part of whatever we move forward on in the arena of \nour agricultural policy. In the proposals I have made, we have, indeed, \nadded and improved the scope and reach of the CRP.\n  The water provisions we are debating today are an effort to link, if \nyou will, administration of the Endangered Species Act with this very \nsuccessful CRP, and to do so in a way that will intrude on State \nsovereignty over water and will create inappropriate pressures on our \nfarmers, our agricultural producers, to give up their water rights and \nwill not result in more effective benefits for the wildlife.\n  In essence, the language we are debating says, as to some of that \nincreased CRP land we are proposing to be put into the new farm bill, \nabout 1.1 million acres of it, that in order to participate in that new \nCRP land, a farmer would have to agree to give up either temporarily or \npermanently his or her water rights to the Federal Government.\n  First, this is creating a condition on our farmers for their \nparticipation in a portion of a very successful conservation program, a \ncondition that is unnecessary and is harmful.\n  Second, it is walking all over States rights. Today States have \nsovereignty over the allocation, management, and use of water and water \nrights, and this is an unprecedented move of the Federal Government \ninto the management, allocation, and use of water rights and, frankly, \na move that will put the Federal Government in control of water rights \nin return for giving farmers the permission to participate in the CRP.\n  Third, the States already have programs and operations in place that \nenable them to address the questions of the need for water for species \nmanagement. In fact, in my State of Idaho, we already are working very \naggressively in salmon and steelhead recovery efforts to work with \nprivate property owners and water rights holders to make certain we are \nable to get water to the species that need it without harming the \nagricultural community and the other interests of water users, and we \nare doing so very successfully.\n  In fact, with permission, I would like to read briefly from a letter \nto me from former Senator Kempthorne, now Governor Kempthorne of the \nState of Idaho. I ask unanimous consent to read from this letter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this letter, sent by Governor Kempthorne on \nDecember 11, says:\n\n       The water conservation program--\n\n  The water proposals I am talking about right now in this bill--\n\n     are not consistent with the laws of the 18 Western States, \n     including those of the State of Idaho. In addition, the goal \n     of implementing water quantity and water quality improvement \n     demonstrated to be required for species listed under the \n     Endangered Species Act can largely be achieved under existing \n     State laws.\n\n  My point is that the objective of this language we are talking about \nis certainly worthwhile: getting water, quantity and quality, to the \nspecies that need them. But the States already have programs in place \nto achieve these objectives, and it is achieved very successfully in \nIdaho.\n\n[[Page S470]]\n\n  Governor Kempthorne goes on to point out:\n\n       In Idaho, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been able to \n     rent water from the State water supply bank from willing \n     sellers pursuant to State law for almost a decade. More \n     recently, the Bureau has rented water while in the Lemhi \n     River, a tributary of the Salmon River, for the benefit of \n     fish species. Again, this was done under the auspices of \n     State law in cooperation with willing sellers.\n\n  My point again is that State law already provides mechanisms for the \nobjectives of this water language to be achieved. We do not need to \ninsert the Federal Government into the control of water rights, and we \ndo not need to condition participation in a very successful \nconservation program and pressure being brought to bear to force \nfarmers to give up their water rights either temporarily or \npermanently.\n  I will make another point and then yield the floor because I know \nthere are other Senators concerned about this matter and who want to \nspeak about it. The point is this: We have all had a lot of experience \nunder the Endangered Species Act with its implementation and \nmanagement. A very critical question has been raised about this \nlanguage with regard to what happens if it is adopted and a farmer, in \norder to participate in this program, agrees to temporarily give up his \nor her water rights, thinking: I can get those water rights back at \nsome point when I determine I would like to say it is time to return \nthem to me.\n  What if a species has become dependent on that water? Under the \nEndangered Species Act, section 9, the question arises: Does that \nbecome a taking? Does there need to be a NEPA analysis before the \nFederal Government can return the water rights to this farmer? Does it \nhave to go through an analysis of section 9 of the Endangered Species \nAct and under NEPA and other provisions of Federal law to determine \nwhether other Federal law would be violated by the return which is \ncontemplated by this very language?\n  Those are the kinds of questions that must be answered, but they are \nthe kinds of questions that also raise clearly the problem that is \naddressed in terms of the Federal Government beginning to assert itself \ninto this process.\n  Mr. President, I know we have a limited time right now, so I am going \nto conclude my remarks. I know there are a number of other Senators who \nwill seek time. I have been told to remind them all we only have about \n15 minutes of debate remaining.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Crapo's \namendment to strike the language in the Conservation Reserve \nEnhancement Program.\n  Before the holiday recess, we debated a slightly different version of \nSenator Reid's proposal. The holidays gave us sufficient time to look \nover the language and to get feedback.\n  I can tell my colleagues that in my State our Governor, our attorney \ngeneral, the Colorado Farm Bureau, and literally every rancher and \nfarmer I talked to during the break strongly oppose this language.\n  Senator Reid has included some very controversial language. I have \ngreat respect for Senator Reid and consider him a close friend, but I \nthink this is just dead wrong. The recent change cannot cure the flawed \nprovision.\n  First of all, some might refer to Senator Reid's proposal as a mere \nextension of CREP, a program that can only be extended if it already \nexists, but water rights should not be part of the Conservation Reserve \nEnhancement Program. Therefore, the addition of water rights is a \nfundamental change to the existing program. Such a change should \nrequire hearings, study, or some level of congressional inquiry, and \nyet there has been none to date.\n  Our constituents expect us to be fully informed. Since this is the \nfirst that most of us have heard of creating what is effectively a new \nprogram, how can we possibly be fully informed? We cannot, and I simply \ncannot vote for something that can hurt farmers in my State when we do \nnot know the effects.\n  I carefully reviewed the language letting the States hold water \nrights rather than the Secretary of Agriculture, as Senator Reid \nrecently proposed.\n  At first glance, this might sound reasonable, properly deferring to \nthe primacy of State water courts in the West. However, the new \nlanguage requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review and approve \nthe interested State's program.\n  Again, the United States waived its sovereign immunity and consented \nto deferring to State adjudication of water rights. In 1993, the U.S. \nSupreme Court reaffirmed that law ensuring that Federal claims are \nsubject to State water courts.\n  Senator Reid's language would make a change to CREP and would bring \nthe Federal Government back into the equation. Whether intentional or \nnot, the USDA review and approval requirement amounts to a sleight-of-\nhand Federal regulation of a precious State resource resulting in de \nfacto Federal involvement.\n  Again, this dramatic change to the CREP creates way too many \nquestions. First and foremost, of course, is why should water be \nincluded in this farm bill? Second, this new program would give \npriority to a State program that addresses endangered, threatened, or \n``species that have been called threatened or endangered.'' Senator \nCrapo alluded to this.\n  It may also include those that ``may become threatened.'' I do not \nhave to remind my friends from the West of the controversy currently \nsurrounding the Canadian lynx and the fish in the Klamath Basin and my \nState of Colorado, too, species that were actually endangered and, in \nsome cases, we are finding out now, in the case of the lynx, they were \nnot really endangered. There were dummied statistics to make them look \nendangered.\n  Before granting discretion to affect ``species that may become \nthreatened,'' we should determine how many problems actually are there \nand what kind of corrective action should be taken.\n  Senator Crapo mentioned the question, if we lease water to the \nFederal Government and they use it for a different purpose than the \nfarmer used it, if it creates an area that may become an actual \nendangered species habitat, would that, under the Endangered Species \nAct, supersede the rancher's and farmer's ability to get the water \nrights back when the lease is over? That is a question we should ask \nourselves.\n  My colleagues have stressed this language would not disrupt water \nrights because it only affects ``willing sellers.''\n  What about the downstream farmer? In the West, all of us know that \nwater is used more than once.\n  I have a small ranch. I think I am about fourth in the use of the \nwater. The wastewater is then filed on by people who are downstream or \nhave areas of ranching territory lower than others. So you may have \nfour or five people who use the same water. Of course, priority right \nis given by senior water rights or junior water rights, depending on \nhow early they were on the claims in the filing. If a senior rights \nholder upstream leases from the Federal Government, where does that \nleave the junior rights holders who also rely on that water to feed \ntheir crops or their livestock? Could they be also in danger? I think \nthey could.\n  In Colorado, much as in all the rest of the West, water is treated \napart from the land. It is considered a property right. It can be taken \nfrom the land and sold separately, which it often is. So long as the \nchange does not injure other water rights, I think this language, \nbecause of the way we reuse the water over and over, could certainly \njeopardize junior rights holders.\n  Colorado is an arid State. Its strained water supply has been over \nappropriated. In other words, the demand for water exceeds our supply. \nThat is what we are always in court about and always fighting about. \nEven more challenging, Colorado's population is projected to grow 63 \npercent in the next 25 years. The growth, in fact, is only superseded \nby the growth in Nevada and Arizona. We are the third fastest growing \nState. I certainly would oppose any action to jeopardize any State's \nrights to use the water it legally owns.\n  In order to meet water needs, communities have entered into water \ncompacts. I believe this language leaves too many questions about what \nhappens to inter-basin compacts, inter-State compacts, and \ninternational compacts. Both the Colorado and the Rio Grande headwaters \nare in Colorado. We have nine rivers that flow out of Colorado. All of \nthem are subject to those compacts. The two major rivers I\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\nmentioned are subject to compacts with another nation, Mexico, as they \nreceive water from both of those resources.\n  In closing, many of my colleagues like to say they are moving a farm \nbill because that is what farmers want. The group, Environmental \nDefense, was quoted today in Congress Daily concerning Senator Reid's \nlanguage, and I would like to remind my colleagues they are purportedly \nacting pursuant to the farmers' interests and what the farmers want.\n  Well, I know the Farm Bureau has gone on record as opposing this \nlanguage. The Farm Union was in my office also opposing this language, \nand I oppose this language. So I hope my friends recognize the real \nlong-term dangers that could exist for water users in all the Western \nStates if the Reid language is included.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nfrom the West and my partner from Idaho, Mike Crapo, to support an \namendment to strike a section from this bill that deals with the very \ncritical issue of western water. This area is being called the water \nconservation program.\n  I will submit for the Record a letter from the President of the \nAmerican Farm Bureau. Basically, he puts it rather clearly:\n\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation board of directors in a \n     special meeting on Tuesday, December 18, 2001, voted to \n     oppose Senate passage of the farm bill if it contains the \n     water language that your amendment is intended to strike.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the American Farm Bureau letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Michael Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I am writing to convey the strongest \n     support possible of the American Farm Bureau Federation for \n     your amendment to strike the Reid water rights language from \n     the conservation title of S. 1731. This language poses an \n     extraordinary new threat to agriculture and the ability of \n     farmers and ranchers to remain economically viable.\n       The water provisions in the bill set a dangerous precedent \n     that would erode historic state water law. Additionally, it \n     will expand the scope of the Endangered Species Act to cover \n     a new category of species that are not in fact threatened or \n     endangered. These changes are unacceptable to agriculture and \n     will affect agricultural producers well beyond those who \n     participate in the Conservation Reserve Program.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation board of directors in a \n     special meeting on Tuesday, December 18, 2001 voted to oppose \n     Senate passage of the farm bill if it contains the water \n     language that your amendment is intended to strike.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am not sure one can get much clearer than the language \nof Bob Stallman as he talks for the thousands and thousands of members \nof the Farm Bureau across the Nation and, most importantly, in the 18 \nWestern States that are most dramatically affected by the Reid \nprovision.\n  A long while ago, long before the Presiding Officer or I ever thought \nabout coming to the Senate--or maybe our parents even thought they \nmight have sons that would come to the Senate --this Congress decided \nthe best way to solve water problems in the arid Western States and \nwestern territories was to allow those States and their governments to \nmake those determinations. Why? Because water was so very scarce, and \nonly the Western States with their perspective could determine the \nallocation of water. It was never true this side of the Mississippi \nwhere there was 30 or 40 or 50 inches of rainfall on an annual basis. \nWater was viewed sometimes as a problem, not an asset or not a rare \ncommodity, but that is not true in Idaho, Arizona, Colorado, New \nMexico, California, or Wyoming where water is truly a scarce commodity. \nOver decades of time, our States have very carefully and cautiously \nallocated that water.\n  My colleague from Idaho, and the Senator from Colorado, spoke about \nsome of the methods, the compacts, the water laws, and also the \nsensitivity that water had to be left instream to take care of \nendangered species, and those decisions had been made in the States \nwhere they most appropriately ought to be made to assure that critical \nbalance in the aridness of the West, of where the water was, how it got \nallocated and how it got used.\n  Never before have we attempted to reach over State law by the \ncharacter of the Reid amendment and create a rather perverse incentive \nthat said we will reward you if you will take land out of production \nand, by the way, in doing so, you have to put your water in a waterbank \nto be reallocated.\n  I do not believe that is the right or the prerogative of the Federal \nGovernment in any of its policies under any incentive to do so. That is \nthe right of the States, the State legislators, their State water \nboards of resources, and the methods by which they have established \nwater allocation historically and currently. That is why it is \ncritically important that the Crapo amendment pass. It is so very \nimportant for all of the West that that happen and that we never allow \nour Government in any way to infringe upon those rights.\n  We in Idaho, as is true of those other 17 States, are very sensitive \nto the needs of wildlife as it relates to the needs of the human \nspecies, as it relates to the needs of agriculture and the consumptive \nuses versus the conservation uses. We have worked constantly to strike \nthat balance, and we do so today.\n  Water use and water allocation are a dynamic process in our States, \nas it must be because it is a rare commodity, constantly being demanded \nby someone for another purpose and another use. This city and those who \nwork in these Halls do not collectively have the understanding that our \ncolleagues in the West have for these unique purposes.\n  That is why I stand in support of the Crapo/Craig amendment this \nevening and hope our colleagues will join with us in its passage to \nchange the provision of the Reid water language in S. 1731, better \nknown as the water conservation program. I believe that proposal is a \nwar on western water rights and western prerogative. Let us not get it \nstarted. Let us snuff it out before the first shot is fired.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am opposed to the Reid provision in the \nfarm bill and stand in support of the Crapo amendment to remove that \nprovision.\n  May I inquire as to how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is approximately 1 minute before the \nvote under the previous order.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized immediately after the vote to speak on the Crapo amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, briefly I want to talk about the fact we \nhave not had any hearings on this particular issue. I do not know how \nmany Senators who come from a different part of the country than those \nof us in the West have come up to me and said: We do not understand \nyour water law. Granted, it is complicated and it varies a little bit \nfrom State to State. Due to that complexity, I don't think we are doing \nthe Members of the Senate any service by rushing this matter through \nand not having proper hearings and giving everybody an opportunity to \nunderstand the full impact of this piece of legislation.\n\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has clearly given the States the sovereignty \nin the matter of water adjudication. We are talking about a property \nright. My State of Colorado has recognized water as a property right. \nWe have sometimes referred to it as the ``doctrine of prior \nappropriation'' or perhaps simply the ``Colorado water doctrine.'' Many \nWestern States have followed suit and the laws have been put in place \nin the State of Colorado.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2830\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nvote on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2533\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, before we had the vote, I was talking \nabout my support of the Crapo amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, \nbecause of the need I felt to remove the Reid amendment from the farm \nbill. At the time, I was making the point that water issues in the West \nare very complicated.\n  Here is an issue that has come to the floor of the Senate that has \nnot had any hearings in committee and has not had any kind of study.\n  Before we move forward with this kind of a proposal from the Senate, \nwe ought to have thorough hearings and study so the Members of the \nSenate can understand the implications of this type of amendment, \nparticularly out West where we deal with and are under a completely \ndifferent set of water laws than those parts of the country that have \nmore water.\n  For those of us in semiarid States, water is a property right. The \nresponsibility of managing water has been made the responsibility of \nthe States. This has gone to the Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court \nhas affirmed that, yes, that is a proper role; States should assume \nthat responsibility.\n  The Reid amendment to the farm bill could literally devastate my \nState of Colorado. It is a very serious problem because we are a \nsemiarid State, and farm country relies a good deal on agriculture.\n  One of the largest agricultural-producing counties in the country is \nin the State of Colorado. They rely on irrigated agriculture and having \na reliable source of water.\n\n  The practical effect of this language could mean that farmers end up \ngiving their water rights to the Federal Government when they sign up \nfor participation in the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  This language, if it is left in the farm bill, could potentially \ndewater Colorado and other Western States. It would dewater States such \nas Colorado that rely on interstate compacts and State water laws to \nallocate a very scarce commodity--water.\n  Water is the essential substance of life. The farmer depends on it to \ngrow enough food to meet our national food needs. The city depends on \nit to survive. Commerce depends on it to deliver goods to customers, to \nrestock store shelves, and to continue as a viable business, providing \njobs and security.\n  Colorado has a unique system in water law. We have our own water \ncourts. We are the only prior appropriation State that does not have a \npermit system. Appropriators in Colorado must make a claim first and \nthen seek a ``decreed'' water right in court.\n  In Colorado, we have actually even set up a different set of courts. \nIt does not go through the regular court system. We have a different \nset of courts that just deal with water rights. When somebody applies \nfor a right to use water, not only are there attorneys in that court \nbut there are engineers, hydrologists, all sorts of scientists who come \nin and discuss the impact of the diversion of that water for one reason \nor another.\n  This requires considerable study. Each individual case is different. \nAnd these individual cases--usually the circumstances are never the \nsame--have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n  Why many of us get so concerned about the Federal Government and a \nFederal law is that this treats everything as a blanket process. The \nFederal Government does not go through that process. They just collect \nthe water off the CRP land, and there is no study as to what impact it \nhas on private property rights.\n  The Colorado Constitution, which the Supreme Court has said has a \nsovereign right on water issues, says: ``The right to divert the \nunappropriated waters of any natural stream shall never be denied.''\n  These are not mere words. This is a collective ideology, molded from \nover 100 years of practical use. Many have brought an excellent point \nregarding beneficial use. Beneficial use is an integral part of western \nwater law. When the farmer allows the Government to take the water, it \nis possible that the farmer could lose the water right under the \nState's beneficial use laws. It is possible that this law would result \nin an unintentional loss of water rights, water rights terminated \nthrough the operation of State law.\n  Let me offer a scenario. A farmer decides to go into the CRP, and it \nis the CRP where the Federal Government would take the water. Suppose \nhe goes in it for 10 years. He has not been using that water so, under \nour State law, he would lose the right to use that water. Or the other \nquestion comes up, Does that right transfer to the Federal Government \nand remain with the Federal Government even though he has brought his \nland out of the CRP and back into production?\n  That is why it is very important that we proceed with hearings and \nstudy. The U.S. Supreme Court has clearly given the States sovereignty \nin the matter of water adjudication. This ill-founded amendment \nattempts to give the Federal Government a new water right that it \nsimply is not entitled to, nor should it be granted by Congress.\n  My home State is united in opposition to this usurpation of water: \nthe Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture, the Colorado Department of \nNatural Resources, the Colorado Farm Bureau, and the Attorney General. \nThere is bipartisan concern in my State, and agricultural groups from \nall aspects of Colorado have raised concerns with me about this \nparticular amendment.\n  The Colorado groups are not alone. The list of those deeply concerned \nwith the negative implications of this language reaches the national \nlevel as well. We have heard from some of my colleagues and will \nprobably hear more.\n  The Reid amendment ties the water rights to endangered species. We \nhave\n\n[[Page S473]]\n\nseen this combination before. Land, water, and the Endangered Species \nAct create a mix that is often disadvantageous for property rights and \nproperty owners. We have seen this, for example, in the Klamath River \nBasin in Oregon. Unfortunately, we are not sure what will happen with \nthe water rights when the farmer's deal with the Government ends. I \nraised this point. We don't know because the proposal is silent on what \nhas to take place upon termination of the enrollment period. Does the \nGovernment keep the water?\n  As we know, the Endangered Species Act requires consultation for any \nFederal action that affects species. That requirement could be applied \nto transfer of water rights back to the landowner on termination of the \nagreement.\n  Does the landowner have to establish that there is no longer a need \nfor the water by the listed species? The landowner is placed in an \nexpensive and dangerous position of proof--a difficult proposition \nthat, if not answered, could mean the landowner loses his water right.\n  When water habits and availability of water to the land are changed, \nthis alters the character of the land. In a region that receives far \ntoo little rain to depend on skies for moisture, a deprivation of \nwater, no matter how permanent, could change the very nature of the \nground itself.\n  Again, I would like to cite, in this context, my own personal \nexperience. I grew up on a ranch. We had many hay meadows, and they \nwere watered with flood irrigation. No longer is that ranch under \nprivate ownership. It is now owned by the Federal Government. They quit \nthe surface right irrigation. It dried up all the springs that were \nfeeding into this river that ran through the place. As a result, we see \nthat that river dries up and is bone dry.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa wants to be recognized for a minute. I \nyield to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding without losing his right \nto the floor.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following list I \nwill send to the desk be the only first-degree amendments in order to \nS. 1731; that they be subject to second-degree amendments which must be \nrelevant to the amendment to which it is offered; that upon the \ndisposition of all amendments, the bill be read a third time and the \nSenate then proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 199, H.R. \n2646, the House companion; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 1731, as amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; that the bill be advanced to third reading and the Senate then \nvote on passage of the bill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on \nits amendment and request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses; and that the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees with a ratio of four to three; that S. 1731 be \nreturned to the calendar, with this action occurring with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, for the \ninformation of Senators, tomorrow we have a number of people who have \nagreed to come and offer amendments: Senator Conrad at 9:30; Senator \nSantorum at 10; Senator Lincoln at 10; and Senator Feinstein at or \nabout 12.\n  I am not asking that this be part of the unanimous consent request \nbut just to alert everybody, tomorrow there will be amendments offered. \nThe two leaders will agree on when we will vote. There will be no votes \ntomorrow, as has been announced. Tomorrow we will be open for business \nto try to move this bill along.\n  I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, the point I was making is that we have \nto be very careful in how we use our water or we could have a lot of \nfar-reaching ramifications that have had some inadvertent effects on \nfish and wildlife and plant species that survive in that particular \narea, which simply may not be met with a ready, easy transfer of water \nto the Federal Government without a serious study of those \nramifications. There is a serious lack of fair and open discussion on \nthis issue.\n  I remind my colleagues again, there was little congressional \ninvestigation or involvement when this language was inserted into the \nbill, and the committees responsible for many of the details simply \nwere not involved in the discussion.\n  One must also ask the question: What is the purpose of the \nConservation Reserve Program? Our debate is focused on many things, but \nnot once have Members had the opportunity to discuss until now whether \nor not the purpose of the Conservation Reserve Program is for \nendangered species. This program also allows for a permanent transfer \nof water rights. CRP has always been limited to a certain number of \nyears.\n  The Reid language also expands the basic coverage afforded to the \nprotection of species under the Endangered Species Act. This is an \nimportant point. Not only will endangered species and threatened \nspecies be covered, but the Reid program would cover sensitive species, \ntoo.\n  What is a sensitive species? At this time everyone should be reminded \nthat the Endangered Species Act has no classification or definition of \nsensitive species. What happens to the other uses of the water source? \nParticipation in the program could lead to increased delivery costs to \nmutual users. The costs of operating ditch companies could increase as \ncost share participants leave the program. Downstream users could also \nbe affected. Participation in the program could lead to underground \nrecharge problems.\n  The language is simply too vague. It does not specify sources of \nwater eligible to participate in the program. Not only would the \nlanguage apply to surface water and CRP, but it could apply to ground \nwater as well; a whole different set of issues become pertinent.\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\nGround water use and set-asides affect neighboring use.\n  My point is, this is a very complicated issue. It has a lot of \nramifications. Without careful study, this could be the wrong action to \nbe taken. It could have just the opposite effect of what the sponsor \nwould like to accomplish.\n  I rise in support of the Crapo amendment. I thank my colleagues and \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to support the Crapo amendment to \nstrike the proposed Water Conservation Program from the farm bill that \nwe are debating today on the Senate floor.\n  The creation of the Water Conservation Program, as proposed in this \ncurrent legislation, would set a very dangerous farm policy precedent. \nIt would open the door to federal government infringement on state \nwater rights. There would be many unintended consequences for the \nnation's agricultural producers--the people we are trying to assist \ntoday.\n  This provision is a threat to private property rights and conflicts \nwith individual state water laws and programs.\n  As Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns said:\n\n       To tie state-administered water rights into such a program \n     creates another federal nexus whereby the federal government \n     can leverage water away from our agricultural producers and \n     water users permanently. . . .  Nebraska simply cannot agree \n     to any such program.\n\n  Governor Johanns clearly identified the dangers of the current \nlegislation.\n  All states care about water conservation and wildlife protection. For \nexample, the State of Nebraska is currently working with Wyoming and \nColorado, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to craft a Cooperative \nAgreement for endangered species management on the Platte River. States \ndo not need more federal dictates and regulation.\n  As one irrigation district manager in western Nebraska said, ``there \ncould be significant consequences with this water conservation proposal \nas it is written in this legislation. The process of evaluating these \nimpacts would be very complicated. Each state has different laws and \nissues.''\n  Additionally, the current proposal has not been debated in the House \nor Senate Agriculture Committees, or in the oversight committees \nresponsible for the Endangered Species Act. This issue deserves \nsignificant study, review and analysis before we move forward with \nfederal legislation.\n  There are too many problems in this proposal--too many questions yet \nto be answered. We should not impose additional, unnecessary \nrestrictions on water and property rights for our states and our \ncitizens. I urge my colleagues to support the Crapo amendment to strike \nthe Water Conservation Program from the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I will be brief. I will come back on \nMonday or Tuesday and talk more about it. I rise, too, in support of \nthe Crapo amendment.\n  Certainly for those of us in the West there is nothing more important \nthan water rights and how we handle those water rights, nothing more \nimportant to us than to maintain the concept of State allocation of \nwater adjudication. And this threatens that, it preempts State water \nrights. It has the possibility of doing that. That could result in \npermanent acquisition of the water rights, which is not something that \nany of us want to see happen.\n  It extends authority of the Endangered Species Act to USDA. Certainly \nwe have enough difficulties with the way the Endangered Species Act is \nhandled now.\n  This is the last one of the issues. It proposes radical changes to \nCRP without addressing the reform of the Endangered Species Act. These \ntwo issues do not fit together and are very inconsistent.\n  Furthermore, it never was discussed in the committee. I happen to be \na member of the Agriculture Committee. This was never debated during \nconsideration of the bill. There are a number of us on the committee \nwho certainly would have fought vigorously to keep this language out of \nthe bill.\n  Madam President, I will not take any more time. Some of my colleagues \nwant to speak. I will be back to talk more about some of the impacts I \nbelieve this amendment will have. Again, I support the Crapo amendment. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise to support the Crapo amendment. \nFrom the statements that have been made with regard to having water \nlanguage in the agriculture bill at all, it is pretty indicative of \nwhat has happened since the legislation was introduced. There has been \nno hearing on this legislation. It started out as a version of S. 1737. \nThe bill never had a hearing. It has never seen the light of day. It \nhas never seen any lightbulbs. Any time that happens in the Senate, \nmost of us fear not what is in it but what is not in it.\n  This summer, we had a crisis in the Klamath Basin in southern Oregon, \nsoutheastern Oregon, and northern California. Anybody who depends on \nwater for irrigation and their farm operations should be very concerned \nabout this amendment.\n  We have heard a lot of Western Senators make statements, but this is \nnot only a problem that is confined to the West. We now have a little \nargument over a river that runs between Alabama and Georgia. As \npopulations grow, we will hear of more conflicts in areas where water \nlaw or water policy has never before been considered.\n  Last weekend, of course, all the papers were full of Enron, but there \nwas a very interesting article in Monday's Washington Post with regard \nto a National Science Foundation study that was released. It was very \ncritical of the science that was a part of the decision to shut off the \nwater to the agricultural interests in the Klamath Basin.\n  Madam President, 1,500 farmers were denied water for their irrigation \nprojects. Crops burned up. We have seen filings of bankruptcy, people \nlosing their farms because in farming, a tenuous endeavor, one cannot \nafford to see one crop missed or they will not have anything at all, \nall because of the Endangered Species Act.\n\n  That made me wonder about a lot of other studies the Government has \ndone. Are they credible? And what kind of responsibility have we taken \non as a Government to make sure that the science is correct to the best \nof our knowledge?\n  Ever since, any legislation that comes before this body that has to \ndo with the Endangered Species Act as it relates to water raises many \nquestions.\n  Congress has had a longstanding policy that water rights, even water \nrights for conservation, even water that would be classified as \npreservation, always had to come to terms with the States involved. It \nis a State's right of controlling and adjudicating its own resources. \nThis Government has never even taken a look at that until the beginning \nof the last administration when we had a Secretary of Interior who was \nvery forthright in his belief that the Federal Government should \ncontrol all water resources across this country.\n  This is a part of the farm bill that is most troubling to most of us. \nWe will have more to say on this before we vote on this amendment, \nwhich comes up on Tuesday. I assume that is the tentative schedule.\n  We see new terms entered in this issue. We know what an ``endangered \nspecie'' is. We have a definition of a ``threatened specie.'' But this \nis the first time we have heard the term ``sensitive specie.'' Maybe \nthat category is those who serve in this body.\n  As we look at what happened in the Klamath Basin, as we look at \nanother little item that happened in Washington State when there was a \ndeliberate planting of the Canadian lynx hair to prove this was habitat \nfor another specie that is on the threatened list and yet has not been \nclassified as endangered just to control the use of the land, we have \nto look with a very suspicious eye at what we are doing to this country \nand its ability to produce food and fiber for its citizens.\n  Can that agenda be so treacherous as to deny us, the American people, \nthe ability to clothe and feed ourselves? Right now, with the attitude \nI see in some communities, I would say that is the case.\n  There are a lot of unintended consequences of this language that \ncould happen later, and all of them are negative. There is nothing \npositive. This does nothing for agriculture, as we know it, and our \nability to produce crops and fiber.\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\n  From that standpoint alone, I ask my colleagues who represent States \nwhere agriculture plays a major role in their economy to take a look at \nthis and ask themselves: Is this farm policy? Is this food security \npolicy? I can see no way that one can find a positive answer.\n  Any time we have big brother, who has the big checkbook, standing in \nthe wings to control the lifeblood of any crop, whether it falls from \nthe sky, whether it runs down our streams, or the capillary or the \nunderground rivers of groundwater under their control, something so \nvital that it is even recommended we have eight glasses a day--or it \nused to be--something so vital to life, would we want that kind of \ncontrol in the hands of a government, sometimes a government that is \ninsensitive to what we have to put up with in the production of food \nand fiber for this country?\n  So as the weekend rolls on and as we take time to study this issue, I \nthink that is a question for this body. Do we pass legislation that has \nnever had a hearing, that has never been presented before any \ncommittee, and then wonder about the question that is being raised \ntonight? Remember, we are doing business that will affect people with \nreal faces, with real investments, in the real world. It is not some \nharebrained idea that has been generated in this 17 square miles of \nlogic-free environment because it does have a true effect on every \nperson who lives in this country, not just us who live in the West but \neverybody who lives in this country.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me this time. I will have more to say \nat a later date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to support the amendment that is \noffered by my colleague from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, a water lawyer. Yes, \nwater is important enough in the West that there are people who make it \nan occupation. It is that complicated and it is that important. His \namendment would strike section 215 of the farm bill and leave intact \nthe current conservation programs that are administered by the \nSecretary of Agriculture.\n  I commend the Senator from Idaho for his leadership in this matter \nand for the excellent foresight he shows in working to block the \nFederal Government when intervening into an area that is extremely \ncritical to the survival of the Western United States.\n  Now one has probably noticed how many Western Senators have come to \nthis Chamber. That is because we have some unique problems with water. \nWe want to make sure those fights we have been having for a long time \nare still fights between States, because we know that is a fair fight \nand a fight with the Federal Government is not.\n  Mark Twain is the one who said in the West whiskey is for drinking \nand water is for fighting over. He was really right.\n  The first principle that must be understood in dealing with water in \nthe West is that availability of water has always been the West's \nlimiting factor for development. If one looks at a map of the private \nand Federal lands in the West, one will see a fairly good description \nof the region's water sources and productive lands. Early settlers \nbuilt their homes where they could get water to plant their crops and \nraise their livestock; at least as soon as they understood the West, \nthey did.\n  A lot of the homesteaders came from the East. One of my old friends, \none of the first people I met when I moved to Gillette, WY, was a \nhomesteader. He has since passed away, but I loved him telling me about \nhis first selection of land. There were people who could be paid who \nwould help pick the best land. But nobody who came West had much money. \nSo rather than pay one of these people this bounty to help him select \nthe good land, he picked good land Pennsylvania-style. He picked the \nhills because he did not want to be flooded out every year.\n\n  After the first year, he gave up his first homestead and picked some \ngood bottomland. Bottomland in Wyoming does not flood because we do not \nhave that much water, and he learned that his first year. He tells \nabout this piece of property on which he did finally homestead. He had \nto get water from a neighbor to drink. He had to haul the water by \nwagon 3 miles to get it to this place. We are talking some dry land.\n  In fact, availability of water was so important to early settlers, \nwhen Wyoming ratified its State constitution in 1890, the State claimed \nState ownership of all water rights as part of the State constitution, \nand that was accepted as part of our Statehood. The Federal Government \nsaid: Wyoming, we will let you own your water.\n  Later, when all the productive lands were settled, the bulk of the \nremaining lands were portioned out by the Federal Government mainly \nbetween the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.\n  We also have a third category, and that is the national parks. The \nBureau of Land Management and the national parks are administered by \nthe Interior Department, and the forest lands are handled by the \nDepartment of Agriculture. There is a good reason for that. The \nnational parks, of course, are very pristine. They are to be maintained \nin that condition, and I do not know of anybody who ever wants to \nchange that. So those are not productive lands.\n  The Bureau of Land Management lands are the lands that were left over \nfrom homesteading. That means those are the lands people found were too \ndry or too rocky or too steep to be usable. So those are not productive \nlands.\n  Then, of course, there are the Forest Service lands. Those went under \nthe Department of Agriculture because those were supposed to be \nproductive. Those were usable lands, and usable for a number of \nactivities. Besides the recreation we greatly enjoy today, there was \ngrazing and timbering. When we created a new agency a little bit later \nthen to develop the water resources on this public land, we had the \nBureau of Reclamation to make sure there was enough water to use the \nvast resources found in places such as the State of Wyoming.\n  The next principle that must be understood as to why it is so \nimportant to strike section 215 is because of the scarcity of water in \nthe West. Western water law was built on a much different foundation \nthan the current laws enforced in the East.\n  We are amazed at the rain that happens out here. Washington, DC, \noccasionally gets more rain in a period of a few consecutive days than \nthe State of Wyoming gets in an entire year. Almost all of Wyoming is \nconsidered desert, high desert, mountain desert. The desert definition \nis less than 15 inches of rainfall a year.\n  Part of the reason we do not get much rainfall, of course, is the \nmountain ranges that this water comes over before it ever gets to us \ndrop out a lot of the moisture. I remember being in Seattle and seeing \nT-shirts that said: ``Here you can take your goldfish for a walk,'' or \n``Kids here do not get a suntan, they rust.''\n  After I saw some of the rain, I realized it was a little different \nplace than Wyoming where we are more interior and have a little less \nrain. While a good portion of the country, particularly the East, is \ntrying to figure out how to drain the water off, we are trying to \nfigure out how to save every last drop. We have come up with some \nrather innovative ways of doing that.\n  We are also in a drought, so water is even more important this year \nthan it has been. This is the third year of a drought, though. There \nare some complications with the Federal Government when there is a \ncontinuing drought because we really only provide for--and can \nimagine--one year of drought. So if people are given advantages in one \nyear of a drought, they are not eligible in the next year.\n  I mentioned that we are going into the third year. There are lakes in \nWyoming that have dried up. Nobody gets any water out of them anymore. \nThe streams are much smaller than usual. Wyoming streams and rivers are \ndifferent than in some of the other areas of the country. We call it a \ncreek or a stream when it is about 2 feet to 20 feet wide. Anything \nover 20 feet is a river in Wyoming.\n  We do not have much water. We are the headwaters of a lot of places, \nbut when there is a drought every last drop is important.\n  I want to explain a little bit about the water law. Although there \nare variations from State to State, basic eastern water law follows a \ndoctrine known as riparian rights. Under this doctrine, landowners who \nborder waterways are granted certain rights that allow them\n\n[[Page S476]]\n\nto use whatever amount of water they need for any reasonable use. \nBecause riparian rights adhere to the ownership of the land, these \nrights do not need to be exercised to be kept alive. By simply \nobtaining a water use permit, much as someone would get a building \npermit, landowners can initiate a new water use at any time they want \nand in doing so can force other users to adjust to their needs. This is \nmore or less the main water use principle that underlies the water law \nin 29 States.\n  Western water law, on the other hand, is based on a doctrine of prior \nappropriation. Under State law, an individual owns the right to use \nwater based on the time the water was first appropriated and used, and \nthen that interest is only valid for the amount of water appropriated \nfor that particular use.\n  Let me give an example. Say that rancher one settles along Crazy \nWoman Creek at the foot of the Wyoming Big Horn Mountains. We have a \nlot of interesting creek names. He drew enough water in his first year \nto water 50 head of cattle and to irrigate two pastures. The next year \nhis neighbor moved in and used enough water to irrigate his two \npastures and to water his livestock. Now in this case, rancher one, \nsettler one, would be able to claim a prior use and his neighbor would \nhave to guarantee enough water remains in Crazy Woman Creek to ensure \nthe first settler can irrigate his two pastures and water his 50 head \nof cattle before settler two gets any water.\n  Furthermore, if in the following year the first settler decided to \nirrigate a third pasture in order to feed an additional 25 head of \ncattle, his second appropriation of water would have to follow the \nappropriated rights already established by settler two the year before.\n  To add to this confusion, once a person puts water to a beneficial \nuse, such as irrigating land or watering livestock, and complies with \nthe statutory requirements, that water right remains valid only so long \nas it continues to be used. If a water right lays dormant for too long, \nthe right is considered abandoned and is lost. All of those rights \nshift.\n  Do not worry if the system sounds complicated. After more than 150 \nyears of more and more water users and more and more beneficial uses, \nthe ability to sort out the rights of Western water users is a science \nall its own. And I have not even thrown in the complication of Indian \nwater rights which have a historic precedent and are the subject of a \nlot of water law.\n  I will say, however, if you were to talk to any of the farmers and \nranchers whose families first settled areas that still apply the prior \nuse doctrine, you would quickly begin to grasp the fact that each one \nof them knows what their rights are under the law now, how much water \nthey can use, how much water they will need, and how any disruption of \nthe use system will decimate the ecosystem and the land's ability to \nsustain life.\n  What does this have to do with the amendment? It has everything to do \nwith the amendment. As soon as the Federal Government intervenes in the \nState water law system and acquires the water rights under section 215, \nthat water right under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution \nwould suddenly move to the front of the line for when that water right \nwould be available for use. In other words, it would trump all other \nuses and put people selectively out of business.\n  The land use and water balance that had been established over the \npast one and a half centuries would then be completely turned on its \near. The impact would immediately be felt by family farms and ranches \nthat would lose productivity, jobs, homes, and wildlife. Migrating \nbirds would lose their habitat.\n  Don't let anyone kid you that ranches and farms are not habitat for \nwildlife. Private ranches and farms in the West are some of the most \nproductive and vibrant wildlife habitat you will ever find. Every time \nwe put a ranch out of business in Wyoming it turns into rich \nranchettes, little 40-acre tracts. The people are so crowded together. \nForty acres may seem to be a lot in the rest of the country, but for \nwildlife that is not a lot of room. It is not even a lot of room for \npeople in our State. We would lose critical wildlife habitat. They \nwould be overrun by people.\n  In addition, many streams in the West are currently overallocated \nwith junior and senior water rights. Individuals with junior water \nrights would lose complete access to water if the Federal Government \nheld senior water rights. Water delivery schedules would be upset; some \nareas could get flooded while others would come up dry at critical \ntimes. And just in case you do not believe that Federal ownership of \nwater rights would have such a devastating impact, I will point out \nagain the travesty that occurred in Oregon and California's Klamath \nBasin.\n\n  Farmers, whose rights to the water were established by Federal \nstatute, had them taken away from them through a policy that the \nNational Academy of Sciences reports was based on speculation. It was \nnot based on science. It was not based on good policy. It was not based \non practicality. I guess it was based on bad politics.\n  As I said at the beginning of my statement, water is extremely \nimportant to the future of the West and to Wyoming. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment offered by my colleague, the water \nattorney from Idaho, and to leave in place the conservation program as \ncurrently administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  If we were to implement section 215 as it now stands, it would have a \ndevastating impact on all the downstream water users, and it would \npreempt the balance carefully established in State water law. It would \ndo so to satisfy a policy that not even the National Academy of \nSciences claims is supported with adequate science.\n  I mentioned before there are fights between States. We just finished \na 25-year fight with the State of Nebraska. It had to do with how much \nwater we have to release from Wyoming into Nebraska. It is settled by a \nwater compact that has a few intricacies that resulted in 25 years of \nlegal battles. That particular compact would be upset, and most of the \nprotection that is built in there is for migrating whooping cranes. \nSometimes when we make an effort, we are not sure of the unintended \nconsequences.\n  Once again, I remind Members what Mark Twain said: In the West, \nwhiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over.\n  We prefer to be fighting between States than fighting with an unfair \nFederal Government. Please help eliminate this unfair section.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I have been listening for the last good \nnumber of minutes as my colleague from Wyoming gave what was not only \nan eloquent but true and most entertaining explanation about the \nvalidity of the Crapo amendment and why this Senate should pass it.\n  There is no question in my mind or any westerner who lives in the \nhigh desert States of the Great Basin, all the way to the Mississippi \nRiver, of the criticality of water and why States over long periods of \ntime have been very cautious in not only its allocation but its \nrelationship to the human species. I hope the explanation of the \nSenator from Wyoming serves us all well as we consider this amendment.\n  It appears there is no one else in the Chamber at this moment to \ndebate the Crapo amendment, so I ask unanimous consent it be set aside \nfor the purpose of offering another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2835 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2835 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1022. STUDY OF PROPOSAL TO PROHIBIT PACKERS FROM OWNING, \n                   FEEDING, OR CONTROLLING LIVESTOCK.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 270 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\n     Secretary of Agriculture shall complete a study to determine \n     the impact that prohibiting packers described in subsection \n     (b) from owning, feeding, or controlling livestock intended \n     for slaughter more than 14 days prior to slaughter would have \n     on--\n       (1) livestock producers that market under contract, grid, \n     basis contract, or forward contract;\n       (2) rural communities and employees of commercial feedlots \n     associated with a packer;\n       (3) private or cooperative joint ventures in packing \n     facilities:\n       (4) livestock producers that market feeder livestock to \n     feedlots owned or controlled by packers:\n       (5) the market price for livestock (both cash and future \n     prices);\n       (6) the ability of livestock producers to obtain credit \n     from commercial sources:\n       (7) specialized programs for marketing specific cuts of \n     meat:\n       (8) the ability of the United States to compete in \n     international livestock markets; and\n       (9) future investment decisions by packers and the \n     potential location of new livestock packing operations.\n       (b) Packers.--The packers referred to in subsection (a) are \n     packers that slaughter more than 2 percent of the slaughter \n     of a particular type of livestock slaughtered in the United \n     States in any year.\n       (c) Consideration.--In conducting the study under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Agriculture shall--\n       (1) consider the legal conditions that have existed in the \n     past regarding the feeding by packers of livestock intended \n     for slaughter; and\n       (2) determine the impact of those legal conditions.\n       (d) Effectiveness of Other Provision.--The section entitled \n     ``PROHIBITION ON PACKERS OWNING, FEEDING, OR CONTROLLING \n     LIVESTOCK'', amending section 202 of the Packers and \n     Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 192), shall have no effect.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, as we debated the farm bill before the \nChristmas recess, I voted to support an amendment offered by Senator \nGrassley, Senator Johnson, and Senator Wellstone to ban packer \nownership of livestock. Since that amendment passed, I and other \nSenators have had serious discussions, along with the livestock \nindustry and the packing industry, as to what this amendment meant and \nwhat it will mean if it becomes law out in the marketplace.\n  As a result of that, I am offering an amendment tonight that would, \nin essence, set this provision aside. I am talking about that provision \nof the section entitled ``the prohibition on packer ownership feeding \nor controlling livestock.'' That is an amendment to section 202 of the \nPackers and Stockyards Act.\n  It is clear to me and to many others that there are a great many \nquestions being asked at this moment about the scope of the language \nand its potential impact on the meatpacker and the livestock producer. \nIn fact, much has been written on both sides with respect to the legal \nand economic ramifications of the language.\n  This fact lends greater credence to my suggestion in this amendment \nthat we approach a complete study by USDA of the intent of this \nlanguage and what it would mean in these kinds of new owner \nrelationships.\n  Since the Senate approved the language in December, I am sure many \nhave heard from those in favor of and opposed to the language. Seldom \nhave I heard such impassioned opinions on any given issue. Indeed, the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association and the National Pork Producers \nCouncil, both leading groups representing livestock producers, have \npolicies opposing the proposed ban. Still other groups support the ban.\n  Meanwhile, eight of the Nation's leading agricultural economists \nreleased a paper that raised nine serious concerns about the potential \nnegative consequences this ban would have. Among them is the damage \nthat would be done by revising strategic alliances between packers and \nproducers, taking us back to a time when meat was treated as a nameless \ncommodity rather than a distinct, branded consumer food product.\n  The U.S. meat and livestock industries also would be at a distinct \ndisadvantage, I believe, under the current language, to foreign beef \nand pork processing competitors with the production capacity and \nmarketing ability to work with livestock producers to form the very \nstrategic alliances, joint ventures, and ownership arrangements that \nthis language seeks to make illegal in the United States. The advances \nwe have made in foreign markets could be put at very serious risk.\n  These economists also point out that producers who enter into \nmarketing agreements with packers are better able to obtain financing \nfor their operations. I know of several instances of those \nrelationships where those very contracts allow the producer to gain the \nnecessary financing with his financial institution. Without these \nagreements, financing for growth and capital investment could clearly \nbe threatened. Lenders would not have the assurances that producers \nseeking loans had a market for their animals.\n  Congress would be taking a critical risk management tool away from \nproducers in certain instances. Is this what the ban's proponents hoped \nto accomplish for their livestock constituents? I really don't think \nthat was the intent. And I must tell you, Mr. President, when I \ninitially voted for the ban, that was clearly not my intent.\n  Still other legal analyses have offered a response to this economic \nanalysis. The very intensity of the ongoing debate over this issue \nraises the question: Why throw support to a measure punctuated by so \nmany question marks as this current language has?\n  Call me a pragmatist if you will, but when I hear such genuine \nconcern expressed by so many of my constituents, by leading economists, \nand by legal experts about language that was never vetted through a \ncommittee, a hearing not held on it, and legal experts not allowed to \ngive their opinion on it, it seems to me that we should not act as \nhastily as I believe we did, and as I know I did.\n  My concerns have been validated by the disparate positions taken by \nmany farm and livestock groups. I have learned that large economic \nimplications may exist for several States, including that of my \ncolleague, Senator Johnson, from South Dakota. Reportedly at stake are \nabout 3,000 jobs in a South Dakota packing plant, and 4,000 jobs \nassociated with the Premium Standard Farms of Missouri. I also know of \nsignificant consequences to the economy and jobs in the State of \nColorado. In this current time of such a sensitive economy in \nagriculture, I believe 10,000 more people without jobs is not a correct \npath to walk down.\n\n  In my State of Idaho, it could significantly impact the relationship \nbetween certain producers in my State and certain packers.\n  Given the questions I have asked about a ban on packer ownership of \nlivestock, I cannot lend my support to the Grassley-Johnson-Wellstone \nlanguage. I urge my colleagues to consider my amendment requiring a \nspeedy but thorough review of the potential impact of a ban on packer \nownership, control and feeding of livestock. The word ``ownership,'' \nand the word ``control'' are key to all of these relationships.\n  Under my amendment, the USDA would conduct a study in cooperation \nwith the livestock industry--all of those within the industry--to \ndetermine the impact that prohibiting packers from owning, feeding, and \ncontrolling livestock intended for slaughter more than 14 days prior to \nslaughter would have on producers, rural communities, private or \ncooperative joint ventures in packing facilities, marketing prices for \nlivestock, the ability of producers to obtain credit, specialized \nmarketing programs, the ability of packers to compete in foreign \nmarkets, and future investment decisions by packers about plant \nlocations. This study would be completed within 270 days of the date of \nthe enactment of this law. I think it is important that we move timely \nto this. It is not my intent to stall it. It is my intent to get clear \nanswers for all of us and for all of those associated with this issue \nin the livestock industry.\n  I have visited with Senator Grassley. We have been working \ncooperatively to get language that is better understood and that we \nbelieve would meet the test of the court. Senator Grassley is working \nwith the Farm Bureau at this moment to do so. That amendment might well \nbe available tomorrow or early next week, and I will take a look at it \nto see whether it fits my concerns and the concerns of a variety of \nother interests and relationships as they relate to the new dynamics of \nthe livestock industry.\n  I am certainly willing to give Senator Grassley and Senator Johnson \nand others the benefit of the doubt if that language can be arrived at. \nBut if it can't be--and let me tell you, legal\n\n[[Page S478]]\n\nlanguage is left to the beholder and the interpreter at the time--it is \nclear that a test needs to be run. This Senate deserves a clear \ndetermination or interpretation of what all of this means. That is \nexactly the intent of the amendment that I offer this evening.\n  Let us act on this important issue with the foresight that a thorough \nreview can offer rather than to seek to undo damage apparent in the \nglaring light of hindsight. Literally, we could destroy thousands of \ncontractual relationships. We could even impact markets and future \nmarkets if this language is not clear and clearly understood in the law \nitself. Lawsuits, court orders, interpretations of or arbitrary \ndecisions made as a result of language that is not clearly understood \nis not what this Senate should be about in the crafting of good farm \npolicy for the livestock industry.\n  That is the intent of my amendment. I hope my colleagues will read \nit, understand it, and I ask their support.\n  Mr. President, I see the chairman of the Agriculture Committee is in \nthe Chamber at this moment. With that consideration, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this legislation. I commend \nSenator Harkin, Senator Lugar and all our colleagues on the Agriculture \nCommittee for their hard work on it and I welcome the opportunity to \ndiscuss its important provisions to deal more effectively with the \nchallenge of nutrition and hunger in our society.\n  It is long past the time for Congress to end the gap in the nation's \nnutrition safety net. Hunger is a silent crisis affecting families \nacross America today. No corner of our land is immune from this crisis.\n  Thirty one million Americans, including twelve million children, \nsuffered from hunger last year. Over seventeen million Americans \nparticipated in the food stamp program but four out of ten of those who \nare eligible did not receive benefits. Last year, 23 million Americans, \nincluding 9 million children, sought emergency food relief through \nAmerica's Second Harvest--an increase of more than 2 million and that \nincrease took place during a time of unprecedented economic prosperity \nin the nation.\n  The average food stamp benefit is 81 cents a meal and it should be \navailable to everyone who truly needs it. The need for action is \nespecially urgent in this current serious downturn in the economy.\n  Too many individuals and families in America have trouble putting \nfood on the table. Their plight is all too clear in the stories of real \npeople:\n  A mother in Springfield, MA, asked, ``Should my kids sit in the dark \nor should they go hungry? One of my kids has multiple handicaps, so I \nhave to pay the utility bills to have heat and light. But, then we have \nno food.''\n  Karen Norman, a mother in Worcester, MA, explained, ``I used to \ndonate food to the food pantry. I always thought, `There's someone out \nthere who needs it.' Now all I have left is pictures of when I had a \nvery nice life. Now I make brunch because I don't have enough to give \nmy kids breakfast and lunch. When I leave the kitchen I can hear my \nfive-year-old say to my eight-year-old, `How come we can't have \nbreakfast and lunch?' and my eight-year-old says, `We have to stretch \nout the food.' Then at night she'll cry, `I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm \nsorry, but I'm hungry.' ''\n  Their plight is unacceptable, but it is all too consistent with the \nnational data collected in reports by the Greater Boston Food Bank, the \nFood Bank of Western Massachusetts, and America's Second Harvest.\n  Nationwide, participation in the Food Stamp Program has declined by \n34 percent since 1996 four times faster than the decline in the poverty \nrate. This means that over 2 million fewer people who live in poverty \nare obtaining food stamps today. Over a quarter of the reduction in \nfood stamp participation between 1994 and 1998 resulted from welfare \nreform and its elimination of food stamp eligibility for legal \nimmigrants which made them ineligible for food stamps and discouraged \ntheir U.S. citizen children from obtaining food stamps.\n  The results are predictable. The Department of Agriculture has \ndetermined that 5 million adults and 2.7 million children live in \nhouseholds that experienced hunger last year. Women and children are \ndisproportionately hurt. Last year, over half of all food stamp \nparticipants were children. Sixty-eight percent of the children were of \nschool age and 70 percent of adult participants were women. The most \nvulnerable are recent immigrants, children, and the elderly, and they \nare the ones who face the greatest difficulty.\n  The nutrition provisions in this bill are a significant step to \nreduce hunger in America. It restores food stamp benefits for all legal \nimmigrant children and persons with disabilities. It is clear that the \npeople now most in need of nutritional assistance are immigrants who \nentered the United States legally. For the first thirty years of the \nFood Stamp Program, legal immigrants were eligible for food stamps. It \nwas unfair for Congress to exclude them in 1996 and it is time for us \nto close this unconscionable gap.\n  While hunger and malnutrition are serious problems for people of all \nages, their effects are particularly damaging to children. Hungry and \nundernourished children are more likely to become anemic and to suffer \nfrom allergies, asthma, infections, and other health problems. They are \nalso more likely to have behavioral problems and difficulty in \nlearning. When children arrive at school hungry, they cannot learn. If \nchildren are hungry, our investments in education and early learning \nwill not have the full positive impact that they should.\n  The nutrition title of this bill includes a number of other important \npolicy provisions, including changes in the Food Stamp Program to \nimprove access and simplify administration. These reforms are vital to \nensure that low income families receive the nutrition assistance they \nneed. Excessive requirements for reporting income, counting assets, \ncalculating expenses for deductions, and determining on-going \neligibility can be an overwhelming burden for families who lack \ntransportation or child care, or who have inflexible work schedules. \nThese requirements often make it difficult or impossible for low income \nfamilies to participate. Given current economic conditions, an \neffective and efficient Food Stamp Program is now more important than \never.\n  The bill also provides states more options for helping families make \nthe transition from welfare to work. Current food stamp law allows a 3-\nmonth state option for a transitional food stamp benefit. This bill \nreflects Medicaid's six-month Medicaid transitional benefit for food \nstamps. It simplifies state record keeping, increases state \nflexibility, and helps welfare families make the transition to work.\n  The bill ends the child penalty under current food stamp law. Just as \nthe marriage penalty in our tax code unfairly penalizes some couples, \nthe existing food stamp law unfairly limits nutritional assistance for \nmany families with children. The bill corrects this problem by indexing \nthe food stamp standard deduction to family size, so that every family \nin deep poverty will receive the maximum current food stamp benefit, \nregardless of family size.\n  The bill helps single parents struggling to make ends meet. It \nensures that the food stamp law treats child support payments like \nincome, by disregarding 20 percent of these payments when calculating \nbenefits. This measure is consistent with last year's overwhelming \napproval of a plan by the House of Representatives to encourage states \nto see that child support actually benefits the children in low-income \nfamilies. Parents who know that their children will directly benefit if \nthey pay child support are more likely to pay the support and stay \ninvolved in their children's lives.\n  In addition, this bill improves access to food stamp information, \nhelping to see that families are aware of the help available. Less than \none-third of the people who seek emergency hunger relief are currently \nreceiving food stamps\n\n[[Page S479]]\n\neven though three-fourths are eligible for the relief. This bill will \nhelp rural families apply for food stamps online or by telephone. It \neliminates the need to travel to food stamp offices. In addition, the \nbill also supports stronger public-private partnerships to distribute \ninformation about nutrition assistance programs.\n  Finally, the bill increases federal support for emergency food \nprograms, which have had sharp increases in requests for help in the \npast year. Many food banks find themselves unable to meet the heavy new \ndemands. America's Second Harvest reports that 23.3 million people--\nequal to the combined population of the 10 largest U.S. cities--\nreceived emergency hunger relief last year--two million more than in \n1997. One-in-five local charitable agencies were already facing \nproblems that threatened their ability to serve hungry people in their \ncommunities--before the current economic crisis.\n  For all of these reasons, it is critical that we maintain the $6.2 \nbillion funding level for the nutrition title of this bill. This amount \nis urgently needed and it must be part of the final bill. The policy \nchanges that will be accomplished will make an enormous difference in \nthe lives of many families. Fewer children will go to bed hungry and \narrive at school hungry and unfed.\n  The current downturn in the economy means that even more families, \nincluding farm families, are facing the impossible choice between \nfeeding their children and paying the rent, a choice no person should \nhave to make. We have the resources to make the modest investment that \nis necessary. Once again, I commend Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar \nfor their skillful work and I urge my colleagues to support the needed \nfunding levels for nutrition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S479-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it would appear that after more than a \ndecade of discussions about campaign finance reform, the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate may be nearer an accord on a historic \nchange of how Federal elections are conducted in the United States. It \nis none too soon. Confidence in our political process has been \nundermined, the integrity of the Congress itself has been questioned, \nand the system is badly in need of repair.\n  We are very indebted to a number of people in this institution and \ndifferent institutions around the country, but in a strange irony, at a \nstroke before midnight, one of the elements that has been driving \nreform is undermining a critical component of the change.\n  Much of what America knows about the abuses of campaign reform has \ncome through the media. Across the Congress today, the Broadcasters \nAssociation, led by scores of lobbyists representing millions of \ndollars of donations of the very type and scale that we seek to \ncontrol, is undermining the bill.\n  Campaign finance reform, as passed by this Senate and the legislation \npending in the House, includes a critical component for controlling and \nreducing the cost of television advertising.\n  The amendment, widely accepted in both Houses of Congress, is based \non the proposition that controlling the amount of money raised must be \nmet by an ability to control the amount of money spent. Controlling \ncampaign fundraising without helping with the cost of campaigns will \nsimply result in a diminished national political debate. Candidates \nwill raise less money, and if the cost of advertising remains as high, \nwe will lose the competitive debate, the exchange of ideas so vital to \nour democracy.\n  As any candidate for Federal office in the United States is painfully \naware, the cost of campaigns is the cost of television advertising. \nEighty-five percent of the cost of a Senate campaign goes to the \ntelevision networks.\n  Under the amendment as passed by this institution, the networks would \nbe required to sell time at the lowest unit rate available; that is, \nwhatever rate they have set for their customers and sold at their \nlowest cost they must make available to a candidate for Federal office.\n  This provision was in previous Federal law since 1971, but in 1990 an \nFCC audit found that 80 percent of the stations had failed to give the \nlowest rate available. During the 2000 elections, a typical candidate \nhad 65 percent of their advertising sold at above that lowest rate.\n  With my amendment now placed in the McCain-Feingold bill, passed by \nthis Senate by a 69-to-31 vote on a bipartisan basis, that provision is \nnow strengthened. It becomes mandatory, and it has the best chance of \ncontrolling these costs.\n  The chart on my left shows the scale of the problem: The percentage \nof ads actually sold at the lowest unit rate in the fall of 2000. \nCongress believed it made this a requirement before, but it has been \nevaded in the majority of cases.\n  Let's look at a few examples: Minneapolis, WCCO, 95 percent of the \nads sold were not at the lowest rate; Detroit, WXYZ, 88 percent were \nnot sold at the lowest rate. In my own market in northern New Jersey, \nWNBC New York, 78 percent were not sold at the lowest rate.\n  In the year 2000, the buying of these television ads cost candidates \n$1 billion. This chart indicates as well the deluge of these ads, the \namount of them now being placed on television.\n  Very simply, if we cannot hold in the McCain-Feingold bill and the \nShays-Meehan bill in the House this element of controlling cost, this \nvital compromise that is campaign finance reform will be broken. It \nmust be raising and it must be spending, and I ask the television \nnetworks to forgo these excess profits on the Federal airways, licensed \nby the Federal Government for the public good. Be part of reform. Don't \nundermine the reform. Let's change the system now for everybody's \nbenefit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S479-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S479-S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SENATOR HERB KOHL\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute on the \noccasion of the birthday of one of our colleagues in the Senate, that \nof Senator Herb Kohl, Senior Senator from the State of Wisconsin.\n  I have known Senator Kohl for many years, since he first came to the \nSenate in 1989, and over that period of time, my respect and admiration \nfor Senator Kohl has grown as I have watched him learn the role of a \nlegislator and master the methods and the means of becoming a fine \nUnited States Senator.\n  Senator Kohl is hard-working, tenacious, and will fight to the end \nfor the interests of this institution and those of his state. A few \nyears ago when the Senate was debating legislation regarding the dairy \nindustry, I remarked that Senator Kohl was the Stonewall Jackson of \nWisconsin, standing firm for the interests of the dairy farmers in his \nstate. When it comes to fighting for his state, or other issues of \nimportance to him, such as measures to help and protect our nation's \nchildren, there is no one to outshine Senator Kohl in his dedication \nfor the values he holds dear. That is one of the distinguishing \ncharacteristics of a good Senator.\n  But Herb Kohl is more than just a fine United States Senator, he is a \ngood and decent man. His hallmark is honest modesty, a man of few \nwords, but words of great meaning and words that deserve being heard. \nHe is consistently kind to the people who work around him, especially \nhis staff, who will follow him faithfully through thick and thin. His \nword is his bond, and to this Senator, there is no greater tribute than \nrecognition of that fact.\n  Senator Kohl represents what is best about Senators and about \nAmericans generally. He is a self-made man whose parents came to this \ncountry during the last century without an ability to speak the English \nlanguage. From those humble beginnings, they and their son and other \nfamily members worked to develop a family grocery business in \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, that became successful and grew to have national \nrecognition. If you drive around\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\nthe Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, you will notice Kohl stores, \nand they are evidence of the contribution Senator Kohl and his family \nhave made to the commercial strength of this country.\n  The types of success that Senator Kohl has known have been the result \nof constant effort, a solid education in the Wisconsin public schools, \nand an understanding that hard work, honesty, intellectual clarity, and \ndedication to strong values are the key components to a successful \ncareer in either the business world or public service.\n  So, I want to honor Senator Kohl on this special day and pay him the \nrecognition that he is due for all his work on behalf of the people of \nWisconsin and all who serve here in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S480-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. DAVID SATCHER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a public \nservant who will soon complete his tenure as the 16th Surgeon General \nof the United States. Dr. David Satcher has served this Nation with \ndistinction and performed the duties of the position of Surgeon General \nin an exemplary manner.\n  Dr. Satcher was born in Anniston, AL on March 2, 1941. He and his \nwife Nola have raised four children. Dr. Satcher graduated from \nMorehouse College in Atlanta in 1963 and received his M.D. and Ph.D. \nfrom Case Western Reserve University in 1970. He has completed numerous \nfellowships and holds many honorary degrees and distinguished honors. \nHe has taught students, chaired Departments, and served as President of \nthe Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. As a public \nservant, he served as the Director for the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention and Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and \nDisease Registry before assuming his current position as Surgeon \nGeneral. During the period February 1998 through January 2001, Dr. \nSatcher simultaneously served as Assistant Secretary for Health and \nSurgeon General of the United States.\n  Dr. Satcher is a learned, well-educated man of great accomplishment. \nYet, in spite of his many degrees and awards, he set a simple goal of \nwanting to be a Surgeon General remembered for listening to the \nAmerican people. He not only listened to those whose voices could be \nheard, but extended his reach to those who for far too long have \nsuffered silently, those in our nation suffering with mental illness.\n  I first became acquainted with Dr. Satcher during his confirmation. I \nremember asking him to consider addressing the issue of suicide and its \nimpact on the Nation. I was concerned about what we as a nation could \ndo in an effort to prevent the nearly 30,000 lives lost annually to \nsuicide. As Surgeon General, Dr. Satcher convened a consensus \nconference on suicide in Reno, Nevada in 1998. He brought together \nscientists, clinicians, survivors, advocates and state mental health \nstaff to examine the science of suicide prevention, that is what we \nknew and what we didn't know, and from this published the Surgeon \nGeneral's Call to Action for Suicide Prevention. His next step was to \ndevelop a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. In May 2001 this \nstrategy to guide our national suicide prevention efforts was \npublished. As we speak today, states, communities, tribes, and many \nothers are coming together to discuss ways in which we can prevent \nsuicide in America.\n  Dr. Satcher demonstrated time and time again his ability to engage \nthe public and the private sectors to come together as we examined \nhealth problems facing our nation and sought solutions on how to \naddress them. In the suicide prevention effort, Congress called for the \ndevelopment of a national strategy to guide our national response. Dr. \nSatcher embraced this challenge, provided the necessary leadership and \nvision to bring it about, and recognized from the outset that \ngovernment alone could not provide the complete background nor could \nthey singularly define the solution. He called upon the non-profit \ncommunity, experts in research, clinical practitioners, and just as \nimportantly, listened to the survivors who freely shared their \nexperiences to ensure that our national effort was inclusive of all \nperspectives. The national problem of suicide warranted a comprehensive \nsolution and, thanks to Dr. Satcher's leadership, the components \nconsidered were from all communities who had a perspective which needed \nto be heard.\n  I for one am truly grateful for the service of Dr. David Satcher. I \ncare deeply about the issue of suicide in America for a number of \nreasons. Unfortunately, Nevada has the highest suicide rate in the \nnation. In fact, the top ten states for suicide are all west of the \nMississippi. I believe we can make a difference by studying the facts \nand developing evidenced based programs to prevent the tragic loss of \nlife due to suicide. I also lost my father to suicide many years ago. \nI've said many times before that back then we did not know as much \nabout depression and treatment as we do now. Today, science and \nresearch have made incredible advances and through medication and \ncounseling help is available and effective treatments can and do make a \ndifference.\n  We have an obligation to help those suffering from mental illness or \nsubstance abuse to ensure they receive the treatment that can afford \nthem a quality of life they deserve. I believe Dr. Satcher has made an \nincredible difference and helped countless individuals through his work \nas Surgeon General. We still have a long way to go in reducing stigma \nand affording access to mental health treatment in this nation, but we \nare further along today as a result of the leadership provided by Dr. \nSatcher.\n  In closing, I wish to thank Dr. Satcher for his courageous work and \ndedicated public service. I am particularly grateful for his efforts in \nraising awareness and educating Americans about mental illness and \nsuicide in America. We are a better nation as a result of his service \nas Surgeon General. He will be remembered by this Senator as the \nSurgeon General who listened to the American people. In my judgement, \nhe not only listened, but he acted as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S480-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 6, 1997 \nin Tyler, TX. Two men attacked another man who the assailants perceived \nto be gay. The attackers, Billy Glenn Adams, 30, and James Dean \nDickerson, 33, were charged with aggravated assault in connection with \nthe incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S480-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S480-S481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, every February our nation pauses to \nrecognize the tremendous contributions of African-Americans to the \nhistory of our nation. In 1926, Dr. Carter G. Woodson established Negro \nHistory Week because he saw that most of the contributions African-\nAmericans had made to American culture and industry were being ignored \nby historians.\n  We have come a long way since 1926. More and more of our history \nbooks acknowledge the contributions of African-Americans. Our schools \nhave made it part of their curriculum. Libraries and museums create \nexhibits. Television executives highlight the contributions of African-\nAmerican actors and screenwriters and our celebration of Black history \nhas been expanded to an entire month. But we still have a long way to \ngo.\n  We need Black History Month because people may not be aware of \nAfrican-Americans who have added to the richness and greatness of our \ncountry. It is appropriate that as we stand in our nation's Capitol, \nwhich was built by the back-breaking labor of free and slave African-\nAmericans, we talk about the contributions African-Americans\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\nhave made to this country's history, and to its future.\n  Any Missourian can name George Washington Carver's most famous \ninvention, peanut butter, but few realize the role Carver played in the \nagricultural revolution that went on in the South in the early 1900s--\nCarver's work to wean the South from its single-crop cultivation of \ncotton. His development of commercial uses for alternate crops like \npeanuts and sweet potatoes helped modernize Southern agriculture, \npaving the way for a better life for the entire South.\n  Scott Joplin led a revolution of a different kind. While living in \nSedalia, Missouri he created a blend of classical and folk music that \ntook America by storm. Ragtime, as his style came to be called, has \nbecome America's unique contribution to classical music and a prelude \nto jazz.\n  In literature, Missourians are proud of the heritage of Langston \nHughes of Joplin, MO. A poet of international renown, Hughes' poetry \nhelped to create the Harlem Renaissance, the artistic and cultural \nawakening among African-Americans in the 1920's and early 1930's. His \nfirst two books of poetry daringly fused jazz and blues with \ntraditional verse. Also an advocate for children, Hughes wrote over a \ndozen still popular children's books on jazz, Africa and the West \nIndies.\n  Another Missourian became famous not only as an inventor but also as \nthe most outstanding jockey of his time. Tom Bass, of Mexico, MO, \ntrained some of the finest race and show horses of his day. At the peak \nof his career he rode in the Inauguration of President Grover Cleveland \nand gave a command performance before Queen Victoria. In addition to \nbeing a famous jockey, he invented the ``Bass bit'' which is still used \ntoday.\n  Missouri has borne some notable civil rights leaders as well. Perhaps \nthe most prominent of them is Roy Wilkins, who served as executive \ndirector of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople from 1955-1977. Appointed during the most turbulent era in the \ncivil rights movement, Wilkins kept the NAACP on the path of \nnonviolence and rejected racism in all forms. His leadership and \ndevotion to the principle of nonviolence earned him the reputation of a \nsenior statesman in the civil rights movement.\n  All of these great Missourians, and others history may have \nforgotten, struggled against bigotry and violence, but all showed--\nthrough their natural talents--that racism was not just wrong, but un-\nAmerican. So it is fitting that we take this month to learn more about \nthe history of African-Americans in this country, to ensure that these \nAmericans are recognized, and to celebrate their contributions to our \ngreat nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S481-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS--NFL CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the Robert Kraft Family, Coach Bill Belichick and the New \nEngland Patriots team on their achievement as victors of Super Bowl \nXXXVI.\n  The people of New Hampshire and the entire New England region are \nproud of the exemplary accomplishments of the Patriots organization. \nThe talented players and coaches of the team have demonstrated that \nhard work, perseverance and unity are the foundation of success.\n  I commend the New England Patriots for the benchmark that they have \ncreated for all Americans who seek to achieve the highest of standards \nin their lives.

Mr. President, in 1994, the Congress passed the Brady Law, \nwhich requires Federal Firearm Licensees to perform criminal background \nchecks on gun buyers. However, a loophole in this law allows unlicenced \nprivate gun sellers to sell firearms at gun shows without conducting a \nbackground check.\n  In April of last year, Senator Reed introduced the Gun Show \nBackground Check Act which would close this loophole in the law. The \nReed bill, which is supported by the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, extends the Brady Bill background check requirement \nto all sellers of firearms at gun shows. I cosponsored that bill \nbecause I believe it is critical that we do all we can to prevent guns \nfrom getting into the hands of criminals and terrorists. A recent \nreport from Americans for Gun Safety demonstrates how successful the \nBrady law has been in this regard and why it is important to extend its \nprovisions to firearms sales at gun shows.\n  According to Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers cited in the AGS \nreport, in 2000 alone, Brady bill background checks blocked more than \n153,000 felons and other illegal firearms purchasers from buying a gun. \nIn addition, these checks were typically conducted without placing \nunreasonable burdens on gun buyers. According to the study, 72 percent \nof background checks were completed within minutes and 95 percent were \ncompleted within two hours. The study provides yet further evidence in \nsupport of common sense legislation to close the gun show loophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S481-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S481-S482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO WORKERS\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in past recessions Congress has been quick \nto extend benefits for the unemployed. Every recession over the past \nthirty years resulted in a extension of unemployment benefits. Helping \nunemployed workers has never been a partisan issue, both Democrats and \nRepublicans have worked to help unemployed workers in times of economic \ndifficulty. During the recession of the early 1990's we extended a \ntotal of 33 weeks of additional benefits. Current data shows this \nrecession started last March, and we are only now taking steps to \nfinally extend unemployment benefits. We have waited too long, but I am \nglad the day for action has come at last. I hope the other body will be \nable to quickly pass this legislation so that this delayed assistance \nwill not be delayed any longer.\n  While I am relieved the Senate has acted, I was disappointed we were \nnot able to do more for workers. Helping people maintain health \ncoverage while out of work would have gone a long way to making working \nfamilies feel more secure. Covering part-time workers and the newly \nhired, and providing the States with the necessary funds to make those \nreforms, also would have helped this country on the road to economic \nrecovery.\n  While some of my colleagues believe that what we have done today will \nhave little or no positive effect on the economy, I disagree. Extending \nbenefits puts money into the hands of people who really need it, and \npeople who will be forced to spend it. The money we send out will be \nspent on groceries,\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\nclothes, and mortgages. It will meet the day-to-day needs of working \nfamilies, and it will be spent right in their communities. It will spur \nlocal economies and prevent the recession from deepening.\n  An unemployment check is always second best to a paycheck. The \n142,000 workers in Wisconsin who have been forced to file for benefits \nwant a job, they want to work, they want to contribute to the economy \nand pay taxes. Unemployment insurance is meant to help hard working \npeople through difficult times. It is an insurance plan that workers \nand employers contribute to for emergencies just like today. American \nworkers have paid for these benefits, they have earned them, and they \ndeserve this extension.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S482-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RESTORING TEA 21 FUNDING LEVELS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the past 6 months Congress has been \ndiscussing the best ways to stimulate the economy. Even though we are \nno longer working on an economic stimulus bill, we face a real crisis \nthat will negatively affect our economy. We face unprecedented losses \nto our highway program. Every state will lose money.\n  If we want to create true stimulus and maintain jobs for our citizens \nthen there is an easy solution. Highways. For every $1 billion dollars \nthat goes into the highway program, 42,000 jobs are created. In an \nattempt to address unemployment concerns and immediate stimulus to the \ncountry's economy, I, along with others on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, propose an increase in obligation authority for the \nfiscal year 2003. This would restore the authorized levels for that \nfiscal year. It doesn't get us all the way there, but it's a start.\n  This is about jobs. Skilled and unskilled jobs in highway \nconstruction are well-paid. These jobs would provide employment \nopportunities for workers who have lost manufacturing jobs, with \nminimal training requirements. In addition current jobs will not be \nlost in many of the supplier and heavy equipment manufacturing \nindustries. This is money that can be spent quickly by state DOTs. Fast \nspending means fast jobs. Both state DOTs and contractors confirm that \nmoney can be spent and jobs maintained within the first 6 months. \nWithout restoring TEA 21 levels, over 360,000 jobs will be lost.\n  There is $20.5 billion in the Highway Trust Fund. We can afford at \nleast the $4.369 billion from that balance to be distributed over the \nnext year. In fact, we can't afford not to.\n  This extra $4.369 billion begins to take care of this huge problem \nthat we face. It is a problem that we addressed the other day in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee hearing on TEA 21 \nreauthorization. We are looking at a highway program that is $9 billion \nlower for FY 2003 than it was in FY 2002. For my state of Montana that \nmeans a $79 million loss to our highway program. And in Montana, \nhighways are our lifeblood. We need the highways and we need the jobs \ncreated from new highway funding. Also, we can't afford to lose any \nhighway-related jobs because of this under funding.\n  We passed a six year highway bill for a reason. So states knew how \nmuch was coming in from year to year. My State Department of \nTransportation is counting on at least the TEA 21 level.\n  Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta was at that hearing I just \nmentioned. And when I pressed him about this extra obligation authority \nfor highways, his response was that highway money is good economic \nstimulus.\n  In conclusion, I propose that we give States at least what they were \nexpecting for highway projects in fiscal year 2003. They say there is \nno such thing as an easy fix, but let me tell you--this idea comes as \nclose as any.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S482-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S482-S485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE FEDERAL REFORMULATED FUELS ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

The first is a draft report prepared by PACE \n     Consultants, under contract with the Environmental Protection \n     Agency. This report is entitled, Economic Analysis of U.S. \n     MTBE Production Under the MTBE Ban.\n       The second document is a draft EPA staff analysis entitled, \n     ``Supply Analysis of S. 950--The Federal Reformulated Fuels \n     Act of 2001.'' This analysis, which was prepared in October \n     2001 by EPA staff who have technical expertise in matters \n     relating to motor vehicle fuels, has never been released and \n     should not be construed to be Administration policy. The \n     analysis draws extensively from the findings of the above-\n     mentioned PACE report.\n       As you know, the issue of MTBE is related to a current \n     Clean Air Act provision that requires the use of oxygenates \n     in reformulated gasoline. It is my understanding that \n     Congress designed this provision to promote the use of \n     renewable fuels, enhance energy security, support the \n     agricultural economy, and improve the environment. EPA \n     welcomes the opportunity to work with the Congress to further \n     these important goals.\n       Again, thank you for writing.

The impact of each \n     of these provisions is discussed below. The evaluation of the \n     financial support for the conversion of merchant MTBE plants \n     to the production of other gasoline blendstocks is combined \n     with that of the ban on MTBE use.\n\n\n                         a. nationwide mtbe ban\n\n       Due to the attention that has been placed on the MTBE issue \n     over the last several years, there have been a number of \n     different MTBE ban scenarios that have been put forward and a \n     considerable amount of analysis already performed for at \n     least some scenarios. Differences in how the bans would be \n     implemented, however, can cause significant differences in \n     what impact they will have on the gasoline fuel supply. What \n     follows is a summary of a recent analysis EPA conducted for a \n     nationwide ban on MTBE use which mirrors relatively closely \n     the MTBE ban provisions in S. 950.\n       Table A-1 shows the sources of the MTBE used in U.S. \n     gasoline and estimated 2000 production volumes (from Pace \n     Consultants). The total MTBE volume of 263,000 bbl/day \n     represents approximately 3.1% of U.S. gasoline consumption. \n     However, MTBE contains only about 80% of the energy density \n     of gasoline. Consequently, on a energy equivalent basis this \n     MTBE volume represents approximately 2.5% of total U.S. \n     gasoline consumption.\n\n  TABLE A-1.--YEAR 2000 PRODUCTION VOLUME OF MTBE (BARRELS/DAY) IN THE\n                                  U.S.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Gasoline\n              Type of MTBE plant                  Physical    equivalent\n                                                   volume       volume\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCaptive refinery plants.......................       79,000       64,000\nPropylene Oxide based merchant plants.........       45,000       36,000\nEthylene based merchant plants................       21,000       17,000\nNatural gas liquids (NGL) based plants........       67,000       54,000\nImports (NGL based)...........................       51,000       41,000\n                                               -------------------------\n    Total.....................................      263,000      212,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In support of EPA's analysis of restrictions on the use of \n     MTBE, we hired Pace Consultants, a knowledgeable and \n     reputable firm, to conduct an analysis of the economics of \n     converting the different types of MTBE plants to produce \n     either alkylate or iso-octane instead of MTBE, versus the \n     plant completely shutting down.\n       MTBE plants react isobutylene with methanol to make MTBE. \n     MTBE plants fall into two broad categories: those which use \n     isobutylene which already exists or which can be produced at \n     very low cost from existing material, and those which have to \n     produce isobutylene at significant cost from other chemicals. \n     Captive or refinery based\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\n     MTBE plants and ethylene based MTBE plants fall into the \n     first category, as their isobutylene is being produced in the \n     process of making gasoline in the refinery or butadiene in \n     the chemical plant. Propylene oxide based MTBE plants produce \n     isobutylene from tertiary butyl alcohol, but do so using an \n     inexpensive chemical process. Thus, they are placed in this \n     first category, as well.\n       Domestic and overseas natural gas liquids (NGL) based MTBE \n     plants fall into the latter category. These plants produce \n     isobutylene via three processes from a mixture of normal \n     butane and isobutane obtained from natural gas processing.\n       If an MTBE plant converts to alkylate production, it \n     produces 80% more gasoline in terms of energy content than it \n     did when producing MTBE. The gain in energy comes from the \n     fact that isobutane is combined with this isobutylene in the \n     production of alkylate, versus the addition of methanol in \n     thr production of MTBE. Isobutane contains more energy than \n     methanol, so the product does as well.\n       If an MTBE plant converts to iso-octane production, it \n     produces 15% less gasoline equivalent volume than it did when \n     producing MTBE. Again, this assumes that the converted MTBE \n     plant would process the same amount of isobutylene as before. \n     The loss in energy comes from the fact that isobutylene is \n     reacted with itself to form iso-octane (i.e., no other \n     feedstock is combined with the isobutylene in the reaction). \n     Thus, the energy content of methanol is lost relative to MTBE \n     production.\n       Alkylate and iso-octane both contain no aromatics and have \n     relatively high octane (90-100) and low RVP, making them \n     attractive fuel blending components. The Pace study found \n     that it should be economic for the vast majority of MTBE \n     production plants to be converted to either iso-octane or \n     alkylate production if MTBE were banned. Below, we discuss \n     the likely fate of each type of MTBE plant, plus imports.\n       Pace projected that captive, refinery MTBE plants will \n     likely convert to either iso-octane or the isobutylene will \n     be used to produce alkylate in a refiner's existing \n     alkylation plant. Isobutylene had always been converted to \n     alkylate at refineries prior to a refiner's decision to \n     produce MTBE and this would be the preferred route if MTBE \n     were banned, due to the higher volume of gasoline produced \n     with alkylate versus iso-octane. However, if a refiner's \n     current alkylation unit did not have excess capacity or its \n     capacity could not be inexpensively increased, Pace concluded \n     that the MTBE unit would likely be converted to produce \n     iso-octane. Thus, as a lower limit for our analysis we \n     have presumed that all these MTBE units are converted to \n     produce iso-octane, and as an upper limit all the \n     isobutylene will be used to produce alkylate. However, in \n     no case should the MTBE production from these plants be \n     completely lost as the isobutylene is available at no cost \n     and has no other high value market.\n       Pace projected that propylene oxide based MTBE plants are \n     likely to convert to iso-octane production, due to the lower \n     capital cost involved. Like captive refinery plants, these \n     plants are unlikely to shut down, since the feedstock used to \n     produce MTBE (tertiary butyl alcohol) is produced as a by-\n     product from propylene oxide or ethylene production (i.e., it \n     is essentially free).\n       Pace projected that ethylene based MTBE plants are likely \n     to shutdown and send their isobutylene to refineries for \n     conversion to alkylate. Thus, while the MTBE plant itself is \n     shut down, the volume it produces is not lost. As a lower \n     limit, we projected that these ethylene based plants would \n     convert to iso-octane, like the propylene oxide based plants.\n       Pace projected that merchant, NGL based MTBE plants would \n     face the greatest challenge to stay in business. If they were \n     to stay in business, Pace projected that they would be more \n     likely to convert to alkylate than iso-octane production. \n     Historical alkylate price premiums over premium gasoline \n     would not support conversion to alkylate production. However, \n     in 2001 price premiums have been consistently higher. \n     Furthermore, under a complete MTBE ban, demand for clear, \n     high-octane blending components should increase and alkylate \n     price premiums should increase accordingly. This was in fact \n     the case in all refining studies of California under their \n     MTBE ban which showed significant flows of alkylate from the \n     Gulf Coast to California. Consequently, for this analysis of \n     a nationwide MTBE ban, due to the uncertainty, we have \n     projected in the worst case that all of these plants would \n     shut down or in the best case that all would convert to \n     alkylate production. Under the actual provisions in S. 950, \n     the best case is more likely to occur. This is due to the \n     $750 million it would provide to help convert merchant MTBE \n     plants. This subsidy should be sufficient to ensure that the \n     production capacity of these plants remains available.\n       Finally, Pace projects that most foreign natural gas based \n     MTBE plants are likely to convert to iso-octane production, \n     given their low feedstock costs. This was observed already \n     with an MTBE plant in Alberta, Canada, that recently \n     converted to producing iso-octane.\n       Table A-2 summarizes the results of this analysis. As can \n     be seen, we project that the net impact on supply from a \n     nationwide MTBE ban ranges from a loss of approximately \n     84,000 bb1/day to gain of approximately 91,000 bb1/day, or \n     roughly a gain or loss of approximately 1% of total \n     nationwide gasoline volume on an energy equivalent basis. \n     Given the $750 million in grants made available to help \n     convert merchant MTBE plants, we believe that the supply \n     impact is more likely to fall towards the upper end of \n     this range than the low end. The grants should be \n     sufficient to ensure that the production capacity of the \n     NGL-based MTBE plants remains in the gasoline supply.\n\n    TABLE A-2.--GASOLINE EQUIVALENT VOLUME WITH A NATIONWIDE MTBE BAN\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Current    Lower limit  Upper limit\n                                    production  of replaced  of replaced\n                                   volume (bbl/ volume (bbl/ volume (bbl/\n                                       day)         day)         day)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCaptive refinery plants..........       64,000       54,000      114,000\nPropylene Oxide based merchant          36,000       31,000       31,000\n plants..........................\nEthylene based merchant plants...       17,000       14,000       30,000\nMerchant (NGL) plants............       54,000            0       98,000\nImports (natural gas based)......       41,000       30,000       30,000\n                                  --------------------------------------\n    Total........................      212,000      128,000      303,000\nChange from Current..............  ...........     (84,000)       91,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       This analysis reflects only the changes in MTBE and \n     gasoline hydrocarbon volume. The changes in ethanol volume \n     that go along with this were not quantified in the Pace \n     analysis. Even without the RFG oxygen mandate, which S. 950 \n     allows states to opt out of, it is likely that a significant \n     amount of ethanol would be used to fulfill the RFG and mobile \n     source air toxics (MSAT) performance requirements. For \n     example, Mathpro, in refinery modeling performed for EPA, \n     projected that 50-65% of California gasoline would contain \n     ethanol if MTBE were banned and the RFG oxygen mandate were \n     waived.\n\n\n      b. rescinding the 1.0 psi rvp waiver for ethanol blended in \n                         conventional gasoline\n\n       Due to its hygroscopic nature it is not possible to ship \n     ethanol blends through the same common carrier fuel \n     distribution system with other petroleum products. \n     Consequently, ethanol is not blended at the refinery into \n     gasoline, but instead is ``splash blended'' at the terminal, \n     usually as it is loaded into tank trucks. When ethanol is \n     added to gasoline, it results in roughly a 1.0 psi RVP \n     increase in the vapor pressure of the final blend. It is \n     possible to produce a sub-RVP grade of gasoline for blending \n     with ethanol downstream to offset this RVP increase, and in \n     fact, that is what is done under the RFG program. \n     Furthermore, some refiners currently produce a sub-octane \n     grade of gasoline for downstream blending of conventional \n     gasoline with ethanol. However, requiring all gasoline \n     blendstock destined for ethanol blending to be distributed \n     separately would place an additional challenge for the \n     distribution system.\n       Rescinding the 1.0 psi RVP waiver for ethanol blending \n     would require a unique sub-RVP gasoline blendstock for \n     conventional gasoline. Unlike the MTBE ban discussed above, \n     EPA has not conducted studies recently that would quantify \n     the impact of this on overall gasoline supply. However, the \n     analysis is also much less complicated. Based on recent \n     analyses performed in support of our analysis of the boutique \n     fuels issue, we have determined that lowering the RVP of \n     gasoline by 1.0 psi RVP would require the removal of 1.5% of \n     the gasoline in the form of butane. For some refineries, this \n     would require the construction of a new butane-pentane \n     splitter. Since butane contains roughly 85% of the energy \n     content of typical gasoline, on an energy equivalent basis \n     this would represent a 1.3% reduction in the volume of \n     gasoline that is blended with ethanol.\n       While the amount of butane which needs to be removed from \n     gasoline increases with increased ethanol use, this impact is \n     overwhelmed by the additional volume of ethanol itself. \n     Ethanol is typically blended at a 10 volume percent level. \n     Ethanol contains 60% of the energy per gallon of gasoline. \n     Thus, adding 10 volume percent ethanol increases gasoline \n     equivalent volume by 6% while removing butane to compensate \n     for ethanol's RVP boost reduces the gasoline equivalent \n     volume by 1.3%, or just over a fifth of the gain from \n     ethanol. Therefore, the net gain from adding 10 volume \n     percent ethanol is an increase in gasoline equivalent volume \n     of 4.7%.\n       Ethanol-blended conventional gasoline currently represents \n     about 7% of total U.S. summertime gasoline consumption, or \n     about 640,000 barrels per day. Thus, about 8000 bbl/day \n     gasoline equivalent of butane would have to be removed from \n     this fuel to compensate for ethanol's RVP boost. However, \n     under a nationwide MTBE ban and with or without state opt \n     outs of the RFG oxygen mandate, ethanol use in both RFG and \n     conventional gasoline would likely increase over today's \n     level. Since the RFG performance standards do not grant \n     ethanol an RVP waiver, increased use of ethanol in either \n     fuel would require butane removal. The impact on conventional \n     gasoline, however, would be directly attributable to the \n     removal of the RVP waiver under S. 950. It is difficult to \n     predict precisely how much ethanol production in general \n     would increase. If for example, ethanol use were to double \n     over today's levels (nominally 100,000 bbl/day, or 60,000 \n     bbl/day gasoline equivalent), this could require the removal \n     of as much as 15,000 bbl/day of butane (13,000 bbl/day \n     gasoline equivalent). Thus, the total amount of butane \n     removed could be 22,000 bbl/day gasoline equivalent under \n     this example. However, this is still much lower than the \n     60,000 bbl/day gasoline equivalent of new gasoline supply \n     associated with the new ethanol production.\n\n[[Page S484]]\n\n             C. EXISTING AND ADDITIONAL AIR TOXICS CONTROL\n\n       It is difficult to quantify the impact on gasoline supply \n     of the existing MSAT standards plus the new air toxics \n     standards which are included in S. 950. The current MSAT \n     standards require refiners to maintain the toxics emission \n     performance of their 1998-2000 RFG and conventional \n     gasoline into the future. In the context of S950, this \n     means that as MTBE is removed from primarily RFG, refiners \n     producing RFG must maintain their previous toxics emission \n     performance.\n       In general, this historical performance has been well \n     beyond that required by the RFG regulations. Removing MTBE \n     increases toxics emissions from gasoline, even considering \n     the lower sulfur levels which will be required in the future \n     and lower olefin levels which should accompany the sulfur \n     reductions. Substituting alkylate and iso-octane for MTBE \n     helps, but may not be sufficient to maintain toxics \n     performance. Adding ethanol along with alkylate and iso-\n     octane should be sufficient for most refiners to compensate \n     for MTBE removal, once the Tier 2 sulfur standards take \n     effect.\n       Another possibility is that most refiners should be able to \n     shift some of their reformate (the gasoline blendstock \n     highest in aromatics and benzene) from RFG to conventional \n     gasoline. This would ease compliance with the MSAT standards \n     for their RFG. However, some refiners may still have to \n     reduce benzene or aromatic levels below current levels. Some \n     refiners are also more dependent on MTBE use than others.\n       Despite this uncertainty, any impact of the MSAT standards \n     are likely to affect RFG supply more than total gasoline \n     supply. Much less MTBE is used in conventional gasoline today \n     compared to RFG. The levels of sulfur and olefins in \n     conventional gasoline will also be dropping in the near \n     future. Thus, most refiners should find it relatively easy to \n     comply with the MSAT standards for their conventional \n     gasoline even with an MTBE ban. Refiners facing difficult \n     meeting their MSAT standards for RFG would not decrease total \n     gasoline production, but could shift some of their RFG \n     production to conventional gasoline. Thus, the relevant issue \n     with the current MSAT standards is their effect on RFG \n     supply, not total gasoline supply.\n       The new toxics performance standards in S. 950, as they \n     appear to be written, would be imposed in addition to the \n     current MSAT standards. As a result, refiners with cleaner \n     than average historic RFG would be constrained primarily by \n     the MSAT standards, while refiners with poorer than average \n     historic RFG toxics performance would be held to a new PADD \n     average toxics standard.\n       We have not analyzed the impact of a regional toxics \n     standard of this type, particularly in conjunction with the \n     MSAT standards. However, as was the case with the MSAT \n     standards, the impact of the regional toxics standards would \n     be to make it relatively more difficult to produce RFG than \n     conventional gasoline. Total gasoline supply would probably \n     be little affected, but RFG supply could be affected. More \n     analysis is needed before any quantitative estimates could be \n     made.\n\n\n                           d. overall impact\n\n       Due to the lack of available analysis to quantify the \n     impact of the new toxics emission requirements on gasoline \n     supply, we cannot provide a comprehensive overall estimate of \n     the impact of the S. 950 on gasoline supply. However, the \n     combination of alkylate and iso-octane production from \n     current MTBE plants, plus the likely increase in ethanol use, \n     should more than compensate for the loss of MTBE volume. \n     Thus, based on this first order analysis, total gasoline \n     production capacity could actually increase. The toxics \n     standards primarily affect RFG production relative to \n     conventional gasoline production. Thus, whether RFG \n     production increases must await further analysis. However, \n     there appears to be a significant probability that total \n     gasoline production capacity would increase under the \n     provisions of S. 950.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 21, 2001.\n     Hon.

Anderson\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n     congressional budget office private-sector mandates statement\n\n     S. 950--Federal Reformulated Fuels Act of 2001\n       Summary: S. 950 contains several private-sector mandates as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill \n     would impose mandates on domestic refiners and importers of \n     certain motor fuels, and on producers of the fuel additive \n     methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). The most costly mandate \n     would ban the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel by the year \n     2006. CBO estimates that the direct costs of such a ban would \n     amount to about $950 million a year starting in fiscal year \n     2006, declining to about $600 million a year by 2008. \n     Consequently, the aggregate direct costs of all the mandates \n     in the bill would be well in excess of the annual threshold \n     established by UMRA ($113 million in 2001, adjusted annually \n     for inflation).\n       S. 950 also would authorize an annual appropriation of $250 \n     million to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the \n     2002-2004 period for grants to assist manufacturers of MTBE \n     to convert facilities to produce fuel additives that would \n     substitute for MTBE.\n       Private-sector mandates contained in bill: S. 950 would \n     impose private-sector mandates on domestic refiners and \n     importers of certain motor fuels, and on producers of the \n     fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether. Specifically, the \n     bill would impose mandates by:\n       Banning the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether in motor \n     vehicle fuel;\n       Eliminating the waiver that allows gasoline blended with \n     ethanol to have higher evaporative properties (as measured by \n     the Reid vapor pressure) than gasoline blended with other \n     fuel additives; and\n       Requiring the refining industry to comply with more \n     frequent environmental and public health testing of fuel \n     additives prior to registration of those substances.\n       Estimated direct cost to the private sector: CBO estimates \n     that the aggregate direct costs of the private-sector \n     mandates in S. 950 would be well in excess of the annual \n     threshold established by UMRA ($113 million in 2001, adjusted \n     annually for inflation) starting in 2006.\n     Ban the Use of MTBE in Gasoline\n       Under the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, areas \n     with poor air quality are required to add chemicals called \n     ``oxygenates'' to gasoline as a means of reducing certain air \n     pollution emissions. The CAA has two programs that require \n     the use of oxygenates. One program requires oxygenated fuel \n     only during winter months. The more significant of the two \n     programs is the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program. Under \n     that program, areas with severe ozone pollution must use \n     reformulated gasoline year round. Areas with less severe \n     ozone pollution may opt into the program as well, and many \n     have. Refiners in participating states are required to add \n     oxygenates to that gasoline at levels designated to improve \n     combustion and thereby, reduce pollution from motor fuel \n     emissions. Currently, about 1.3 million barrels of \n     reformulated gasoline are sold each day. One of the most \n     commonly used oxygenates is methyl tertiary butyl ether. In \n     recent years concerns have been raised about the adverse \n     effects on drinking water supplies of MTBE that leaks from \n     underground tanks.\n       S. 950 would ban the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether in \n     gasoline within four years of the bill's enactment. Nearly \n     0.3 million barrels of MTBE are blended into gasoline each \n     day in this country, with about one third of that amount \n     supplied to refiners by merchant producers and the rest \n     produced by the refiners themselves or imported. Under the \n     bill, domestic petroleum refiners would no longer be able to \n     blend MTBE into gasoline and would therefore be required to \n     either produce or buy other, more costly fuel additives (such \n     as Alkylates or IsoOctane) to blend into reformulated \n     gasoline. Merchant producers would have to convert their \n     operations and begin producing alternative fuel additives, or \n     would sell MTBE abroad. Significant capital investment by \n     domestic refiners and merchant producers, including \n     conversion of MTBE plants would be required in order to \n     produce the Alkylates or IsoOctane. Importers would have to \n     acquire gasoline produced without MTBE and alternative fuel \n     additives.\n       Industry studies indicate that refiners and importers may \n     initially have to pay an additional 2.5 cents to three cents \n     per gallon to supply gasoline without MTBE. The cost to \n     merchant producers of MTBE that decide to convert to the \n     production of alternative fuel additives could be about 15 \n     cents per gallon of MTBE converted. For both parties, the \n     unit costs of compliance will diminish after capital \n     investments are made. CBO estimates the total cost of the \n     MTBE ban would amount to about $950 million annually \n     starting in 2006 and decline after a few years to about \n     $600 million annually.\n       At this time, ten states, including California and New \n     York, have acted to completely phase-out the use of MTBE in \n     gasoline. CBO's estimate of the cost to refiners has been \n     adjusted for the fact that those states, which account for \n     more than 40 percent of reformulated gasoline sales, will \n     already be in compliance with the ban by the time the bill's \n     provisions would go into effect.\n     Eliminate the Ethanol Waiver\n       Under the RFG program gasoline sold in the summer months \n     must meet a Reid vapor pressure (RVP) standard that is \n     stricter than that for other gasoline. RVP, measured in \n     pounds per square (psi), indicates how quickly a substance \n     evaporates. Gasoline with a high RVP evaporates more readily \n     at a given temperature, allowing components of gasoline that \n     contribute to smog formation to escape into the atmosphere.\n       S. 950 would eliminate the statutory waiver that allows \n     conventional gasoline blended with ethanol to have a higher \n     Reid vapor pressure than other gasoline. Currently, \n     conventional gasoline blended with ethanol is\n\n[[Page S485]]\n\n     allowed to have an RVP of 10 psi, making it more evaporative \n     than other fuels. Under the bill, ethanol-blended fuels would \n     have to achieve an RVP of 9 psi. To accommodate the change, \n     refiners who blend ethanol would reduce their use of other \n     highly evaporative components in gasoline, such as butane. It \n     is likely that those refiners (located mainly in the Midwest) \n     would continue their use of ethanol, since that additive \n     receives federal and state subsidies. According to the Energy \n     Information Administration, it would cost about 0.4 cents per \n     gallon of gasoline to eliminate enough butane to lower the \n     RVP of ethanol-blended gasoline to 9 pounds per square inch. \n     CBO therefore expects that the cost of replacing butane and \n     other evaporative blendstocks in the 0.4 million barrels of \n     ethanol-blended gasolines that are sold each day would be \n     about $65 million annually.\n     Require More Frequent Environmental and Public Health Testing\n       The bill would require manufacturers of fuel additives to \n     test their products regularly for any environmental and \n     public health effects of the fuel or additive, as part of the \n     registration process with the EPA. Under current law, such \n     testing occurs at the discretion of the EPA Administrator. \n     Based on information provided by the EPA on the most recent \n     round of testing, CBO expects the cost of regular testing to \n     be between $10 million and $20 million every five years, \n     which is the period of time over which the EPA expects the \n     testing to take place.\n       Appropriation or other Federal financial assistance \n     provided in the bill related to private-sector mandates: S. \n     950 would authorize the appropriation of $750 million to the \n     Environmental Protection Agency over the 2002-2004 period for \n     grants to assist domestic manufacturers of MTBE to convert \n     facilities to produce substitute fuel additives instead of \n     MTBE.\n       Estimate prepared by: Lauren Marks and Richard Farmer.\n       Estimate approved by: David Moore, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Microeconomics and Financial Studies Division.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S485-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              HONORING ALLISON CHURCH OF CORBIN, KENTUCKY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nVermont Small Business Development Center, commonly known as the \nVermont SBDC, for its impressive first ten years of operation.\n  In 1992, this new partnership of government, education, and business \nwas established in Vermont to help spur the state's economy. The \nparties involved were the U.S. Small Business Administration, the \nVermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development, the Vermont State \nColleges, and Vermont's twelve Regional Development Corporations.\n  With a staff of five and a lean budget, the SBDC set out to \naccomplish its statewide mission: to help Vermont small businesses \nsucceed. In its first year of operation, nearly 3,000 hours of free \nbusiness counseling were provided to 736 clients. The positive impact \nof SBDC activities in just its first three years of existence is \nattested to by the attendance of nearly 1,400 people at its small \nbusiness seminars held around the state in 1995.\n  Over the past 10 years, the SBDC has provided more than 44,000 hours \nof counseling to 11,000 clients. Over half were women, and half were \nnew business startups. In addition, over 15,000 Vermonters have \nattended SBDC business seminars.\n  Evaluation is a critical component to the SBDC. The annual impact \nassessment implemented in 1996 measured the economic impact that SBDC \nclients were having in Vermont. It found that SBDC clients created jobs \nat twice the rate of other Vermont businesses. It is not surprising \nthat client satisfaction was rated at 97 percent.\n  In 1998, the Vermont SBDC was recognized by the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, as the Outstanding National SBDC; a wonderful feat \nfor an organization that accomplishes so much with so little. In fact, \nlast year's economic impact assessment revealed that SBDC clients have \nled to the addition of over $3.2 million in incremental tax revenues to \nthe Vermont treasury. Considering the current state match contribution \nof about $300,000, that equates to more than 9 to 1 return on the \nstate's investment.\n  The impressive achievements of SBDC must be viewed in light of the \nactive role of the various partners that support it. Since its \ninception, SBDC has been housed at Vermont Technical College, which \nalso provides facilities for workshops and seminars. The SBA provided \nthe initial seed funding and by validating SBCD's effectiveness \ncontinues to provide federal funding. The Vermont Agency for Commerce \nand Community Development provides matching state funds and is an \nintegral partner in the SBDC network. The Agency considers SBDC a \nprimary component of their economic development strategy. The Vermont \nRegional Development Corporations (RDC) are the local partners which \nensure that services are provided uniformly throughout the state. SBDC \ncounselors are housed at the twelve RDC centers around the state.\n  Leveraging resources and working with other organizations has been \nthe hallmark of the SBDC over the years. Private sector and other \nexternal network partners have been absolutely essential for service \ndelivery. The SBDC works with countless external organizations on a \ndaily basis to form a broad delivery and support network. For example, \napproximately 60 percent of referrals for SBDC counseling and business \nplanning assistance come from the banking community and other lenders.\n  In the face of potential reduction of funding, clients and friends of \nthe SBDC are coming together to emphasize the benefit and economic \ncontributions of the SBDC. Together, they are sending the message that \nnow is not the time to cut SBDC resources. Rather, a challenging \neconomy is the time to invest in partnerships like the SBDC. At return \nrates of 9 to 1 it is difficult to justify not providing the funding \nnecessary to maintain the resources needed to meet market need.\n  Once again, I am proud of the initiative and hard work SBDC has \ncontributed to making our state a national leader among small business \ndevelopment organizations. Small business is truly the backbone of \nVermont's business community. And Vermont is an example of how small \nstates can leverage their limited resources for the maximum benefit of \ntheir citizens. Over the years, SBDC has found ways to partner with the \nfederal government, the private sector, and higher education to double \nits available funding, provide free quality services to businesses, \nhelp develop businesses and economic independence, and at the same time \nprovide a return on investment that more than pays for the program. I \ncongratulate them on their tenth anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S485-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S485-S486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PETER HAMBLETT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor an \noutstanding public servant, John ``Jack'' Rice for his thirty-six years \nof exemplary Federal service. As a Marine Machinist General Foreman at \nthe Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, Jack consistently provided high \nquality work to the Coast Guard and deserves recognition for his \nservice.\n  Throughout his long career with the Federal Government, Jack Rice \ndistinguished himself as a highly skilled tradesman who was committed \nto the Coast Guard and his trade. His vast knowledge and extensive \nexperience as a Marine Machinist made him a valuable source of \ninformation for the Coast Guard Yard as it sought to achieve high \nquality production of Coast Guard ships. Among the many important \nprojects that he made significant contributions to was the design, \nconstruction, and procurement of the Yard's 4000HP water brake, a \ncomputer-controlled dynamometer. His insight also proved essential to \nthe architects and facility managers that built and outfitted the \nbuilding that currently houses this equipment.\n  Jack Rice's innovative approach to his position will be missed. When \nthe Yard's new Machine Shop was in need of additional equipment and \ntools, Jack diligently reviewed excess equipment lists from other \nagencies. Through his efforts, the Yard was able to maintain state-of-\nthe-art techniques while simultaneously achieving significant savings \nfor the Coast Guard and the Federal Government.\n  Jack Rice also played a key role in advocating that the Coast Guard \nYard receives the necessary resources from the Federal Government to \naccomplish its important missions. I was fortunate to have the \nopportunity to work with Jack on these efforts. The Coast Guard and our \ncountry owe him a debt of gratitude for helping to ensure that the \nCoast Guard is adequately prepared to defend our coastlines, \nparticularly during these difficult times.\n  In addition to his service to the Coast Guard, Jack has contributed \nendless hours to promoting the development of skilled tradesmen. In \nparticular, as Chairman of the Baltimore City Public Schools \nManufacturing Advisory Committee, he advised the school system about \nthe latest trade technology and provided valuable suggestions to the \nBoard as it developed a curriculum that would effectively prepare \nstudents for a career involving a trade. He also played a key role in \nthe organization of the job and information fairs that have been \nextremely successful at informing students and their parents about the \nneed for skilled labor and the benefits of selecting a career in the \ntrades.\n  For 36 years, Jack Rice exemplified the Coast Guard Yard's motto, \n``Service to the Fleet''. Without a doubt, he played a large part in \nhelping the Yard earn its reputation as a top quality workforce which \nproduces top quality products.\n  It is my firm conviction that public service is one of the most \nhonorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated \nefforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow \ncitizens and country. Throughout his career, Jack Rice has exemplified \na steadfast commitment to meeting this demand.

WALKER GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL OF RICHMOND, VA\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on May 4 through 6, 2002 more than \n1200 students from across the United States will visit Washington, D.C. \nto compete in the national finals of the ``We the People . . .'' The \nCitizen and the Constitution program, administered by the Center for \nCivic Education. ``We the People'' is the most extensive educational \nprogram in the country developed specifically to educate young people \nabout the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I am proud to announce that the class from Maggie L. Walker \nGovernor's School from Richmond will represent the Commonwealth of \nVirginia in this national event. These young Virginians have worked \ndiligently to reach the national finals and through their experience \nhave gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The 3-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the \nUnited States Congress. The hearings consist of oral presentations by \nhigh school students before a panel of adult judges on constitutional \ntopics. The students' testimony is followed by a period of questioning \nby the judges who probe their depth of understanding and ability to \napply their constitutional knowledge.\n  The class from Maggie L. Walker Governor's School is currently \nconducting research and preparing for their upcoming participation in \nthe national competition in Washington, D.C. I wish these young \n``constitutional experts'' the best of luck at the ``We the People . . \n.'' national finals. They represent the future leaders of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S486-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WHITNEY R. HARRIS INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President later today, Washington \nUniversity, in St. Louis, MO, will be dedicating the Whitney R. Harris \nInstitute for Global Legal studies. This Institute is a fitting tribute \nto a man who has devoted his life to the concept of international law.\n  As a young naval officer, Mr. Harris was selected to join the team of \n24 U.S. prosecutors during the trial of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg \nbecause of his expertise in German intelligence matters. The trial was \nwithout precedent in legal history. For his services at Nuremberg, \nHarris was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Highest decoration received \nby any trial counsel.\n  As Mr. Harris said, ``Because of Nuremberg--and the effort which it \nrepresents of man's attempt to elevate justice and law over inhumanity \nand war--there is hope for a better tomorrow.'' The importance of Mr. \nHarris' work cannot be overstated.\n  In the 50 years since Nuremberg, Mr. Harris has championed human \nrights through international law. In 1954, Mr. Harris wrote ``Tyranny \nTrial,'' in which he distills the massive documentary evidence \npresented at the historic trial to provide a meticulous look at \nHitler's rise to power and the Nazi planning and execution of war \ncrimes. His book explores the relationship between law and war and \ndiscusses the precedent Nuremberg set for international human rights \nlaw.\n  The mission statement of the Institute for Global Legal Studies says: \n``We live in a truly global age. People, goods, services, information, \nand capital flow freely across international boundaries. From the \nInternet, e-mail, fax machines to travel, migration, commerce, and \nforeign relations, the story of the new millennium will be our ever \nshrinking planet. The world's problems--and the problems entrusted to \nlawyers--will increasingly require international cooperation and \ninternational solutions.'' The Whitney R. Harris Institute for Global \nLegal Studies will train men and women to follow in Mr. Harris' \nfootsteps, guiding us through this new global age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S486-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S486-S487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KERRY FORBES\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide a \nmandatory fuel surcharge for transportation provided by certain motor \ncarriers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Motor \nCarrier Fuel Cost Equity Act, which is much-needed legislation. My bill \nis designed to improve the ability of independent truck drivers to \nrecoup losses from high fuel costs by requiring that motor carriers \ncharge a fuel surcharge when the price of diesel fuel rises above $1.15 \nand pass-through this surcharge to the payer of the fuel costs. My bill \nwill level the playing field for small operators, which comprise nearly \n80 percent of the motor carrier industry, without any cost or \nregulatory requirement for the Federal Government.\n  There are approximately 350,000 independent truck drivers, known as \nowner-operators, who haul freight either on a per-load contractual \nbasis or by leasing their truck and driving services to a motor \ncarrier, freight forwarder or other shipping broker. Owner-operators \nessentially are independent contractors. Sometimes they provide their \nservices directly to a shipper, but more often owner-operators contract \nout their services to a motor carrier company which negotiates its own \ncontract with a shipper and then pays the owner-operator to provide the \ntransport service.\n  Fuel surcharges are a long-established method of permitting motor \ncarriers, airlines and even taxis to recover high fuel costs. But \nbecause of intense competition in the industry, owner-operators have \nlittle ability to negotiate terms of transport with a motor carrier, \nand in virtually no circumstance are they able to pass along the \nincreased costs of fuel to the shipper. The inability of independent \ntruck drivers to pass along the higher fuel costs of the last two years \nhas resulted in the bankruptcy of 7,000 trucking companies, nearly all \nsmall businesses, and the repossession of nearly 200,000 trucks.\n  I'd like to make clear a couple of additional points about the \nlegislation: First, the bill would not affect less-than-truckload \ncarriers, such as package delivery services. Many of these services are \nalready imposing surcharges and they don't face the same unique \nsituation that confronts the independent trucker. Second, my bill \nallows the parties to set their own surcharge formulas, but the \nsurcharge must be sufficient to fully compensate the person who pays \nfor the fuel. That's only fair, but it allows the motor carriers and \ntruckers the greatest degree of flexibility in negotiating the terms of \ntransport.\n  While national diesel fuel costs have recently fallen below the $1.15 \nthreshold, we know well that fuel costs can increase suddenly. \nAmerica's independent truckers, which form the backbone of truck \ntransportation in this country, deserve the ability to protect \nthemselves during these periods of high diesel fuel prices.\n  I am proud to be joined by Senator Bond in introducing this bill \ntoday. I am also pleased that Congressman Rahall has introduced similar \nlegislation on the House side. He has worked hard on this bill for \nseveral years now, and I look forward to working closely with him as we \nmove forward on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN:\n  S. 1915.

A bill to expand the teacher loan forgiveness programs under \nthe guaranteed and direct student loan programs for higher qualified \nteachers of mathematics, science, and special education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nFrist, Lieberman, DeWine, Roberts, and Sessions to introduce the Math, \nScience, and Special Education Teacher Recruitment Act of 2002. I \nparticularly want to thank the Senator from Tennessee for his tireless \nefforts and his leadership on this issue. The legislation we have \nbefore us today is, in large part, a product of his commitment to \naffordable education. I would also like to thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for his assistance and his dedication to solving America's \nteacher shortage.\n\n[[Page S490]]\n\n  The legislation we are introducing is designed to recruit teachers \nwith an expertise in math, science, or special education to work in \nschools with high concentrations of low-income students by offering \nsubstantial assistance with their student loan payments.\n  All across our Nation, public schools are struggling to fill teaching \npositions with qualified teachers. In the 2001-2002 school year, \nadministrators had to hire an estimated 200,000 new teachers just to \nmaintain the current teacher/student radio. Although universities \ncontinue to produce a greater number of teachers each year, the \nprofession is losing too many of its most qualified and experienced \npersonnel to retirement. In Maine, for example, 30.2 percent of \nteachers are over the age of 50. With such a large portion of the \nprofession nearing retirement, additional replacements will be needed \nin the next few years. The national teaching shortage is expected to \ncontinue throughout the next decade, making it more and more difficult \nfor schools to find qualified instructors.\n  Attracting new faculty is difficult enough, but finding applicants \nwith backgrounds in math, science, or special education can be \nparticularly demanding. Among first year teachers, approximately 55 \npercent graduated from college with a bachelors in general education. \nMany more graduated with liberal arts degrees or majors unrelated to \nthe curriculum they teach. The result is a system where only 38 percent \nof public school teachers hold subject-matter specific degrees.\n  In Maine, the shortage of qualified applicants is most severe with \nregard to math, science, special education, and foreign languages. \nEighty nine percent of our high schools reported a shortage in math \nteachers, and 87 percent reported a shortage of science teachers. With \nthe recent developments in technology and computing, it is becoming \nmore important than ever that our schoolchildren enter the workforce \nwith a firm grasp of math and science. Yet, it is more and more \ndifficult to attract math and science specialists to the teaching \nprofession. As for special education, the Council for Exceptional \nChildren reports that 50,000 special education positions were unfilled \nor filled by teachers without a full certification.\n  If this teacher shortage is a burden on suburban school districts \nwith ample resources, you can imagine the strain it puts on high \npoverty school systems. Problems are amplified in high-need areas: \nTeachers are likely to be the least experienced, often just out of \nschool, they are less likely to hold a masters degree, and they are \nless likely to have majored in their field of instruction.\n  To help deal with this epidemic, Senator FRIST and I put together a \nproposal that would expand the current loan forgiveness program for \nmath and science teachers who are willing to teach in high-poverty \nareas. Under the Act, teachers who commit to teach for five consecutive \nyears in a low-income/high-need area would be eligible for $17,500 in \nloan forgiveness instead of the current benefit of $5,000. To meet the \npressing need for special educators, the proposal would also make \nspecial educators eligible for the loan assistance for the first time. \nWe expect this legislation will expand upon the successes of the \ncurrent program and encourage a greater number of college graduates to \nenter the teaching profession. We are also hopeful that it will \nencourage more of the best qualified teachers to consider teaching in \nhigh need areas.\n  We are delighted that the President has included $45 million in his \nbudget for a similar proposal. Once again, President Bush has chosen to \nmake education a priority, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and the Administration on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill being \nintroduced today by Senator Collins, a bill that would expand loan \nforgiveness for math, science and special education teachers. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  At this time, I would like to share with you some startling \nstatistics regarding the status of teaching skills in our country. More \nthan 1 in 4 high school math teachers and nearly 1 in 5 high school \nscience teachers lack even a minor in their main teaching field. About \n56 percent of high school students taking physical science are taught \nby out-of-field teachers, as are 27 percent of those taking math. And \nthese percentages are much greater among high-poverty areas. Among \nschools with the highest minority enrollments, for example, students \nhave less than a 50 percent chance of getting a science or math teacher \nwho hold both a license and a degree in the field being taught. One \nsurvey taken among 40 large urban schools, for instance, showed that \nmore than 90 percent of them had an immediate need for a certified math \nor science teacher.\n  This shortage of strong math and science teachers is having a direct \neffect on the performance of our students. The most recent NAEP science \nsection results showed that the performance of fourth- and eighth-grade \nstudents remained about the same since 1996, but scores for high school \nseniors changed significantly: up six points for private school \nstudents and down four for public school students, for a net national \ndecline of three points. Moreover, a whopping 82 percent of twelfth-\ngrade students are not proficient in science and the achievement gaps \namong eighth-graders are appalling: Only 41 percent of white, 7 percent \nof African-American and 12 percent of Hispanic students are proficient.\n  The disappointing overall results for seniors on the science section \nof the NAEP prompted Education Secretary Rod Paige to call the decline \n``morally significant.'' He warned, ``If our graduates know less about \nscience than their predecessors four years ago, then our hopes for a \nstrong 21st century workforce are dimming just when we need them \nmost.'' I couldn't agree with the Secretary more.\n  An enormous improvement in mathematics and science education at the \nK-12 level is necessary if today's students want good jobs and the \nUnited States wants to stay competitive in the world economy. With \nglobalization, that means that the good jobs will go to the people who \ncan do them best. If those people are not in the United States, then \nthose jobs will also not be in the United States. At present, the law \nallows 195,000 immigrants to enter the United States on H-1B visas each \nyear in order to take jobs that cannot be filled by workers in the \nUnited States.\n  We have to do more to make sure that our students are learning math \nand science skills. And to do so, we must improve the quality of our \nNation's math and science teachers. These sentiments are echoed by the \nNational Research Council in its 2001 ``Educating Teachers of Science, \nMathematics, and Technology'' report. The Council notes: If the Nation \nis to make the continuous improvements needed in teaching, we need to \nmake a science out of teacher education--using evidence and analysis to \nbuild an effective system of teacher preparation and professional \ndevelopment.\n  President Bush has taken note of the startling statistics I shared \nwith you today, and that is why he has provided $45 million in his \nbudget to expand loan forgiveness for math and science teachers from \n$5,000 to $17,500 for those teachers who commit to teach for 5 \nconsecutive years in high-need schools. The President also provided \nthis expansion of loan forgiveness for special education teachers in \nhis proposal.\n  I wrote like to praise Senator Collins for following his lead and \nintroducing a bill to provide the authorizing language to make his \nproposal become a reality. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor \nof the bill. The bill would provide that $17,500 of loans would be \nforgiven for those that have math, science, engineering and special \neducation majors or graduate degrees, have been certified to teach in \ntheir states, and agree to teach in a school with a 50 percent or \nhigher rate of poverty. The bill is very simple, but it could make a \ntremendous difference for many of our young students' lives.\n  I have had the benefit of an amazing education in my lifetime and \nalso have had the wonderful opportunity of being inspired by \ntremendously talented and dedicated teachers. I want to make sure that \nall children have that same opportunity: to be inspired by smart, \ngifted and devoted teachers who actually know and understand math and \nscience. These teachers make a difference. They can lead a child to \nlike math, to like science, or they can\n\n[[Page S491]]\n\ncause a child to forever stray from the life sciences and run toward \nthe liberal arts.\n  Our society needs more engineers, more technicians, more doctors and \nmore scientists. We as a society should do all we can to encourage kids \nto enter these professions. That means we have to start early and make \nsure that those individuals who have the ability to shape their \nknowledge actually encourage them to become future scientists, not \ndissuade them from ever considering it. And, having spoken with so many \nteachers, school board members and educators who must grapple with the \ndemands of the special education students, no one can underestimate the \nneed to encourage more of our best and brightest to teach special need \nchildren.\n  I hope others join Senator Collins and me in this effort to make a \ndifference in a young child's future. Please cosponsor this initiative \nand help us to pass this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1919. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to provide for improved disclosure, diversification, account \naccess, and accountability under individual account plans; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an extremely \nimportant bill, the Retirement Security Protection Act of 2002. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in pressing for its swift consideration.\n  As the Enron debacle continues to unfold, it exposes serious gaps in \nthe framework of protections to shield Americans from corporate excess \nand irresponsibility. Perhaps nowhere is our vulnerability more \napparent than in the area of retirement security.\n  As thousands of Enron employees saw much of their life savings \nvanish, the company's top executives walked off with fortunes for \nretirement locked in. Enron spent over $1 million to insure that Ken \nLay would receive $440,000 in annual retirement income while \nsimultaneously encouraging employees to risk their own retirement \nsecurity by loading up on excessive amounts of soon-to-be worthless \nstock.\n  Unfortunately, some of the Enron circumstances are by no means \nunique. Similar disparities between rank-and-file employee and \nexecutive retirement security have become increasingly common in \ncorporate America. Similarly disastrous outcomes for employees' \nretirement security have occurred at other companies, such as Lucent \nand Polaroid.\n  We must take steps now to address these fundamental inequities.\n  Nearly eight decades ago, the Federal Government established a \ncompact with all Americans to provide a basic level of security in \ntheir retirement years. Social security became and still is the \nessential cornerstone of the American promise of retirement security. \nWe must do everything in our power to protect the dignity of social \nsecurity for older Americans.\n  In the 1970s, we recognized the need to protect what was then \nbecoming a second lynchpin of retirement security: employer-provided \npension plans, or so-called ``defined benefit'' plans. In ERISA, the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act, we took steps to protect the \nsecurity of such plans. We created a system for insuring them against \nloss, and we put into place portfolio diversification rules to help \nassure their solvency. No more than 10 percent of assets in a defined \nbenefit plan, that is, in a traditional pension plan, may be held in \nthe employer's company stock.\n  The Federal Government has not thus far taken steps to provide \nsimilar protections with respect to other retirement savings accounts, \nfor example, 401(k) plans. This is because, until relatively recently, \nsuch plans were much fewer in number, and they had largely been viewed \nas a supplement to workers' social security and defined benefit plans.\n  The world of retirement security has changed, however, and it is \nstill changing. Now, traditional defined benefit, or pension, plans \nhave essentially given way to defined contribution plans, such as \n401(k)s, as the primary retirement security vehicle after social \nsecurity. These new plans have been popular with mobile younger \nworkers, and a boon to employers who have enjoyed substantial cash and \nadministrative savings by switching out of their traditional pension \nplans and into these new ones.\n  In 1984, there were 30 million defined benefit participants and 7.5 \nmillion participants in 401(k) plans. By 2001, this relationship was \nreversed, with just 20 million defined benefit participants and an \nestimated 42 million 401(k) participants. In a 1998 survey, 57 percent \nof U.S. households said that the only pension plan available to them \nwas a 401(k) plan. That percentage undoubtedly has increased since \nthen.\n  Meanwhile, measures to ensure the integrity of these 401(k) plans \nhave not kept pace with their proliferation and importance. Such plans \nclearly carry considerable risks for the retirement security of \nmillions of Americans, as the Enron and other situations have \ndemonstrated. Unfortunately, the potential for additional disasters \nremains high. Recent reports indicate some 20 major corporations at \nwhich the 401(k) plan is more than 60 percent invested in company \nstock.\n  When the 401(k) portfolios of employees are overinvested in their \ncompany's stock and that company's stock crashes, the individual losses \nsuffered by workers and retirees who see their entire retirement \nsavings obliterated are only a piece of the story. The human and \ncapital costs to society of such failures are multiplied many times \nover. Family members who themselves may be struggling will find that \nthey are forced to pitch in to help their loved ones. Retirees will be \nforced to spend many additional years in the workplace to recover even \na portion of what they lost. Individuals without family or savings to \nsee them through will turn to government for support.\n  It's important to remember that these retirement plans come with a \nheavy price tag for taxpayers. Under current law, pension plans that \nmeet certain standards net considerable tax advantages for both the \ncompanies that sponsor them and the individuals who participate in \nthem. These provisions cost the government an estimated $100 billion \nper year in foregone revenue. In my view, that is money well invested. \nBut we do our best to ensure that we are reaching our actual policy \ngoal.\n  The primary policy rationale for tax favored treatment of these plans \ntoday is that they promote retirement security for millions of \nAmericans. There is hardly a more important policy goal. But while \ntraditional pension plans are carefully regulated to manage the level \nof risk involved while promoting that goal, 401(k) and similar plans \ncurrently offer no such protections. Our support for 401(k)s is not \nmatched by adequate disclosure, portfolio diversification and \naccountability measures. The huge risks of individual overexposure to \ncompany stock have been demonstrated in no uncertain terms, yet the \ndanger continues with no appropriate government response, despite the \nmajor public investment.\n  That is the reason that I am introducing the Retirement Security \nProtection Act of 2002. The legislation is designed to maximize the \nflexibility and benefits that retirement savings plans provide for both \nemployers and employees, while minimizing the risk of future Enrons.\n  First, my proposal seeks to improve the flow of information between \nplan sponsors and participants, particularly for those plans with \nsignificant employer stock holdings.\n  Second, I am proposing that employers take steps to safeguard their \nemployees' retirement by providing them and the government with an \nestimate of the extent to which their retirement is dependent on \nemployer stock and property. Employers will be required to reduce that \nlevel of dependency across all retirement plans to 20 percent by the \nyear 2008. Companies that sufficiently limit the amount of employer \nstock in their plans as a whole are deemed to meet the 20 percent \nstandard.\n  While my plan uses the same, 20-percent diversification target as \nother proposals, it also encourages and rewards employers who sponsor \ntraditional pension plans by allowing them to maintain higher levels of \ncompany stock in their defined contribution 401(k) plans. It also seeks \nto spur innovation by permitting employers to obtain a waiver from the \nDepartment of\n\n[[Page S492]]\n\nLabor for alternative approaches that manage the risk associated with \ndefined contribution plans.\n  Finally, I propose broadening the liability for plan losses resulting \nfrom illegal behavior and improving the remedies available to those who \nhave been hurt by such behavior.\n  Our compact with American working families is meant to assure them \nthe kind of security in their retirement years they have worked so hard \nto achieve. I urge my colleagues to join me in this urgent quest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Retirement Security Protection Act of 2002\n\n       The Retirement Security Protection Act of 2002 protects \n     employees' retirement security with respect to their 401(k) \n     retirement plans through (1) improved disclosure \n     requirements, (2) new rules to promote plan diversification, \n     and (3) tougher accountability rules.\n\n\n                      Full and Accurate Disclosure\n\n       1. Annual plan statements: Defined contribution plans would \n     be required to provide annual statements highlighting the \n     percentage of assets in company stock and any restrictions on \n     the sale of that stock and that stress the importance of \n     account diversification for long-term retirement security.\n       2. Duty to provide full and accurate information: Plan \n     sponsors and administrators have explicit duty to provide all \n     material investment information to plan participants and \n     beneficiaries.\n       3. Fines for false disclosures: Secretary of Labor can fine \n     employers and/or plan administrators up to $1,000 per day for \n     making misleading statements or omitting material information \n     about the value of employer stock or other investment \n     options.\n\n\n           Improved Diversification and Account Access Rights\n\n       1. Employer responsibility for portfolio diversification or \n     alternative arrangements for risk management: By December 31, \n     2007, employers are responsible for achieving diversification \n     across employees' entire tax qualified retirement portfolios \n     (i.e. defined benefit and defined contribution plans) so that \n     no more than 20% of the employee's total benefits are \n     dependent on company stock. This allows employers sponsoring \n     defined benefit plans to maintain higher levels of company \n     stock in defined contribution plans. Employers will have \n     maximum flexibility in how such diversification is achieved \n     AND the opportunity to obtain a waiver from the Department of \n     Labor for alternative approaches that manage the risk \n     associated with defined contribution plans. Companies that \n     sufficiently limit the amount of employer stock in their \n     plans as a whole are deemed to meet the 20% standard. ESOPs \n     of privately held companies and ESOPs that own more than 50% \n     of the employer are exempt and the Department of Labor is \n     directed to recommend special rules for pure, employer-funded \n     ESOPs.\n       2. Ban on employer restraints: Overturns existing rules \n     permitting employers to require employees to invest up to 10% \n     of employee contributions in employer stock.\n       3. Faster diversification rights: For publicly-traded \n     companies, permits any participant who has been with company \n     for more than 1 year--regardless of vesting status--to \n     transfer employer stock contributions to other funds. \n     (Maintains the current 10-years participation requirement for \n     employer contributions to ESOPs). The Department of Labor is \n     directed to make recommendations on the application of \n     diversification rights to non-publicly traded company stock \n     within retirement plans.\n       4. Lockdown protections for plans with company stock: \n     Requires 30 days advance written notice of plan \n     ``lockdowns'', limits such events to 10 business days, and \n     directs the Secretary of Labor to prescribe regulations to \n     provide for exemptions in case of genuine emergency. Company \n     executives cannot sell company stock during a lockdown \n     period. Plan fiduciaries are liable for violations of their \n     fiduciary duty that result in plan or participant losses \n     during a lockdown.\n\n\n                        Stronger Accountability\n\n       1. Expanded remedies: Expands the liability for breach of \n     fiduciary duty to knowing participants in the breach (e.g \n     Arthur Andersen in the Enron case) and stipulates that both \n     the plan and the individual participants have the right to be \n     made whole in court, including receipt of compensatory \n     damages.\n       2. Fiduciary insurance: Requires all defined contribution \n     fiduciaries to maintain sufficient insurance or bonding to \n     cover financial losses resulting from breach of fiduciary \n     duty.\n       3. Employee oversight: Requires employers that offer \n     defined contribution pension plans to appoint an equal number \n     of employer and employee trustees to oversee such plans.\n       4. No employer coercion. Makes it illegal for employers to \n     require employees to waive their statutory pensions rights as \n     part of any employment-related agreement (such as a \n     termination or severance package).\n       5. Auditor independence: Bars company auditors from also \n     auditing the pension plans.\n       6. Whistleblower protections. Expands legal protections for \n     pension plan whistleblowers by extending existing protections \n     to persons other than participants or beneficiaries, \n     increasing the burden of proof on employers to explain their \n     actions, and expanding relief available for violations of \n     whistleblower protections.\n       7. Insurance feasibility study: Directs the PBGC to study \n     and report to Congress on insurance options for defined \n     contribution plans.\n       8. Labor Department assistance: The Department of Labor \n     shall establish an office of the Participant Advocate to \n     monitor potential abuses of employee pension plan rights and \n     assist plan participants in preventing and resolving abuses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1920. A bill to require that the Attorney General conduct a study \nregarding the ability of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent \nand combat international crimes involving children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I introduced the \nInternational Child Safety Improvement Act of 2002. This legislation is \nintended to improve the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ability to \nprevent and combat international crimes involving children.\n  The number of people who use the Internet to meet children and commit \ncriminal acts, including illegal sexual acts, is on the rise. Some of \nthese cases occur in other countries, but involve American kids.\n  Just over a year ago, a 15-year-old girl from Mulberry, FL \ndisappeared only to be found in Greece living with an alleged German \nsex offender. The 35-year-old German man had met this young girl \nthrough the Internet and enticed her to run away from home. Law \nenforcement authorities were able to eventually track her down and \nreturn her to her distraught parents. The process of finding the girl \nexposed flaws in the FBI's ability to prevent and combat these crimes \nwhen they occur in foreign jurisdictions.\n  My legislation would require the Attorney General, in cooperation \nwith the Secretary of State, to evaluate the way in which the FBI \ninvestigates international crimes involving children. The Attorney \nGeneral would be required to report back to the Congress with \nrecommendations for improving the FBI's practices and procedures for \ninvestigating international crimes involving children. The bill also \ndirects the FBI to coordinate and share information with the \nInternational Criminal Police Organization, the world's preeminent \norganization whose mission is preventing or detecting international \ncrime, whenever such an investigation starts.\n  I would urge my colleagues to review and pass this legislation as \nsoon as possible. Action must be taken to improve the way in which \nthese crimes are investigated. Our kids need better protection from \npredators and we need to act quickly to ensure that the FBI has the \nprocedures in place and the resources it needs to fight these crimes \neffectively.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1921. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to provide greater \nprotection of workers' retirement plans, to prohibit certain activities \nby persons providing auditing services to issuers of public securities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Pension Plan \nProtection Act, being introduced today by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, and others. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this \nimportant bill and commend the Senator for her leadership on this \nissue.\n  This bill will help employees and protect their families and their \nretirement nest eggs. It will require employers to take reasonable \nresponsibility toward employees in administering plans, increase \ntransparency, improve information and disclosure, increase employee \nchoice and control, treat management the same as the rank-and-file \nduring blackout periods, and help prevent auditor conflicts of \ninterest.\n  This is a bill that can and should become law quickly. It includes \nmost of the reforms recommended by the President and representing the \nexport judgment of a Cabinet-level, interagency\n\n[[Page S493]]\n\ntask force. It also includes additional improvements. These protections \nwill be strong, but measured. Unlike some other ideas being floated \ntoday, these reforms are not arbitrary. They are fair and uniform, but \nnot one-size-fits-all. They keep the focus where it belongs, on \nprotecting, empowering, and informing workers.\n  I realize that other legislation may still be forthcoming, regarding \naccounting practices, securities management, or other issues. But that \nshould not delay us from acting now on reforms that we all know are \nneeded. Workers should not be left vulnerable for one unnecessary day \nwhile the Congress holds endless hearings in search of a ``perfect'' \npackage.\n  I urge my colleagues to act promptly and pass this pro-worker bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1922. A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto expand and intensify programs with respect to research and related \nactivities concerning elder falls; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nElder Fall Prevention Act of 2002, along with my colleagues Senator \nMikulski and Senator Enzi.\n  Many people do not realize that over 60 percent of fall-related \ndeaths in our country occur among persons 75 or older. Fall victims, \nespecially the elderly, are prone to sustain hip fractures which can be \ndevastating to their health--in fact, 25 percent of individuals who \nsustain hip fractures die within one year from the time the injury \noccurred.\n  In Arkansas, falls are the second leading cause of deaths from \nunintentional injuries. Based on data collected by the Centers for \nDisease Control, 91 Arkansans died because of a fall-related injury in \n1998 alone.\n  Not only is this a serious public health issue, it is also a fiscal \nissue, because billions of Medicare and Medicaid dollars are spent each \nyear to treat fall victims. It is estimated that over $32 billion will \nbe spent by the Medicare and Medicaid programs for fall related \ninjuries in the year 2020.\n  The Elder Fall Prevention Act will provide needed resources for \neducation, research and demonstration projects aimed at reducing the \nrisk of falls, identifying vulnerable populations, and preventing \nrepeat falls. The congressionally chartered National Safety Council, \nwhich is a leader in fall prevention efforts, will be spearheading \nseveral of these initiatives, along with the Centers for Disease \nControl, the Administration on Aging, the Agency for Health Research \nand Quality, and other qualified organizations.\n  Falls are preventable. I urge my colleagues to support the Elder Fall \nPrevention Act of 2002 in order to make seniors, family members, \ncaregivers, and employers more safety conscious, to prevent unnecessary \ndeaths, and to provide seniors with peace of mind and a safe \nenvironment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Elder Fall Prevention Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among \n     people over 65.\n       (2) Sixty percent of fall-related deaths occur among \n     persons 75 and older.\n       (3) Twenty-five percent of elderly persons who sustain a \n     hip fracture die within 1 year.\n       (4) Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly \n     have increased from 231,000 admissions in 1988 to 332,000 in \n     1999. The number of hip fractures is expected to exceed \n     500,000 by 2040.\n       (5) The costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and \n     society as a whole from falls by elderly persons continue to \n     climb much faster than inflation and population growth. \n     Direct costs alone will exceed $32,000,000,000 in 2020.\n       (6) The Federal Government should devote additional \n     resources to research regarding the prevention and treatment \n     of falls in residential as well as institutional settings.\n       (7) A national approach to reducing elder falls, which \n     focuses on the daily life of senior citizens in residential, \n     institutional, and community settings is needed. The approach \n     should include a wide range of organizations and individuals \n     including family members, health care providers, social \n     workers, architects, employers and others.\n       (8) Reducing preventable adverse events, such as elder \n     falls, is an important aspect to the agenda to improve \n     patient safety.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to develop effective public education strategies in a \n     national initiative to reduce elder falls in order to educate \n     the elders themselves, family members, employers, caregivers, \n     and others who touch the lives of senior citizens;\n       (2) to expand needed services and gain information about \n     the most effective approaches to preventing and treating \n     elder falls; and\n       (3) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     to evaluate the effect of falls on the costs of medicare and \n     medicaid and the potential for reducing costs by expanding \n     services covered under these two programs.\n\n     SEC. 4. PUBLIC EDUCATION.\n\n       Subject to the availability of appropriations, the \n     Administration on Aging within the Department of Health and \n     Human Services shall--\n       (1) oversee and support a three-year national education \n     campaign to be carried out by the National Safety Council to \n     be directed principally to elders, their families, and health \n     care providers and focusing on ways of reducing the risk of \n     elder falls and preventing repeat falls; and\n       (2) provide grants to qualified organizations and \n     institutions for the purpose of organizing State-level \n     coalitions of appropriate State and local agencies, safety, \n     health, senior citizen and other organizations to design and \n     carry out local education campaigns, focusing on ways of \n     reducing the risk of elder falls and preventing repeat falls.\n\n     SEC. 5. RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall--\n       (1) conduct and support research to--\n       (A) improve the identification of elders with a high risk \n     of falls;\n       (B) improve data collection and analysis to identify fall \n     risk and protective factors;\n       (C) improve strategies that are proven to be effective in \n     reducing subsequent falls by elderly fall victims;\n       (D) expand proven interventions to prevent elder falls;\n       (E) improve the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of \n     elderly fall victims; and\n       (F) assess the risk of falls occurring in various settings;\n       (2) conduct research concerning barriers to the adoption of \n     proven interventions with respect to the prevention of elder \n     falls (such as medication review and vision enhancement); and\n       (3) evaluate the effectiveness of community programs to \n     prevent assisted living and nursing home falls by elders.\n       (b) Administration.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--\n       (1) conduct research and surveillance activities related to \n     the community-based and populations-based aspects of elder \n     fall prevention through the Director of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention;\n       (2) conduct research related to elder fall prevention in \n     health care delivery settings and clinical treatment and \n     rehabilitation of elderly fall victims through the Director \n     of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; and\n       (3) ensure the coordination of the activities described in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2).\n       (c) Grants.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall award grants to qualified organizations and \n     institutions to enable such organizations and institutions to \n     provide professional education for physicians and allied \n     health professionals in elder fall prevention.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\n\n       Subject to the availability of appropriations, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the \n     Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     and in consultation with the Director of the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality, shall carry out the \n     following:\n       (1) Oversee and support demonstration and research projects \n     to be carried out by the National Safety Council in the \n     following areas:\n       (A) A multi-State demonstration project assessing the \n     utility of targeted fall risk screening and referral \n     programs.\n       (B) Programs targeting newly-discharged fall victims who \n     are at a high risk for second falls, which shall include, but \n     not be limited to modification projects for elders with \n     multiple sensory impairments, video and web-enhanced fall \n     prevention programs for caregivers in multifamily housing \n     settings, and development of technology to prevent and detect \n     falls.\n       (C) Private sector and public-private partnerships, \n     involving home remodeling, home design and remodeling (in \n     accordance with accepted building codes and standards) and \n     nursing home and hospital patient supervision.\n       (2)(A) Provide grants to qualified organizations and \n     institutions to design and carry out fall prevention programs \n     in residential and institutional settings.\n\n[[Page S494]]\n\n       (B) Provide one or more grants to one or more qualified \n     applicants in order to carry out a multi-State demonstration \n     project to implement fall prevention programs targeted toward \n     multi-family residential settings with high concentrations of \n     elders, including identifying high risk populations, \n     evaluating residential facilities, conducting screening to \n     identify high risk individuals, providing pre-fall \n     counseling, coordinating services with health care and social \n     service providers and coordinating post-fall treatment and \n     rehabilitation.\n       (C) Provide one or more grants to qualified applicants to \n     conduct evaluations of the effectiveness of the demonstration \n     projects in this section.\n\n     SEC. 7.

This review shall include a review of the \n     reimbursement policies of medicare and medicaid in order to \n     determine if additional fall-related services should be \n     covered or reimbursement guidelines should be modified.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall submit to the Congress a report describing the \n     findings of the Secretary in conducting the review under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATION.\n\n       In order to carry out the provisions of this Act, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated--\n       (1) to carry out the national public education provisions \n     described in section 4(1), $5,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2003 through 2005;\n       (2) to carry out the State public education campaign \n     provisions of section 4(2), $8,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2003 through 2005;\n       (3) to carry out research projects described in section 5, \n     $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2005; and\n       (4) to carry out the demonstration projects described in \n     section 6(1), $7,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2003 \n     through 2005; and\n       (5) to carry out the demonstration and research projects \n     described in section 6(2), $8,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2003 through 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1923. A bill to provide for increased corporate average fuel \neconomy standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the ``Fuel Economy \nand Security Act of 2002.'' This legislation would reduce our Nation's \noil consumption--and in doing so, our dependence on foreign oil, by \nincreasing Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, standards for \npassenger cars and light trucks. This legislation would also expand the \ncurrent CAFE credits system by allowing credit trading between \nautomobile manufacturers, as well as other industries that emit \ngreenhouse gases. Increasing CAFE standards, coupled with this new \ntrading system, would strengthen our national security, while \nsignificantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade \nand beyond.\n  The terrorist attacks waged on this country on September 11, 2001, \nhave brought into focus the need to reduce our dependence on all \nforeign oil, but most importantly, oil from the Persian Gulf. Compared \nwith the United States' daily oil production of 6 million barrels, this \ncountry imports 9 million barrels of oil per day, 2.6 million barrels \nof which come directly from the Persian Gulf. This bill would result in \ndaily oil savings by 2020 that are more than what the United States \ncurrently imports from that region. The cumulative oil savings between \n2007 and 2020 will be approximately 6.2 billion barrels. This savings \nfrom increased fuel economy is essential if we are to increase our \nenergy independence and national security.\n  Last year, the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, issued a report \nthat concluded that the benefits resulting from CAFE since its \nimplementation in 1978 clearly warrant government intervention to \nensure fuel economy levels beyond what may result from market forces \nalone. The NAS panel found that CAFE has led to marked improvements in \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, fuel consumption, and dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  The debate over CAFE is complex because it requires striking a \ncareful balance among many factors, including the environment, consumer \npreferences, and domestic employment. It is also important to consider \nthe need for powerful and durable vehicles in rural America. I believe \nthis bill would achieve a balance of many of these competing interests \nby providing adequate lead time to implement aggressive CAFE increases; \nfurthering efforts to reduce greenhouse gases; and factoring in the \nability of automobile manufacturers to meet annual standards based on \nexisting technology.\n  This bill would increase fuel economy standards by combining the \ndual-fleet CAFE structure, which currently requires that manufacturers \nmeet separate fuel economy standards for their light trucks and \npassenger cars. The bill requires that manufacturers' fleets average 36 \nmiles per gallon by 2016. Combining the fleets eliminates the often-\ncriticized ``SUV loophole'' and provides flexibility to automobile \nmanufacturers in designing their fleets.\n  Reducing fuel consumption will accomplish the critical goal of \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the recent World Economic Forum \nannual meeting in New York, it was reported that out of 142 nations, \nthe U.S. ranked 51st on an environmental sustainability index that \nmeasures overall progress toward environmental sustainability for the \nevaluated countries. Alarmingly, the U.S. ranked 133rd out of 142 on \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, one of the key indicators used to \ndetermine the sustainability index.\n  The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has held \nseveral hearings to address the complex issue of greenhouse gas \nemissions. The bill I am introducing today, focuses on one of the major \nindustrial greenhouse gas emitters, the automotive industry. While this \nbill proposes significant increases in the fuel economy of vehicles, it \nalso expands the options that a manufacturer has to meet these \nrequirements. Title II of this legislation proposes to establish a \nnational registry for entities to register greenhouse gas emissions \nreductions. The registry would support the trading of credits \nestablished in both the CAFE system, and other voluntary trading \npractices.\n  To ensure that automakers improve fuel economy and do not rely solely \non purchasing credits from the registry to satisfy CAFE requirements, \nthe bill has limited the amount of credits that can be purchased.\n  I believe this bill provides a realistic approach to reducing our \nnation's dependence on foreign oil and preserving our climate for \nfuture generations.

Res. 205\n\n       Whereas Ukraine stands at a critical point in its \n     development to a fully democratic society, and the \n     parliamentary elections on March 31, 2002, its third \n     parliamentary elections since becoming independent more than \n     10 years ago, will play a significant role in demonstrating \n     whether Ukraine continues to proceed on the path to democracy \n     or experiences further setbacks in its democratic \n     development;\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine can demonstrate its \n     commitment to democracy by conducting a genuinely free and \n     fair parliamentary election process, in which all candidates \n     have access to news outlets in the print, radio, television, \n     and Internet media, and nationally televised debates are \n     held, thus enabling the various political parties and \n     election blocs to compete on a level playing field and the \n     voters to acquire objective information about the candidates;\n       Whereas a flawed election process, which contravenes \n     commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe (OSCE) on democracy and the conduct of elections, \n     could potentially slow Ukraine's efforts to integrate into \n     western institutions;\n       Whereas in recent years, government corruption and \n     harassment of the media have raised concerns about the \n     commitment of the Government of Ukraine to democracy, human \n     rights, and the rule of law, while calling into question the \n     ability of that government to conduct free and fair \n     elections;\n       Whereas Ukraine, since its independence in 1991, has been \n     one of the largest recipients of United States foreign \n     assistance;\n       Whereas $154,000,000 in technical assistance to Ukraine was \n     provided under Public Law 107-115 (the Kenneth M. Ludden \n     Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2002), a $16,000,000 \n     reduction in funding from the previous fiscal year due to \n     concerns about continuing setbacks to needed reform and the \n     unresolved deaths of prominent dissidents and journalists;\n       Whereas Public Law 107-115 requires a report by the \n     Department of State on the progress by the Government of \n     Ukraine in investigating and bringing to justice individuals \n     responsible for the murders of Ukrainian journalists;\n       Whereas the disappearance and murder of journalist Heorhiy \n     Gongadze on September 16, 2000, remains unresolved;\n       Whereas the presidential election of 1999, according to the \n     final report of the Office of Democratic Institutions and \n     Human Rights (ODIHR) of OSCE on that election, was marred by \n     violations of Ukrainian election law and failed to meet a \n     significant number of commitments on democracy and the \n     conduct of elections included in the OSCE 1990 Copenhagen \n     Document;\n       Whereas during the 1999 presidential election campaign, a \n     heavy proincumbent bias was prevalent among the state-owned \n     media outlets, members of the media viewed as not in support \n     of the president were subject to harassment by government \n     authorities, and proincumbent campaigning by state \n     administration and public officials was widespread and \n     systematic;\n       Whereas the Law on Elections of People's Deputies of \n     Ukraine, signed by President Leonid Kuchma on October 30, \n     2001, was cited in a report of the ODIHR dated November 26, \n     2001, as making improvements in Ukraine's electoral code and \n     providing safeguards to meet Ukraine's commitments on \n     democratic elections, although the Law on Elections remains \n     flawed in a number of important respects, notably by not \n     including a role for domestic nongovernmental organizations \n     to monitor elections;\n       Whereas according to international media experts, the Law \n     on Elections defines the conduct of an election campaign in \n     an ambiguous manner and could lead to arbitrary sanctions \n     against media operating in Ukraine;\n       Whereas the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) on \n     December 13, 2001, rejected a draft Law on Political \n     Advertising and Agitation, which would have limited free \n     speech in the campaign period by giving too many \n     discretionary powers to government bodies, and posed a \n     serious threat to the independent media;\n       Whereas the Department of State has dedicated $4,700,000 in \n     support of monitoring and assistance programs for the 2002 \n     parliamentary elections;\n       Whereas the process for the 2002 parliamentary elections \n     has reportedly been affected by apparent violations during \n     the period prior to the official start of the election \n     campaign on January 1, 2002; and\n       Whereas monthly reports for November and December of 2001 \n     released by the Committee on Voters of Ukraine (CVU), an \n     indigenous, nonpartisan, nongovernment organization that was \n     established in 1994 to monitor the conduct of national \n     election campaigns and balloting in Ukraine, cited five major \n     types of violations of political rights and freedoms during \n     the precampaign phase of the parliamentary elections, \n     including--\n       (1) use of government position to support particular \n     political groups;\n       (2) government pressure on the opposition and on the \n     independent media;\n       (3) free goods and services given in order to sway voters;\n       (4) coercion to join political parties and pressure to \n     contribute to election campaigns; and\n       (5) distribution of anonymous and compromising information \n     about political opponents:\n        Now, therefore, be it\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the strong relationship between the United \n     States and Ukraine since Ukraine's independence more than 10 \n     years ago, while understanding that Ukraine can only become a \n     full partner in western institutions when it fully embraces \n     democratic principles;\n       (2) expresses its support for the efforts of the Ukrainian \n     people to promote democracy, the rule of law, and respect for \n     human rights in Ukraine;\n       (3) urges the Government of Ukraine to enforce impartially \n     the new election law, including provisions calling for--\n       (A) the transparency of election procedures;\n       (B) access for international election observers;\n       (C) multiparty representation on election commissions;\n       (D) equal access to the media for all election \n     participants;\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\n       (E) an appeals process for electoral commissions and within \n     the court system; and\n       (F) administrative penalties for election violations;\n       (4) urges the Government of Ukraine to meet its commitments \n     on democratic elections, as delineated in the 1990 Copenhagen \n     Document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE), with respect to the campaign period and \n     election day, and to address issues identified by the Office \n     of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of OSCE \n     in its final report on the 1999 presidential election, such \n     as state interference in the campaign and pressure on the \n     media; and\n       (5) calls upon the Government of Ukraine to allow election \n     monitors from the ODIHR, other participating states of OSCE, \n     and private institutions and organizations, both foreign and \n     domestic, full access to all aspects of the parliamentary \n     election process, including--\n       (A) access to political events attended by the public \n     during the campaign period;\n       (B) access to voting and counting procedures at polling \n     stations and electoral commission meetings on election day, \n     including procedures to release election results on a \n     precinct by precinct basis as they become available; and\n       (C) access to postelection tabulation of results and \n     processing of election challenges and complaints.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, I today am introducing a resolution \nurging the Government of Ukraine to ensure a democratic, transparent, \nand fair election process leading up to the March 31, 2002 \nparliamentary elections. I am pleased to be joined by fellow \nCommissioners Dodd and Brownback. Several of our colleagues from the \nHouse have introduced a companion resolution.\n  Ukraine's success as an independent, democratic state is vital to the \nstability and security in Europe, and that country has, over the last \ndecade, enjoyed a strong relationship with the United States. The \nHelsinki Commission has monitored closely the situation in Ukraine and \nhas a long record of support for the aspirations of the Ukrainian \npeople for human rights and democratic freedoms. Ukraine enjoys \ngoodwill in the Congress and remains one of our largest recipients of \nassistance in the world. Clearly, there is a genuine desire that \nUkraine succeed as an independent, democratic, stable and economically \nsuccessful state. It is against this backdrop that I introduce this \nresolution, as a manifestation of our concern about Ukraine's direction \nat this critical juncture. These parliamentary elections will be an \nimportant indication of whether Ukraine moves forward rather than \nbackslides on the path to democratic development.\n  Indeed, there has been growing cause for concern about Ukraine's \ndirection over the last few years. Last May, I chaired a Helsinki \nCommission hearing: ``Ukraine at the Crossroads: Ten Years After \nIndependence.'' Witnesses at that hearing testified about problems \nconfronting Ukraine's democratic development, including high-level \ncorruption, the controversial conduct of authorities in the \ninvestigation of murdered investigative journalist Heorhiy Gongadze and \nother human rights problems. I had an opportunity to meet Mrs. Gongadze \nand her daughters who attended that hearing.\n  While there has been progress over the last few months with respect \nto legislation designed to strengthen the rule of law, it is too early \nto assert that Ukraine is once again moving in a positive direction.\n  With respect to the upcoming elections, on the positive side we have \nseen the passage of a new elections law which, while not perfect, has \nmade definite improvements in providing safeguards to meet Ukraine's \ninternational commitments. However, there are already concerns about \nthe elections, with increasing reports of violations of political \nrights and freedoms during the pre-campaign period, many of them \ndocumented in reports recently released by the non-partisan, non-\ngovernment Committee on Voters of Ukraine, CVU.\n  It is important for Ukraine that there not be a repeat of the 1999 \npresidential elections which the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, OSCE, stated were marred by violations of the \nUkrainian election law and failed to meet a significant number of \ncommitments on the conduct of elections set out in the 1990 OSCE \nCopenhagen Document. Therefore, this resolution urges the Ukrainian \nGovernment to enforce impartially the new election law and to meet its \nOSCE commitments on democratic elections and to address issues \nidentified by the OSCE report on the 1999 presidential election such as \nstate interference in the campaign and pressure on the media.\n  The upcoming parliamentary elections clearly present Ukraine with an \nopportunity to demonstrate its commitment to OSCE principles. The \nresolution we introduce today is an expression of the importance of \nthese parliamentary elections, which could serve as an important \nstepping-stone in Ukraine's efforts to become a fully integrated member \nof the Europe-Atlantic community of nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/07/senate-section/article/S498-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2826.
