Mr. President:\n\n     When I remember all\n     The friends, so link'd together,\n     I've seen around me fall\n     Like leaves in wintry weather,\n     I feel like one\n     Who treads alone\n     Some banquet-hall deserted,\n     Whose lights are fled,\n     Whose garlands dead,\n     And all but he departed!\n     Thus, in the stilly night,\n     'Ere slumber's chain has bound me,\n     Sad Memory brings the light\n     Of other days around me.\n\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, in June 1970, it was my honor and privilege as the \nthen Secretary of the Senate Democratic party conference to go to this \nfloor and make the announcement that Senator Mike Mansfield had become \nthe longest serving majority leader in history.\n  Today, it is with sadness that I come to the Senate floor to speak of \nthe passing on Friday last of Mike Mansfield, and of his service to \nthis Chamber and to our country.\n  Mike Mansfield personified both America and the American dream. He \nwas born in New York City, the son of Irish immigrant parents, in 1903, \nthe year in which the Wright Brothers made their historic flight. He \nwas raised in his beloved Montana. When he was only 14 years of age, \nwithout completing the 8th grade, he served first in the U.S. Navy \nduring World War I, and eventually in the Army and the Marine Corps--at \nthat time, all of the branches of the U.S. military. After the war, he \nbecame a miner, then a mining engineer.\n  At 30 years of age, he was finally able, with the constant help of \nhis devoted wife Maureen, to obtain the first of several college \ndegrees that would enable him to become a college professor of history \nand political science for almost a decade.\n  In 1942, he was first elected to the U.S. Congress and served five \nterms in the House of Representatives. In 1952, Mike was elected to the \nSenate--that was the year in which I was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives--and began a remarkable quarter-of-a-century of service \nin this Chamber, a career that included being elected Senate majority \nwhip in 1957.\n  In January 1961, Senator Mansfield was elected Senate majority \nleader, and he served in that capacity until 1977--one of the most \nturbulent periods in American history. It was a time of assassinations \nand riots, marches and demonstrations, war and anti-war protests.\n  Nevertheless, under his leadership--a leadership that emphasized \ncooperation, honor, fairness, integrity, and negotiation--and a \nleadership style marked by personal conviction and a loyalty to lasting \nprinciples--the Senate was a place of remarkable legislative \naccomplishments, including the Great Society legislation of the mid \n1960's. That was one of the most productive periods of Congress in \nAmerican history, and Senate Majority Leader Mansfield certainly had an \nimportant role in it.\n  I worked shoulder to shoulder with Mike Mansfield for 10 years on \nthis floor, where I served as secretary of the Democratic conference \nfor 4 years and as Democratic whip for 6 years.\n  After leaving the Senate, he continued his public career by serving \nas the American Ambassador to Japan under Presidents Carter, Reagan, \nand Bush. Mansfield's 12 years as Ambassador to Japan are the longest \nin history.\n  Mike Mansfield of Montana was a man of outstanding achievements, a \nremarkable Senator, and an outstanding leader.\n  Mr. President, it was on last Friday, that the pallid messenger with \nthe inverted torch beckoned Mike Mansfield to depart this life. We can \nbelieve that he awakened to see a more glorious sunrise with \nunimaginable splendor of a celestial horizon, and that he yet remembers \nus as we remember him, for we have the consolation that has come down \nto us from the lips of that ancient man of Uz, whose name was Job: ``Oh \nthat my words were written in a book and engraved with an iron pen, and \nlead in the rock forever, for I know that my redeemer liveth and that \nin the latter day he shall stand upon the earth.''\n  Mike Mansfield has now passed from this earthly stage and gone on to \nhis eternal reward. The links which connect the glorious past with the \npresent have been forever sundered.\n\n     Passing away!\n     'Tis told by the leaf which chill autumn breeze,\n     Tears ruthlessly its hold from wind-shaken trees;\n     'Tis told by the dewdrop which sparkles at morn,\n     And when the noon cometh\n     'Tis gone, ever gone.\n\n  I always held Mike Mansfield in the highest esteem. He was a \ngentleman with great courage and unwavering patriotism, a wise and \ncourageous statesman, affable in his temperament, and regarded as one \nof the outstanding men in the Senate. He was both morally and \nintellectually honest and that is saying a great deal in these times. \nHe was simple in his habits and devoid of all hypocrisy and deceit. \nThere was not a deceitful cell in his body. He never resorted to the \ntricks of a demagog to gain favor and, although he was a partisan \nDemocrat, he divested himself of partisanship when it came to serving \nthe best interests of his country. May God rest his soul.\n\n     The potentates on whom men gaze\n     When once their rule has reached its goal,\n     Die into darkness with their days.\n     But monarchs of the mind and soul,\n     With light unfailing, and unspent,\n     Illumine flame's firmament.\n\n  Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and other great Grecian and Roman \nphilosophers, by pure reason and logic arrived at the conclusion that \nthere is a creating, directing, and controlling divine power, and to a \nbelief in the immortality of the human soul. Throughout the ages, all \nraces and all peoples have instinctively so believed. It is the basis \nof all religions, be they Islamic, Hebrew, Christian, or heathen. It is \nbelieved by savage tribes and by semi-civilized and civilized nations, \nby those who believe in many gods and by those who believe in one God. \nAgnostics and atheists are, and always have been, few in number. Does \nthe spirit of man live after it has separated from the flesh? This is \nan age-old question. We are told in the Bible that when God created man \nfrom the dust of the ground, ``He breathed into his nostrils the breath \nof life, and man became a living soul.''\n  When the serpent tempted Eve, and induced her to eat the forbidden \nfruit of the tree of knowledge, he said to her, ``ye shall not surely \ndie.''\n  Scientists cannot create matter or life. They can mold and develop \nboth, but they cannot call them into being. They are compelled to admit \nthe truth uttered by the English poet Samuel Roberts, when he said:\n\n     That very power that molds a tear\n     And bids it trickle from its source,\n     That power maintains the earth a sphere\n     And guides the planets in their course.\n\n  That power is one of the laws--one of the immutable laws of God, put \ninto force at the creation of the universe. From the beginning of \nrecorded time to the present day, most scientists have believed in a \ndivine creator although I read not too long ago that only about 40 \npercent of the scientists in this country believe in a creator. I have \noften asked a physician:\n\n       Doctor, with your knowledge of the marvelous intricacies of \n     the human body and mind, do you believe that there is a God, \n     a Creator?\n\n  Not one physician has ever answered, ``No.''\n  Each has answered, readily and without hesitation, ``Yes.'' Some may \nhave doubted some of the tenets of the theology of orthodoxy, but they \ndo not deny the existence of a creator. Science is the handmaiden of \ntrue religion, and confirms our belief in the Creator and in \nimmortality.\n  It was William Jennings Bryan who said:\n\n       If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold \n     and pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst \n     forth from its prison walls, will He leave neglected in the \n     earth the soul of man made in the image of his Creator?\n\n  As an aside let me say that I always grow a few tomatoes--about four \nvines. This year I planted four vines, and I had more than 400 tomatoes \noff those four vines. Sometimes I plant the Early Girl, sometimes I \nplant Big Boy or Better Boy. I grow enough tomatoes to furnish my wife \nand myself, also to supply our older daughter and her husband. Our \ngrandsons and our granddaughters and their spouses live farther away, \nbut sometimes they have some tomatoes for them.\n\n     Whoever plants a seed beneath the sod\n     And waits to see it break away the clod\n     Believes in God.\n\n  As Longfellow said:\n\n       It is not all of life to live, nor all of death to die. \n     Rather, as he says:\n\n     There is no death! What seems so is transition;\n     This life of mortal breath\n     Is but a suburb of the life Elysian,\n     Whose portal we call death.\n\n  Life is but a narrow isthmus between the boundless oceans of two \neternities. All of us who travel that narrow isthmus today, must one \nday board our little frail barque and hoist its white sails for the \njourney on that vast unknown sea where we shall sail alone into the \nboundless ocean of eternity,\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\nthere to meet our Creator face to face in a land where the roses never \nwither and the rainbow never fades. Mike Mansfield has gone on to meet \nhis pilot face to face. He was 98. I am but 84--within 42 days I will \nreach my 84th birthday. And it won't be long until I, too--and then so \nwill you, and so will you--meet our pilot face to face.\n\n     Sunset and evening star,\n     And one clear call for me\n     And may there be no moaning of the bar\n     When I put out to sea,\n     But such a tide as moving seems asleep,\n     Too full for some and foam,\n     When that which came from out the boundless deep\n     Turns again home.\n\n     Twilight and evening bell\n     And after that the dark,\n     And may there be no sadness of farewell\n     When I embark,\n     For though from out our borne of time and place,\n     The flood may bear me far\n     I hope to see my Pilot face to face\n     When I have crost the bar.\n\n  To that borne, from which no traveller ever returns, Mike Mansfield \nhas now gone to be reunited with his wife Maureen and others who once \ntrod these marble halls, and whose voices once rang in this Chamber.\n  I can hear them yet: Hubert Humphrey, Paul Douglas, Allen Ellender, \nRichard B. Russell--who sat at this desk--George Aiken, Everett \nDirksen, Norris Cotton, ``Scoop'' Jackson--their voices in this earthly \nlife have now been forever stilled.\n  Mike Mansfield has crossed the Great Divide. Of that illustrious man \nwho sat in this Chamber when he and I were young Senators, only Strom \nThurmond and I remain here today.\n\n     They are drifting away, these friends of old\n     Like leaves on the current cast;\n     With never a break in their rapid flow\n     We count them, as one by one they go\n     Into the Dreamland of the Past.\n\n  Erma and I extend our condolences to Mike's daughter, Ann, and to \nothers of his family. May his soul rest in peace.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10345-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE ``MIKE'' I KNEW\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I cannot find the words I want for Mike \nMansfield--their meaning--and put them together like our good friend \nfrom West Virginia. He knew Michael almost as long as I did.\n  But Mike has moved on. His work here on Earth is done. His legacy \nwill live as it will be placed among the archives as majority leader of \nthe Senate, as a Member of the House of Representatives, and as an \nAmbassador to Japan. As a nation, we have been graced and blessed by \ngreat leaders who rose to uncommon levels in times of national crises. \nWe, the Members of this Senate, are the benefactors of his stewardship. \nA thankful nation is the benefactor of his wisdom.\n  I now occupy the seat once held by Mike. Thirteen years ago, I came \nto this body, and for 13 years Mike and I had breakfast every Wednesday \nmorning the Senate was in session. He seldom missed. Those \nconversations were wonderful, and they were also very insightful. They \nwere full of wisdom, information, and insight.\n  Senator Byrd described him as a nonpartisan. That is 95 percent \ncorrect. But one cannot work in this system and not have some partisan \nleanings.\n  No person in Washington, DC, was kinder or more helpful to a newly \nelected Member of the Senate than Mike Mansfield--even being on the \nother side of the aisle. I shall never be able to thank him enough or \nforget what he did for me.\n  Senator, Ambassador, Mike Mansfield, whichever you prefer--he was a \ngood and faithful servant of the Nation and of the people of Montana \nwhom he represented. His long lifespan was some 98 years. That gave him \na perspective on life and history that very few of us will ever \nunderstand or attain. His wise eyes had seen and experienced so much of \nthis country's history. In his lifetime, a nation--think about this--\nwent from horseback to the Moon. Think of it.\n  He was an honest man. He lied a little about his age to get into \nWorld War I. He came home and worked in the mines of Butte and \nAnaconda. One has to read the history of Montana to know that was not \neasy work, and very dangerous.\n  His beloved wife Maureen, who preceded him in death just a year ago, \npushed him for education to better himself and to lift himself from the \nmines. He experienced the rigors of the worst depression in the history \nof the United States--what lessons that taught many of us--and the \nexperience of World War II. If that weren't enough, the era of Korea, \nVietnam, and the cold war, when two powers looked each other in the eye \nuntil one blinked.\n  During tumultuous times, the United States has been blessed with \ncommon men and women who rose to uncommon levels of leadership when \nthey were tested and asked to do so--men and women with a hidden \ncharacter of steel, vision, compassion, and integrity. Mike Mansfield \nwas one who, when called, responded to that level demanded by the day.\n  Looking back at those conversations, they were mostly events and \nhappenings of the Senate. He loved to tell stories of the giants of \ntheir day. That gave me great insight of this body, and his advice was \nseldom, if ever, wrong.\n  The Mike I knew will be with me as long as I shall breathe. I thank \nGod every day that our Nation's demands were answered by men and women \nsuch as Mike Mansfield.\n  The best advice that was ever given to me by Senator Mansfield was \nshort and very pointed.\n  By the way, I used to work in the press corps in Montana when Michael \nwas a Member of this body. The producer of the news show would say: Go \nout and interview Senator Mansfield. We need about a 15-minute \ninterview. That meant you had better have about 40 questions, because \nthe answers were very short.\n  Yes, noble--little possible doubt. He didn't embellish much. But the \nbest advice he ever gave me was short and very pointed. He said one \ntime--and I will never forget it--``At the end of the day, it will be \ncourage and vision that will sustain this Republic for generations to \ncome.'' Courage and vision to sustain this Republic for the generations \nto come.\n  This Nation has not only been blessed by great topography, but with a \ngreat climate and great natural resources from the mountains in the \nEast, across the Ohio, the Missouri, and Mississippi valleys to the \nmountains of the West, to the high prairies and the Deep South. It has \nalways produced men and women who, when tested, showed the steel of \ncharacter and vision.\n  Thank God he was a Member of this body. And might all of us live for \nthe day when we can even stand in measure with him.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, what time is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 10:18.\n  Mr. REID. We have 12 minutes left before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Chairman Hollings is in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Madam President, we have the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to \nthe airport security bill at 10:30.\n  I say, in the few minutes allotted me, I wish everyone could have \nbeen at the Commerce Committee briefing we had with the El Al airline \nsecurity chief and Israeli government security officials. You would \nimmediately understand that when the plane went down over the Black Sea \nthis past weekend, even though the plane came from Israel, the \nexplosion had to come from somewhere else because it is veritably \nimpossible to get a bomb aboard a plane at airports in Israel.\n\n  The United States military is now working with Ukrainian and Russian \nofficials to verify evidence that a Ukrainian missile may have gone \nastray during military exercises on the Black Sea coast. I only mention \nthis incident to emphasize the thoroughness of airport security in \nIsrael. They call their security plan the ``onion ring'' perimeter \ndefense. Their plan effectively addresses not only security during the \nboarding of the plane, but security surrounding the airport and on the \ntarmac. But we continue to talk more narrowly about security in the \ncockpit and the need for federal screeners and U.S. marshals on board. \nAs inexperienced as we are on these matters, this is where our minds \nare focused.\n  However, we need to expand our work on airline security to the \nairport and airline personnel working on the tarmac. At some point \nduring pre-flight preparation, you have not only the screeners, cargo \nhandlers, caterers, and general airport perimeter officials, but you \nhave the individual who vacuums underneath the seats, who all have \naccess to the airplane prior to take-off. Because of this access, all \npersonnel need to go through an FBI check, in our opinion. That is what \nthis bill provides.\n  Take the following scenario for instance. A terrorist checks in ahead \nof time online and the airline staff says to the person you have seat \n9A. All a terrorist has to do is pick up that mobile phone and call a \nfriend who has been working 2 years on the tarmac out there and say it \nis a 12 o'clock flight to Charleston, seat 9A. That is it. They tape a \npistol or a weapon of some kind under seat 9A. But even there at the \ncounter, all you have to do is get out there a little bit early, get \nyour ticket, and then sit down and be calm. Then just give a motion up \nat the window because your friend has already been told that this is \nthe flight you are going to take.\n  The bill itself has been released to the Senate after a full day's \nhearing we had at the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee \nwith nearly all of the Senators in attendance. In a bipartisan fashion, \nSenator McCain, and I, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who has been \nworking on this over several years, along with the chairman of our \nSubcommittee on Aviation, Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia, all got \ntogether with some two dozen cosponsors to develop this legislation.\n  We do have a managers' amendment that really takes care of some of \nthe flexibility needs that we found out about from the FAA with respect \nto restrictions on parking 300 feet from the airport building--that \nkind of thing. As the Senator from North Dakota says, I think if you \nmove 300 feet from the airport building in North Dakota, you will be in \nSenator Dorgan's cow pasture. We must be careful to maintain reasonable \nand flexible oversight of airline security in order to ensure the \ncontinued efficiency of the industry. Those kinds of judgments can be \nmade from time to time by the administering agency.\n  These efforts will be paid for. Right now, we are studying the exact \ncost. Senator McCain and I have tried to hold costs down--including the \npassenger security fee itself. What we have agreed upon at the moment, \nof course, is $2.50 per ticketed passenger which would add up to $1.5 \nbillion. But they are saying, no, if you are going to take care of the \n18,000 screeners and some 10,000 other personnel around the tarmac and \nout on the sidewalk, you are going to really get into about $1.7 \nbillion or maybe $1.9 billion total cost. So we might have to raise the \npassenger fee up to $3. I don't know. We are currently trying to obtain \nthe best CBO figures.\n  The airline executives favor this bill; the airline pilots favor the \nbill. You go right on down the list, all the personnel involved; the \nmayors have sent us resolutions. I think we made a mistake in calling \nit airline security. We should have used the word ``stimulus,'' the \n``airline stimulus'' bill, because if we had used that word, we would \nnot have had any trouble at all in passing this measure. Everybody is \naround here trying to stimulate, stimulate, stimulate--these fancy \nwords we get up here in Washington.\n  I know of no better measure to stimulate airline travel and get the \nairlines back to normal. We give the airlines $15 billion and then \nguarantee they go broke by keeping the airports closed or extending the \nidea that there is no security, that there are no marshals on the \nplane, as the Senator from California told me early this morning. We \nare going to have marshals. We are going to have security with this \nairline stimulus security measure.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Montana. He has worked \nclosely with us on this issue, and perhaps he would have an \nobservation.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my good friend from South Carolina. I didn't think \nhe had to be invigorated or stimulated to make a great speech. I was \ngoing to stay out of this, but the Senator is correct; nothing will \nstimulate travel more than a strong sense of security. It has to be \nvisible. People have to see the measures that are being taken to make \nit viable and to give them a sense of security whenever they fly. We \nknow we are in a different kind of a confrontation now. Some have \ntermed it a war. It really is. But it is different from anything this \nNation has ever faced.\n  Whenever we start talking about our own security, providing security \nfor our people in this country and abroad, we only have to look--I was \ninterested, as was the chairman of the Commerce Committee, that when we \ntalk to the representatives of El Al, the national airline of Israel, \nwe talked to the people who are in charge of security. If the Senator \nremembers, there are 7,000 employees of El Al, both domestic and \ninternational; 1,500 of that 7,000 are in security. And there is a \nbright line between their security people and everybody else--the \npilots, the people who operate their airports, the people who operate \ntheir reservation systems, the people who operate their ground \noperations and their in-flight operations. There is a bright line of \nauthority between those people who are the security people. They know \nhow to exercise that authority. They are accountable and responsible \nfor that. But most importantly, they are accountable to their airline \nand to their country.\n  We have crafted this legislation without a hearing--we never had a \nmarkup--but it is as close, and I think with a couple of amendments we \ncan perfect it, as we can come to some understanding on that bright \nline of accountability and responsibility for security.\n  I congratulate the Senator for his leadership. He understands where \nwe\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\nhave to go and how to get there in order to provide the safety and \nsecurity the American people demand.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Madam President, it was my hope we could move directly \nnow to the bill, given the 97-0 vote on the motion to proceed. As I \nunderstand it, there are still objections to go to the bill itself. I \nhope we can work through whatever objections there may be on the other \nside so we can get on the bill and begin offering amendments and coming \nto closure of this bill quickly. We have a lot of work. All of it is \nbeing held up now as a result of our inability to get that work done.\n  In the interim, it would be my hope for those Senators who had come \nto the floor with the expectation they could speak as if in morning \nbusiness on Senator Mike Mansfield and other matters, we accord \nSenators that opportunity. I ask for the next hour that the Senate \nstand as if in morning business to accommodate Senators who wish to \nspeak in tributes to Senator Mansfield and other matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask the majority leader if we could \nclarify something for the record. We had 97 Senators vote, publicly \nsaying they are prepared to have a motion that allows us to at least \nproceed to the bill, but we are not actually able to get on the bill \nitself. Nobody should be mistaken that suddenly the Senate is actually \nmaking big progress on aviation security.\n  I ask the majority leader if he would just clarify what the \nprocedural hurdle is now, and also, what is the substantive resistance \nhere and how he sees the Senate proceeding.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield, I will simply say it is the \nright of any Senator to ask for his or her time allocated to \npostcloture debate. As everyone in this body knows, you have 30 hours \nof postcloture debate after cloture has been achieved. We have now \nvoted on cloture, and Senators are entitled to a 30-hour debate.\n  It is my hope we can accelerate and somehow bring to closure this \npostcloture period of debate so we can somehow get on the bill. I do \nnot think it is in anybody's interests right now to be exacerbating the \nsituation with any kind of accusations about who is at fault. We are \ngoing to try to work through that. I just hope we can work through it \nin a way that will accommodate debate on the bill and ultimately a \nsuccessful conclusion of that debate so we can enact this legislation \nthis week. It is critical that we get this work done. No Senator has to \nbe reminded of that.\n  Again without acrimony, without pointing fingers, let's see if we can \nwork through it in a constructive way, and that is my intention. I will \nbe speaking to the Republican leader momentarily, as well as, again, to \nthe ranking member of the Commerce Committee, as we try to find a way \nto resolve whatever outstanding problems there still are.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the majority leader.\n  I want to emphasize, as I know Senator McCain and Senator Hollings \nfeel, nobody at this point wants the good work of the Senate to be \ndistracted in any way by any kind of finger pointing or accusations. \nThat is not the purpose of my question.\n  But we have now been discussing airport security for several weeks--\nseveral weeks. There is a very significant majority of the Senate who \nare poised to vote in a certain way. It is my hope my colleagues will \nallow the will of the Senate to be worked. The American people expect \nnothing less of this Congress than a prompt response in a responsible \nway. Frankly, I think we can do better at the job of resolving this \nfaster than we seem to be at this moment. I hope that will happen in \nshort order, in the course of the next 24 or 48 hours.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nMontanan, a great American, and a great\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\nleader who passed away early Friday morning.\n  In our Nation's history, we have been blessed with leaders who have \nstepped forward to lead us in moments of crisis, war, or social \nupheaval. Mike Mansfield of Montana was such a man, such a leader.\n  Modest and self-effacing, Mike Mansfield, as Senate Majority Leader, \nwas instrumental in the 1960s and 1970s in steering the U.S. Senate and \nAmerica through some of the most tumultuous times in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  He was here in this Chamber, leading the Senate through the sadness \nfollowing the assassination of President Kennedy.\n  He helped pass landmark Great Society programs, including the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination in public \naccommodations.\n  And the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which allowed blacks in the South \nto more widely take part in Federal and State elections.\n  He questioned our country's growing role in the Vietnam War when that \nmight have been unpopular to do so, but when it needed to be done.\n  He helped lead the Senate through Watergate, when the foundations of \nour democracy and government were shaken by scandal and the resignation \nof our President.\n  And he was most proud of his role in helping Congress pass \nlegislation that led to ratification of the 26th amendment. That gave \nour young people--18 year olds--the right to vote and extended \nparticipation in our government to even more Americans.\n  Mike Mansfield was a key leader in extraordinary times. He was the \nsage, laconic captain with his hand firmly on the wheel. The captain we \ncould trust in rough seas, who knew when to speak and give orders, and \nknew when to listen.\n  He was a counselor and team leader who walked the bridge to consult \nwith Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. And later Presidents \ntapped Mike Mansfield for even more public service--to serve as \nAmerica's Ambassador to Japan, one of the most sensitive postings in \nthe world.\n  This Senator from Montana served longer than anyone else in American \nhistory as Senate majority leader and as U.S. Ambassador to Japan.\n  And he left the Senate a better place, not only for Senators but for \nthe American people. He left it a civilized institution that allowed \nall Senators an equal voice in the legislative process. He encouraged \nyounger Senators to speak, breaking the tradition of a Senate dominated \nby an exclusive club of older men. Senator Mansfield democratized the \nSenate.\n  When he retired at age 73, Senator Mansfield noted that in his period \nof service in Congress--from 1942 to 1976--he had witnessed: ``One-\nsixth of the Nation's history since independence. The administrations \nof seven Presidents. The assassination of a President and his brother. \nAble political leadership and seamy politics and chicanery. The dawn of \nthe nuclear age and men on the moon.\n  ``A great war and a prelude to two more wars. A dim perception of \nworld order, and an uncertain hope for international peace. There is a \ntime to stay and a time to go. Thirty-four years is not a long time, \nbut it's time enough.''\n  That's quite a record, quite a resume, quite a life.\n  But that all pales in comparison to his love for his wife Maureen, \nand his love for Montana and the people he so faithfully represented.\n  Over the course of his career, Mike Mansfield went by many titles: \nProfessor Mansfield, Congressman Mansfield, Senator Mansfield, Majority \nLeader Mansfield, and Ambassador Mansfield.\n  Senator Mansfield was an internationally recognized leader. But in \nMontana, we simply knew him as ``Mike.'' And he was our Mike.\n  Mike was the embodiment of Montana: Quiet, humble, strong, salt of \nthe earth, committed to his wife, family, State and country. He was my \nmentor and he was my friend.\n  Although he served six U.S. Presidents in his career as majority \nleader and ambassador to Japan, Mike once said humbly, ``I reached the \nheight of my political aspirations when I was elected Senator from \nMontana.''\n  That's just the kind of man he was, a quiet but firm leader, one who \ndidn't like the spotlight but endured it in service to his State and \ncountry.\n  Michael Joseph Mansfield was born in New York City on March 16, 1903. \nHe moved with his family to Great Falls, MT, in 1906.\n  When he was only 14 years old, Mike joined the Navy and served as a \nseaman in World War I. He then served as a private in the Army in 1919 \nand 1920, and as a private first class in the Marines from 1920 to \n1922.\n  After his military service, Mike moved back home to Montana, where he \nworked as a mine mucker and engineer in the copper mines of Butte for 8 \nyears.\n  It was during this time that he met his soon-to-be wife, Maureen. \nAfter meeting Maureen, Mike's life was forever changed, he would say. \nThey would marry in 1934. By her guidance, her faith in him, Mike said, \nMaureen pushed him to go back to school and was responsible for his \nsuccess in life.\n  So Mike went back to school. He attended the Montana School of Mines \nin Butte in 1927 and 1928, then graduated from Montana State \nUniversity--as it was called then--in 1932. Mike earned a masters \ndegree in history in 1934, and taught history and political science for \neight years.\n  Mike's 34-year career of representing Montanans in Washington began \nin 1942, when Maureen urged him to run for a seat in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. He served Montanans well in the House for over a \ndecade. Then we sent him to the Senate in 1952.\n  Mike's ability to bring people together and find common ground \nenabled him to succeed Lyndon Johnson as Senate majority leader in \n1961, a post he held until 1977.\n  When John F. Kennedy asked him to serve as majority leader, Mike at \nfirst declined. Mike and Kennedy were freshmen together in the Senate, \nand Mike became a close confidant. Mike finally agreed to serve--for \nlove of country--and went on to become one of the most effective \ngentlemen ever to grace this great Chamber.\n  After he was elected majority leader, Mike was asked if he would act \nthe same way as the legendary Lyndon Johnson, whose style as majority \nleader was blunt and heavy-handed. In typical Mansfield fashion, Mike \nsaid, ``I am who I am.''\n  After Mike Mansfield's distinguished service here in the Senate, \nPresident Carter appointed him in 1977 to be our ambassador to Japan. \nMike was reappointed to that post by President Reagan. And Mike \ncontinued his diplomatic service until he retired in 1988, making him \nthe longest-serving Ambassador to Japan in our Nation's history.\n\n  When he served as Ambassador to Japan, Mike said, ``I try to put \nmyself in the shoes of the Japanese, but I have never forgotten that \nthe shoes I wear are American, and that my country's interests come \nfirst.''\n  That's Mike. He never forgot where he came from.\n  Although he came from the mines in Butte, Mike understood the \nimportance of our relationships with other countries and the world.\n  I remember about 5 years ago, I wanted to ask Mike about his thoughts \non Most Favored Nation status for China. So, I called him up. We talked \nbriefly and then he said, ``Max, do you have a few minutes?'' I said, \n``Of course.'' Then he proceeded to read to me an in-depth analysis he \nhad written on the U.S.-China relationship and China's role in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, that was the most cogent, trenchant analysis I had \never encountered or have ever seen to date. But that was Mike. In a \nmatter-of-fact tone, he just read it to me over the phone.\n  Mike's legacy includes, among many others, the Mansfield Center for \nPacific Affairs in Washington, D.C., and the Maureen and Mike Mansfield \nCenter at the University of Montana in Missoula.\n  These institutions live on. They teach us and our children the \nimportance of looking out across our borders, the importance of \nunderstanding different cultures. And that is more important now than \never.\n  That's a distinguished record. But Mike never lost touch with his \nroots. Mike was so humble. I told him once that I was looking forward \nto reading his memoirs one day. He simply said: ``Nope.''\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\n  He said many of those conversations were confidential. No kiss and \ntell for Mike. He was such a classy, deep, dignified, thoughtful, and \nwonderful person.\n  When I first considered running for Congress in 1974, I went to Mike \nand asked whether or not he thought I should run. ``Yep,'' he said. \nThat's how he used to respond to questions: Yep, nope, and maybe. Very \nstraight forward, he told it as it was.\n  He told me running for Congress took a lot of hard work, a lot of \nshoe leather, and a little bit of luck. That was enough for me.\n  That wasn't the last time I sought out Mike's counsel. Right up until \nhis death last Friday, I went to Mike for his advice on a variety of \nissues. I saw him just a few weeks ago, not long after the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. Even though he was laid up in a hospital bed, he \nimmediately said, ``Hi, Max,'' and invited me to take off my coat and \nhave a seat. At age 98, he was still sharp as a tack and just as \ngracious as ever.\n  We talked for some time before our conversation turned to \nAfghanistan. This was a man who knew so much. He talked about the \nhistory of Afghanistan--how the Russians and every would-be conqueror \nattempting to occupy that country ran into trouble. His history lesson \non Afghanistan was rich with such figures as Genghis Kahn and Alexander \nthe Great.\n  When a Japanese reporter once asked Mike about his secret of \nlongevity and health, Mike smiled and said, ``A good wife and good \nMontana people.'' Mike was always quick to point out that all the \nsuccess he had in life he owed to his beloved wife Maureen. Maureen \nHayes took him out of the mines of Butte and into greatness.\n  Her quiet encouragement gave Mike the strength to lead our nation \nduring some very difficult times: civil rights, the Vietnam War, \nWatergate. Maureen cashed in her life insurance policy to help pay for \nMike's education. And in Washington, she worked in his office without \ncompensation so she could spend more time with him.\n  What they did, they did together. Mr. President, Mike and Maureen \nwere a team, a great team. When Maureen passed away last year, we all \nmourned the loss. Today, we mourn the loss of Mike. But today we also \nfind comfort in knowing that the love affair that started so long ago \nhas come full circle. Now, Mike and Maureen are together.\n  Now, we as Montanans and Americans pay tribute to their lives and \ntheir contributions. Now, especially now, we look to their example of \nleadership through humility, integrity, and dignity.\n  Mike was the embodiment of family, saying so eloquently in Maureen's \neulogy, that what he did and accomplished, they did together. That \nrecognition of her greatness, strength and vision was Mike's greatness, \nstrength and vision.\n  I am proud and honored to have known Mike and Maureen Mansfield. They \nwere common people who led uncommon lives. They were great Montanans, \nthey were great Americans, and they were our friends.\n  Mike used to say he had three loves in this world: His wife, Montana \nand the U.S. Senate.\n  When I saw him just over two weeks ago in the hospital, we talked \nabout Montana, we talked about the Senate, and we talked world events. \nThen we talked about Maureen.\n  And right before I left him, he leaned back in his bed, looked off in \nthe distance, closed his eyes, smiled, and said, ``Maureen--what a girl \nshe was, what a girl.''\n  And Mike, what a great man you were. You were both great--together.\n  This is not goodbye, Mike. Rather, as our many Indian friends say, \n``See you later.'' And as you would say and said so many times to your \nmany Montana friends, Tap 'er light, Mike.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana for his comments about our former majority leader. I was \none of those who was fortunate enough, as he was, to know Senator \nMansfield--not nearly as well, of course, as Senator Baucus did, but \nwell enough to seek his counsel, to enjoy his friendship, to be \nprovided with his guidance on so many occasions over the years that I \nhave had the good fortune to serve as leader.\n  Mike Mansfield, in every way, shape, and form, was a Senator whom all \ncould admire, a Senator who understood that in this body of \nloquaciousness there is an eloquence to simplicity, that in this place \nof debate there is always an opportunity for decency, that in this \nlocation, as we consider those who are more prominently seen throughout \nthe country in positions of leadership, there is that quiet strength \nthat came from a Mike Mansfield.\n  Mike Mansfield once said, ``when I am gone, I want to be forgotten.''\n  With all due respect to my dear friend and teacher, he will never be \nforgotten.\n  Mike Mansfield began his service to America as Senator Baucus noted, \nwhen he was 14, when he managed to enlist in the Navy in World War I. \nEventually, he would serve in both the Army and the Marine Corps as \nwell.\n  He served 34 years in Congress, 24 of them in the Senate.\n  He said he achieved the height of his ambition when he was elected \nSenator from Montana. But it was certainly not the height of his \nachievement.\n  He served as majority leader longer than any other leader has in our \nNation's history--16 years.\n  Following that, for 12 years, under two Presidents--one Republican \nand one Democratic--he represented America as our Ambassador to Japan.\n  He said he had three great loves in his life. The first was obvious.\n  The first was his wife, Maureen--his partner for more than 65 years. \nShe was the one who forced an eighth grade dropout to leave the coal \nmines of Montana, go to college, and make something of himself.\n  The second was his beloved State of Montana.\n  The third was this institution, the U.S. Senate.\n  The Senate majority leader has been called ``the first among \nequals.'' No one deserved that title more than Mike Mansfield. He was \nwise. He was decent. He was endlessly patient. He was a man who deeply \nbelieved in the ability of free people to govern themselves wisely. It \nis no coincidence that the Mansfield years remain the most civil and \nthe most productive in our Senate's history.\n  He was a steady hand during turbulent times. In the sad and anxious \ndays that followed President Kennedy's death, Senator Mansfield's words \nand poise helped calm this Nation.\n  In the years that followed he led the Senate to the passage of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. During his \ntenure, he led the Senate through a war in Vietnam and the resignation \nof a President.\n  The last time Mike Mansfield spoke to a group of Senators was 3\\1/2\\ \nyears ago when he returned to the Capitol to inaugurate the leaders' \nlecture series begun by my colleague and friend Senator Lott. On that \nnight, Senator Mansfield delivered a speech that he had written many \nyears earlier. He wrote the speech to answer critics who said he was \nnot forceful enough as majority leader. He said he had intended to give \nthe speech on a quiet afternoon when there would be no news to compete \nwith. The date he had chosen was Friday, November 22, 1963.\n  A week later, as the Nation grieved, Senator Mansfield simply \ninserted his remarks in the Congressional Record. Thirty-five years \nlater, he returned to the Capitol and delivered them for the first \ntime. I want to read a section of those remarks.\n\n       I have always felt that the President of the United \n     States--whoever he may be--is worthy of the respect of the \n     Senate. I have always felt that he bears a greater burden of \n     responsibility than any individual Senator for the welfare of \n     the nation, for he, alone, can speak for the nation abroad; \n     and he, alone, at home, stands with the Congress as a whole, \n     as constituted representatives of the American people. In the \n     exercise of his grave responsibilities, I believe we have a \n     profound responsibility to give him whatever understanding \n     and support we can, in good conscience and in conformity with \n     our independent duties.\n       I believe we owe it to the nation of which all our states \n     are a part--particularly in matters of foreign relations--to \n     give to him not only responsible opposition, but responsible \n     cooperation.\n       And finally, within this body, I believe that every member \n     ought to be equal in fact, no less than in theory, that they \n     have a primary responsibility to the people whom they\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\n     represent to face the legislative issues of the nation. . . .\n       And to the extent that the Senate may be inadequate in this \n     connection, the remedy lies not in the seeking of shortcuts, \n     not in the cracking of nonexistent whips, not in wheeling and \n     dealing, but in an honest facing of the situation and a \n     resolution by the Senate itself, by accommodation, by respect \n     for one another, by mutual restraint and, as necessary, \n     adjustments in the procedures of this body.\n       The constitutional authority and responsibility does not \n     lie with the leadership. It lies with all of us individually, \n     collectively and equally. And in the last analysis, \n     deviations from that principle must in the end act to the \n     detriment of the institution. And, in the end, that principle \n     cannot be made to prevail by the rules. It can prevail only \n     when there is a high degree of accommodation, mutual \n     restraint and a measure of courage--in spite of our \n     weaknesses--in all of us.\n       It can prevail only if we recognize that, in the end, it is \n     not the Senators as individuals who are of fundamental \n     performance. In the end, it is the institution of the Senate. \n     It is the Senate itself as one of the foundations of the \n     Constitution. It is the Senate as one of the rocks of the \n     Republic.\n  So said Senator Mansfield and so it is advice to all of us. We are in \nthe Senate today considering matters of the gravest national \nimportance. I can think of no better advice than the sage guidance Mike \nMansfield left for all of us. His words are at least as important today \nas they were when he delivered them 3\\1/2\\ years ago and when he wrote \nthem 38 years ago.\n  We were lucky to have Mike Mansfield for as long as we did. Now we \nhave his remarkable example. That itself is a considerable gift. We \nshould treasure it. We should live by it.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go to his daughter Anne.\n  Contrary to Mike Mansfield's wishes, Mike Mansfield will never be \nforgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Mike \nMansfield, not from the standpoint of the eloquent eulogy given by the \nSenator from Montana, who knew Mike Mansfield so well, or the majority \nleader, who knew him and served with him. I didn't serve with Mike \nMansfield, but I did have a wonderful relationship with him in a very \ndifferent way.\n  The first time I ever saw the stature of Mike Mansfield was through \nhis picture that is in the Mansfield Room. For anyone who has been in \nthe Mansfield Room, which is one of the major meeting rooms in the \nCapitol, the picture of Mike Mansfield says so much about him because \nit is a very long, narrow picture with Mike Mansfield standing there \nalone, nothing behind him, just that solitary figure that is so very \npowerful.\n  That is exactly the kind of man I came to know. I go to the Senate \nprayer breakfast every Wednesday morning, where Senators and former \nSenators meet to talk about our feelings about religion. We have Jewish \nmembers. We have Catholic members. We have Protestant members. We have \neven had a member come and talk about agnosticism.\n  It is something we all keep very personal and private. It has been \none of the highlights of my service in the Senate to meet every \nWednesday morning and talk about religion and the importance of \nreligion in our lives and in the life of our Nation.\n  The special place Mike Mansfield held was in the Senate prayer \nbreakfast. He was coming to the Senate prayer breakfast all the way up \nuntil he died. He never missed a week except in the unusual \ncircumstance when Maureen had taken a turn for the worse or immediately \nfollowing Maureen's death, and then only when he was sick. And I would \ncall him if he missed one or two times and I was concerned about him. I \nwould find there was a reason, but he was going to be OK. Getting to \nknow him was wonderful.\n\n  It was kind of interesting because no one has assigned seats and it \nis a small room. Probably 30 of us come in any 1 week. But there are no \nassigned seats. You just take the seat that is empty--except for Mike \nMansfield's seat. He did have a regular seat. No one would sit in Mike \nMansfield's seat unless it was clear that he wasn't coming. He was \nalways there on time. So if we started and he wasn't there, someone \nmight sit in his seat, but never before because we revered having him \nthere. He was such a wonderful presence, and his countenance was always \nso positive.\n  I had the opportunity to talk to him because I generally sat next to \nhim. I started getting to know him when I joked with him. Here was Mike \nMansfield when he was 95, 96, 97, and he had a breakfast that was eggs, \nbacon, biscuits, and if they had gravy, it would have been on there, \ntoo. Do you know what. I have to sit by a guy who still eats like a guy \nbecause so many people are now into rabbit food, as we call it. This \nwas a guy who still ate like a guy. It gave me great hope that someone \nwho was 97 years old was eating like that. And so we started a \nfriendship that has lasted throughout my 8 years in the Senate.\n  I talked to Mike Mansfield about Japan. As many people know, he was \nour wonderful Ambassador to Japan immediately--not immediately \nfollowing his Senate leadership position, but he was appointed by a \nDemocrat, as well as a Republican President, because he was so \neffective in Japan and he understood that part of the world so well. I \nwould talk to him about the economic situation in Japan. As things \nwould look bad, I would ask him about it. He always had absolutely \ngreat insights. I remember a time when Mike Mansfield was telling me \nthat he worked for Goldman Sachs. He worked for Goldman Sachs all the \nway up until he died.\n  I said: ``Well, tell me what you do.''\n  He said: ``I advise them on the Far East and Japan.''\n  That is very important for the economy, of course, and for them.\n  I said: ``When did you start working for them?''\n  He said: ``Actually, they started calling me, and I thought there \nmust be a mistake, so I didn't return their calls.''\n  This was years ago.\n  So he said: ``They kept calling,'' and I said, ``I'm 88 years old; \nare you really serious about wanting me to go to work for you?'' He \nsaid only after they said: ``We know how old you are; we think you have \nvery valuable advice.''\n  So he agreed to go to work for Goldman Sachs and worked for them up \nuntil he died at the age of 98. He was so pleased that he could still \nbe helpful. We all knew that his mind never left him. He was so precise \nand up on issues that it would astound anyone. He read the London \nEconomist and the newspapers in Japan. He was very up to date.\n  I talked to Mike Mansfield once about Maureen, and I told him that I \nknew of the great love story; it is legendary around here, how \ncommitted he was to Maureen. She was bedridden for a long time. He \nwould go to see her regularly. He kept her in their apartment until he \njust could not take care of her, and then he would visit her daily when \nshe was being taken care of in another place.\n  I asked him about her, and he never forgot that it was Maureen who \nmade him what he was. That is what he said. Just as Senator Baucus \nrelated earlier, it was Maureen who saw this miner and saw that he \ncould be something more than a miner. So she encouraged him to get his \nhigh school education and then his college education. She saw in him \nsomeone who could make a great contribution, and he never forgot that, \nno matter how high he went. He went to the very highest level as the \ndistinguished majority leader and then as Ambassador to Japan. He never \nforgot that it was Maureen who made him what he was, and his love for \nher was so touching and so poignant. I enjoyed having that conversation \nwith him.\n\n  So my experience with Mike Mansfield was not during his active \nservice, as it was with so many of my colleagues here. My experience \nwith him was in a different way, but it was so rewarding. He would \nbring me clips from foreign newspapers that he thought would be of \ninterest to me. So I thought he was a great man in a different time of \nhis life.\n  It shows how much you can contribute if you stay active and keep on \ntop of world affairs, and that is what Mike Mansfield did. It was hard \nto believe that he was 96, 97, 98 years old if you were around him \nbecause he was so absolutely vivacious and clear. He wasn't a talkative \nperson, as has been mentioned. He was the strong, silent type--the \nepitome of what you would think of as the Marlboro Man who didn't feel \nas if he had to talk a lot. But certainly when he did speak, he had a \nlot to say, and it was clear and\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\nfocused; there was no excess. But you knew it was the wisdom of all \nthose years coming through.\n  I pay tribute to Mike Mansfield as a man who was a symbol of decency \nand humility in the Senate and throughout his public service career. \nHonesty and integrity will always be words that will be associated with \nthis great man. We have lost a friend and one of the great Members of \nthe Senate. I know that Republicans and Democrats will feel this loss \nfor a long time to come. I know his words and the speeches that were \nread by the majority leader will be here for us to remember a great \nleader and give us guidance as we go through the trying times we are \nfacing in our country today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to \nmy former Senate leader, Mike Mansfield. The State of Montana and the \nUnited States have lost a great man, a valiant soldier, a dedicated \nstatesman, and a gentleman of a breed we don't see enough of these \ndays.\n  Mike Mansfield was a revered figure whose distaste of partisanship \nled the Senate to accomplish great deeds for civil rights, voting \nrights, and foreign relations during Vietnam, the cold war, and the \nWatergate scandal. His leadership emphasized equality, cooperation, and \nfairness which were marked by his personal style of leadership. He was \nconsidered a quiet man who did not care for self-promotion, often \nanswering questions with a ``Yep,'' ``Nope,'' ``Maybe,'' or ``Can't \nsay.'' Although he was not known as an orator, his simple statements \nand words were extremely effective. He said in eulogy for John F. \nKennedy, ``There was a sound of laughter; in a moment, it was no more. \nAnd so she took a ring from her finger and placed it in his hands.'' In \nhis quiet manner, he managed to guide a exceptionally productive Senate \nduring a turbulent political era which could have become bogged down \nhad he not been able to work with both Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Mike was a Representative and Senator from Montana who came to \nCongress after dutifully serving his country in the military during \nWWII. At 14, he stretched the truth about his age in order to enlist in \nthe Navy. He then went on to serve in both the Army and the Marine \nCorps. Having returned from duty in 1922, he worked as a ``mucker'' in \nthe copper mines of Butte, Montana where he met Maureen Hayes. In 1932, \nhe married Maureen who is said to have played an essential role in his \nremarkable career. She was the person who convinced him to go back to \nschool, run for Congress, and become U.S. Ambassador to Japan under \nPresident Carter and President Reagan.\n  He was elected as the Senate Majority Leader in 1961, 5 years before \nI was elected to the Senate from South Carolina. I remember in 1971 \nwhen I was in Canada on my honeymoon with Peatsy, Mike's office called \nand asked us to come to Europe. Peatsy and I left Canada immediately \nand spent our honeymoon traveling around Europe with Mile and Muareen.\n  Mike served as Senate Majority Leader for 16 years-longer than anyone \nin Senate history. He was extremely involved in the civil rights \nmovement, a critic of the Vietnam conflict, and an advocate of health \ncare legislation. He was a man who was convinced that the true strength \nof the Senate lay in the center and not on the right of the left. \nPartisan politics was not his style, and his success lay in the fact \nthat he was an honest, straight shooting individual who cooperated and \nworked with both sides of the aisle.\n  We have lost a great statesman and a fine man who served his country \nwell.\n  The distinguished Senator from Montana was my role model. He believed \nin getting things done. In order to get things done, you have to listen \nand let everyone be heard. But once done, then move on.\n  He was particularly kind to me because I was just a freshman Senator \nin 1966. He had me immediately on what we call the policy committee. I \nthen, in 1971-1972, chaired the campaign committee for the Democrats on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  It so happened that I was off on a trip just after my wedding in \n1971. Senator Mansfield was asked by President Nixon to coordinate and \ncommunicate the 10-percent surcharge on imports with about 10 country \nheads in Europe and in Africa and Morocco. He called me. I was in \nCanada. He called and I came immediately back down to the Andrews air \nbase. We boarded the plane, and we went to Helsinki, Norway, Denmark, \nFrance, Germany, Italy, Spain, Morocco, of course, London, several, a \ncouple other countries, he and his wife Maureen and my wife Peatsy and \nmyself.\n  Watching him, how he responded and acted and more or less chaired \nthose meetings with the heads of state was really an inspiration to me. \nHe was so direct, so much to the point. We have so much in the field of \npolitical correctness now. Mike Mansfield was always politically \ncorrect, but he didn't bother around with all those nuances.\n  He was the finest of Senators and leaders in the history of this \nbody.\n  The best of Mike Mansfield was more or less said by himself in a \neulogy to his wife at the time of her funeral just last year. I \nincluded that eulogy. He permitted me to put it in the Record because I \nknew he had friends all over the country and the world. They wanted to \nbe with him in that trying moment. I knew that they would, more than \nany, appreciate the real Mansfield flavor if they could just hear him.\n  The most eloquent of all tributes to be paid to Mike Mansfield was \nsort of paid to himself when he made the eulogy to his charming wife \nMaureen, and I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Eulogy for Maureen Mansfield Delivered by Senator Mike Mansfield, \n                           September 26, 2000\n\n     1929\n       We met--She was 24 and I was 26.\n       She was a high school teacher; I was a miner in the Copper \n     mines of Butte.\n       She was a college graduate; I had not finished the 8th \n     grade.\n       She urged me to achieve a better education. I followed her \n     advice and with her help, in every way, we succeeded.\n       She took me out of the mines and brought me to the surface.\n     1932\n       We were married in Missoula during the great depression.\n       She gave up her teaching job.\n       She cashed in on her insurance.\n       She brought what little savings she had and, she did it all \n     for me.\n     1940\n       Maureen was very politically oriented--I was not.\n       She urged me to run for Congress.\n       We campaigned together.\n       We finished next to last.\n       The day after the election she put us on the campaign trail \n     for the next election and we won.\n     1942\n       Maureen was largely responsible for our election to the \n     House of Representatives.\n       Almost every summer she drove herself and our daughter, \n     Anne, to Missoula--5 days and 3,000 miles.\n       Why? To campaign for us and in\n     1952\n       She got us elected to the U.S. Senate.\n     1977\n       We decided--after talking it over, to retire.\n       We did not owe anything to anybody--except the people of \n     Montana--nor did anyone owe anything to us.\n     1977\n       President Carter asked me if we would be interested in \n     becoming the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. Maureen thought we \n     should accept and we did and when President Reagan called and \n     asked us to stay, we did for almost 12 years.\n     1988\n       Around Xmas Maureen almost literally forced me to go to the \n     Naval Hospital at Yokosuka, which sent me to the Army \n     Hospital at Honolulu, which sent me directly to Walter Reed \n     Army Hospital where I had heart bypass and prostate \n     operations.

Mr. President, I go from the debate, along \nwith my good chairman and leader, Senator Hollings, that tends to get \none's blood pressure up over the fact we are having to spend 30 hours \ndebating the airline security bill, to now go to the subject of great \nsadness over the passing of one of the greatest leaders that the Senate \nhas ever produced: Senator Mike Mansfield.\n  Growing up in my political adult lifetime, of course, he has always \nbeen someone to whom I have looked up. He was someone I looked up to \nwhile I was in college because he was already an established leader. He \nwas an assistant to the majority leader, Lyndon Johnson. He reigned \nbecause he was loved and respected as majority leader for an \nunprecedented 16 years. One of the greatest compliments I have read in \nthe commentary since his death was made by one who was on the other \nside of the aisle, Senator Scott, who paid him an extraordinary \ncompliment that he was one of the finest men he had ever met.\n\n  The fact that Senator Mansfield was selected by administrations of \nboth parties to represent this Nation in the nation of Japan as our \nAmbassador for an unprecedented long time also speaks volumes.\n  But the reason I felt compelled to come to the floor today was to \nshare with the Senate my observations of Senator Mansfield in the last \nfew months, for I had never really known Senator Mansfield except when \nI saw him faithfully every Wednesday as he attended the Senate prayer \nbreakfast. It is a private meeting completely off the record where \nSenators can come and share what is on their hearts. Who was the first \none there every Wednesday? None other than Senator Mansfield at age 98, \nas much a participant in that activity every week as anybody else in \nthe room, often with many of us deferring to him for his political, \nprofessional, and spiritual guidance.\n  That spoke volumes to this freshman Senator. It said something else \nto me about a man who has had so many accolades. But I saw a man that \nwas truly walking humbly with his God.\n  That is what I wanted to come to the floor of the Senate to share.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10352-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10352-S10353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STRUGGLING TOGETHER WITH TERRORISM\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, grief has changed the face of America. \nWe are a tear-stained nation, but in spite of that, we are united as \nnever before. Americans are wearing symbols on their lapels. They are \ndisplaying flags from their cars and windows, and they are donating \nmillions of dollars to victims' families. America has responded, as we \nalways do, with patriotism and purpose.\n  Today, we are uniting further in support of our troops flying \ndangerous missions in Afghanistan. This is the first step in a \nprolonged campaign against terrorism. It is a necessary step, and it \nwas directed at the right targets--the Taliban government, which has \ngiven safe harbor to terrorists and to organizations such as theirs for \nfar too long.\n  Americans are also united in sympathy with the Afghan people. While \nour bombers were flying over Taliban strongholds, our C-17s were \ndropping food to the refugees. Congress has also responded to the \nSeptember 11 attacks with unity and determination. We came together to \nsupport the people of Washington and New York by providing $40 billion \nto begin the relief effort. We came together to support the President \nand our military by authorizing the use of force in this new struggle \nwith terrorism. We came together to aid our airlines by enacting a $15 \nbillion stabilization package, and with the vote today in favor of \ncloture, we are poised to increase airline security.\n  We are now focused on our military action abroad and security issues \nat home, but we also need to deal with the severe economic problems the \nSeptember 11 attacks have caused. Our airlines are now flying and their \nshort-term economic crisis has been resolved. Now we must come together \nbehind the men and women who are the heart and soul of the airline \nindustry--the workers. The layoffs announced in the airline industry \nsince September 11 are staggering. We need only look at this chart to \nsee Boeing, 30,000; American Airlines, 20,000; United Airlines, 20,000. \nThe list goes on and on. Twenty to thirty percent of Boeing's orders \nfor new aircraft have been cancelled, and they plan to lay off as many \nas 30,000 workers. Then there are the airport workers, the \nconcessionaires, and the workers who make the airlines' meals.\n  The total number of announced layoffs in the industry is 140,000, and \nthat figure may continue to rise. These are not just numbers on a page. \nThese are men and women. These are moms and dads who up until just a \nfew weeks ago thought they had good paying jobs, believed they would be \nable to pay their bills, and were saving to send their children to \ncollege. They believed their future was secure.\n  These layoffs are going to affect communities all across the country. \nSt. Louis; Kansas City; Springfield, MO, have about 14,000 airline \nworkers, and they will be hard hit by these layoffs. The Boeing layoffs \nwill also cause hardships for every family in Everett, WA, and Wichita, \nKS. Any city that is home to a large hub airport--Pittsburgh, \nCleveland, Salt Lake City, Denver, Dallas, Chicago--will feel the \neffects of these layoffs.\n  Once the airline safety bill is under consideration, I will offer an \namendment. It will provide meaningful assistance for airline industry \nworkers who have lost their jobs as a result of the September 11 \nattacks.\n\n  My amendment will do three things: First, it will provide income \nsupport because many of these families live from paycheck to paycheck.\n  Second, it will provide job training so employees can prepare to work \nin other industries, or new jobs within the airline industry.\n  Third, it will give health care benefits so workers can stay in their \nhealth plan and keep their doctors while they are looking for work.\n  The benefits in my proposal would be available to employees of \nairlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and suppliers to airlines.\n  Obviously, airline industry employees are not the only ones who are \nlosing their jobs. When we do an economic stimulus package, I believe \nwe should address the problem more broadly. But the impact on the \nairline industry has been abrupt, immediate, and severe. Congress acted \nquickly and decisively to provide $15 billion of assistance for the \nairlines, and we should act with the same level of urgency for the \nairline industry workers.\n  It is interesting, when we did the airline bailout, I did not hear my \ncolleagues saying we should wait until we came up with a package to \nhelp other industries that were impacted by the attack. But now, when \nit comes to the workers, all of a sudden some argue we need to slow \ndown.\n  We did the right thing for the airlines when we acted quickly. We \nshould do the same thing for the workers as well.\n  Another criticism of this proposal has been assistance is already \navailable for displaced workers, and there is no need to provide \nadditional help.\n  I have modeled my package of benefits on the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act, which provides benefits to workers displaced due to \nproducts imported into the United States.\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Act provides additional assistance \nbeyond standard unemployment insurance. It also provides resources to \nretrain laid-off workers so they can get back to work.\n  In passing the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, Congress determined \nto support workers who lose their job due to the vagaries of \ninternational trade. Can we not again determine that workers who are \nlaid off as a direct result of a terrorist attack on the United States \nalso deserve assistance?\n  The primary difference between my amendment and the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act is the inclusion of health care coverage for the \ndisplaced worker. We have had lots of discussion during this Congress \nabout how to address the problems of the uninsured. Today is the chance \nfor Members to take a courageous step that will prevent 140,000 workers \nand their families from joining the rolls of the uninsured.\n  Some have also said the best way to help workers is to keep the \nairlines going. That is about half right. We did the right thing \nhelping the airlines, and that has protected thousands of jobs. The \nassistance bill did not do anything for those workers who were put out \nof a job or have no immediate prospects of being rehired and will now \nhave to seek work in an economy that has slowed.\n  Last week, the President highlighted three things that should dictate \nthe way we undertake efforts to stimulate the economy and help \ndisplaced workers. He said we should take actions that will, first, \nencourage economic growth. Second, we should be bipartisan and instead \nof creating new programs, we should make use of the programs that \nalready exist and make them work better. I strongly agree.\n\n  My amendment is consistent with these principles. First, it will \nencourage growth by providing income assistance and job training \nbenefits to airline employees who have recently been laid off.\n  Second, the amendment has bipartisan support. Senators Fitzgerald, \nBrownback, and Gordon Smith have signed on as cosponsors.\n  Finally, it makes use of an existing program, the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program, that was put in place to help displaced workers in \ntimes of need.\n  While the President's plan is a step in the right direction, I \nbelieve we need stronger action at this time. As we did with the \nbailout and the disaster relief package, we need to act boldly. We need \nto make sure those airline industry workers who were laid off suddenly, \nwith no time to make preparation, receive immediate assistance, obtain \nretraining, and are able to retain their health care. The President's \npackage does not guarantee these benefits for everyone covered by my \namendment.\n  I am extremely pleased this amendment is being supported by the \nairline industry. The airlines know their employees have been dealt a \nsevere blow and deserve help. Our Governors have also known many \ncommunities around the country are going to be hard hit.\n  As Carl Sandburg once reminded us, ``We are Americans. Nothing like \nus ever was.''\n  Now is the time for us to stand together, and that means standing \ntogether behind our industries and our workers. Every day we delay, our \neconomy suffers. Every day we delay, families struggle to pay bills. \nEvery day we delay, children go without health insurance. Let us do \nwhat is right for those who need it most.\n  I am pleased my proposal has received bipartisan support, and I hope \nit will be adopted by the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the Air Transport Association and a letter from a tripartisan \ngroup of 13 Governors be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Air Transport Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The member airlines of the Air Transport \n     Association deeply appreciate your leadership in obtaining \n     the economic stabilization package enacted September 22. \n     Without this assistance the very viability of the industry \n     would have been in question.\n       Even with the adoption of the airline stabilization package \n     many of our members have found it impossible not to furlough \n     large numbers of employees. Just as the economic disaster \n     that has befallen the airline industry is the result of our \n     being used as an instrumentality of the terrorists, these \n     dedicated employees face very serious adverse economic \n     consequences. These employees, along with those still \n     working, are the backbone of our industry. We are working \n     very hard to put this difficult period behind us and, \n     hopefully, bring them back as soon as the economic situation \n     allows us to.\n       In the meantime, we strongly support the prompt adoption of \n     legislation to provide these workers with displacement \n     assistance including extended unemployment benefits, training \n     and retraining, and the continuation of health care coverage. \n     It is only fair and reasonable that we ensure that adequate \n     provisions are made for the basic protections for the workers \n     who face extreme economic hardship in the weeks and months \n     ahead.\n       The airlines and their workers are inextricably linked in \n     the battle against terrorism. We must ensure that all \n     participants are adequately protected, and we urge the prompt \n     enactment of worker relief legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carol B. Hallett,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  October 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senator Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We applaud the Congress' timely response to \n     appropriate funds for recovery and relief efforts in the \n     aftermath of the devastating attacks of September 11th. \n     Likewise, we strongly supported Congressional legislation to \n     assist the airline industry, which has suffered incredible \n     financial losses.\n       However, we believe that the Congress should also provide \n     assistance to displaced workers who have been laid off as a \n     result of the ongoing security crisis. Airlines and related \n     employers are laying off tens of thousands of workers, and \n     industry experts are estimating that more than 130,000 people \n     could lose their jobs. These displaced workers are going to \n     need financial assistance--and because we do not know how \n     long they will be out of work, it is important for the \n     federal government to act now to ensure that the necessary \n     assistance is available to those who might need it.\n       S. 1454, the Displaced Workers Assistance Act, would \n     provide financial assistance, training, and health care \n     coverage to those workers displaced due to the attacks of \n     September 11, 2001. The benefits would be distributed within \n     the framework created by the Trade Adjustment Act.\n       We are writing in support of S. 1454. States, of course, \n     will finance the initial 26 weeks of unemployment assistance. \n     However, federal financing of an additional 52 weeks of \n     unemployment insurance and the extension of health coverage \n     will protect those unemployed workers that might not \n     otherwise have a safety net. The additional funding to help \n     train those individuals who cannot be expected to return to \n     the airline industry, and those who would need new training \n     to prepare for a different job within the industry, is \n     definitely needed. We also support providing 8 months of \n     Medicaid to those who do not qualify for COBRA coverage, and \n     26 weeks of unemployment compensation to those who would not \n     normally be eligible for their state programs.\n       It is difficult at this time to determine how long our \n     displaced workers will be out of work. Obviously, they are \n     going to need financial assistance. States will do their job \n     to assist these vulnerable citizens, but we need the federal \n     government to help provide the funds to do so. Please work \n     with us to enact S. 1454.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               13 State Governors.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN.

Mr. President, I am not going to take long. I know \nthere are other colleagues who are going to want to speak, but I do \nwant to talk about where we are right now in this Senate Chamber. I \nwant to try to do that not in an abstract way but in relation to what \nis happening throughout the country and, particularly, I want to talk \nabout my State of Minnesota.\n  Yesterday we had a field hearing in Minnesota. It was a formal \nhearing of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training of which \nI am lucky enough to chair. It was just absolutely packed with people. \nI am not sure that is good news. I think it was packed with people \nbecause we have had a sharp economic downturn, and it affects a broad \nsection of the population in Minnesota and around the country.\n  I said yesterday that I cannot remember--and I think I said this to \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer--another time in my adult life when \nI ever felt as if our country was facing three challenges or crises and \nall at the same time.\n  One of them has to do with the world that we live in--military \naction, use of force in Afghanistan. I have said back home that I very \nmuch want this action to be successful. I think it is terribly \nimportant that it is with the most careful targeting. I think it is \nessential that we do everything we know how to do to minimize the loss \nof innocent civilian life.\n  I pray for the men and women of our armed services, and, frankly, I \npray no innocent Afghan, or anyone else, is killed in this process.\n  I had a chance to talk with the Ambassador to Pakistan today and was \nasking her how things were going in her country. And she, too, talked \nabout how it is so important that what we do militarily, and in many \nother ways, we do in the right way. Whatever we do has to be consistent \nwith our own values. That means, above and beyond the use of force, \ndealing with the humanitarian crisis, dealing with the massive hunger \nand starvation in Afghanistan, and doing everything we can to minimize \nthe loss of civilian life.\n  Then there is the whole question of physical security in our own \ncountry. Today Chairman Kennedy and the HELP Committee had very \npowerful hearings. The distinguished Chair testified about his work and \nsome of his legislation as to what we need to do to better defend our \nown homeland. Then there is economic security. What I rise to discuss \nbriefly is my indignation about some of the opposition and delay. Quite \noften, one person's political truth is another person's political \nhorror. We are all different, and political truth can be illusive. We \nhave different ideas. People of good conscience can disagree. That \nalways is the case, including now as well.\n\n  I have to say I don't really know how any Senator, Democrat or \nRepublican, can go home, after we have provided $15 billion of help for \nthe airline industry--which we should have done; I don't think they are \nplaying Chicken Little crying that the sky is falling in--now and be \nunwilling to provide the employees with help.\n  Senator Carnahan has an amendment, in which a number of us have \njoined--it makes all the sense in the world--extending unemployment \ninsurance to a full year, picking up the cost of COBRA or helping \npeople get Medicaid assistance--when you lose your job, the other thing \nthat is so terrifying in our country is, you lose your health care \ncoverage for yourself and your loved ones--making sure that that is \nthere, making sure the funding is there for training. I am just amazed \nat the opposition to this amendment. I am amazed that we have been \nhaving to go through cloture votes, and now people want to burn up yet \nmore time.\n  For my own point of view, I don't think we should move. Senator \nHollings is right that one of the best ways to get this industry back \non its feet is to have people think they are safe. God knows the whole \nnotion of federalizing the security forces is what the vast majority of \npeople are for. That is apparently being opposed. There are other \ncolleagues who talk about Amtrak and say there has to be a commitment \nto that as part of our transportation system. They are right.\n  What I want to relate today is what Senator Dayton and other \ncolleagues from Minnesota, Democrats and Republicans, heard at our \nfield hearing, which was all the employees, 4,500 people out of work, \nwho were asking: What about us? You helped the industry. Fine. But what \nabout working families? What about us?\n  I said about a week ago now that I believe the people values are \ncoming out in the country. September 11 and beyond, people really are \nvery committed to helping one another. I can't quite figure out why \nthat has not extended to the Senate.\n  There will be plenty of discussion about this in the Chamber, but as \nfar as I am concerned, this is the place we draw the line. This airline \nsecurity bill has to pass. If there is opposition to federalizing part \nof the security forces, so be it; we will vote on it. If there is \nopposition to providing the help to employees I just outlined, the \nCarnahan amendment, then we will vote on it. If there is opposition to \nother amendments, then we will vote on them.\n  I just can't, for the life of me, understand the opposition. I can't \nunderstand why we wouldn't want to help people flat on their back. \nFrankly, I don't want to go back home to Minnesota and face these \nemployees and tell them that Congress was unwilling to provide the \nhelp.\n  I thank the majority leader and the whip, Senator Reid, for their \ncommitment. I am committed to this fight. We are unified as a country. \nThere is no question about it. We have to be our own best selves. To \nme, part of being your own best self is to speak out and advocate for \npeople you love and believe in who need help. That is what we are \ntalking about right now.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the Senator has offered a \nresolution--in fact, did so last week--commending the Capitol Police \nfor the valiant work they did on September 11 and what they have done \nsince then; is that true?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is true. I did offer an amendment, and I was \nhoping that every single Senator would support it. I thought on \nThursday or Friday maybe the whip could help me out. I actually \nsubmitted it. I didn't want to make a big hoo-ha about it. I wanted to \nthank the Capitol Police and thought maybe we would pass it by \nunanimous consent. Then we could send it out and let everyone know we \nhave expressed our appreciation.\n  My understanding is, it has been blocked; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding. We wanted that cleared last week, \nbut somebody is holding this up. My friend knows how holds work. We \nhave a general idea from where they come but not specifically from \nwhom. I say to the Senator from Minnesota, he has always been such a \nsupporter of the Capitol Police. He has always been thoughtful and kind \nto them. I have seen that as he walked through the Capitol. I \npersonally am so grateful for the work they have done. Prior to \nSeptember 11, I always felt really strongly about the work they did. \nSince September 11, my emotions have run much higher.\n  I commend the Senator from Minnesota for this resolution. I want him \nto know we are going to continue to talk about this resolution until it \nis cleared. Otherwise, we will try to figure out a way to get a vote on \nit so anyone who has the audacity to stand and not say to the Capitol \nPolice they have done a good job will have to come forward and be \ncounted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will not speak much longer. Let me \nsay to the whip--who, by the way, also was a member of the Capitol \nPolice, the only one in the Senate--I thank him. I don't even want to \nmake a big deal of this. In fact, I am almost embarrassed about it. \nThis now is going to become a point of contention? I am a pretty good \nrabble-rouser. I didn't think this would be something on which we would \nhave to go this far.\n  My hope is that it will pass. I say to the whip that I would like to \nget his help, that if this doesn't clear today, then I will prepare an \namendment. I would love to have the whip's support\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\nand do it with him. We will just come out here and have a debate, I \nsuppose, if Senators are opposed to the resolution of support. Above \nand beyond that, we are talking about a lot of Capitol Police. They are \nworking 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Frankly, the whip discussed this \nwith me. Above and beyond just the resolution saying ``thank you for \nyour support,'' the other point is the additional resources. With all \ndue respect, there will have to be additional resources to go to them \nfor them to be able to do this job.\n  I thought when I came back that this resolution would have been \npassed. I wouldn't have thought there would have been any controversy. \nI thought we then could notify the police.\n  Now what we will do is talk about it for a day or so. We will keep \nasking who is holding it up. We will keep asking why. It is hardly a \nway to say thank you to the police. And if necessary, we will have an \namendment on it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, I am hopeful and confident that it is \njust a misunderstanding. Otherwise, we will have to move forward as the \nSenator from Minnesota has indicated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10355-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I was actually thinking about reading \nsome of the descriptions and testimony of some of the people who spoke \nyesterday.\n  Let me just say one more time that on this one, we don't budge until \nwe get the help for the employees. That is all there is to it. If that \nis the difference between Democrats and Republicans, so be it. That \nwould make me proud to be a Democrat. If it does not end up being the \ndifference between Democrats and Republicans and we do it in a \nbipartisan way, all the better. But we are not waiting any longer. I am \nnot going back home again this weekend trying to explain to people how \nin the world the Senate could not provide them some support.\n  My final point is, the truth is, we need to be doing this business \nand more because, frankly, we have something else that is ahead of us, \nwhich is all the other people in Minnesota and in the country who have \nbeen affected, all of the other people who are losing their jobs, \nwhether it be in the tourism industry, hotel/restaurant, related to \ntourism, whatnot, whether it be small businesses, or whether it be \npeople in high-tech. There are a lot of people right now who are out of \nwork. A lot of small businesses lost some of their business, and they \nnever had a lot of capital to rely on in the first place.\n\n  So I just say to colleagues that we are in a serious recession in our \ncountry. These are hard economic times. We need to put a stimulus \npackage together next week. We need to have the stimulus package large \nenough to make a difference. It has to be something that focuses on \ngetting money into the hands of consumers--those who will make \npurchases right away. It has to take effect within the next couple of \nmonths, frankly, to really make a difference. There are a lot of people \nwho, A, could use the help and, B, this would put purchasing power back \ninto the economy. Unemployment benefits need to be extended and \nimproved. There is the health care coverage for people and child care \nexpenses, and there is the workforce development and work training that \nis so important. There are ways in which we can invest in rebuilding \ncrumbling schools and affordable housing and creating jobs at the same \ntime. There is a whole lot we need to do, and we need to do it now. \nThat is part of the crisis that is staring us in the face. Yet we are \nin morning business for another 2 hours this afternoon.\n  I just wanted to make it clear that--and I think I am speaking for \nother Democrats--we are not giving any ground on getting help to the \naviation employees and others, and we are going to do it this week on \nthis bill. We are not going to give any ground on safety, and we are \ngoing to pass this bill this week. We are also going to move on and get \nserious about an economic stimulus package as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Because of the unanimous consent agreement, I ask that the time \ncontinue to run on the motion to proceed because it is the same morning \nbusiness we asked it to run against; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, about a half hour ago, President Bush was \nin the Rose Garden for a ceremony. During the question-and-answer \nperiod, the President expressed some great concern--in my judgment, \njustifiable concern--about the leaking of classified information that \nwas given to some Members of Congress. Apparently, at least a couple \nMembers of Congress, on a couple of occasions, have leaked that \ninformation to the press.\n  In my judgment, the President has every right to be very upset about \nthat. This country has asked its young men and women in military \nservice to risk their lives in this time of national emergency. As they \nundertake military operations in parts of the world that are thousands \nand thousands of miles from here, it ill-serves our country's interests \nto have any Member of Congress, under any circumstance, at any time, \ngoing to a classified briefing and then disclosing the information from \nthat classified briefing to a member of the press.\n  The solution, I might say, is not, however, for the administration to \nstop briefing the Congress about classified material. The solution, I \nwould urge the President, would be for us to find out which Member of \nCongress has leaked classified information and then make certain that \nthis Member of Congress--House or Senate--is not given classified \ninformation in the future.\n  I know this is a difficult area and a difficult set of circumstances, \nbut this country faces some very difficult days ahead.\n  The September 11 terrorist attacks that were committed against this \ncountry changed almost everything. The need for security is quite \nevident to almost everyone in this country.\n  The terrorist attacks require this country to respond. The President \nhad no choice. We cannot ignore those attacks. We had to respond to \nthose attacks. And the President has the full support of the American \npeople in his response, in my judgment, and certainly the full support \nof the Congress.\n  But I just want to say that the President was dead right this \nafternoon in\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nexpressing anger about the disclosure--the unlawful disclosure and \nunauthorized disclosure--of classified information. Members of the \nHouse or the Senate who would disclose classified information to the \npress that they received in classified briefings do no service to this \ncountry.\n  I would hope the administration and the President, rather than \ndeciding they will not share that information with Congress, would \ndecide that they would sanction those who have misused that classified \ninformation.\n  In order for Congress to do its work, and in order for the committees \nin Congress to do their work, information must be made available, even \nclassified information. But the President is correct that information \nmust be treated as classified, treated as top secret, and cannot be \ngiven to the press. An unauthorized disclosure, in my judgment, \nundercuts this country's interests.\n  I hope the President's admonition today, and I hope the discussion by \nother Members of Congress about this, will convince the administration \nthey ought to continue the briefings. They are helpful and important as \na part of this process. But some of us in Congress full well understand \nthe President's concern about the unauthorized leaks that have \noccurred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10356-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week the House of Representatives \npassed a new farm bill. That piece of legislation is an important step \nforward because most of us believe the current farm bill does not work. \nThe so-called Freedom to Farm bill, in fact, has been a disaster for \nfamily farmers now for many years. It had no ability to help farmers \nduring tough times to provide for disasters and collapses in commodity \nprices. Because of this, each year Congress has had to come up with \nemergency funding at the end of the year.\n  We did that. We did not do enough, but we did some each year to try \nto repair the hole in the so-called Freedom to Farm bill. That bill now \nexpires at the end of next year and needs to be replaced.\n  The House of Representatives, God bless them, said: No. We should not \nwait until next year. We should write a new farm bill now. And it ought \nto be in place for the next crop-year when people go into the fields \nnext spring. We in the Senate now have the obligation to do the same, \nand I believe we will do the same.\n  With respect to the bill that the House of Representatives enacted \nlast week, let me say this: I think it is better than the Freedom to \nFarm bill. They have made progress. Good for them. I commend them.\n  There are some things we need to do better than they did in the House \nbill. For example, in my part of the country we raise a great deal of \nwheat and barley. The loan rates, for example, for wheat and barley are \nnot significant enough, when compared to other crops. They are far too \nlow in the House bill. So we need to make some adjustments to that \npiece of legislation.\n  Farm benefits ought to be better targeted to family farmers, in my \njudgment, as well. We have had the development in this country of these \ngiant agrifactories. Well, that is not what we are trying to preserve. \nIf this isn't about preserving family farms, families that are trying \nto live out their lives in the country and make a living on the family \nfarm, if that is not what this is about, then, in my judgment, we do \nnot need a farm bill.\n  Abraham Lincoln started the Department of Agriculture with nine \nemployees in the 1860s. As you know, a century and a half later, it is \na behemoth organization. If a farm bill is only to support the giant \nagrifactories of the world, then count me out. But if it is to support \nfamily farms, I say: Good; it is important. And it is important to this \ncountry's future that we maintain a network of family farm food \nproducers.\n  There is a national security interest as well for the Senate to do a \nfarm bill. The House has done the bill, so we also ought to do it \nbefore we adjourn, in the interest of national security.\n  What is the national security interest? The other evening on national \ntelevision, they described a feedlot with nearly 200,000 cattle in it \nover the year. This is a giant agricultural enterprise that brings \nlarge numbers of cattle together and feeds them in a huge series of \nfeedlots. They talked about the potential of bioterrorism entering the \nfood supply, and how convenient it would be for those giant \nagrifactories to be a target for efforts in bioterrorism.\n  It seems to me a broad network of family producers across this \ncountry tends to thwart that.\n  Security of America's food supply is best achieved by a network of \nfamily farms producing America's food. That is why a farm bill is so \nimportant.\n  We have the obligation and the opportunity in the Senate to do the \nright thing. Between now and when we leave at the end of this session \nof Congress, we should pass a farm bill, go to conference, reach \nagreement with the House, and then send a farm bill to the President \nthat he will sign. I understand the President says he doesn't support \nthe bill passed by the House of Representatives. The fact is, however, \nif it is not his priority, it is ours. We ought to write a good farm \nbill and send it to him.\n  I believe at the end of the day he will support it because the House \npassed it with a veto-proof majority. I would expect a good farm bill \nwill pass the Senate with a similar majority.\n  I believe we ought to waste no time. I have talked to the majority \nleader and others about it. He agrees. Let's try to do what we can do \nto pass a farm bill in the Senate, then go to conference and see if we \ncan't get a farm bill signed into law before the end of this year. That \nway, family farmers who go into the fields next spring will understand \nwhat the new farm bill will be and will be able to plan accordingly.\n  It will certainly be better than the Freedom to Farm bill, a bill \nthat has undercut the interests of families trying to make a living on \na family farm.\n  Very few people in this country have seen their income cut as \ndramatically as the average family farm income has been cut over the \nyears. This loss of income, then, is somewhat ironic. We are dropping \nfood into Afghanistan because people are on the abyss of starvation; we \nhear reports of old women climbing trees in Sudan to forage for leaves \nto eat; and one-half a billion people go to bed every night with an \nache in their belly because it hurts to be hungry. All told, thousands \nof children die every day from hunger and hunger-related causes. Yet \nthe farmers of South Dakota and North Dakota and Kansas and Montana and \nNebraska are told, when they load their truck with wheat or barley and \ntake it to the country elevator, that which they produce has no value. \nThey are told the food somehow has no value, that the price is \ncollapsed because it is not worth very much. It seems to me that much \nof the world is placing great worth on that which we produce in great \nabundance on America's farms.\n  If we can't find a way to connect that which we produce to those who \nneed it, then we are not thinking hard. The surest road to stability \nand peace in the world is to try to help people who are hungry. We must \nplace a value on the food our family farmers produce. Again, there is a \ndisconnection there somewhere. We need to find it and reconnect it.\n  Let me again say, I hope in the coming couple of weeks we will, in \nthe Senate, make it a priority to write a farm bill, bring it to the \nfloor, and go to conference with the House. We have that obligation to \nour family farmers. That ought to be our responsibility now. It is not \nonly good for family farmers; it is good for American security \ninterests, for food security interests to do that. I hope we will do it \nsoon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10356-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10356-S10361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AVIATION SECURITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to the consideration of \nS. 1447.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me correct a statement I made \nsometime last week when we were checking\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\ninto the practice of other countries with respect to airport security. \nWe were told that of the countries in Europe, all were Government \nemployed. That should be corrected. That is not the case. In fact, \nFrance, Belgium, the Netherlands, and England, those four countries, \nhave contracts, but they have the health benefits and the guaranteed \nvacation and other benefits guaranteed by the Government. It is a sort \nof hybrid situation.\n  Of 102 countries around the world with significant air travel \nsystems, only 23 use contract screeners. I think that is not the point \nI want to make this afternoon.\n  No one would suggest that we take the security for the President of \nthe United States; namely, the Secret Service, and privatize it, \ncontract it out. Nor would anyone recommend privatizing the security \nthat the distinguished Chair, myself, and other Senators receive, the \nCapitol Police, who incidentally have been working around the clock, \ndoing an outstanding job. You can go on down the list, whether it is \nCustoms, whether it is the Border Patrol, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service that has some 33,000 personnel, no one in the \nHouse or Senate has suggested that we contract that out.\n  No one has suggested we contract out the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation with the thousands of professionals conducting the \ninvestigation right now. No one suggests that they take some 669,000 \ncivilian workers in national defense and contract them out. In fact, \nthere was a suggestion by the OMB earlier this year to do just that. \nThe OMB folks called over to the Pentagon and said: We are looking at \ndownsizing and we want to get some contracting out of 5 to 10 percent \nof your civilian workers. And the Department of Defense said: That will \nnever happen. We are in the security business.\n  Yet the big hangup is federalization, the Government taking over the \nresponsibility of security for air travel in America.\n  Now, we have tried after Pan Am 103 back in 1988, with more training, \nmore hours, more supervision, extra this and extra that, to no avail; \nwe had TWA 800 in 1996 and again the Gore commission with more \ntraining, more supervision, and what have you. And now we have 6,000 \nkilled and 13,000 casualties. To me, it will take unmitigated gall, \nwith the recent experiences in mind, to come forth with a contracting \nout proposal.\n  Only a while ago did I learn why we are having to put up with this \nnonsense. All you have to do is read Roll Call, ``Airport Firms Form \nAlliance.'' The airport firms formed an alliance with a Swedish company \nand call themselves the Aviation Security Association. And who do they \nhave as members? The contractors that want to keep continuing their \nmisdeeds. For instance, one of the association members, Argenbright had \nthe contract for the Dulles and Newark airports.\n  Now, let's read about Argenbright. I find in an article on September \n13 in the Miami Herald:\n\n       The security company that provides the checkpoint workers \n     at the airports breached by Tuesday's hijackers has been \n     cited at least twice for security lapses.\n       In its worst infraction, Atlanta-based Argenbright Security \n     pleaded guilty last year to allowing untrained employees, \n     some with criminal backgrounds, to operate checkpoints at \n     Philadelphia National Airport.\n       In settling the charges, Argenbright agreed to pay $1.2 \n     million in fines and investigative costs.\n       . . . Argenbright was also found to have committed dozens \n     of violations of Federal labor laws against its employees at \n     Los Angeles International Airport, an administrative law \n     judge ruled in February 2000.\n\n  Here we are trying to do the work of the people of America, and we \ndon't have any Senators listening. They are listening to the lobbyists, \nthe K Street crowd, who are down here working the different Senators, \nand I can't explain to them the problem of security at the airports. \nMind you me, those who are falsifying records, if you please, are now \nsaying what we have to do is have contracting out; we can't federalize.\n  Of course, that appeals to the crowd that comes into public service \nby promising to get rid of the Government. ``The Government is not the \nsolution, the Government is the problem.'' That is all they all talk \nabout. They are thinking of what? Of next year's reelection. They are \nnot thinking of security. They are thinking: Wait a minute now, I was \ngoing to downsize and get rid of the Government, and now I supported \n18,000 screeners and some 10,000 other airport personnel--some 28,000 I \nam going to put on the Government payroll, and my opponent is going to \nsay: He promised to get rid of the Government, and he went and voted to \nadd 28,000 more Government jobs.\n  That is the problem--along with the blooming lobbyists. They are \ntrying to carry out their political commitments. They are not looking \nout for the safety of the traveling public in America. The worst thing \nwe have ever done is give the money to the airlines. They didn't take \ncare of the employees. I had Herb Kelleher, of Southwest Airlines, tell \nme he did not furlough a single employee and maintained 100 percent \nservice. But they were all going broke. Why? Because the lobbyists took \nover--the same crowd that came running around hollering they were all \ngoing to go broke. Here I am fighting to do the people's work, and \nSenators are gathered together in their offices with all of these \nairline lobbyists. This is the fifth week since September 11, and we \ncan't pass airline security.\n  All of America wants this responsibility fixed within the Government. \nNo one for a second, as I say, would suggest that the FBI and the \nSecret Service, the Border Patrol, and Customs, or any of the other \nsecurity agencies--no one would suggest that the 669,000 civilians in \ndefense be contracted out. According to the lobbyists the Government is \ntoo big, the Government can't do anything. They ought to be ashamed of \nthemselves. Look at what is happening. Turn on your TV if you want to \nsee what Government can do. Look at these attacks on Osama bin Laden \nand the Taliban. I don't know--there are some 31 different military \ntargets, with 2 countries involved, B-2s coming all the way from \nMissouri, ships stationed in the Indian Ocean, planes coming off Diego \nGarcia--all Government, Government recruited, Government fed, \nGovernment housed, Government trained, Government deployed, with \nprecision work that we all praise--but we can't get a Government \nairport security screener. Oh, no, no, that would be against my \nideology. No, we want contracting out, privatization.\n  We now know what we are putting up with in this lobbyist crowd and \nthe silly ideology that the Government can't do anything. Well, I am \nproud of our Government; I am proud of our deployment. We are going to \ncorrect this situation, and we are not going to have an Executive \norder. I have heard word that the administration might implement an \nExecutive order to take care of it and say Congress is dragging its \nfeet.\n  We are trying to go along and be bipartisan and everything else \nbecause this is a bipartisan bill, reported unanimously out of the \nCommerce Committee. We have been ready to vote and take amendments, \nconsider them and vote upon them. But they are going to say now that we \nare going to have to get an Executive order because we are dragging our \nfeet and can't get security out of the Congress, mind you me.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am delighted to yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was listening with interest to the Senator about this \nissue of national objectives and Federal employees doing airport \nscreening. I know there are some who think there is nothing in \nGovernment that can be done correctly. But I say them, that they should \ngo to ground zero in New York City, the site of these terrorist acts, \nand talk to the firefighters and law enforcement people. They will then \nunderstand that those Government employees, those firefighters who lost \ntheir lives, were climbing the stairs of those twin Trade Towers even \nas they were coming down. As that fire broke out in both buildings and \npeople began to evacuate those buildings, those firefighters were going \nup with full backpacks. People told me--and I read reports--of seeing \nfirefighters on the 20th floor and the 30th floor, nearly out of \nbreath, climbing the stairs of those buildings. Those are public \nservants providing a public service that is unmeasurable in its value \nto this country.\n  So when I hear people talk about Government workers in a disparaging\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\nway, I say this: There are a lot of people who commit themselves to \npublic service in this country who, every day and every way, every \nhour, protect this country and stand up for the interests of this \ncountry. Yes, I'm describing the firefighters of New York, and the law \nenforcement folks in New York and New Jersey and the surrounding \nregion, but this public service also occurs in every community across \nthis country, every single day.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has proposed, and I support, the \nnotion that at the 100 largest airports in this country we federalize \nthe screeners who are screening baggage so that they are following \nnational standards and national training guidelines. It makes great \nsense to me. And with respect to the other airports, I believe the \nSenator proposed that local airports could contract with law \nenforcement officials and others to do the same thing.\n  But it seems to me that--I guess I will ask the Senator this \nquestion, finally, that we are hung up on this issue at this moment: \nThe issue of aviation security is of paramount importance to this \ncountry. Why? Because some people don't like the notion that we would \nreplace the big companies that have now contracted to provide this \nservice--service where inspector after inspector has shown us you can \ndrive a truck through the holes in the service. They decide: We don't \nwant to do it. Therefore, we will hold up the legislation and not allow \nit to continue.\n  How long, I ask the Senator, have we been held up on the floor of the \nSenate by this ideology that says we won't allow there to be Federal \nscreeners at the Nation's largest airports? How long?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are into the fifth week. We are into the fifth week \nsince the attacks. We immediately held these hearings, and I called the \ndistinguished Secretary of Transportation the week of this occurrence. \nIt was on the following Thursday immediately after September 11th. I \nsaid: I am going to set this hearing up. I said: You can enhance \ncockpit security by installing reinforced cockpit doors. We found in \nIsrael that once you secure that cockpit--and Boeing said they could \nretrofit doors immediately in the next 2 to 3 weeks, and then they will \nhave a more secure door. They have a retrofit package for the planes \nright now, and if you and I were head of an airline, we would \nimmediately require this for the security of our pilots.\n\n  We want pilots to fly, not fight. Once they secure that door, then \nyou do not have disturbed individuals storming that door as we had on \nthat Los Angeles to Chicago flight. That ends hijacking for all intents \nand purposes, because never again can they use an air flight as a \nweapon of mass destruction.\n  I do not want to pass up the eloquence of the observation of the \nSenator with respect to these firefighters. They are the best in the \nworld. They are not paid enough. They are working extra hours, and they \nwere willing, as the Senator says, to give their life to try to save \nthose lives while the building was coming down. They thought there \ncould be a chance they would save a life or two, and they were going up \nthose steps. That is fixed in my mind.\n  We should be ashamed of ourselves for delaying this bill. We get all \nboiled up about procedure. We have to move now. Once we moved 97 to 0 \nto cloture, we need to go ahead to the bill itself. Why are we not \ndebating the bill this afternoon and passing it tonight?\n  There are two or three amendments. Let us vote on those amendments. \nThey could be just ideas. We are not hard and fast, except on one \nthing, and that is to get airport security. Yes, there is flexibility \nin the bill. We live in the real world.\n  Take small, rural airports such as at Bamberg and Orangeburg, SC. \nThey are not used to having the federalization of the system, but we \nhave to have the Federal standards for inspections to make certain they \nhave airport security. We do not want a plane coming from, say, Bamberg \nto fly into Charlotte and then the passengers get off, never having \nbeen checked properly, to come into Washington, never having had the \nproper security check.\n  So that is a lesson I learned from El Al, the Israeli security \nagents, and the chief pilot at El Al. He told me, for example, once \nthat cockpit door was closed, they could be assaulting his wife in the \ncabin, but he does not open the door. That is why, when they heard this \nRussian plane that had come out of Israel exploded and went down into \nthe Black Sea last weekend, they knew immediately it was not from a \nbomb, because for 30 years they have known they are not going to get \nanywhere. They are still investigating the possibility that a Ukrainian \nmissile gone astray may have caused the crash. They might start a fight \nand hurt, say, 5 people, but not 5,000. But the pilot immediately lands \nand already has law enforcement waiting to take over.\n  The rule used to be--and I guess still is unless that FAA is getting \ngoing--if I am the pilot and you come forward and say, this is a \nhijacking and I want to go to Havana, Cuba, you say, oh, yes, I always \nwanted to go to Cuba; let's all go to Havana, wonderful, yes--just go \nwherever the hijacker wants and get it down and then let law \nenforcement come.\n  No, the rule has changed and ought to have been changed 3 weeks ago, \nand they are still dillying around wondering about contractors and the \nemployees.\n  I actually had a meeting with the transportation officials, and they \nwere talking about 9 months to a year to get this thing done. \nAbsolutely ludicrous. We are in an emergency situation. We have men \ncommitted in battle, putting their lives on the line, and we are \ntalking about maybe securing our airlines in a year's time even though \nwe have already sent $15 billion to the airlines.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield further for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not mean to interrupt the Senator, but I was \ninspired listening to his discussion and I want to make a couple of \nadditional comments, concluding with a question.\n  It is not unusual for politicians to compliment themselves, but the \nSenator from South Carolina is not someone who would ever do that. So \nlet me pay a compliment to Senator Hollings and also to Senator McCain. \nThe Senator has brought a bill to this Chamber that makes good sense. \nHe worked on this legislation in a manner of developing a consensus, \nworked in a bipartisan way, brought a bill in a very timely manner, and \nthen, as the Senator from South Carolina has said, it has been hung up \nnow for some weeks.\n  It is inexplicable that in a time of national emergency--and it is \nthat, not just with respect to national security issues but also with \nrespect to this economy--it is inexplicable that there is, among some, \nbusiness as usual in the Senate. This is not business as usual. In my \njudgment, it ought to be a circumstance where, if someone disagrees \nwith what Senator Hollings and Senator McCain have brought to the \nfloor, then by all means offer an amendment, make their best case and \ntry to strip it out.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Have a record vote and strip it out.\n  As I understand the circumstances, those with whom the Senator \ndisagrees at this point, they are content just preventing the Senator \nfrom considering this bill because they do not want to have a vote. \nThey will lose the vote, and lose the vote by a fairly large margin.\n  Will the Senator from South Carolina agree with that assessment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with that assessment, and part of that \nassessment should go right to the lobbyists. This is actually a \nheadline: Airport firms form alliance. Well, they did not form an \nalliance for safety or security. They formed an alliance to feather \ntheir own nests. They are not interested in security, and that is what \nthe hold-up is over with that political stand-off of ``get rid of the \nGovernment.'' They are thinking about their reelection campaigns next \nyear. They are not thinking about the security of airline travel in \nAmerica, I can say that.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield one final time for a question? I \ndeeply appreciate his indulgence.\n  The reason this is important, aside from basic safety, which I think \nis paramount, is the airline industry and commercial aviation are \ncritically important to this country's economy. Prior to September 11 \nour economy was very soft, and the airline industry as a leading \neconomic indicator was hemorrhaging in red ink going into September 11. \nThen the Government shut down the entire commercial aviation\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\nsector, just shut it down completely. Now that it has begun to start up \nonce again, people are leery, are worrying about whether or not they \nwant to get back on an airplane. People are cancelling trips. They are \ncancelling conferences.\n  The thing is, Government has the obligation to say to those people \nwho have images in their head of an airplane crashing into a trade \ntower over and over again, we have a responsibility to say to people we \nare taking effective, decisive, and immediate action to deal with \nsecurity on commercial airliners in this country, and that is why there \nis this urgency.\n  Yes, it is about this industry, but even more so it is about this \neconomy. It is important that we do this, that we do it right, and that \nwe do it immediately.\n  Let me again say I think the leadership of the Senator and the \nleadership of Senator McCain is something all of us should cherish, and \nI hope we can get to this bill and get it moving, have the votes, and \npass this legislation. I support what the Senator is doing.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator. It is proper to \nmention the leadership of Senator McCain, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison \nof Texas, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator Olympia Snowe of \nMaine, and it has been bipartisan; this was not a partisan approach.\n  We have tried over the past 15 years to set professional standards \nfor airline security, more hours of training, more supervision. But \neven with all of the contract standards, with all the training, with \nall the supervision, they are falsifying the records and putting people \nwith criminal records in as the screeners, and they say: Let us keep \ndoing it. Give us some more standards. Give us some more training. Come \non.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. REID. I recognize the Senator is not talking about contracting \nout, but the Senator mentioned contracting out, and I am an opponent of \ncontracting out. I have seen what it has done to Federal installations \nin the State of Nevada where these outside contractors come in and say, \nwe will give you a real good deal, and they give a contract this year, \nand the next year it goes up and up and up, where we would have been \nbetter off sticking with Government in the first place.\n  So I thank the Senator from South Carolina very much for bringing to \nthe attention of the American public the fact we have to federalize the \nsafety of these airplanes and to also alert the American public that \ncontracting out is not a panacea for good government.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. We want those in charge of security to \nhave their minds set on just that, not the bottom line, not the profit. \nWe are going to do the oversight. We will look and see whether there is \nany fat, or anything else of that kind. The truth of the matter is, we \nhave to have accountability. The only way to do it now is to fix it. \nDon't have some security measures over here, some over there, and then \nnot check in there.\n\n  If you go to the onion ring security structure of the Israel Security \nAgency and El Al, the Israeli airline, you can see exactly you can't \nhave any gaps. They start with the outer perimeter of intelligence. \nIncidentally, Senator, when I mention intelligence, harken the New York \nTimes article by Bobby Inman, Admiral Inman, former head of the CIA, \nwhich recounts how our intelligence went down, down, down, was \ninadequate, and brought about--indirectly, obviously--these September \n11 attacks. It never could have occurred if we had the intelligence \nagents like before.\n  I became involved in intelligence matters under the Hoover Commission \nin 1954. We had McCarthy running around about security. So President \nEisenhower appointed the commission on the reorganization of the \nexecutive branch under former President Herbert Hoover. I served as one \nof the six members of that task force going into the CIA, Army, Navy, \nair intelligence, security, Secret Service, special clearance, atomic \nenergy. At that time we had the entire sphere of security and \nintelligence. Under Alan Dulles we had a real outfit, but it has gone \ndown, down, down with respect to high, high costs of technology. And \nthe technology is so amazing to you and me that we can see this and \nrecognize that. We collect as much intelligence information as they \nhave in the Library of Congress, perhaps, every day. But nobody looks \nat it, they just say: Oh, look at all the information we are getting.\n  In addition to that, when they are talking about analysts, we want \nsomething to look at, but we don't want too much analysis. They have \nGeneral Scwharzkopf on TV. All weekend he was on the TV. I will never \nforget the briefing he gave us when he returned from Desert Storm. He \ntold a Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that CIA analysts rounded \nthe edges, they cut the corners, they protected their backsides. When I \ngot it--I am going to use the word he used--it was ``mush.'' He said it \nwas of no value, it was mush. I had to go to my pilots in order to get \nthe intelligence and find out how I could move forward.\n  Now that is what we have been limping along with. It is our fault. \nThere is no question about it. But read what Bobby Inman said. The \nintelligence is starting at the outer perimeter of a security system. \nThe intelligence is keyed on not just the screener, but when they get \nto the departure gate, to the pilots, to the marshals on that plane and \neverything else. And it is not a one-way feed. It is back and forth, \nall the time. You know somebody is not going to come through with a \nknife or a gun. The entire airport is a screening place now.\n  All we do, the Senator and I, we get our ticket to go down to Miami. \nThe agent says here is your ticket; you have seat 9A. So I call my \nfriend who has been out there for 2 years working on the tarmac. He \nknows when I call, that is the signal. I will take the 12 o'clock \nflight, 9A, to Miami. He is out there and he goes to seat 9A and tapes \na pistol or tapes a box cutter or whatever else they are using. Or you \ndon't have to wait, just go to the counter and you get your seat \nassignment. Then you just drift around in the crowd. You have already \nalerted your friend on the tarmac and you are by the window and give \nthe signal, 9A, and he puts a weapon under the seat.\n  You have to check and have absolute security, not just for screeners \nbut with the person who vacuums the plane. You have the marshals. They \ncome in and they check those things. They don't take their seat and \nwait for a hijacking, just sitting there eating and drinking. They are \nalert and know exactly what they are looking for. They look for \nsuspicious actions and reactions on the plane by any of the passengers. \nThey know what to look for. We have to get serious about security \nbecause it comes right down to the aircraft.\n\n  As I pointed out, once you secure that door, that for all intents and \npurposes ends the hijacking of commercial flights. But since they have \nbeen flying planes, I don't know how we control private flight.\n  There are many more opportunities for terrorism beyond airlines. But \nonce we secure airlines, we can try to get some of the other things \ndone on the railroads, on the seaports, that the Senator from Florida \nand his senior colleague, Senator Graham, have been pointing out for \nyears. In fact, we have the bill on the calendar, seaport security. \nThey can take one of those containers which is hardly looked at, bring \nit into New Jersey, and drive it down to Times Square and have the \ncontainer full of anthrax, 40,000 pounds.\n  There can be all kinds of acts of terrorism. This thing is not the \n100-yard dash. It is the endurance contest. We have to endure, sober up \nand get serious. We need to cut out all of our reelection concerns \nabout what we promised to do in getting rid of the Government and that \nkind of thing. We are elected by the people to make the Government \nwork, and work efficiently and economically.\n  By the way, this is paid for, Senator. That is the genius of this. \nAll you have to do is put $2.50 or $3 and we are arguing that backwards \nand forwards, but we will get the amount, and that will take care of \nall the screeners, make sure every bag has gone through the screener. \nIf I go through now and take a bag--they just put out the rule I cannot \ntake but one--but a bag goes through the screener. Why let baggage that \ngoes into the cargo be different? All of the cargo should be screened, \nair marshals on all of these flights, particularly cross-country and \ndown to\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\nFlorida, up and down the seaboard, up and down California, and across \nthe country. We have to have those marshals on the plane. Once they \nknow that, America comes back again.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator has been a great inspiration to me \nand all the members of the Commerce Committee which he chairs. What a \ngreat inspiration it is to see on matters of grave national importance \nthat the Senator, as chairman, and the ranking member, Senator McCain, \nwork so closely together. I want the Senator to know that observation \ncomes from many Members.\n  What troubles me is that certain Members of this Chamber, for either \nideological reasons or for partisan reasons or for parochial reasons, \nwould not recognize what the chairman of the Commerce Committee and the \nleadership is saying, how important to the national defense of this \ncountry it is to produce legislation on airline security so that the \nAmerican people believe we are following through on a promise we made \nto them so they will be encouraged to get back on the airlines and \nstart flying. This will help all of the collateral industries such as \ncar rental companies, such as hotels, such as restaurants, tourism \ndestinations, and so forth.\n  As we say in the South, it is just beyond me----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is beyond this Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That we would have people hold up this \nlegislation, cause us to have 30 hours of debate not on the bill but \njust on a motion to proceed to get to the bill. The big hangup is over \nfederalizing the airline passenger screeners.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Everybody in America wants the most \nproficient, the most trained, the most expert, and well-paid people \ndoing the adequate and professional and thorough job of screening \npeople when they go through those checkpoints. If that means \nfederalizing, then we ought to be getting about the business of the \nAmerican public and passing this legislation and moving it.\n  I want to add a comment and also another compliment to the Senator, \nour chairman. Over the weekend I visited two ports in Florida. I \nvisited, on Friday, the Port of Pensacola. In the warehouse there, I \nfound a huge load of sacked flour that was going to Tadzhikistan. \nFortunately, those 100-pound sacks of flour were red, white, and blue \nso people would know where it was coming from--the USA.\n  That is what we need to do if we are going to try to win the hearts \nand minds of people as we have had such tremendous success doing in \nNorth Korea, a Communist dictatorship. The food we have sent in there \nis in these red, white, and blue sacks so people know where it is \ncoming from--the USA. So I was very gratified to see that.\n  But when I went to the Port of Pensacola on Friday and the Port of \nJacksonville yesterday, Monday, it was to talk about security and to \ntalk about the bill the Senator had passed out of committee on \nSeptember 14 and the amendment that he intends to add, increasing the \namount available, both in grants and in loan guarantees, for the 300 \nports that we have in this country in order for them to upgrade \nsecurity because, if we are looking at vulnerability, where a terrorist \nmight attack, clearly a port--whether it be a cruise ship or whether it \nbe a commercial ship with a precious cargo or whether it be a port \ncolocated with a military facility or, in the case of the Port of \nPensacola, where they would be responsible for loading and unloading \nmilitary equipment--not for the Pensacola Naval Air Station but for \nHurlburt Air Force Base, which is the head of the Air Force Special \nOperations Command--be it any of those particular roles that a port \nplays, we have to upgrade security there.\n  I thank our chairman for his leadership. Wouldn't it be nice to get \nto the port security bill, if we could get through the airline security \nbill?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. Exactly. We are bogged down in here and they \nall seem to be enjoying it. I do not understand.\n  I understand you have to be considerate. We are not ramming anything. \nWe do not want to, for example, ram this bill through the House. They \nare going to have their say, and they do have their say. But heavens \nabove, let's move it over to them so they can have their say.\n  We want to be considerate--and you have been too generous to me. The \npoint is with respect to seaports, 9 out of 10 containers coming in are \nnot even looked at. If Senator Nelson and Senator Hollings wanted to \nget into the drug business down in Colombia, we would fill up 10 \ncontainers full of cocaine and send it in. I can tell you right now, \nyou have 9 of them that would go through and we would have made a \nfortune. We don't mind one getting caught; that is the name of the \ngame.\n  What they have been trying to do is brag how fast they could move \ncargo through. Up there in New Jersey they not only go to the port, \nthen they go to a staging area 25 miles farther. In between the time \nthey go from the port, actual dock to the 25-mile site, some of them, \nthey never see those trucks again. They don't know where they went or \nwhatever happened to them. They just do not show up for the \ninspections.\n  The DEA says, no, it is the Customs' fault. Customs say, no, it is \nthe port's fault. The port says, no, it is the Coast Guard's fault. The \nCoast Guard says you are running the port and you are in charge. But no \none is in charge. That is where we have had it with these contractors.\n  We are not going to give this the runaround. We are going to fix this \nresponsibility once and for all. With the seaports, under the law, the \ncaptain of the port is the responsible officer. You cannot just put in \none bill and wave a wand and all of a sudden you have security. You \nhave to give them time and money and let them change the culture and \nget in step. Labor is absolutely concerned about background checks of \nthose working the docks, just as they were in El Al. They had trouble, \nthe El Al security people and the El Al chief pilot said, yes, we had \nproblems too with labor, and we finally got past that and everybody is \nsubject to these background checks and periodic spot checks for \nsecurity.\n\n  When you mention FAA--and that is one of the reasons we put it under \na Deputy Secretary of Transportation and not under the FAA--last week I \nhad the distinction of meeting, if you please, with the former \nchairman, on the House side, of the Transportation Appropriations \nCommittee of FAA. He told me some of the horror stories. For spot \nchecks he had the individual given the pictures and told: We are going \nto make spot checks down in Florida next week, so you go to these \nparticular airlines and show them the pictures because these are the \nfellows coming through making the spot checks.\n  That is how incestuous the FAA has become. That is why the airlines \ncontinue to say they want to be able to provide the money.\n  No, no, they are going to be Federal employees with Federal pay. It \nis going to be subject to appropriations. Why? Because we know already, \nunder the Airport and Airways Improvement Act, we owe them $15 billion \nbecause you and I and the Government have been using that $15 billion \nto balance the budget, to cut the deficits down and try to get \nsurpluses. We have not given them airport security. We have not given \nthem airport improvements.\n  So when we look at this, our distinguished colleague and friend, the \nSenator from the State of Washington, Mrs. Murray--she has that \ncommittee. She is going to have the oversight. With Senator Byrd, the \nfull committee chairman, along with Senator Stevens, the ranking \nmember, we are going to have it subject to appropriations.\n  The gamesmanship is stopped. We have gotten dead serious about this \nsituation. We are going to fix the responsibility and have \naccountability, accountability, accountability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business, and the time I consume be \ncounted against the 30 hours of postcloture debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business'')\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10361-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10361-S10362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE WORDS OF GORDON HINCKLEY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every 6 months the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-Day Saints, referred to as the Mormon Church, has a semiannual \nconference. Every 6 months, for 3 days, the leaders of the church get \ntogether and those people who are members of the church come to Salt \nLake City to the relatively new auditorium which holds approximately \n22,000 people. It is broadcast and telecast around the world to 11 \nmillion members of the church.\n  The reason I come to the floor today is to read to the Senate a few \nselect paragraphs from a statement that was given by the president of \nthe church, a 92-year-old man by the name of Gordon Hinckley.\n  I will ask unanimous consent at the appropriate time to have the full \nstatement printed in the Record.\n  His statement started with the words:\n\n       I have just been handed a note that says a U.S. missile \n     attack is underway.\n\n  Keep in mind that this is being telecast to 11 million members of the \nchurch and millions of others who are watching.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       You are all acutely aware of the events of September 11, \n     less than a month ago. Out of that vicious and ugly attack we \n     are plunged into a state of war. It is the first war of the \n     21st century. The last century has been described as the most \n     war-torn in human history. Now we are off on another \n     dangerous undertaking, the unfolding of which and the end \n     thereof we do not know.\n       For the first time since we became a nation, the United \n     States has been seriously attacked on its mainland soil. But \n     this was not an attack on the United States alone. It was an \n     attack on men and nations of good will everywhere. It was \n     well-planned, boldly executed, and the results were \n     disastrous. It is estimated that more than 5,000 innocent \n     people died. Among these were many from other nations. It was \n     cruel and cunning, an act of consummate evil.\n\n  Skipping a couple of paragraphs, he went on to say:\n\n       Now we are at war. Great forces are being mobilized and \n     will continue to be. Political alliances are being forged. We \n     do not know how long this conflict will last. We do not know \n     what it will cost in lives and treasure. We do not know the \n     manner in which it will be carried out. It could impact the \n     work of the Church in various ways.\n\n  Skipping again a couple of paragraphs, President Hinckley went on to \nsay:\n\n       Those of us who are American citizens stand solidly with \n     the President of our nation. The terrible forces of evil must \n     be confronted and held accountable for their actions. This is \n     not a matter of Christian against Muslim. I am pleased to see \n     that food is being dropped to the hungry people of a target \n     nation. We value our Muslim neighbors across the world and \n     hope that those who live by the tenets of their faith will \n     not suffer. I ask particularly that our own people do not \n     become a party in any way to the persecution of the innocent. \n     Rather, let us be friendly and helpful, protective and \n     supportive. It is the terrorist organizations that must be \n     ferreted out and brought down.\n\n  Skipping two paragraphs, he went on to say:\n       On the Larry King television broadcast the other night I \n     was asked what I think of those who, in the name of their \n     religion, carry out such infamous activities. I replied, \n     ``Religion offers no shield for wickedness, for evil, for \n     those kinds of things. The God in whom I believe does not \n     foster this kind of action. He is a God of mercy. He is a God \n     of love. He is God of peace and reassurance, and I look to \n     Him in times such as this as a comfort and a source of \n     strength.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full statement of \nGordon B. Hinckley be printed in the Record, with the understanding \nthat his statement is one that lays out what most Americans believe: \nthat we are in a time of trouble; that there are things we can do as \nAmericans to respond. But the most important thing we can do to respond \nis to treat our fellow man with the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you \nwould have them do unto you; be kind, thoughtful, and considerate to \nthose you come in contact with on a daily basis. This is the most \nimportant thing we can do to thwart the actions of these terrible \npeople who did these terrible, evil deeds on September 11.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The Times in Which We Live\n\n   (By President Gordon B. Hinckley of the Church of Jesus Christ of \n                           Latter-day Saints)\n\n       My beloved brethren and sisters, I accept this opportunity \n     in humility. I pray that I may be guided by the Spirit of the \n     Lord in that which I say.\n       I have just been handed a note that says a U.S. missile \n     attack is under way.\n       I need not remind you that we live in perilous times. I \n     desire to speak concerning these times and our circumstances \n     as members of this Church.\n       You are all acutely aware of the events of September 11, \n     less than a month ago. Out of that vicious and ugly attack we \n     are plunged into a state of war. It is the first war of the \n     21st century. The last century has been described as the most \n     war-torn in human history. Now we are off on another \n     dangerous undertaking, the unfolding of which and the end \n     thereof we do not know.\n       For the first time since we became a nation, the United \n     States has been seriously attacked on its mainland soil. But \n     this was not an attack on the United States alone. It was an \n     attack on men and nations of good will everywhere. It was \n     well-planned, boldly executed, and the results were \n     disastrous. It is estimated that more than 5,000 innocent \n     people died. Among these were many from other nations. It was \n     cruel and cunning, an act of consummate evil.\n       Recently, in company with a few national religious leaders, \n     I was invited to the White House to meet with the President. \n     In talking to us he was frank and straightforward.\n       That same evening he spoke to the Congress and the nation \n     in unmistakable language concerning the resolve of America \n     and its friends to hunt down the terrorists who were \n     responsible for the planning of this terrible thing and any \n     who harbored such.\n       Now we are at war. Great forces are being mobilized and \n     will continue to be. Political alliances are being forged. We \n     do not know how long this conflict will last. We do not know \n     what it will cost in lives and treasure. We do not know the \n     manner in which it will be carried out. It could impact the \n     work of the Church in various ways.\n       Our national economy has been made to suffer. It was \n     already in trouble, and this has compounded the problem. Many \n     are losing their employment. Among our own people this could \n     affect Welfare needs, and also the tithing of the Church. It \n     could affect our missionary program.\n       We are now a global organization. We have members in more \n     than 150 nations. Administering this vast worldwide program \n     could conceivably become more difficult.\n       Those of us who are American citizens stand solidly with \n     the President of our nation. The terrible forces of evil must \n     be confronted and held accountable for their actions. This is \n     not a matter of Christian against Muslim. I am pleased to see \n     that food is being dropped to the hungry people of a target \n     nation. We value our Muslim neighbors across the world and \n     hope that those who live by the tenets of their faith will \n     not suffer. I ask particularly that our own people do not \n     become a party in any way to the persecution of the innocent. \n     Rather, let us be friendly and helpful, protective and \n     supportive. It is the terrorist organizations that must be \n     ferreted out and brought down.\n       We of this Church know something of such groups. The Book \n     of Mormon speaks of the Gadianton Robbers, a vicious, oath-\n     bound, and secret organization bent on evil and destruction. \n     In their day they did all in their power, by whatever means \n     available, to bring down the Church, to woo the people with \n     sophistry, and to take control of the society. We see the \n     same thing in the present situation.\n       We are people of peace. We are followers of the Christ who \n     was and is the Prince of Peace. But there are times when we \n     must stand up for right and decency, for freedom and \n     civilization, just as Moroni rallied his people in his day to \n     the defense of their wives, their children, and the cause of \n     liberty.\n       On the Larry King television broadcast the other night I \n     was asked what I think of those who, in the name of their \n     religion, carry out such infamous activities. I replied, \n     ``Religion offers no shield for wickedness, for evil, for \n     those kinds of things. The God in whom I believe does not \n     foster this kind of action. He is a God of mercy. He is a God \n     of love. He is God of peace and reassurance, and I look to \n     Him in times such as this as a comfort and a source of \n     strength.''\n       Members of the Church in this and other nations are not \n     involved with many others in a great international \n     undertaking. On television we see those of the military \n     leaving their loved ones, knowing not whether they will \n     return. It is affecting the homes of our people. Unitedly, as \n     a Church, we must get on our knees and invoke the powers of \n     the Almighty in behalf of those who will carry the burdens of \n     this campaign.\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\n       No one knows how long it will last. No one knows precisely \n     where it will be fought.\n       No one knows what it may entail before it is over. We have \n     launched an undertaking the size and nature of which we \n     cannot see at this time.\n       Occasions of this kind pull us up sharply to a realization \n     that life is fragile, peace is fragile, civilization \n     itself is fragile. The economy is particularly vulnerable. \n     We have been counseled again and again concerning self-\n     reliance, concerning debt, concerning thrift.\n       So many of our people are heavily in debt for things that \n     are not entirely necessary. When I was a young man, my father \n     counseled me to build a modest home, sufficient for the needs \n     of my family, and make it beautiful and attractive and \n     pleasant and secure. He counseled me to pay off the mortgage \n     as quickly as I could so that come what may there would be a \n     roof over the heads of my wife and children. I was reared on \n     that kind of doctrine. I urge you as members of this Church \n     to get free of debt where possible, and to have a little laid \n     aside against a rainy day.\n       We cannot provide against every contingency. But we can \n     provide against many contingencies. Let the present situation \n     remind us that this we should do.\n       As we have been continuously counseled for more that 60 \n     years, let us have some food set aside that would sustain us \n     for a time in case of need. But let us not panic nor go to \n     extremes. Let us be prudent in every respect. And above all, \n     my brothers and sisters, let us move forward with faith in \n     the Living God and His Beloved Son.\n       Great are the promises concerning this land of America. We \n     are told unequivocally that it is a ``choice land and \n     whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from \n     bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under \n     heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is \n     Jesus Christ'' (Ether 2:12). This is the crus of the entire \n     matter-obedience to the commandments of God.\n       The Constitution under which we live and which has not only \n     blessed us but has become a model for other constitutions, is \n     our God-inspired national safeguard ensuring freedom and \n     liberty, justice and equality before the law.\n       I do not know what the future holds. I do not wish to sound \n     negative, but I wish to remind you of the warnings of \n     scripture and the teachings of the prophets which we have had \n     constantly before us.\n       I cannot forget the great lesson of Pharaoh's dream of the \n     fat and lean kine, and of the full and withered stalks of \n     corn.\n       I cannot dismiss from my mind the grim warnings of the Lord \n     as set forth in the 24th chapter of Matthew.\n       I am familiar, as are you, with the declarations of modern \n     revelation that the time will come when the earth will \n     be cleansed and there will be indescribable distress, with \n     weeping, and mourning, and lamentation (see D 112:24).\n       Now, I do not wish to be an alarmist. I do not wish to be a \n     prophet of doom. I am optimistic. I do not believe that the \n     time is here when an all-consuming calamity will overtake us. \n     I earnestly pray that it may not. There is so much of the \n     Lord's work yet to be done. We and our children after us, \n     must do it.\n       I can assure you that we who are responsible for the \n     management of the affairs of the Church will be prudent and \n     careful as we have tried to be in the past. The tithes of the \n     Church are sacred. They are appropriated in the manner set \n     forth by the Lord Himself.\n       We have become a very large and complex organization. We \n     carry on many extensive and costly programs. But I can assure \n     you that we will not exceed our income. We will not place the \n     Church in debt. We will tailor what we do to the resources \n     that are available.\n       How grateful I am for the law of tithing. It is the Lord's \n     law of finance. It is set forth in a few words in the 119th \n     section of the Doctrine and Covenants. It comes of His \n     wisdom. To every man and woman, to every boy and girl, to \n     every child in this Church who pays an honest tithing, be it \n     large or small, I express gratitude for the faith that is in \n     your hearts. I remind you, and those who do not pay tithing \n     but who should, that the Lord has promised marvelous \n     blessings (see Malachi 3:10-12). He has also promised that \n     ``he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming'' (D \n     64:23).\n       I express appreciation to those who pay a fast offering. \n     This costs the giver nothing other than going without two \n     meals a month. It becomes the backbone of our Welfare \n     Program, designed to assist those in distress.\n       Now, all of us know that war, contention, hatred, suffering \n     of the worst kind are not new. The conflict we see today is \n     but another expression of the conflict that began with the \n     war in heaven. I quote from the book of Revelation:\n       ``And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels \n     fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his \n     angels,\n       ``And prevailed not, neither was their place found anymore \n     in heaven.\n       ``And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, call \n     the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was \n     cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with \n     him.\n       ``And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come \n     salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the \n     power of his Christ'' (Rev. 12:7-10).\n       That must have been a terrible conflict. The forces of evil \n     were pitted against the forces of good. The great deceiver, \n     the son of the morning, was defeated and banished, and took \n     with him a third of the hosts of heaven.\n       The Book of Moses and the Book of Abraham shed further \n     light concerning this great contest. Satan would have taken \n     from man his agency and taken unto himself all credit and \n     honor and glory. Opposed to this was the plan of the Father \n     which the Son said He would fulfill, under which He came to \n     earth and gave His life to atone for the sins of mankind.\n       From the day of Cain to the present, the adversary has been \n     the great mastermind of the terrible conflicts that have \n     brought so much suffering.\n       Treachery and terrorism began with him. And they will \n     continue until the Son of God returns to rule and reign with \n     peace and righteousness among the sons and daughters of God.\n       Through centuries of time, men and women, so very, very \n     many, have lived and died. Some may die in the conflict that \n     lies ahead. To us, and we bear solemn testimony of this, \n     death will not be the end. There is life beyond this as \n     surely as there is life here. Through the great plan which \n     became the very issue of the war in heaven, men shall go on \n     living.\n       Job asked, ``If a man die, shall he live again?'' (Job \n     14:14).\n       He replied:\n       ``For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall \n     stand at the latter day upon the earth:\n       ``And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in \n     my flesh shall I see God:\n       ``Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, \n     and not another'' (Job 19:25-27).\n       Now, brothers and sisters, we must do our duty whatever \n     that duty might be. Peace may be denied for a season. Some of \n     our liberties may be curtailed. We may be inconvenienced. We \n     may even be called on to suffer in one way or another. But \n     God our Eternal Father will watch over this nation and all of \n     the civilized world who look to Him. He has declared: \n     ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord'' (Psalms \n     33:12). Our safety lies in repentance. Our strength comes of \n     obedience to the commandments of God.\n       Let us be prayerful. Let us pray for righteousness. Let us \n     pray for the forces of good. Let us reach out to help men and \n     women of good will whatever their religious persuasion and \n     wherever they live. Let us stand firm against evil, both at \n     home and abroad. Let us live worthy of the blessings of \n     heaven, reforming our lives where necessary, and looking to \n     Him, the Father of us all. He has said: ``Be still, and know \n     that I am God'' (Psalms 46:10).\n       Are these perilous times? They are. But there is no need to \n     fear. We can have peace in our hearts and peace in our homes. \n     We can be in influence for good in this world, every one of \n     us.\n       May the God of heaven, the Almighty, bless us, help us, as \n     we walk our various ways in the uncertain days that lie \n     ahead. May we look to Him with unfailing faith. May we \n     worthily place our reliance on His Beloved Son who is our \n     great Redeemer, whether it be in life or in death, is my \n     prayer in His Holy Name, even the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been talking about aviation \nsecurity. While the chairman of the Commerce Committee is still in the \nChamber, I want to get a few things straight. The amendment that is \nhanging out there for this piece of legislation has nothing to do with \nairport security--nothing. In all other parts of the debate, we are so \nclose to agreement it is unbelievable. And those areas can be ironed \nout.\n  I am one, as the chairman knows, who has an amendment that would put \nthe authority of airport security under the Justice Department. There \nis a very good reason for that. The model is already in front of us.\n  The Attorney General can either have the Marshals Service or the FBI, \nwhichever, put them in charge of airport security, and then give them \nthe leeway if they wanted to contract using their standards and their \nclearance, making sure, I would imagine, that the people who work as \nscreeners or baggage handlers or with the cargo could stand the \nscrutiny of a security clearance.\n  The chairman of the Commerce Committee, and rightly so, invited \nmembers of El Al's security team in to visit with us. We sat there and \nlistened to them. I was impressed with what they did. I think the \nSenator would have to admit that. But they only have 31 airplanes. They \nhave 7,000 employees, and 1,500 of them are security people. They do \nnothing but security.\n  There is a bright line between those people who fly them, those \npeople who\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\nload them, those people who refuel them, those people in checkout \nareas, or check-in areas, and baggage areas--they know what they are \nsupposed to do--but there is a bright line on their security. One \nperson is in charge of security.\n  Those areas the Senator mentioned a while ago--passenger lists and \nintelligence, the airport, the periphery outside, the check-in area, \nthe departure gate, cargo, the aircraft--you get down to the little \nbottom part of it that says: Aircraft. Above that is where it parks. We \nknow those areas. And they can be supervised by people who understand \nrestricted areas, restricted cargo, the movement of contraband, and \nunderstand passenger lists and intelligence. And that is Justice. That \nis where it is at. So we can agree on that, I am sure, before it is all \nover.\n  But that is what we have to do. This debate is right on target, I say \nto the Senator. And I do not know what the House wants. I have no idea. \nThey have not told anybody. I do not know what they want or what they \ndo not want.\n  But I think it is incumbent on us and the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, through his leadership, that we get a bill out of this \nSenate this week and also probably an antiterrorism bill, too. We can \nagree on those things.\n  But make no mistake about it; what is continuing this debate, which I \ndoubt continues past tomorrow, is an amendment that is hanging out \nthere that has nothing to do with airport security.\n  What we have to be very careful about--and I think there are a couple \nothers, but those areas can be worked out. We can negotiate those out. \nI am satisfied with them because nobody understands justice any better \nthan our chairman. He chairs the appropriations subcommittee that gives \nthem their money. He understands that. And I am willing to work with my \nchairman to make sure that we make this as suitable as possible.\n\n  But what I think I want to do, I want to make a bright line of \nauthority, accountability, and responsibility because we are in war. \nWhy am I adamant about this? It is very simple. Approximately 6,000 \npeople died September 11. That is an astounding figure to me, \nastounding. And the system we were using had a soft point. It did not \nwork.\n  So what I am saying is this: Give authority where there is \naccountability and responsibility and also a presence that is trusted \nby the American people so they feel confident, safe, and secure when \nthey fly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURNS. I certainly will.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. He has \nbeen the most diligent of all. He has been to every one of the \nhearings, all the briefings with El Al, and has been a wonderful \nsupporter to get responsibility fixed. That has been his theme. And \nwhether we do it in Justice or whether we do it in Transportation, or \nwherever, I always tended toward trying to get it done. And the White \nHouse wanted it in Transportation. Transportation has a follow-on with \nrespect to railroads and the seaports. So I thought the one entity of \nTransportation would be it.\n  But there is tremendous logic in what the Senator has pointed out. I \ncannot thank him enough for his support, so we can move to let the \nmajority's will govern.\n  We ought to be embarrassed. Five weeks after September 11, and we are \nstill dillying around, with an empty Senate Chamber, arguing about \nmaybe benefits and maybe about the railroads and maybe about something \nelse.\n  I am ready to move to this and have it done and then take up \nrailroads. Let's take up the question of the seaports and take up \ncounterterrorism and all these other measures. But I think in trying to \nengineer around and satisfy this Senator and satisfy that Senator, we \nhave been doing that for 3 weeks, and we have gotten nowhere.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his time and \nappreciate that we quit monkeying around and that we get it done. But \nin those areas that really concern us about airport security, we are \npretty close. We can agree on that.\n  So I think we ought to keep our eyes on the ball, why we are here, \nwhat the legislation is supposed to do, and then let other issues come \nup as they shall. But I think the American people expect this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Again, I cannot believe that people would venture into areas that \nhave nothing to do with security when basically we are at war. Nobody \nunderstands that in this body today as well as the man who is the \nPresiding Officer, his losing friends, family--maybe not family but \nfriends. Six thousand people died on that day. It is time to quit \nmonkeying around. It is time to get on with our business.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10363-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10363-S10365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1510\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have been negotiating in good faith \non both sides of the aisle all day long. As you know, there have been \nRepublican objections to moving directly to the airport security bill. \nWe are still in that postcloture period where the 30 hours are being \nconsumed as we attempt to address the need to move directly to the \nbill. Tomorrow at 5 o'clock, we will have that opportunity. It was my \nhope, in consultation with Senator Lott, that we could move in the \ninterim to the counterterrorism bill. So much work and effort and \nnegotiation has gone into getting us to this point that it was my hope, \nin the interest of expediting consideration of this bill, that we would \nhave the opportunity to take it up, and it would be my hope we could \ntake it up tonight, work through the day tomorrow, and then have a vote \non final passage tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 10 o'clock tomorrow, the Senate turn \nto consideration of S. 1510, the antiterrorism bill; that the time \nbetween then and 5 o'clock be equally divided between Senator Leahy and \nSenator Hatch; that the only amendment in order be a managers' \namendment to be cleared by both managers, with 30 minutes of Republican \ntime under the control of Senator Specter; that at 5 p.m. tomorrow, the \nbill be read the third time, and the Senate vote without any \nintervening action or debate on final passage. Further, upon \ndisposition of S. 1510, the Senate immediately vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 1447.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand and certainly appreciate the urgency of \nthis bill. It is very important we give the Department of Justice and \nour intelligence agencies the tools they need to combat and prevent \nterrorism, but it is also crucial that civil liberties in this country \nbe preserved. Otherwise, I am afraid the terrorists win this battle \nwithout firing another shot.\n  It is our constitutional duty in this body to preserve and protect \nthe Constitution of the United States. Our freedoms in part are what \nthe terrorists hate about us. We cannot be expected to limit those \nfreedoms without careful study and debate, and I do know--and the \nmajority leader, of course, is right--how hard the leaders, the \nchairman, and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee have been \nworking on this measure, and I appreciate all they have done. But there \nhas not been an open process in the Judiciary Committee, much less the \nfull Senate, for Senators to have an opportunity to raise concerns \nabout how far this bill goes in giving powers to law enforcement to \nwiretap or investigate law-abiding U.S. citizens.\n  As of the end of last week, we were told the bill would probably come \nup on Thursday of this week. Today the request is made to bring it up \nimmediately under extremely restrictive\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\nterms for debate that would not allow any opportunity for amendments \nother than the one the majority leader mentioned.\n  Senators must have the opportunity to read and debate this 200-plus \npage bill and offer amendments. It does not have to take weeks or even \ndays, but it cannot be done before most Senators have even had a chance \nto read and understand the far-reaching changes this bill makes on our \nlaws.\n  Madam President, I reserve the right to object. I do not wish to \nobject, but in order to give due attention to the serious \nconstitutional issues before us, and in the interest of moving forward \non this important legislation, I ask unanimous consent that the \nleader's request be modified to allow this Senator to offer four \nrelevant amendments with each to be debated for an hour equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Wisconsin be prepared to insert \nthe text of the amendments in the Record this evening?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will not be able to do it this evening, but I will be \nable to do it tomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, that is exactly the problem we have had \nwith the Senator from Wisconsin and others over the course of the last \nseveral days. There is a desire on the part of Senators to amend the \nbill but no amendments are available. I cannot agree to amendments I \nhave not seen, obviously, and I think it is asking a good deal of all \nthe Senate that we reserve opportunities for him to offer amendments \nwithout having the opportunity to see the amendments themselves. Of \ncourse, I have to object to that.\n  I am very disappointed. This bill has been on the calendar now for \nsome time. It has been available for all Senators to review. We have \nhad the opportunity to discuss it in caucus now on several occasions.\n  It has been available for discussion, certainly for further \nconsideration, as Senators have had the opportunity to talk to the \ndistinguished Chair, with me, and with others. So I am understandably \nconcerned about the request of the Senator from Wisconsin. Obviously, I \nam not able to agree to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object to the request of the leader because I agree with it, but I \nwant Senators to know an enormous amount of time has gone into this \nbill. We have been trying to consult with Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee and outside the Judiciary Committee as we have gone forward. \nWe have consulted with Republicans, Democrats, the White House, and \nwith the Department of Justice. I have tried to keep the distinguished \nmajority leader informed each step of the way, and I know Senator Hatch \nhas done the same with the distinguished Republican leader.\n  We put the bill in last week.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true that the Senator and Senator Hatch and the \nstaffs have spent hundreds of hours on the bill in the last 5 weeks? Is \nthat a fair statement, hundreds of hours?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tell my friend from Nevada not only is it a fair \nstatement, but I am painfully aware of all of those hours. In fact, I \ngot up at 3 this morning in Vermont to come back in time to be prepared \nto go forward to discuss the bill, to have a full discussion today or \ntomorrow, if need be, so that Senators could ask questions and they \ncould either vote for it or against it. I say to my friend, the senior \nSenator from Nevada, throughout those nights and days, a lot of times I \nwould leave about 1 a.m. and the staff would still be there at 4 a.m. \nor 5 a.m. We made a number of changes. Nobody is more protective of the \nrights of individuals than I, and considerably more than that, I feel \nvery strongly in agreement with Benjamin Franklin's comment when he \nliterally had his neck on the line when he said people who would trade \ntheir liberty for security deserve neither.\n  We are trying to get that balance between liberty and security. Is it \na perfect bill? No. Could we pass a perfect bill? I doubt it very much. \nIs it far better than when it was originally proposed by the \nadministration as far as being protective of civil liberties? I believe \nit is.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend one more question. I know that one of \nSenator Leahy's key staff members had a long-standing dinner \nengagement, and he had to dress in the car prior to taking 2 hours off \non a Saturday night for dinner because he had worked all Friday night, \nall Saturday, and he finished dinner and was going back to work.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have asked him about those 2 hours he took off during \nthat 48 hours.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator this question: During this process, has \nthe Senator's staff been available to my staff and any other Senator \nwho had a question about what was being done with that legislation?\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have had calls from Senators on and off the committee. \nThe Senator from Nevada is absolutely right, to answer his question. We \nhave been available to everybody. Since the bombing, I have been able \nto go back a couple of times to Vermont, mainly to tell Vermonters what \nhas happened. I do not know the number of faxes and calls I had from \nSenators around the country who had questions, and we tried to get \nanswers to them. I sometimes get e-mails at 2 a.m., going back and \nforth. So I do not know any Senator who could say they have not had an \nopportunity.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is absolutely right; as I said, I have \ntried to keep him briefed. I know Senator Hatch tried to keep Senator \nLott briefed. I say to my friend from Wisconsin, is it moving faster \nthan I would like to see such legislation move? Yes. Are we facing \nother threats in this country today? I believe we are.\n  I also might say this bill does not answer all of those threats. We \nwill at some appropriate time go back and look at the number of things \nthat were probably overlooked by the Department of Justice or the FBI \nor others, things that might have prevented the bombings in the first \nplace that were overlooked, things that have been gathered under the \ncurrent law.\n  Having said all of that, and notwithstanding the fact the current law \nwas not used as well as it should have been by the Department of \nJustice and others, we have made some improvements, but the House has \nalso made changes.\n  I ask my friend from Nevada, who is the distinguished deputy majority \nleader, would it not be his assumption that ultimately the final \nversion of this bill will come out of that conference between the \nSenate and the House? But we cannot get to conference until we get the \nbill off the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I again propound the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will not object, but I do wish to commend Senator Daschle \nfor working to make it possible to move this antiterrorism bill \nforward. I also commend Senator Leahy. Two weeks ago, it looked as if \nit was hopelessly balled up and an agreement or compromise was not \ngoing to be worked out. There was a lot of give and take, and Senator \nLeahy hung in there. Even though some people were being critical of \nhim, he did not let it deter him. He stuck with it and came up with a \nvery strong bill, a delicately balanced bill. He worked with the \nadministration. He worked with his colleague on the other side of the \naisle, and I think compliments are due all around.\n  Is it a perfect bill? No. I have people on our side of the aisle who \nbelieve it is still not nearly strong enough, and Senators who would \nlike to have an opportunity to offer amendments that would make it even \nstronger from the standpoint of how we deal with the necessary \ninformation we need, wiretaps, and from a law enforcement standpoint, \nbut this was a way for us to deal with this critical issue.\n  I do not make a blanket indictment. I do worry about, Heaven forbid, \nsomething further happening that we could have avoided if we had had \nthese tools at our disposal. We still have to get through the Senate, \nget through the House, get into conference, and get this bill done. We \nare talking about, if we\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\nget this done tomorrow or the next day, still probably a week.\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides, let us work together. An \nexample has been set, and I am proud of what the Senate has done. I am \nproud of what the committee has done and is willing to do. I hope the \nrest of us will take advantage of the opportunity to follow that \nleadership.\n  I wanted to get that on the record. I will not object, Madam \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We can certainly continue these discussions, but I want \nto say it is certainly not the case that I have not shared the concerns \nI have, I would say, concerning the amendments we have talked about, \nthe actual areas, and shared them with the leadership. We certainly \ncould have the text of all of these amendments by 10 tomorrow morning. \nIn other words, the language would be available before the bill even \ncomes up. That strikes me as sufficient notice usually in the Senate.\n  I do not think it is a fair complaint to say we cannot agree to these \nreasonable requests simply because of the extra language written out at \nthis point.\n  Madam President, at this point, unless other Members wish to address \nthis issue, I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator from Mississippi seeks \nrecognition, obviously I yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I was hoping to have a brief opportunity \nto speak about the magnificent leadership of Senator Mike Mansfield, \nbut I will be glad to withhold on that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will say to the minority leader, Mike Mansfield is a man \nwho was my mentor and I will be speaking about him tomorrow after the \nmemorial service. But I say to the distinguished leader, he was my \nleader when I came to the Senate, and I think he probably had as much \ninvolvement in teaching me how to be a Senator as anybody. I will speak \nfurther on that at another time.\n  I hope Senators would work with the distinguished majority leader and \nthe distinguished Republican leader to help us schedule this \nlegislation. I have tried to be accommodating, getting up at 3 o'clock \nthis morning in Vermont to try to get back.\n\n  Do I love this bill? Of course I don't love this bill, Madam \nPresident. But neither does the distinguished Republican leader. \nNeither does the distinguished ranking member. There is nobody in here \nwho does. It is impossible to craft a bill of this nature that \neverybody is going to like.\n  Does it protect us for all time from terrorism? Of course it does \nnot. As I said earlier, I suspect we had information prior to September \n11 in our files at the Justice Department that might have led to the \napprehension and the stopping of the terrorists. That was information \nand intelligence that was acquired properly under the current laws. \nWill this protect us by itself? No. Will it give us some tools we don't \nhave? Yes. This can be done in such a way that we ask ourselves, are we \nwilling to try some of this for a while? Put constitutional \nlimitations.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Mississippi knows I am very \ntruthful when I say I will have some very serious and, I would hope, \nbipartisan oversight hearings of abuse of the law as we go along. This \nis not a liberal or conservative piece of legislation. We have liberals \nand conservatives and moderates who have areas of concerns. We all do \nbecause we protect and respect our privacy. I come from a State where \nprivacy is paramount to everybody. It is one thing that unites every \none of us, no matter our political background.\n  But we cannot tell what is going to be the final bill until we \nconsider it. We have to pass something out of the Senate. The House has \nto pass something. They have been working extraordinarily hard, Madam \nPresident, both Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers. Why \nnot see what we can come up with? The committee of conference will be \nthe final package. If I don't like the final package, I will be the \nfirst to vote against it. But I suspect we will come up with something. \nWe will probably have some very late nights that will be worthwhile.\n  I thank my friend from Mississippi and my friend from South Dakota \nfor trying to bring this bill up. I will stand ready. I don't have to \nleave at 3 o'clock anymore this week to be here. I am here. Although I \nmight say, if anybody could know how absolutely beautiful it is in \nVermont at this time of year, with the best foliage we have had in 25 \nyears, maybe we should move the Senate up there. It depends on the good \ngraces of my friend from Mississippi.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Leahy for his work. We have clearly come up \nwith a superior bill to the one being moved in the House, but the House \nis also moving forward. I know Senator Smith of New Hampshire has an \namendment he wanted to offer, too. Every Senator has the right to \nobject. We should not be critical of a Senator exercising that right.\n  But I think there is urgency on this legislation. I hope, I say to \nSenator Leahy, we will continue to work to see if we can clear this \nbill and get it considered tomorrow. If we don't, there is a danger \nthat the aviation security bill will tangle up the rest of the week and \nwe might not be able to get to this bill until next week.\n  I think the American people have appreciated the way we have worked \ntogether, shoulder to shoulder, regardless of party. We are all feeling \na great need to pull together with patriotism while protecting \nfundamental rights. I hope we can continue to do that. We will be glad \nto work with Senators Leahy and Daschle to see that happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brownback pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1521 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10365-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, last Thursday, October 4, I was pleased \nto introduce with the Majority Leader, Senator Daschle, and the \nChairmen of the Banking and Intelligence Committees, as well as the \nMinority Leader, Senator Lott, and Senator Hatch and Senator Shelby, \nthe United and Strengthening America, or USA Act. This is not the bill \nthat I, or any of the sponsors, would have written if compromise was \nunnecessary. Nor is the bill the administration initially proposed and \nthe Attorney General delivered to us on September 19, at a meeting in \nthe Capitol.\n  We were able to refine and supplement the administration's original \nproposal in a number of ways. The administration accepted a number of \nthe practical steps I had originally proposed on September 19 to \nimprove our security on the Northern Border, assist our Federal, State \nand local law enforcement officers and provide compensation to the \nvictims of terrorist acts and to the public safety officers who gave \ntheir lives to protect ours. This USA Act also provides important \nchecks on the proposed expansion of government powers that were not \ncontained in the Attorney General's initial proposal.\n  In negotiations with the administration, I have done my best to \nstrike a\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\nreasonable balance between the need to address the threat of terrorism, \nwhich we all keenly feel at the present time, and the need to protect \nour constitutional freedoms. Despite my misgivings, I have acquiesced \nin some of the administration's proposals because it is important to \npreserve national unity in this time of crisis and to move the \nlegislative process forward.\n  The result of our labors still leaves room for improvement. Even \nafter the Senate passes judgment on this bill, the debate will not be \nfinished. We will have to consider the important judgments made by the \nHouse Judiciary Committee in the version of the legislation making its \nway through the House. Moreover, I predict that some of these \nprovisions will face difficult tests in the courts and that we in \nCongress will have to revisit these issues at some time in the future \nwhen, as we all devoutly hope, the present crisis has passed. I also \nintend as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to exercise careful \noversight of how the Department of Justice, the FBI and other executive \nbranch agencies are using the newly-expanded powers that this bill will \ngive them.\n  The negotiations on this bill have not been easy. Within days of the \nSeptember 11 attacks, I instructed my staff to begin work on \nlegislation to address security needs on the Northern Border, the needs \nof victims and State and local law enforcement, and criminal law \nimprovements. A week after the attack, on September 19, the Attorney \nGeneral and I exchanged the outlines of the legislative proposals and \npledged to work together towards our shared goal of putting tools in \nthe hands of law enforcement that would help prevent another terrorist \nattack.\n  Let me be clear: No one can guarantee that Americans will be free \nfrom the threat of future terrorist attacks, and to suggest that this \nlegislation--or any legislation--would or could provide such a \nguarantee would be a false promise. I will not engage in such false \npromises, and those in the administration who make such assertions do a \ndisservice to the American people.\n  I have also heard claims that if certain powers had been previously \nauthorized by the Congress, we could somehow have prevented the \nSeptember 11 attacks. Given this rhetoric it may be instructive to \nreview efforts that were made a few years ago in the Senate to provide \nlaw enforcement with greater tools to conduct surveillance of \nterrorists and terrorist organizations. In May 1995, Senator Lieberman \noffered an amendment to the bill that became the Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 that would have expanded the \nGovernment's authority to conduct emergency wiretaps to cases of \ndomestic or international terrorism and added a definition of domestic \nterrorism to include violent or illegal acts apparently intended to \n``intimidate, or coerce the civilian population.'' The consensus, \nbipartisan bill that we consider today contains a very similar \ndefinition of domestic terrorism.\n  In 1995, however, a motion to table Senator Lieberman's amendment was \nagreed to in a largely party-line vote, with Republicans voting against \nthe measure. In fact, then Senator Ashcroft voted to table that \namendment, and my good friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, spoke against \nit and opined, ``I do not think we should expand the wiretap laws any \nfurther.'' I recall Senator Hatch's concern then that ``We must ensure \nthat in our response to recent terrorist acts, we do not destroy the \nfreedoms that we cherish.'' I have worked very hard to maintain that \nbalance in negotiations concerning the current legislation.\n  Following the exchange on September 19 of our legislative proposals, \nwe have worked over the last two weeks around the clock with the \nadministration to put together the best legislative package we could. I \nshare the administration's goal of providing promptly the legal tools \nnecessary to deal with the current terrorist threat. While some have \ncomplained publicly that the negotiations have gone on for too long, \nthe issues involved are of great importance, and we will have to live \nwith the laws we enact for a long time to come. Demands for action are \nirresponsible when the road-map is pointed in the wrong direction. As \nBen Franklin once noted, ``if we surrender our liberty in the name of \nsecurity, we shall have neither.''\n  Moreover, our ability to make rapid progress was impeded because the \nnegotiations with the administration did not progress in a straight \nline. On several key issues that are of particular concern to me, we \nhad reached an agreement with the administration on Sunday, September \n30. Unfortunately, within two days, the administration announced that \nit was reneging on the deal. I appreciate the complex task of \nconsidering the concerns and missions of multiple federal agencies, and \nthat sometimes agreements must be modified as their implications are \nscrutinized by affected agencies. When agreements made by the \nadministration must be withdrawn and negotiations on resolved issues \nreopened, those in the administration who blame the Congress for delay \nwith what the New York Times described last week as ``scurrilous \nremarks,'' do not help the process move forward.\n  We have expedited the legislative process in the Judiciary Committee \nto consider the administration's proposals. In daily news conferences, \nthe Attorney General has referred to the need for such prompt \nconsideration. I commend him for making the time to appear before the \nJudiciary Committee at a hearing September 25 to respond to questions \nthat Members from both parties have about the administration's initial \nlegislative proposals. I also thank the Attorney General for extending \nthe hour and a half he was able to make in his schedule for the hearing \nfor another fifteen minutes so that Senator Feinstein and Senator \nSpecter were able to ask questions before his departure. I regret that \nthe Attorney General did not have the time to respond to questions from \nall the Members of the Committee either on September 25 or last week, \nbut again thank him for the attention he promised to give to the \nwritten questions Members submitted about the legislation. We have not \nreceived answers to those written questions yet, but I will make them a \npart of the hearing record whenever they are sent.\n  The Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, Senator Feingold, also \nheld an important hearing on October 3 on the civil liberties \nramifications of the expanded surveillance powers requested by the \nadministration. I thank him for his assistance in illuminating these \ncritical issues for the Senate.\n  Rule 14: To accede to the administration's request for prompt \nconsideration of this legislation, the leaders decided to hold the USA \nAct at the desk rather than refer the bill to the committee for markup, \nas is regular practice. Senator Hatch specifically urged that this \noccur, and I support this decision. Indeed, when the Senate considered \nthe anti-terrorism act in 1995 after the Oklahoma City bombing, we \nbypassed committee in order to deal with the legislation more promptly \non the floor.\n  Given the expedited process that we have used to move this bill, I \nwill take more time than usual to detail its provisions.\n  The heart of every American aches for those who died or have been \ninjured because of the tragic terrorist attacks in New York, Virginia, \nand Pennsylvania on September 11. Even now, we cannot assess the full \nmeasure of this attack in terms of human lives, but we know that the \nnumber of casualties is extraordinarily high.\n  Congress acted swiftly to help the victims of September 11. Within 10 \ndays, we passed legislation to establish a Victims Compensations \nProgram, which will provide fair compensation to those most affected by \nthis national tragedy. I am proud of our work on that legislation, \nwhich will expedite payments to thousands of Americans whose lives were \nso suddenly shattered.\n  But now more than ever, we should remember the tens of thousands of \nAmericans whose needs are not being met--the victims of crimes that \nhave not made the national headlines. Just one day before the events \nthat have so transformed our nation, I came before this body to express \nmy concern that we were not doing more for crime victims. I noted that \nthe pace of victims legislation had slowed, and that many opportunities \nfor progress had been squandered. I suggested that this year, we had a \ngolden opportunity to make significant progress in this area by passing \nS.783, the Leahy-Kennedy Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2001.\n  I am pleased, therefore, that the antiterrorism package now before \nthe\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\nSenate contains substantial portions of S.783 aimed at refining the \nVictims of Crime Act of 1984, VOCA, and improving the manner in which \nthe Crime Victims Fund is managed and preserved. Most significantly, \nsection 621 of the USA Act will eliminate the cap on VOCA spending, \nwhich has prevented more than $700 million in fund deposits from \nreaching victims and supporting essential services.\n  Congress has capped spending from the fund for the last two fiscal \nyears, and President Bush has proposed a third cap for fiscal year \n2002. These limits on VOCA spending have created a growing sense of \nconfusion and unease by many of those concerned about the future of the \nFund.\n  We should not be imposing artificial caps on VOCA spending while \nsubstantial unmet needs continue to exist. Section 621 of the USA Act \nreplaces the cap with a self-regulating system that will ensure \nstability and protection of Fund assets, while allowing more money to \nbe distributed to the States for victim compensation and assistance.\n  Other provisions included from S. 783 will also make an immediate \ndifference in the lives of victims, including victims of terrorism. \nShortly after the Oklahoma City bombing, I proposed and the Congress \nadopted the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995. This legislation \nauthorized the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) to set aside an \nemergency reserve of up to $50 million as part of the Crime Victims \nFund. The emergency reserve was intended to serve as a ``rainy day'' \nfund to supplement compensation and assistance grants to States to \nprovide emergency relief in the wake of an act of terrorism or mass \nviolence that might otherwise overwhelm the resources of a State's \ncrime victim compensation program and crime victim assistance services. \nLast month's disaster created vast needs that have all but depleted the \nreserve. Section 621 of the USA Act authorizes OVC to replenish the \nreserve with up to $50 million, and streamlines the mechanism for \nreplenishment in future years.\n  Another critical provision of the USA Act will enable OVC to provide \nmore immediate and effective assistance to victims of terrorism and \nmass violence occurring within the United States. I proposed this \nmeasure last year as an amendment to the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act, but was compelled to drop it to achieve bipartisan \nconsensus. I am pleased that we are finally getting it done this year.\n  These and other VOCA reforms in the USA Act are long overdue. Yet, I \nregret that we are not doing more. In my view, we should pass the Crime \nVictims Assistance Act in its entirety. In addition to the provisions \nthat are included in today's antiterrorism package, this legislation \nprovides for comprehensive reform of Federal law to establish enhanced \nrights and protections for victims of Federal crime. It also proposes \nseveral programs to help States provide better assistance for victims \nof State crimes.\n  I also regret that we have not done more for other victims of recent \nterrorist attacks. While all Americans are numbed by the heinous acts \nof September 11, we should not forget the victims of the 1998 Embassy \nbombings in East Africa. Eleven Americans and many Kenyan and Tanzanian \nnationals employed by the United States lost their lives in that tragic \nincident. It is my understanding that compensation to the families of \nthese victims has in many instances fallen short. It is my hope that \nOVC will use a portion of the newly replenished reserve fund to remedy \nany inequity in the way that these individuals have been treated.\n  Hate Crimes: We cannot speak of the victims of the September 11 \nwithout also noting that Arab-Americans and Muslims in this country \nhave become the targets of hate crimes, harassment, and intimidation. I \napplaud the President for speaking out against and condemning such \nacts, and visiting a mosque to demonstrate by action that all religions \nare embraced in this country. I also commend the FBI Director for his \nperiodic reports on the number of hate crime incidents against Arab-\nAmerican and Muslims that the FBI is aggressively investigating and \nmaking clear that this conduct is taken seriously and will be punished.\n  The USA Act contains, in section 102, a sense of the Congress that \ncrimes and discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans are \ncondemned. Many of us would like to do more, and finally enact \neffective hate crimes legislation, but the administration has asked \nthat the debate on that legislation be postponed. One of my greatest \nregrets regarding the negotiations in this bill was the objections that \nprevented the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, S. 625, from being \nincluded in the USA Act.\n  The administration's initial proposal was entirely focused on Federal \nlaw enforcement. Yet, we must remember that State and local law \nenforcement officers have critical roles to play in preventing and \ninvestigating terrorist acts. I am pleased that the USA Act we consider \ntoday recognizes this fact.\n  As a former State prosecutor, I know that State and local law \nenforcement officers are often the first responders to a crime. On \nSeptember 11, the Nation saw that the first on the scene were the \nheroic firefighters, police officers and emergency personnel in New \nYork City. These New York public safety officers, many of whom gave the \nultimate sacrifice, remind us of how important it is to support our \nState and local law enforcement partners. The USA Act provides three \ncritical measures of Federal support for our State and local law \nenforcement officers in the war against terrorism.\n  First, we streamline and expedite the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits application process for family members of fire fighters, \npolice officers and rescue workers who perish or suffer a disabling \ninjury in connection with prevention, investigation, rescue or recovery \nefforts related to a future terrorist attack.\n  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program provides benefits for \neach of the families of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and \nemergency response crew members who are killed or disabled in the line \nof duty. Current regulations, however, require the families of public \nsafety officers who have fallen in the line of duty to go through a \ncumbersome and time-consuming application process. In the face of our \nnational fight against terrorism, it is important that we provide a \nquick process to support the families of brave Americans who selflessly \ngive their lives so that others might live before, during and after a \nterrorist attack.\n  This provision builds on the new law championed by Senator Clinton, \nSenator Schumer and Congressman Nadler to speed the benefit payment \nprocess for families of public safety officers killed in the line of \nduty in New York City, Virginia, and Western Pennsylvania, on September \n11.\n  Second, we have raised the total amount of Public Safety Officers' \nBenefit Program payments from approximately $150,000 to $250,000. This \nprovision retroactively goes into effect to provide much-needed relief \nfor the families of the brave men and women who sacrificed their own \nlives for their fellow Americans during the year. Although this \nincrease in benefits can never replace a family's tragic loss, it is \nthe right thing to do for the families of our fallen heroes. I want to \nthank Senator Biden and Senator Hatch for their bipartisan leadership \non this provision.\n  Third, we expand the Department of Justice Regional Information \nSharing Systems Program to promote information sharing among Federal, \nState and local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute \nterrorist conspiracies and activities and authorize a doubling of \nfunding for this year and next year. The RISS Secure Intranet is a \nnationwide law enforcement network that already allows secure \ncommunications among the more than 5,700 Federal, State and local law \nenforcement agencies. Effective communication is key to effective law \nenforcement efforts and will be essential in our national fight against \nterrorism.\n  The RISS program enables its member agencies to send secure, \nencrypted communications--whether within just one agency or from one \nagency to another. Federal agencies, such as the FBI, do not have this \ncapability, but recognize the need for it. Indeed, on September 11, \n2001, immediately after the terrorist attacks, FBI Headquarters called \nRISS officials to request ``Smartgate'' cards and readers to secure \ntheir communications systems. The FBI agency in Philadelphia called \nsoon after to request more Smartgate cards and readers as well.\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\n  The Regional Information Sharing Systems Program is a proven success \nthat we need to expand to improve secure information sharing among \nFederal, State and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate their \ncounter-terrorism efforts.\n  Our State and local law enforcement partners welcome the challenge to \njoin in our national mission to combat terrorism. We cannot ask State \nand local law enforcement officers to assume these new national \nresponsibilities without also providing new Federal support. The USA \nAct provides the necessary Federal support for our State and local law \nenforcement officers to serve as full partners in our fight against \nterrorism.\n  I am deeply troubled by continuing reports that information is not \nbeing shared with state local law enforcement. In particular, the \ntestimony of Baltimore Police Chief Ed Norris before the House \nGovernment Reform Committee last week highlighted the current problem.\n  The unfolding facts about how the terrorists who committed the \nSeptember 11 attack were able to enter this country without difficulty \nare chilling. Since the attacks many have pointed to our northern \nborder as vulnerable to the entry of future terrorists. This is not \nsurprising when a simple review of the numbers shows that the northern \nborder has been routinely short-changed in personnel. While the number \nof Border Patrol agents along the southern border has increased over \nthe last few years to over 8,000, the number at the northern border has \nremained the same as a decade ago at 300. This remains true despite the \nfact that Admad Ressam, the Algerian who planned to blow up the Los \nAngeles International Airport in 1999, and who has been linked to those \ninvolved in the September 11 attacks, chose to enter the United States \nat our northern border. It will remain an inviting target until we \ndramatically improve our security.\n  The USA Act includes my proposals to provide the substantial and long \noverdue assistance for our law enforcement and border control efforts \nalong the Northern Border. My home State of Vermont has seen huge \nincreases in Customs and INS activity since the signing of NAFTA. The \nnumber of people coming through our borders has risen steeply over the \nyears, but our staff and our resources have not.\n  I proposed--and this legislation authorizes in section 402--tripling \nthe number of Border Patrol, INS inspectors, and Customs Service \nemployees in each of the States along the 4,000-mile Northern Border. I \nwas gratified when 22 Senators--Democrats and Republicans--wrote to the \nPresident supporting such an increase, and I am pleased that the \nadministration agreed that this critical law enforcement improvement \nshould be included in the bill. Senators Cantwell and Schumer in the \nCommittee and Senators Murray and Dorgan have been especially strong \nadvocates of these provisions and I thank them for their leadership. In \naddition, the USA Act, in section 401, authorizes the Attorney General \nto waive the FTE cap on INS personnel in order to address the national \nsecurity needs of the United States on the northern border. Now more \nthan ever, we must patrol our border vigilantly and prevent those who \nwish America harm from gaining entry. At the same time, we must work \nwith the Canadians to allow speedy crossing to legitimate visitors and \nfoster the continued growth of trade which is beneficial to both \ncountries.\n  In addition to providing for more personnel, this bill also includes, \nin section 402(4), my proposal to provide $100 million in funding for \nboth the INS and the Customs Service to improve the technology used to \nmonitor the Northern Border and to purchase additional equipment. The \nbill also includes, in section 403(c), an important provision from \nSenator Cantwell directing the Attorney General, in consultation with \nother agencies, to develop a technical standard for identifying \nelectronically the identity of persons applying for visas or seeking to \nenter the United States. In short, this bill provides a comprehensive \nhigh-tech boost for the security of our nation.\n  This bill also includes important proposals to enhance data sharing. \nThe bill, in section 403, directs the Attorney General and the FBI \nDirector to give the State Department and INS access to the criminal \nhistory information in the FBI's National Crime Information Center, \nNCIC, database, as the administration and I both proposed. The Attorney \nGeneral is directed to report back to the Congress in two years on \nprogress in implementing this requirement. We have also adopted the \nadministration's language, in section 413, to make it easier for the \nState Department to share information with foreign governments for aid \nin terrorist investigations.\n  The USA Act contains a number of provisions intended to improve and \nupdate the federal criminal code to address better the nature of \nterrorist activity, assist the FBI in translating foreign language \ninformation collected, and ensure that federal prosecutors are \nunhindered by conflicting local rules of conduct to get the job done. I \nwill mention just a few of these provisions.\n  FBI Translators: The truth certainly seems self-evident that all the \nbest surveillance techniques in the world will not help this country \ndefend itself from terrorist attack if the information cannot be \nunderstood in a timely fashion. Indeed, within days of September 11, \nthe FBI Director issued an employment ad on national TV by calling upon \nthose who speak Arabic to apply for a job as an FBI translator. This is \na dire situation that needs attention. I am therefore gratified that \nthe administration accepted my proposal, in section 205, to waive any \nfederal personnel requirements and limitations imposed by any other law \nin order to expedite the hiring of translators at the FBI.\n  This bill also directs the FBI Director to establish such security \nrequirements as are necessary for the personnel employed as \ntranslators. We know the effort to recruit translators has a high \npriority, and the Congress should provide all possible support. \nTherefore, the bill calls on the Attorney General to report to the \nJudiciary Committees on the number of translators employed by the \nJustice Department, any legal or practical impediments to using \ntranslators employed by other Federal, State, or local agencies, on a \nfull, part-time, or shared basis; and the needs of the FBI for specific \ntranslation services in certain languages, and recommendations for \nmeeting those needs.\n  Federal Crime of Terrorism: The administration's initial proposal \nassembled a laundry list of more than 40 Federal crimes ranging from \ncomputer hacking to malicious mischief to the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and designated them as ``Federal terrorism offenses,'' \nregardless of the circumstances under which they were committed. For \nexample, a teenager who spammed the NASA website and, as a result, \nrecklessly caused damage, would be deemed to have committed this new \n``terrorism'' offense. Under the administration's proposal, the \nconsequences of this designation were severe. Crimes on the list would \ncarry no statute of limitations. The maximum penalties would shoot up \nto life imprisonment, and those released earlier would be subject to a \nlifetime of supervised release. Moreover, anyone who harbored a person \nwhom he had ``reasonable grounds to suspect'' had committed, or was \nabout to commit, a ``Federal terrorism offense''--whether it was the \nTaliban or the mother of my hypothetical teenage computer hacker--would \nbe subject to stiff criminal penalties. I worked closely with the \nadministration to ensure that the definition of ``terrorism'' in the \nUSA Act fit the crime.\n\n  First, we have trimmed the list of crimes that may be considered as \nterrorism predicates in section 808 of the bill. This shorter, more \nfocused list, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332(g)(5)(B), more \nclosely reflects the sorts of offenses committed by terrorists.\n  Second, we have provided, in section 810, that the current 8-year \nlimitations period for this new set of offenses will remain in place, \nexcept where the commission of the offense resulted in, or created a \nrisk of, death or serious bodily injury.\n  Third, rather than make an across-the-board, one-size-fits-all \nincrease of the penalties for every offense on the list, without regard \nto the severity of the offense, we have made, in section 811, more \nmeasured increases in maximum penalties where appropriate, including \nlife imprisonment or lifetime supervised release in cases in which the\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\noffense resulted in death. We have also added, in section 812, \nconspiracy provisions to a few criminal statutes where appropriate, \nwith penalties equal to the penalties for the object offense, up to \nlife imprisonment.\n  Finally, we have more carefully defined the new crime of harboring \nterrorists in section 804, so that it applies only to those harboring \npeople who have committed, or are about to commit, the most serious of \nFederal terrorism-related crimes, such as the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Moreover, it is not enough that the defendant had \n``reasonable grounds to suspect'' that the person he was harboring had \ncommitted, or was about to commit, such a crime; the Government must \nprove that the defendant knew or had ``reasonable grounds to believe'' \nthat this was so.\n  McDade Fix: The massive investigation underway into who was \nresponsible for and assisted in carrying out the September 11 attacks \nstretches across State and national boundaries. While the scope of the \ntragedy is unsurpassed, the disregard for State and national borders of \nthis criminal conspiracy is not unusual. Federal investigative officers \nand prosecutors often must follow leads and conduct investigations \noutside their assigned jurisdictions. At the end of the 105th Congress, \na legal impediment to such multi-jurisdiction investigations was \nslipped into the omnibus appropriations bill, over the objection at the \ntime of every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I have spoken many times over the past two years of the problems \ncaused by the so-called McDade law, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 530B. According to \nthe Justice Department, the McDade law has delayed important criminal \ninvestigations, prevented the use of effective and traditionally-\naccepted investigative techniques, and served as the basis of \nlitigation to interfere with legitimate federal prosecutions. At a time \nwhen we need Federal law enforcement authorities to move quickly to \ncatch those responsible for the September 11 attacks, and to prevent \nfurther attacks on our country, we can no longer tolerate the drag on \nFederal investigations and prosecutions caused by this ill-considered \nlegislation.\n  On September 19, I introduced S. 1437, the Professional Standards for \nGovernment Attorneys Act of 2001, along with Senators Hatch and Wyden. \nThis bill proposes to modify the McDade law by establishing a set of \nrules that clarify the professional standards applicable to government \nattorneys. I am delighted that the administration recognized the \nimportance of S. 1437 for improving Federal law enforcement and \ncombating terrorism, and agreed to its inclusion as section 501 of the \nUSA Act.\n  The first part of section 501 embodies the traditional understanding \nthat when lawyers handle cases before a Federal court, they should be \nsubject to the Federal court's standards of professional \nresponsibility, and not to the possibly inconsistent standards of other \njurisdictions. By incorporating this ordinary choice-of-law principle, \nthe bill preserves the Federal courts' traditional authority to oversee \nthe professional conduct of Federal trial lawyers, including Federal \nprosecutors. It thus avoids the uncertainties presented by the McDade \nlaw, which potentially subjects Federal prosecutors to State laws, \nrules of criminal procedure, and judicial decisions which differ from \nexisting Federal law.\n  Another part of section 501 specifically addresses the situation in \nOregon, where a State court ruling has seriously impeded the ability of \nFederal agents to engage in undercover operations and other covert \nactivities. See In re Gatti, 330 Or. 517 (2000). Such activities are \nlegitimate and essential crime-fighting tools. The Professional \nStandards for Government Attorneys Act ensures that these tools will be \navailable to combat terrorism.\n  Finally, section 501 addresses the most pressing contemporary \nquestion of government attorney ethics--namely, the question of which \nrule should govern government attorneys' communications with \nrepresented persons. It asks the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates to submit to the Supreme Court a proposed uniform national rule \nto govern this area of professional conduct, and to study the need for \nadditional national rules to govern other areas in which the \nproliferation of local rules may interfere with effective Federal law \nenforcement. The Rules Enabling Act process is the ideal one for \ndeveloping such rules, both because the Federal judiciary traditionally \nis responsible for overseeing the conduct of lawyers in Federal court \nproceedings, and because this process would best provide the Supreme \nCourt an opportunity fully to consider and objectively to weigh all \nrelevant considerations.\n  The problems posed to Federal law enforcement investigations and \nprosecutions by the McDade law are real and urgent. The Professional \nStandards for Government Attorneys Act provides a reasonable and \nmeasured alternative: It preserves the traditional role of the State \ncourts in regulating the conduct of attorneys licensed to practice \nbefore them, while ensuring that Federal prosecutors and law \nenforcement agents will be able to use traditional Federal \ninvestigative techniques. We need to pass this corrective legislation \nbefore more cases are compromised.\n  Terrorist Attacks Against Mass Transportation Systems: Another \nprovision of the USA Act that was not included in the administration's \ninitial proposal is section 801, which targets acts of terrorism and \nother violence against mass transportation systems. Just last week, \na Greyhound bus crashed in Tennessee after a deranged passenger slit \nthe driver's throat and then grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the \nbus into the oncoming traffic. Six people were killed in the crash. \nBecause there are currently no Federal laws addressing terrorism of \nmass transportation systems, however, there may be no Federal \njurisdiction over such a case, even if it were committed by suspected \nterrorists. Clearly, there is an urgent need for strong criminal \nlegislation to deter attacks against mass transportation systems. \nSection 801 will fill this gap.\n\n  Cybercrime: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. section 1030, \nis the primary Federal criminal statute prohibiting computer frauds and \nhacking. I worked with Senator Hatch in the last Congress to make \nimprovements to this law in the Internet Security Act, which passed the \nSenate as part of another bill. Our work is included in section 815 of \nthe USA Act. This section would amend the statute to clarify the \nappropriate scope of federal jurisdiction. First, the bill adds a \ndefinition of ``loss'' to cover any reasonable cost to the victim in \nresponding to a computer hacker. Calculation of loss is important both \nin determining whether the $5,000 jurisdictional hurdle in the statute \nis met, and, at sentencing, in calculating the appropriate guideline \nrange and restitution amount.\n  Second, the bill amends the definition of ``protected computer,'' to \ninclude qualified computers even when they are physically located \noutside of the United States. This clarification will preserve the \nability of the United States to assist in international hacking cases.\n  Finally, this section eliminates the current directive to the \nSentencing Commission requiring that all violations, including \nmisdemeanor violations, of certain provisions of the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act be punished with a term of imprisonment of at least 6 months.\n  Biological Weapons: Borrowing from a bill introduced in the last \nCongress by Senator Biden, the USA Act contains a provision in section \n802 to strengthen our Federal laws relating to the threat of biological \nweapons. Current law prohibits the possession, development, or \nacquisition of biological agents or toxins ``for use as a weapon.'' \nThis section amends the definition of ``for use as a weapon'' to \ninclude all situations in which it can be proven that the defendant had \nany purpose other than a peaceful purpose. This will enhance the \nGovernment's ability to prosecute suspected terrorists in possession of \nbiological agents or toxins, and conform the scope of the criminal \noffense in 18 U.S.C. section 175 more closely to the related forfeiture \nprovision in 18 U.S.C. section 176. This section also contains a new \nstatute, 18 U.S.C. section 175b, which generally makes it an offense \nfor certain restricted persons, including non-resident aliens from \ncountries that support international terrorism, to possess a listed \nbiological agent or toxin.\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\n  Of greater consequence, section 802 defines another additional \noffense, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, of possessing a \nbiological agent, toxin, or delivery system ``of a type or in a \nquantity that, under the circumstances,'' is not reasonably justified \nby a peaceful purpose. As originally proposed by the administration, \nthis provision specifically stated that knowledge of whether the type \nor quantity of the agent or toxin was reasonably justified was not an \nelement of the offense. Thus, although the burden of proof is always on \nthe government, every person who possesses a biological agent, toxin, \nor delivery system was at some level of risk. I am pleased that the \nadministration agreed to drop this portion of the provision.\n  Nevertheless, I remain troubled by the subjectivity of the \nsubstantive standard for violation of this new criminal prohibition, \nand question whether it provides sufficient notice under the \nConstitution. I also share the concerns of the American Society for \nMicrobiology and the Association of American Universities that this \nprovision will have a chilling effect upon legitimate scientific \ninquiry that offsets any benefit in protecting against terrorism. While \nwe have tried to prevent against this by creating an explicit exclusion \nfor ``bona fide research,'' this provision may yet prove unworkable, \nunconstitutional, or both. I urge the Justice Department and the \nresearch community to work together on substitute language that would \nprovide prosecutors with a more workable tool.\n  Secret Service Jurisdiction: Two sections of the USA Act were added \nat the request of the United States Secret Service, with the support of \nthe administration. I was pleased to accommodate the Secret Service by \nincluding these provisions in the bill to expand Electronic Crimes Task \nForces and to clarify the authority of the Secret Service to \ninvestigate computer crimes.\n  The Secret Service is committed to the development of new tools to \ncombat the growing areas of financial crime, computer fraud, and \ncyberterrorrism. Recognizing a need for law enforcement, private \nindustry and academia to pool their resources, skills and vision to \ncombat criminal elements in cyberspace, the Secret Service created the \nNew York Electronic Crimes Task Force, NYECTF. This highly successful \nmodel is comprised of over 250 individual members, including 50 \ndifferent Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies, 100 \nprivate companies, and 9 universities. Since its inception in 1995, the \nNYECTF has successfully investigated a range of financial and \nelectronic crimes, including credit card fraud, identity theft, bank \nfraud, computer systems intrusions, and e-mail threats against \nprotectees of the Secret Service. Section 105 of the USA Act authorizes \nthe Secret Service to develop similar task forces in cities and regions \nacross the country where critical infrastructure may be vulnerable to \nattacks from terrorists or other cyber-criminals.\n  Section 507 of the USA Act gives the Secret Service concurrent \njurisdiction to investigate offenses under 18 U.S.C. section 1030, \nrelating to fraud and related activity in connection with computers. \nPrior to the 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the \nSecret Service was authorized to investigate any and all violations of \nsection 1030, pursuant to an agreement between the Secretary of \nTreasury and the Attorney General. The 1996 amendments, however, \nconcentrated Secret Service jurisdiction on certain specified \nsubsections of section 1030. The current amendment would return full \njurisdiction to the Secret Service and would allow the Justice and \nTreasury Departments to decide on the appropriate work-sharing balance \nbetween the two. This will enable the Secret Service to investigate a \nwide range of potential White House network intrusions, as well as \nintrusions into remote sites, outside of the White House, that could \nimpact the safety and security of its protectees, and to continue its \nmissions to protect the Nation's critical infrastructure and financial \npayment systems.\n\n  Counter-terrorism Fund: The USA Act also authorizes, for the first \ntime, a counter-terrorism fund in the Treasury of the United States to \nreimburse Justice Department for any costs incurred in connection with \nthe fight against terrorism.\n  Specifically, this counter-terrorism fund will : one, reestablish an \noffice or facility that has been damaged as the result of any domestic \nor international terrorism incident; two, provide support to counter, \ninvestigate, or prosecute domestic or international terrorism, \nincluding paying rewards in connection with these activities; three, \nconduct terrorism threat assessments of Federal agencies; and four, for \ncosts incurred in connection with detaining individuals in foreign \ncountries who are accused of acts of terrorism in violation of United \nStates law.\n  I first authored this counter-terrorism fund in the S. 1319, the 21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, which \nSenator Hatch and I introduced in August.\n  The USA Act provides enhanced surveillance procedures for the \ninvestigation of terrorism and other crimes. The challenge before us \nhas been to strike a reasonable balance to protect both security and \nthe liberties of our people. In some respects, the changes made are \nappropriate and important ones to update surveillance and investigative \nprocedures in light of new technology and experience with current law. \nYet, in other respects, I have deep concerns that we may be increasing \nsurveillance powers and the sharing of criminal justice information \nwithout adequate checks on how information may be handled and without \nadequate accountability in the form of judicial review.\n  The bill contains a number of sensible proposals that should be not \nbe controversial.\n  Wiretap Predicates: For example, sections 201 and 202 of the USA Act \nwould add to the list of crimes that may be used as predicates for \nwiretaps certain offenses which are specifically tailored to the \nterrorist threat. In addition to crimes that relate directly to \nterrorism, the list would include crimes of computer fraud and abuse \nwhich are committed by terrorists to support and advance their illegal \nobjectives.\n  FISA Roving Wiretaps: The bill, in section 206, would authorize the \nuse of roving wiretaps in the course of a foreign intelligence \ninvestigation and brings FISA into line with criminal procedures that \nallow surveillance to follow a person, rather than requiring a separate \ncourt order identifying each telephone company or other communication \ncommon carrier whose assistance is needed. This is a matter on which \nthe Attorney General and I reached early agreement. This is the kind of \nchange that has a compelling justification, because it recognizes the \nease with which targets of investigations can evade surveillance by \nchanging phones. In fact, the original roving wiretap authority for use \nin criminal investigations was enacted as part of the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act, ECPA, in 1986. I was proud to be the \nprimary Senate sponsor of that earlier law.\n  Paralleling the statutory rules applicable to criminal \ninvestigations, the formulation I originally proposed made clear that \nthis roving wiretap authority must be requested in the application \nbefore the FISA court was authorized to order such roving surveillance \nauthority. Indeed, the administration agrees that the FISA court may \nnot grant such authority sua sponte. Nevertheless, we have accepted the \nadministration's formulation of the new roving wiretap authority, which \nrequires the FISA court to make a finding that the actions of the \nperson whose communications are to be intercepted could have the effect \nof thwarting the identification of a specified facility or place. While \nno amendment is made to the statutory directions for what must be \nincluded in the application for a FISA electronic surveillance order, \nthese applications should include the necessary information to support \nthe FISA court's finding that roving wiretap authority is warranted.\n  Search Warrants: The USA Act, in section 219, authorizes nationwide \nservice of search warrants in terrorism investigations. This will allow \nthe judge who is most familiar with the developments in a fast-breaking \nand complex terrorism investigation to make determinations of probable \ncause, no matter where the property to be searched is located. This \nwill not only save time by avoiding having to bring up-to-speed another \njudge in another jurisdiction where the property is located, but also\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\nserves privacy and fourth amendment interests in ensuring that the most \nknowledgeable judge makes the determination of probable cause. The \nbill, in section 209, also authorizes voice mail messages to be seized \non the authority of a probable cause search warrant rather than through \nthe more burdensome and time-consuming process of a wiretap.\n  Electronic Records: The bill updates the laws pertaining to \nelectronic records in three primary ways. First, in section 210, the \nbill authorizes the nationwide service of subpoenas for subscriber \ninformation and expands the list of items subject to subpoena to \ninclude the means and source of payment for the service.\n  Second, in section 211, the bill equalizes the standard for law \nenforcement access to cable subscriber records on the same basis as \nother electronic records. The Cable Communications Policy Act, passed \nin 1984 to regulate various aspects of the cable television industry, \ndid not take into account the changes in technology that have occurred \nover the last 15 years. Cable television companies now often provide \nInternet access and telephone service in addition to television \nprogramming. This amendment clarifies that a cable company must comply \nwith the laws governing the interception and disclosure of wire and \nelectronic communications just like any other telephone company or \nInternet service provider. The amendments would retain current \nstandards that govern the release of customer records for television \nprogramming.\n  Finally, the bill, in section 212, permits, but does not require, an \nelectronic communications service to disclose the contents of and \nsubscriber information about communications in emergencies involving \nthe immediate danger of death or serious physical injury. Under \ncurrent law, if an ISP's customer receives an e-mail death threat from \nanother customer of the same ISP, and the victim provides a copy of the \ncommunication to the ISP, the ISP is limited in what actions it may \ntake. On one hand, the ISP may disclose the contents of the forwarded \ncommunication to law enforcement, or to any other third party as it \nsees fit. See 18 U.S.C. section 2702(b)(3). On the other hand, current \nlaw does not expressly authorize the ISP to voluntarily provide law \nenforcement with the identity, home address, and other subscriber \ninformation of the user making the threat. See 18 U.S.C. section \n2703(c)(1)(B),(C), permitting disclosure to government entities only in \nresponse to legal process. In those cases where the risk of death or \ninjury is imminent, the law should not require providers to sit idly \nby. This voluntary disclosure, however, in no way creates an \naffirmative obligation to review customer communications in search of \nsuch imminent dangers.\n\n  Also, under existing law, a provider even one providing services to \nthe public may disclose the contents of a customer's communications--to \nlaw enforcement or anyone else--in order to protect its rights or \nproperty. See 18 U.S.C. section 2702(b)(5). However, the current \nstatute does not expressly permit a provider voluntarily to disclose \nnon-content records, such as a subscriber's login records, to law \nenforcement for purposes of self-protection. See 18 U.S.C. Section \n2703(c)(1)(B). Yet the right to disclose the content of communications \nnecessarily implies the less intrusive ability to disclose non-content \nrecords. Cf. United States v. Auler, 539 F.2d 642, 646 n.9, 7th Cir. \n1976, phone company's authority to monitor and disclose conversations \nto protect against fraud necessarily implies right to commit lesser \ninvasion of using, and disclosing fruits of, pen register device, \nciting United States v. Freeman, 524 F.2d 337, 341, 7th Cir. 1975. \nMoreover, as a practical matter providers must have the right to \ndisclose the facts surrounding attacks on their systems. When a \ntelephone carrier is defrauded by a subscriber, or when an ISP's \nauthorized user launches a network intrusion against his own ISP, the \nprovider must have the legal ability to report the complete details of \nthe crime to law enforcement. The bill clarifies that service providers \nhave the statutory authority to make such disclosures.\n  Pen Registers: There is consensus that the existing legal procedures \nfor pen register and trap-and-trace authority are antiquated and need \nto be updated. I have been proposing ways to update the pen register \nand trap and trace statutes for several years, but not necessarily in \nthe same ways as the administration initially proposed. In fact, in \n1998, I introduced with then-Senator Ashcroft, the E-PRIVACY Act, S. \n2067, which proposed changes in the pen register laws. In 1999, I \nintroduced the E-RIGHTS Act, S. 934, also with proposals to update the \npen register laws.\n  Again, in the last Congress, I introduced the Internet Security Act, \nS. 2430, on April 13, 2000, that proposed: one, changing the pen \nregister and trap and trace device law to give nationwide effect to pen \nregister and trap and trace orders obtained by Government attorneys and \nobviate the need to obtain identical orders in multiple Federal \njurisdictions; two, clarifying that such devices can be used for \ncomputer transmissions to obtain electronic addresses, not just on \ntelephone lines; and three, as a guard against abuse, providing for \nmeaningful judicial review of government attorney applications for pen \nregisters and trap and trace devices.\n  As the outline of my earlier legislation suggests, I have long \nsupported modernizing the pen register and trap and trace device laws \nby modifying the statutory language to cover the use of these orders on \ncomputer transmissions; to remove the jurisdictional limits on service \nof these orders; and to update the judicial review procedure, which, \nunlike any other area in criminal procedure, bars the exercise of \njudicial discretion in reviewing the justification for the order. The \nUSA Act, in section 216, updates the pen register and trap and trace \nlaws only in two out of three respects I believe are important, and \nwithout allowing meaningful judicial review. Yet, we were able to \nimprove the administration's initial proposal, which suffered from the \nsame problems as the provision that was hastily taken up and passed by \nthe Senate, by voice vote, on September, 13, 2001, as an amendment to \nthe Commerce Justice State Appropriations Act.\n  Nationwide Service: The existing legal procedures for pen register \nand trap-and-trace authority require service of individual orders for \ninstallation of pen register or trap and trace device on the service \nproviders that carried the targeted communications. Deregulation of the \ntelecommunications industry has had the consequence that one \ncommunication may be carried by multiple providers. For example, a \ntelephone call may be carried by a competitive local exchange carrier, \nwhich passes it at a switch to a local Bell Operating Company, which \npasses it to a long distance carrier, which hands it to an incumbent \nlocal exchange carrier elsewhere in the U.S., which in turn may finally \nhand it to a cellular carrier. If these carriers do not pass source \ninformation with each call, identifying that source may require \ncompelling information from a host of providers located throughout the \ncountry.\n  Under present law, a court may only authorize the installation of a \npen register or trap device ``within the jurisdiction of the court.'' \nAs a result, when one provider indicates that the source of a \ncommunication is a carrier in another district, a second order may be \nnecessary. The Department of Justice has advised, for example, that in \n1996, a hacker, who later turned out to be launching his attacks from a \nforeign country, extensively penetrated computers belonging to the \nDepartment of Defense. This hacker was dialing into a computer at \nHarvard University and used this computer as an intermediate staging \npoint in an effort to conceal his location and identity. Investigators \nobtained a trap and trace order instructing the phone company, Nynex, \nto trace these calls, but Nynex could only report that the \ncommunications were coming to it from a long-distance carrier, MCI. \nInvestigators then applied for a court order to obtain the connection \ninformation from MCI, but since the hacker was no longer actually using \nthe connection, MCI could not identify its source. Only if the \ninvestigators could have served MCI with a trap and trace order while \nthe hacker was actively on-line could they have successfully traced \nback and located him.\n  In another example provided by the Department of Justice, \ninvestigators\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\nencountered similar difficulties in attempting to track Kevin Mitnick, \na criminal who continued to hack into computers attached to the \nInternet despite the fact that he was on supervised release for a prior \ncomputer crime conviction. The FBI attempted to trace these electronic \ncommunications while they were in progress. In order to evade arrest, \nhowever, Mitnick moved around the country and used cloned cellular \nphones and other evasive techniques. His hacking attacks would often \npass through one of two cellular carriers, a local phone company, and \nthen two Internet service providers. In this situation, where \ninvestigators and service providers had to act quickly to trace Mitnick \nin the act of hacking, only many repeated attempts--accompanied by an \norder to each service provider--finally produced success. Fortunately, \nMitnick was such a persistent hacker that he gave law enforcement many \nchances to complete the trace.\n\n  This duplicative process of obtaining a separate order for each link \nin the communications chain can be quite time-consuming, and it serves \nno useful purpose since the original court has already authorized the \ntrace. Moreover, a second or third order addressed to a particular \ncarrier that carried part of a prior communication may prove useless \nduring the next attack: in computer intrusion cases, for example, the \ntarget may use an entirely different path, i.e., utilize a different \nset of intermediate providers, for his or her subsequent activity.\n  The bill would modify the pen register and trap and trace statutes to \nallow for nationwide service of a single order for installation of \nthese devices, without the necessity of returning to court for each new \ncarrier. I support this change.\n  Second, the language of the existing statute is hopelessly out of \ndate and speaks of a pen register or trap and trace ``device'' being \n``attached'' to a telephone ``line.'' However, the rapid \ncomputerization of the telephone system has changed the tracing \nprocess. No longer are such functions normally accomplished by physical \nhardware components attached to telephone lines. Instead, these \nfunctions are typically performed by computerized collection and \nretention of call routing information passing through a communications \nsystem.\n  The statute's definition of a ``pen register'' as a ``device'' that \nis ``attached'' to a particular ``telephone line'' is particularly \nobsolete when applied to the wireless portion of a cellular phone call, \nwhich has no line to which anything can be attached. While courts have \nauthorized pen register orders for wireless phones based on the notion \nof obtaining access to a ``virtual line,'' updating the law to keep \npace with current technology is a better course.\n  Moreover, the statute is ill-equipped to facilitate the tracing of \ncommunications that take place over the Internet. For example, the pen \nregister definition refers to telephone ``numbers'' rather than the \nbroader concept of a user's communications account. Although pen \nregister and trap orders have been obtained for activity on computer \nnetworks, Internet service providers have challenged the application of \nthe statute to electronic communications, frustrating legitimate \ninvestigations. I have long supported updating the statute by removing \nwords such as ``numbers . . . dialed'' that do not apply to the way \nthat pen/trap devices are used and to clarify the statute's proper \napplication to tracing communications in an electronic environment, but \nin a manner that is technology neutral and does not capture the content \nof communications. That being said, I have been concerned about the FBI \nand Justice Department's insistence over the past few years that the \npen/trap devices statutes be updated with broad, undefined terms that \ncontinue to flame concerns that these laws will be used to intercept \nprivate communications content.\n  The administration's initial pen/trap device proposal added the terms \n``routing'' and ``addressing'' to the definitions describing the \ninformation that was authorized for interception on the low relevance \nstandard under these laws. The administration and the Department of \nJustice flatly rejected my suggestion that these terms be defined to \nrespond to concerns that the new terms might encompass matter \nconsidered content, which may be captured only upon a showing of \nprobable cause, not the mere relevancy of the pen/trap statute. \nInstead, the administration agreed that the definition should expressly \nexclude the use of pen/trap devices to intercept ``content,'' which is \nbroadly defined in 18 U.S.C. 2510(8).\n  While this is an improvement, the FBI and Justice Department are \nshort-sighted in their refusal to define these terms. We should be \nclear about the consequence of not providing definitions for these new \nterms in the pen/trap device statutes. These terms will be defined, if \nnot by the Congress, then by the courts in the context of criminal \ncases where pen/trap devices have been used and challenged by \ndefendants. If a court determines that a pen register has captured \n``content,'' which the FBI admits such devices do, in violation of the \nFourth Amendment, suppression may be ordered, not only of the pen \nregister evidence by any other evidence derived from it. We are leaving \nthe courts with little or no guidance of what is covered by \n``addressing'' or ``routing.''\n  The USA Act also requires the government to use reasonably available \ntechnology that limits the interceptions under the pen/trap device laws \n``so as not to include the contents of any wire or electronic \ncommunications.'' This limitation on the technology used by the \ngovernment to execute pen/trap orders is important since, as the FBI \nadvised me June, 2000, pen register devices ``do capture all electronic \nimpulses transmitted by the facility on which they are attached, \nincluding such impulses transmitted after a phone call is connected to \nthe called party.'' The impulses made after the call is connected could \nreflect the electronic banking transactions a caller makes, or the \nelectronic ordering from a catalogue that a customer makes over the \ntelephone, or the electronic ordering of a prescription drug.\n  This transactional data intercepted after the call is connected is \n``content.'' As the Justice Department explained in May, 1998 in a \nletter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, ``the \nretrieval of the electronic impulses that a caller necessarily \ngenerated in attempting to direct the phone call\" does not constitute a \n``search'' requiring probable cause since ``no part of the substantive \ninformation transmitted after the caller had reached the called party'' \nis obtained. But the Justice Department made clear that ``all of the \ninformation transmitted after a phone call is connected to the called \nparty . . . is substantive in nature. These electronic impulses are the \n`contents' of the call: They are not used to direct or process the \ncall, but instead convey certain messages to the recipient.''\n  When I added the direction on use of reasonably available technology, \ncodified as 18 U.S.C. 3121(c), to the pen register statute as part of \nthe Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, CALEA, in 1994, \nI recognized that these devices collected content and that such \ncollection was unconstitutional on the mere relevance standard. \nNevertheless, the FBI advised me in June 2000, that pen register \ndevices for telephone services ``continue to operate as they have for \ndecades'' and that ``there has been no change . . . that would better \nrestrict the recording or decoding of electronic or other impulses to \nthe dialing and signaling information utilized in call processing.'' \nPerhaps, if there were meaningful judicial review and accountability, \nthe FBI would take the statutory direction more seriously and actually \nimplement it.\n  Judicial Review: Due in significant part to the fact that pen/trap \ndevices in use today collect ``content,'' I have sought in legislation \nintroduced over the past few years to update and modify the judicial \nreview procedure for pen register and trap and trace devices. Existing \nlaw requires an attorney for the Government to certify that the \ninformation likely to be obtained by the installation of a pen register \nor trap and trace device will be relevant to an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation. The court is required to issue an order upon seeing the \nprosecutor's certification. The court is not authorized to look behind \nthe certification to evaluate the judgement of the prosecutor.\n  I have urged that government attorneys be required to include facts \nabout their investigations in their applications for pen/trap orders \nand allow\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\ncourts to grant such orders only where the facts support the relevancy \nof the information likely to be obtained by the orders. This is not a \nchange in the applicable standard, which would remain the very low \nrelevancy standard. Instead, this change would simply allow the court \nto evaluate the facts presented by a prosecutor, and, if it finds that \nthe facts support the Government's assertion that the information to be \ncollected will be relevant, issue the order. Although this change will \nplace an additional burden on law enforcement, it will allow the courts \na greater ability to assure that government attorneys are using such \norders properly.\n  Some have called this change a ``roll-back'' in the statute, as if \nthe concept of allowing meaningful judicial review was an extreme \nposition. To the contrary, this is a change that the Clinton \nadministration supported in legislation transmitted to the Congress \nlast year. This is a change that the House Judiciary Committee also \nsupported last year. In the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, H.R. \n5018, that Committee proposed that before a pen/trap device ``could be \nordered installed, the government must first demonstrate to an \nindependent judge that `specific and articulable facts reasonably \nindicate that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed, and \ninformation likely to be obtained by such installation and use . . . is \nrelevant to an investigation of that crime.' '' Report 106-932, 106th \nCong. 2d Sess., Oct. 4, 2000, p. 13. Unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration has taken a contrary position and has rejected this \nchange in the judicial review process.\n  Computer Trespasser: Currently, an owner or operator of a computer \nthat is accessed by a hacker as a means for the hacker to reach a third \ncomputer, cannot simply consent to law enforcement monitoring of the \ncomputer. Instead, because the owner or operator is not technically a \nparty to the communication, law enforcement needs wiretap authorization \nunder Title III to conduct such monitoring. I have long been interested \nin closing this loophole. Indeed, when I asked about this problem, the \nFBI explained to me in June, 2000, that:\n\n       This anomaly in the law creates an untenable situation \n     whereby providers are sometimes forced to sit idly by as they \n     witness hackers enter and, in some situations, destroy or \n     damage their systems and networks while law enforcement \n     begins the detailed process of seeking court authorization to \n     assist them. In the real world, the situation is akin to a \n     homeowner being forced to helplessly watch a burglar or \n     vandal while police seek a search warrant to enter the \n     dwelling.\n\n  I therefore introduced as part of the Internet Security Act, S. 2430, \nin 2000, an exception to the wiretap statute that would explicitly \npermit such monitoring without a wiretap if prior consent is obtained \nfrom the person whose computer is being hacked through and used to send \n``harmful interference to a lawfully operating computer system.''\n  The administration initially proposed a different formulation of the \nexception that would have allowed an owner/operator of any computer \nconnected to the Internet to consent to FBI wiretapping of any user who \nviolated a workplace computer use policy or online service term of \nservice and was thereby an ``unauthorized'' user. The administration's \nproposal was not limited to computer hacking offenses under 18 U.S.C. \n1030 or to conduct that caused harm to a computer or computer system. \nThe administration rejected these refinements to their proposed wiretap \nexception, but did agree, in section 217 of the USA Act, to limit the \nauthority for wiretapping with the consent of the owner/operator to \ncommunications of unauthorized users without an existing subscriber or \nother contractual relationship with the owner/operator.\n  Sharing Criminal Justice Information: The USA Act will make \nsignificant changes in the sharing of confidential criminal justice \ninformation with various Federal agencies. For those of us who have \nbeen concerned about the leaks from the FBI that can irreparably damage \nreputations of innocent people and frustrate investigations by alerting \nsuspects to flee or destroy material evidence, the administration's \ninsistence on the broadest authority to disseminate such information, \nwithout any judicial check, is disturbing. Nonetheless, I believe we \nhave improved the administration's initial proposal in responsible \nways. Only time will tell whether the improvements we were able to \nreach agreement on are sufficient.\n  At the outset, we should be clear that current law allows the sharing \nof confidential criminal justice information, but with close court \nsupervision. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) provides that \nmatters occurring before a grand jury may be disclosed only to an \nattorney for the government, such other government personnel as are \nnecessary to assist the attorney and another grand jury. Further \ndisclosure is also allowed as specifically authorized by a court.\n  Similarly, section 2517 of title 18, United States Code provides that \nwiretap evidence may be disclosed in testimony during official \nproceedings and to investigative or law enforcement officers to the \nextent appropriate to the proper performance of their official duties. \nIn addition, the wiretap law allows disclosure of wiretap evidence \n``relating to offenses other than specified in the order'' when \nauthorized or approved by a judge. Indeed, just last year, the Justice \nDepartment assured us that ``law enforcement agencies have authority \nunder current law to share title III information regarding terrorism \nwith intelligence agencies when the information is of overriding \nimportance to the national security.'' Letter from Robert Raben, \nAssistant Attorney General, September 28, 2000.\n  For this reason, and others, the Justice Department at the time \nopposed an amendment proposed by Senators Kyl and Feinstein to S. 2507, \nthe ``Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001 that would \nhave allowed the sharing of foreign intelligence and \ncounterintelligence information collected from wiretaps with the \nintelligence community.'' I deferred to the Justice Department on this \nissue and sought changes in the proposed amendment to address the \nDepartment's concern that this provision was not only unnecessary but \nalso ``could have significant implications for prosecutions and the \ndiscovery process in litigation,'' ``raises significant issues \nregarding the sharing with intelligence agencies of information \ncollected about United States persons'' and jeopardized ``the need to \nprotect equities relating to ongoing criminal investigations.'' In the \nend, the amendment was revised to address the Justice Department's \nconcerns and passed the Senate as a free-standing bill, S. S. 3205, the \nCounterterrorism Act of 2000. The House took no action on this \nlegislation.\n  Disclosure of Wiretap Information: The administration initially \nproposed adding a sweeping provision to the wiretap statute that \nbroadened the definition of an ``investigative or law enforcement \nofficer'' who may receive disclosures of information obtained through \nwiretaps to include Federal law enforcement, intelligence, national \nsecurity, national defense, protective and immigration personnel and \nthe President and Vice President. This proposal troubled me because \ninformation intercepted by a wiretap has enormous potential to infringe \nupon the privacy rights of innocent people, including people who are \nnot even suspected of a crime and merely happen to speak on the \ntelephone with the targets of an investigation. For this reason, the \nauthority to disclose information obtained through a wiretap has always \nbeen carefully circumscribed in law.\n  While I recognize that appropriate officials in the executive branch \nof government should have access to wiretap information that is \nimportant to combating terrorism or protecting the national security, I \nproposed allowing such disclosures where specifically authorized by a \ncourt order. Further, with respect to information relating to \nterrorism, I proposed allowing the disclosure without a court order as \nlong as the judge who authorized the wiretap was notified as soon as \npracticable after the fact. This would have provided a check against \nabuses of the disclosure authority by providing for review by a neutral \njudicial official. At the same time, there was a little likelihood that \na judge would deny any requests for disclosure in cases where it was \nwarranted.\n  On Sunday, September 30, the administration agreed to my proposal, \nbut within two days, it backed away from its agreement. I remain \nconcerned that the resulting provision will allow the unprecedented, \nwidespread disclosure\n\n[[Page S10374]]\n\nof this highly sensitive information without any notification to or \nreview by the court that authorizes and supervises the wiretap. This is \nclearly an area where our committee will have to exercise close \noversight to make sure that the newly-minted disclosure authority is \nnot being abused.\n\n  The administration offered three reasons for reneging on the original \ndeal. First, they claimed that the involvement of the court would \ninhibit Federal investigators and attorneys from disclosing information \nneeded by intelligence and national security officials. Second, they \nsaid the courts might not have adequate security and therefore should \nnot be told that information was disclosed for intelligence or national \nsecurity purposes. And third, they said the President's constitutional \npowers under Article II give him authority to get whatever foreign \nintelligence he needs to exercise his national security \nresponsibilities.\n  I believe these concerns are unfounded. Federal investigators and \nattorneys will recognize the need to disclose information relevant to \nterrorism investigations. Courts can be trusted to keep secrets and \nrecognize the needs of the President.\n  Current law requires that such information be used only for law \nenforcement purpose. This provides an assurance that highly intrusive \ninvasions of privacy are confined to the purpose for which they have \nbeen approved by a court, based on probable cause, as required by the \nFourth Amendment. Current law calls for minimization procedures to \nensure that the surveillance does not gather information about private \nand personal conduct and conversations that are not relevant to the \ncriminal investigation.\n  When the administration reneged on the agreement regarding court \nsupervision, we turned to other safeguards and were more successful in \nchanging other questionable features of the administration's bill. The \nadministration accepted my proposal to strike the term ``national \nsecurity'' from the description of wiretap information that may be \nshared throughout the executive branch and replace it with ``foreign \nintelligence'' information. This change is important in clarifying what \ninformation may be disclosed because the term ``foreign intelligence'' \nis specifically defined by statute whereas ``national security'' is \nnot.\n  Moreover, the rubric of ``national security'' has been used to \njustify some particularly unsavory activities by the government in the \npast. We must have at least some assurance that we are not embarked on \na course that will lead to a repetition of these abuses because the \nstatute will now more clearly define what type of information is \nsubject to disclosure. In addition, Federal officials who receive the \ninformation may use it only as necessary to the conduct of their \nofficial duties. Therefore, any disclosure or use outside the conduct \nof their official duties remains subject to all limitations applicable \nto their retention and dissemination of information of the type of \ninformation received. This includes the Privacy Act, the criminal \npenalties for unauthorized disclosure of electronic surveillance \ninformation under chapter 119 of title 18, and the contempt penalties \nfor unauthorized disclosure of grand jury information. In addition, the \nAttorney General must establish procedures for the handling of \ninformation that identifies a United States person, such as the \nrestrictions on retention and dissemination of foreign intelligence and \ncounterintelligence information pertaining to United States persons \ncurrently in effect under Executive Order 12333.\n  While these safeguards do not fully substitute for court supervision, \nthey can provide some assurance against misuse of the private, \npersonal, and business information about Americans that is acquired in \nthe course of criminal investigations and that may flow more widely in \nthe intelligence, defense, and national security worlds.\n  Disclosure of Grand Jury Information: The wiretap statute was not the \nonly provision in which the administration sought broader authority to \ndisclose highly sensitive investigative information. It also proposed \nbroadening Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to \nallow the disclosure of information relating to terrorism and national \nsecurity obtained from grand jury proceedings to a broad range of \nofficials in the executive branch of government. As with wiretaps, few \nwould disagree that information learned in a criminal investigation \nthat is necessary to combating terrorism or protecting the national \nsecurity ought to be shared with the appropriate intelligence and \nnational security officials. The question is how best to regulate and \nlimit such disclosures so as not to compromise the important policies \nof secrecy and confidentiality that have long applied to grand jury \nproceedings.\n  I proposed that we require judicial review of requests to disclose \nterrorism and foreign intelligence information to officials in the \nexecutive branch beyond those already authorized to receive such \ndisclosures. Once again, the administration agreed to my proposal on \nSunday, September 30, but reneged within two days. As a result, the \nbill does not provide for any judicial supervision of the new \nauthorization for dissemination of grand jury information throughout \nthe executive branch. The bill does contain the safeguards that I have \ndiscussed with respect to law enforcement wiretap information. However, \nas with the new wiretap disclosure authority, I am troubled by this \nissue and plan to exercise the close oversight of the Judiciary \nCommittee to make sure it is not being abused.\n  Foreign Intelligence Information Sharing: The administration also \nsought a provision that would allow the sharing of foreign intelligence \ninformation throughout the executive branch of the government \nnotwithstanding any current legal prohibition that may prevent or limit \nits disclosure. I have resisted this proposal more strongly than \nanything else that still remains in the bill. What concerns me is that \nit is not clear what existing prohibitions this provision would affect \nbeyond the grand jury secrecy rule and the wiretap statute, which are \nalready covered by other provisions in the bill. Even the \nadministration, which wrote this provision, has not been able to \nprovide a fully satisfactory explanation of its scope.\n  If there are specific laws that the administration believes impede \nthe necessary sharing of information on terrorism and foreign \nintelligence within the executive branch, we should address those \nproblems through legislation that is narrowly targeted to those \nstatutes. Tacking on a blunderbuss provision whose scope we do not \nfully understand can only lead to consequences that we cannot foresee. \nFurther, I am concerned that such legislation, broadly authorizing \nthe secret sharing of intelligence information throughout the executive \nbranch, will fuel the unwarranted fears and dark conspiracy theories of \nAmericans who do not trust their government. This was another provision \non which the administration reneged on its agreement with me; it agreed \nto drop it on September 30, but resurrected it within two days, \ninsisting that it remain in the bill. I have been able to mitigate its \npotential for abuse somewhat by adding the same safeguards that apply \nto disclosure of law enforcement wiretap and grand jury information.\n\n  ``Sneak and Peek'' Search Warrants: Another issue that has caused me \nserious concern relates to the administration's proposal for so-called \n``sneak and peek'' search warrants. The House Judiciary Committee \ndropped this proposal entirely from its version of the legislation. \nNormally, when law enforcement officers execute a search warrant, they \nmust leave a copy of the warrant and a receipt for all property seized \nat the premises searched. Thus, even if the search occurs when the \nowner of the premises is not present, the owner will receive notice \nthat the premises have been lawfully searched pursuant to a warrant \nrather than, for example, burglarized.\n  Two circuit courts of appeal, the Second and the Ninth Circuits, have \nrecognized a limited exception to this requirement. When specifically \nauthorized by the issuing judge or magistrate, the officers may delay \nproviding notice of the search to avoid compromising an ongoing \ninvestigation or for some other good reason. However, this authority \nhas been carefully circumscribed.\n  First, the Second and Ninth Circuit cases have dealt only with \nsituations where the officers search a premises without seizing any \ntangible property. As the Second Circuit explained, such\n\n[[Page S10375]]\n\nsearches are ``less intrusive than a conventional search with physical \nseizure because the latter deprives the owner not only of privacy but \nalso of the use of his property.'' United States v. Villegas, 899 F.2d \n1324, 1337 (2d Cir. 1990).\n  Second, the cases have required that the officers seeking the warrant \nmust show good reason for the delay. Finally, while the courts have \nallowed notice of the search may be delayed, it must be provided within \na reasonable period thereafter, which should generally be no more than \nseven days. The reasons for these careful limitations were spelled out \nsuccinctly by Judge Sneed of the Ninth Circuit: ``The mere thought of \nstrangers walking through and visually examining the center of our \nprivacy interest, our home, arouses our passion for freedom as does \nnothing else. That passion, the true source of the Fourth Amendment, \ndemands that surreptitious entries be closely circumscribed.'' See \nUnited States v. Freitas, 800 F.2d 1451, 1456 (9th Cir. 1986).\n  The administration's original proposal would have ignored some of the \nkey limitations created by the caselaw for sneak and peek search \nwarrants. First, it would have broadly authorized officers not only to \nconduct surreptitious searches, but also to secretly seize any type of \nproperty without any additional showing of necessity. This type of \nwarrant, which has never been addressed by a published decision of a \nfederal appellate court, has been referred to in a law review article \nwritten by an FBI agent as a ``sneak and steal'' warrant. See K. Corr, \n``Sneaky But Lawful: The Use of Sneak and Peek Search Warrants,'' 43 U. \nKan. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (1995). Second, the proposal would simply have \nadopted the procedural requirements of 18 U.S.C. section 2705 for \nproviding delayed notice of a wiretap. Among other things, this would \nhave extended the permissible period of delay to a maximum of 90 days, \ninstead of the presumptive seven-day period provided by the caselaw on \nsneak and peek warrants.\n  I was able to make significant improvements in the administration's \noriginal proposal that will help to ensure that the government's \nauthority to obtain sneak and peek warrants is not abused. First, the \nprovision that is now in section 213 of the bill prohibits the \ngovernment from seizing any tangible property or any wire or electronic \ncommunication or stored electronic information unless it makes a \nshowing of reasonable necessity for the seizure. Thus, in contrast to \nthe administration's original proposal, the presumption is that the \nwarrant will authorize only a search unless the government can make a \nspecific showing of additional need for a seizure. Second, the \nprovision now requires that notice be given within a reasonable time of \nthe execution of the warrant rather than giving a blanket authorization \nfor up to a 90-day delay. What constitutes a reasonable time, of \ncourse, will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. But \nI would expect courts to be guided by the teachings of the Second and \nthe Ninth Circuits that, in the ordinary case, a reasonable time is no \nmore than seven days.\n  Several changes in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, \nare designed to clarify technical aspects of the statutory framework \nand take account of experience in practical implementation. These \nchanges are not controversial, and they will facilitate the collection \nof intelligence for counterterrorism and counterintelligence purposes. \nOther changes are more significant and required careful evaluation and \nrevision of the administration's proposals.\n  The USA Act, in section 207, changes the duration of electronic \nsurveillance under FISA in cases of an agent of a foreign power, other \nthan a United States persons, who acts in the United States as an \nofficer or employee of a foreign power or as a member of an \ninternational terrorist group. Current law limits court orders in these \ncases to 90 days, the same duration as for United States persons. \nExperience indicates, however, that after the initial period has \nconfirmed probable cause that the foreign national meets the statutory \nstandard, court orders are renewed repeatedly and the 90-day renewal \nbecomes an unnecessary procedural for investigators taxed with far more \npressing duties.\n  The administration proposed that the period of electronic \nsurveillance be changed from 90 days to one year in these cases. This \nproposal did not ensure adequate review after the initial stage to \nensure that the probable cause determination remained justified over \ntime. Therefore, the bill changes the initial period of the \nsurveillance 90 to 120 days and changes the period for extensions from \n90 days to one year. The initial 120-day period provides for a review \nof the results of the surveillance or search directed at an individual \nbefore one-year extensions are requested. These changes do not affect \nsurveillance of a United States person.\n  The bill also changes the period for execution of an order for \nphysical search under FISA from 45 to 90 days. This change applies to \nUnited States persons as well as foreign nationals. Experience since \nphysical search authority was added to FISA in 1994 indicates that 45 \ndays is frequently not long enough to plan and carry out a covert \nphysical search. There is no change in the restrictions which provide \nthat United States persons may not be the targets of search or \nsurveillance under FISA unless a judge finds probable cause to believe \nthat they are agents of foreign powers who engage in specified \ninternational terrorist, sabotage, or clandestine intelligence \nactivities that may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the \nUnited States.\n  The bill, in section 208, seeks to ensure that the special court \nestablished under FISA has sufficient judges to handle the workload. \nWhile changing the duration of orders and extensions will reduce the \nnumber of cases in some categories, the bill retains the court's role \nin pen register and trap and trace cases and expands the court's \nresponsibility for issuing orders for records and other tangible items \nneeded for counterintelligence and counter terrorism investigations. \nUpon reviewing the court's requirements, the administration requested \nan increase in the number of Federal district judges designated for the \ncourt from seven to 11 of whom no less than 3 shall reside within 20 \nmiles of the District of Columbia. The latter provision ensures that \nmore than one judge is available to handle cases on short notice and \nreduces the need to invoke the alternative of Attorney General approval \nunder the emergency authorities in FISA.\n  Other changes in FISA and related national security laws are more \ncontroversial. In several areas, the bill reflects a serious effort to \naccommodate the requests for expanded surveillance authority with the \nneed for safeguards against misuse, especially the gathering of \nintelligence about the lawful political or commercial activities of \nAmericans. One of the most difficult issues was whether to eliminate \nthe existing statutory ``agent of a foreign power'' standards for \nsurveillance and investigative techniques that raise important privacy \nconcerns, but not at the level that the Supreme Court has held to \nrequire a court order and a probable cause finding under the fourth \namendment. These include pen register and trap and trace devices, \naccess to business records and other tangible items held by third \nparties, and access to records that have statutory privacy protection. \nThe latter include telephone, bank, and credit records.\n  The ``agent of a foreign power'' standard in existing law was \ndesigned to ensure that the FBI and other intelligence agencies do not \nuse these surveillance and investigative methods to investigate the \nlawful activities of Americans in the name of an undefined authority to \ncollect foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information. The \nlaw has required a showing of reasonable suspicion, less than probable \ncause, to believe that a United States person is an ``agent of a \nforeign power'' engaged in international terrorism or clandestine \nintelligence activities.\n  However, the ``agent of a foreign power'' standard is more stringent \nthan the standard under comparable criminal law enforcement procedures \nwhich require only a showing of relevance to a criminal investigation. \nThe FBI's experience under existing laws since they were enacted at \nvarious time over the past 15 years has been that, in practice, the \nrequirement to show reasonable suspicion that a person is an ``agent of \na foreign power'' has been almost as burdensome as the\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\nrequirement to show probable cause required by the fourth amendment for \nmore intrusive techniques. The FBI has made a clear case that a \nrelevance standard is appropriate for counterintelligence and \ncounterterrorism investigations, as well as for criminal \ninvestigations.\n  The challenge, then, was to define those investigations. The \nalternative proposed by the administration was to cover any \ninvestigation to obtain foreign intelligence information. This was \nextremely broad, because the definition includes any information with \nrespect to a foreign power that relates to, and if concerning a United \nStates person is necessary to, the national defense or the security of \nthe United States or the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United \nStates. This goes far beyond FBI counterintelligence and \ncounterterrorism requirements. Instead, the bill requires that use of \nthe surveillance technique or access to the records be relevant to an \ninvestigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine \nintelligence activities.\n  In addition, an investigation of a United States person may not be \nbased solely on activities protected by the first amendment. This \nframework applies to pen registers and trap and trace under section \n215, access to records and other items under section 215, and the \nnational security authorities for access to telephone, bank, and credit \nrecords under section 506. Lawful political dissent and protest by \nAmerican citizens against the government may not be the basis for FBI \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations under these \nprovisions.\n  A separate issue for pen registers and trap and trace under FISA is \nwhether the court should have the discretion to make the decision on \nrelevance. The administration has insisted on a certification process. \nI discussed this issue as it comes up in the criminal procedures for \npen registers and trap and trace under title 18, and my concerns apply \nto the FISA procedures as well.\n  The most controversial change in FISA requested by the administration \nwas the proposal to allow surveillance and search when ``a purpose'' is \nto obtain foreign intelligence information. Current law requires that \nthe secret procedures and different probable cause standards under FISA \nbe used only if a high-level executive official certifies that ``the \npurpose'' is to obtain foreign intelligence formation. The \nadministration's aim was to allow FISA surveillance and search for law \nenforcement purposes, so long as there was at least some element of a \nforeign intelligence purpose. This proposal raised constitutional \nconcerns, which were addressed in a legal opinion provided by the \nJustice Department, which I insert in the record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The Justice Department opinion did not defend the constitutionality \nof the original proposal. Instead, it addressed a suggestion made by \nSenator Feinstein to the Attorney General at the Judiciary Committee \nhearing to change ``the purpose'' to ``a significant purpose.'' No \nmatter what statutory change is made even the Department concedes that \nthe court's may impose a constitutional requirement of ``primary \npurpose'' based on the appellate court decisions upholding FISA against \nconstitutional challenges over the past 20 years.\n  Section 218 of the bill adopts ``significant purpose,'' and it will \nbe up to the courts to determine how far law enforcement agencies may \nuse FISA for criminal investigation and prosecution beyond the scope of \nthe statutory definition of ``foreign intelligence information.''\n  In addition, I proposed and the administration agreed to an \nadditional provision in Section 505 that clarifies the boundaries for \nconsultation and coordination between officials who conduct FISA search \nand surveillance and Federal law enforcement officials including \nprosecutors. Such consultation and coordination is authorized for the \nenforcement of laws that protect against international terrorism, \nclandestine intelligence activities of foreign agents, and other grave \nforeign threats to the nation. Protection against these foreign-based \nthreats by any lawful means is within the scope of the definition of \n``foreign intelligence information,'' and the use of FISA to gather \nevidence for the enforcement of these laws was contemplated in the \nenactment of FISA. The Justice Department's opinion cites relevant \nlegislative history from the Senate Intelligence Committee's report in \n1978, and there is comparable language in the House report.\n  The administration initially proposed that the Attorney General be \nauthorized to detain any alien indefinitely upon certification of \nsuspicion to links to terrorist activities or organizations. Under \nclose questioning by both Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter at the \nCommittee hearing on September 25, the Attorney General said that his \nproposal was intended only to allow the Government to hold an alien \nsuspected of terrorist activity while deportation proceedings were \nongoing. In response to a question by Sen. Specter, the Attorney \nGeneral said: ``Our intention is to be able to detain individuals who \nare the subject of deportation proceedings on other grounds, to detain \nthem as if they were the subject of deportation proceedings on \nterrorism.'' The Justice Department however continued to insist on \nbroader authority, including the power to detain even if the alien was \nfound not to be deportable.\n  I remain concerned about the provision, in section 412, but I believe \nthat it is has been improved from the original proposal offered by the \nadministration. Specifically, the Justice Department must now charge an \nalien with an immigration or criminal violation within seven days of \ntaking custody, and the merits of the Attorney General's certification \nof an alien under this section is subject to judicial review. Moreover, \nthe Attorney General can only delegate this power to the Commissioner \nof the INS, ensuring greater accountability and preventing the \ncertification decision from being made by low-level officials. \nNonetheless, I would have preferred that this provision not be \nincluded, and I would urge the Attorney General and his successors to \nemploy great discretion in using this new power.\n  In addition, the administration initially proposed a sweeping \ndefinition of terrorist activity and new powers for the Secretary of \nState to certify an organization as a terrorist organization for \npurposes of immigration law. We were able to work with the \nadministration to refine this definition to limit its application to \nindividuals with innocent contacts to non-certified organizations. We \nalso limited the retroactive effect of these new definitions. If an \nalien solicited funds or membership, or provided material support for \nan organization that was not certified at that time by the Secretary of \nState, the alien will have the opportunity to show that he did not know \nand should have known that his action would further the organizations \nterrorist activity. This is a substantially more protective than the \nadministration's proposal, which by its terms, would have empowered INS \nto deport someone who raised money for the African National Congress. \nThroughout our negotiations on these issues, Senator Kennedy provided \nsteadfast help. Although neither of us are pleased with the final \nproduct, it is far better than it would have been without his \nleadership.\n  I was disappointed that the administration's initial proposal \nauthorizing the President to impose unilateral food and medical \nsanctions would have undermined a law we passed last year with \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Under that law, the President already has full authority to impose \nunilateral food and medicine sanctions during this crisis because of \ntwo exceptions built into the law that apply to our current situation. \nNevertheless, the administration sought to undo this law and obtain \nvirtually unlimited authority in the future to impose food and medicine \nembargoes, without making any effort for a multi-lateral approach in \ncooperation with other nations. Absent such a multi-lateral approach, \nother nations would be free to step in immediately and take over \nbusiness from American firms and farmers that they are unilaterally \nbarred from pursuing.\n  Over 30 farm and export groups, including the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the Grocery Manufacturers of America, the National Farmers \nUnion, and the U.S. Dairy Export Council, wrote to me and explained \nthat the administration proposal would ``not achieve its intended \npolicy goal.''\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\n  I worked with Senator Enzi, and other Senators, on substitute \nlanguage to give the administration the tools it needs in this crisis. \nThis substitute has been carefully crafted to avoid needlessly hurting \nAmerican farmers in the future, yet it will assure that the United \nStates can engage in effective multilateral sanctions.\n  This bipartisan agreement limits the authority in the bill to \nexisting laws and executive orders, which give the President full \nauthority regarding this conflict, and grants authority for the \nPresident to restrict exports of agricultural products, medicine or \nmedical devices. I continue to agree with then-Senator Ashcroft, who \nargued in 1999 that unilateral U.S. food and medicine sanctions simply \ndo not work when he introduced the ``Food and Medicine for the World \nAct.'' As recently as October 2000, then-Senator Ashcroft pointed out \nhow broad, unilateral embargoes of food or medicine are often \ncounterproductive. Many Republican and Democratic Senators made it \nclear just last year that the U.S. should work with other countries on \nfood and medical sanctions so that the sanctions will be effective in \nhurting our enemies, instead of just hurting the U.S. I am glad that \nwith Senator Enzi's help, we were able to make changes in the trade \nsanctions provision to both protect our farmers and help the President \nduring this crisis.\n  I have done my best under the circumstances to confine the amendment \ndemands to those matters that are consensus legal improvements. I \nconcede that my efforts have not been completely successful and there \nare a number of provisions on which the administration has insisted \nwith which I disagree. Frankly, the agreement that was made September \n30, 2001 would have led to a better balanced bill. I could not stop the \nadministration from reneging on the agreement any more than I could \nhave sped the process to reconstitute this bill in the aftermath of \nthose breaches.\n  In these times we need to work together to face the challenges of \ninternational terrorism. I have sought to do so in good faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10377-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10377-S10378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA RENAISSANCE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, there is a renaissance occurring in West \nVirginia's Northern Panhandle. In the city of Wheeling, through the \nWheeling National Heritage Area initiative, local leaders are \nrevitalizing areas of cultural and historic significance in order to \ncreate a brighter future for their community.\n  On August 15, I had the opportunity to attend the dedication of the \nlatest milestone in these revitalization efforts--the Wheeling Heritage \nPort, which is nestled on a bank of the magnificent Ohio River. \nWheeling, the Mountain State's first capital, is not only rich in \nnatural resources, but also in history.\n  In its beginnings, Wheeling was a small outpost that represented the \nwesternmost point of eastern settlement in a young country. Because of \nits location, Wheeling became the window of the West and a gateway to \nthe unknown. Travelers flocked to this new epicenter of commerce and \ntransportation in pursuit of fortune and adventure. After the Civil \nWar, Wheeling, and much of the Northern Panhandle, experienced a \npostwar industrial expansion that brought to the area great prosperity \nthat would last well into the 20th century. A booming economy, combined \nwith a natural beauty and a genteel society, ushered in an era of \nVictorian splendor.\n  However, as market demands changed, Wheeling--along with most \nindustrial regions throughout this nation and across West Virginia--\nrepositioned itself, transitioning from an industrial base to a more \ndiverse, high-tech economy. While it has focused on economic \ndevelopment, the city also has kept an eye on preserving its rich \ncultural and historic areas.\n  I have supported Wheeling's efforts to redevelop its historic \ndowntown by winning congressional approval for legislation that \nestablished the Wheeling National Heritage Area. The mission of a \nheritage area is to preserve the lessons of history for future \ngenerations so that they can better lead tomorrow. The Wheeling Port is \njust one of the many components of the heritage area, which includes \nthe Wheeling Visitors Center and the Artisan Center. I am very \nfortunate to have had the opportunity to assist the city of Wheeling in \nthese initiatives, but the man who first exhibited the vision for \nrenewal of this city was my friend, the late Harry Hamm.\n  It was Harry, more than anyone, who recognized that Wheeling, like \nother industrial regions in America, would need to transform its \neconomy. In his own words, Harry said that Wheeling would have to \n``take the old, idle, and abandoned factories . . . and create in them \n. . . a public place where people can feel at home. . . .'' In an \neffort to accomplish this task, Harry laid out a plan that would \npromote the city's heritage and, once again, establish it as a national \ncenter of commerce and trade. Harry envisioned Wheeling as a hub of \nhigh-technology and as a new port of entry to the heartland of our \ncountry.\n  For those of us who knew Harry, we know that he was not an \nunrealistic dreamer, but that he was a man who worked hard and \ntirelessly to propel Wheeling toward a brighter future. It was his \nforesight and leadership that brought about the establishment of the \nWheeling National Heritage Area. Although Harry passed away several \nyears ago, if you ever have the opportunity to travel to Wheeling, you \nwill undoubtably see the imprint that he left on this wonderful city.\n  Among Harry's ideas for revitalizing the downtown area of Wheeling \nwas the resurrection of the vibrant heart of the city--the waterfront. \nThe port once served as a main destination point for steamboats \ntraveling down the Ohio River. Now, with its restoration complete, the \nport will recreate the bustle of the steamboat port that it once was. \nIt will serve as a civic ``open space''--a community meeting place \nenlivened by festivals and concerts.\n  The port's restoration is another step to ensure that Wheeling's \nlegacy to America is preserved for generations to come. The community's \nefforts to embrace its cultural and historic heritage, while also \ninvesting in its future, provide us with a glimpse into the ongoing \nrestoration and redevelopment of our nation's industrial regions. The \nactivities undertaken in Wheeling could serve as a blueprint for post-\nindustrial America and the communities in pursuit of a revitalized \neconomy. As the Wheeling of old served as a guidepost in America's \nwestward expansion, the new Wheeling can serve as a model for a 21st \ncentury economy and a 21st century community that has not forgotten its \npast.\n  At the dedication of the port, Rabbi Ronald H. Bernstein-Goff of \nTemple Shalom and Dr. D.W. Cummings of Bethlehem Apostolic Temple, both \nof Wheeling, offered the invocation and the benediction, respectively. \nMadam President, I ask unanimous consent to have these prayers printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Prayer by Rabbi Ronald H. Bernstein-Goff, D.D.\n\n       Master of the universe--Creator of Earth and sky, fire and \n     water, and author of time, flowing like a great river, \n     carrying us down the days and years of our lives.\n       We gather here today with gratitude for the rich history, \n     the vitality, and prosperity, which those who came before us \n     worked and labored to create, we were proud in the past, \n     because we were prosperous; we had dignity, because we were \n     successful; we had hope, because we seemed to be in control \n     of our destinies.\n       It seems to us like yesterday, although the river has \n     carried us very far from that past. We acknowledge that it \n     has taken us too long to deal with the realities of decline \n     and decay; too long to deal with our feelings of guilt and \n     shame, as buildings were boarded up and the joyful noise of \n     life faded into uneasy silence; too long to face our fear of \n     change--our fear of the unknown. And just because we have had \n     faith in you, does not mean we had faith in ourselves or in \n     each other.\n       Yet, you have taught us that out of suffering and struggle, \n     distress and despair, comes the capacity for renewal and \n     self-transformation.\n       ``Out of the depths have I called you, O God''.--Psalm \n     130:1.\n       ``Revive my spirit, lest I sleep the sleep of death.''--\n     Psalms: 13:4:16.\n       How can we thank You then, for giving us the wisdom and the \n     courage to stand before You this day, as we dedicate \n     ourselves to a new hopefulness and a new reality? How can we \n     thank You for bringing us beyond nostalgia to a waking vision \n     of the future; to a renewed sense of solidarity and purpose \n     in our community--our hopeful city; how can\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\n     we thank You for the awareness that only by facing reality \n     can we change it; for reminding us that You fashioned us \n     beyond dust and ashes; that we can be little lower than the \n     angels after all.\n       We thank You for the vision of our local leadership; of the \n     Wheeling National Heritage Corporation, and Mayor Nick \n     Sparachane.\n       We are grateful for the presence of Congressman Alan B. \n     Mollohan who is with us this morning to help us dedicate \n     heritage port.\n       We thank You for Senator Robert Byrd--his dedication, his \n     devotion, and his love for the people of West Virginia. \n     Because of his vision, drive and commitment, the people of \n     Wheeling have a new place of beauty to imagine a brighter \n     future.\n       Bless us all, and the work of our hands. With pride in our \n     past, with hope for our future, with faith in You and faith \n     in each other do we gather this day to dedicate this heritage \n     port.\n       Amen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              The Benediction Prayer, By Dr. D.W. Cummings\n\n       Dear Father, O Father, Father of us all. Red, Yellow, Black \n     and White, we are precious in your sight. Thank you for the \n     dedication of Wheeling Heritage Port. Thank you for our local \n     leadership. The may of Wheeling, the councilmen of Wheeling, \n     the Wheeling Heritage Port Board, Representative Mollohan, \n     Senator Robert C. Byrd and all who made this dream come true.\n       Thank you for the memory of Harry Ham. Thank you for the \n     knowledge that one of the main reasons why Wheeling is not \n     the Capital of the state of West Virginia is because of a \n     clown.\n       Lord, we know that is not the end of a Hopeful City, and \n     neither is it the beginning. But Lord, let it be the end of \n     the beginning. Help us to move to the next level of making \n     Wheeling and the Ohio Valley a more hopeful area, and a more \n     hopeful city for all its residents.\n       Gracious Lord, help us to always remember that \n     ``Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to \n     any people.''

Madam President, today I would like to take a moment \nand recognize all those brave firefighters who died in the line of duty \nlast year.\n  This past Sunday--October 7--was National Fallen Firefighters \nMemorial Day. The President and Mrs. Bush joined with thousands of \nfamily members and friends at the National Fallen Firefighters \nMemorial, located in Emmitsburg, MD, to honor those who have given the \nultimate sacrifice. In 2000, 99 brave men and women in 38 States and \nPuerto Rico lost their lives trying to save the lives of others. I am \nsaddened to say Mr. Robert W. Crump from the Denver Fire Department was \none of the many honored this past weekend.\n  In 1999, over 1.8 million fires were attended to by a public fire \ndepartment. That means fire departments across the country responded to \na fire once every 17 seconds. In that same year, fire resulted in over \n$10 billion of property damage, almost 22,000 civilian injuries, and \nalmost 3,000 civilian deaths.\n  We currently have over a million firefighters in the United States. \nWhile there are thousands of career firefighters that serve us each day \nin cities across the country, there are over 785,000 volunteer \nfirefighters. In fact, most communities with less than 25,000 people \nare served by these volunteer units.\n  As we saw on September 11th, firefighters are among the first on the \nscene. It is without a doubt that there would have been hundreds if not \nthousands of more victims without the help of those brave public \nservants. It is our job to make sure that these our firefighters have \nthe right tools and training so that they may continue to work saving \nthousands of people each year.\n  We must also remember that these acts of bravery not only occur in \nour cities but also in our national forests. As a citizen of the \nAmerican West, I have seen the devastating effect forest fires have on \nour country. An average of over 100,000 fires burn nearly 4 million \nacres each year. Federal forest firefighters based throughout the \ncountry work with local departments to protect the national forest \nsystem.\n  Since 1981 the names of 2,181 firefighters have been added to the \nplaques that surround the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. As a \nCo-Chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I will continue \nto work to insure that these firefighters will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10378-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10378-S10379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNITION OF TOM MORFORD\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise today to say thank you and \nfarewell to a trusted friend and a dedicated public servant, Tom \nMorford. For the past 5 years, Tom has served as the deputy \nadministrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nhelping to bring health care to millions of underserved Americans. \nWithout much fanfare or public recognition, he has quietly and \ndutifully served the American people in this post and in many others \nover the past three decades.\n  I do not know if Tom had planned for such a long career in public \nservice when he came to Washington in 1971. Since he first began as a \nmanagement intern at the then Department of Health, Education and \nWelfare, Tom has held numerous positions, authored 12 papers, and \nreceived more awards than time will allow me to recite.\n  For the past five years as deputy administrator at HRSA, Tom spent \nhis days making hundreds of phone calls, reviewing budgets, and signing \ncontracts. It isn't the kind of work that will make you famous, but it \ndoes make a tremendous difference.\n  Tom was responsible for some of America's most vital public health \nprograms; the construction of health care facilities, the operation of \nhealth clinics in underserved areas, and the training of healthcare \nprofessionals. His leadership helped strengthen the nation's community \nhealth centers, bringing primary health care services to nearly 12 \nmillion people this past year alone. Tom also helped pioneer the \ncomprehensive telehealth network which provides first-class health care \nto the hardest to reach communities.\n  Yet Tom's accomplishments go much further than the systems he oversaw \nor the facilities he helped build. Tom's greatest skill has always been \nhis desire to put aside egos and politics so he could concentrate on \nserving the American people. From the secretaries and grants officers \nat HRSA to Members of Congress, Tom listens, builds relationships and \ntrust, then gets the job done. By his example alone, Tom reminds us why \nwe entered public service--to make a difference.\n  Now, thirty years later, Tom has decided to move on. He leaves behind \na tremendous legacy and our nation's health care system is better for \nhis efforts. While he will be sorely missed, we thank him for what he \nhas already anonymously done for millions of people.\n  It is said that ``a hand never opens in vain.'' Tom Morford has spent \nthe last 30 years opening his hands to a succession of presidents and \nsecretaries, to legislators, and to health care providers and \nadvocates. Most importantly, Tom Morford opened his hands to the \nmillions of forgotten who are often left in the shadows of our society.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in the Congress and the millions of \nAmericans who don't know Tom, but who benefit from his work, I say a \nsimply thank you. Thank you, Tom, for opening your hands to lift those \nmost in need. You will be missed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Today I want to salute and thank Mr. Thomas G. Morford, \nas he retires from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), \nafter almost 30 years of dedicated service to the American people. As \nthe Ranking Member of the Labor, HHS, and Education Subcommittee on \nAppropriations, I want to express my gratitude to Tom for the \nassistance he has provided to our subcommittee over the years. His \nknowledge of appropriations law and the federal budgetary process, and \nhis willingness to assist my staff has been an invaluable service to \nthe subcommittee. Tom spent many long hours, working under tight \ndeadlines, putting together the President's budget and, in turn, \nhelping our subcommittee complete our appropriations bills. Vital \nprograms like Healthy Start, the National Health Service Corps, Ryan \nWhite AIDS programs, and Health Professions--to name a few--have \nbenefited from Tom's tireless efforts.\n\n  Tom has been a valued member of the staff at HHS, first in the Office \nof the Secretary, then with the Health Care Financing Administration, \nand finally with the Health Resources and Services Administration. My \nstaff and I will miss his presence, guidance, patience, and good humor \nduring the fiscal year\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\n2002 appropriations season and beyond. But, more importantly, the \nAmerican people are losing a valued and dedicated public servant. Tom \nis one of those unsung heroes throughout our government who has made it \nhis life's work to help those in need. But today, as Tom leaves us, I \nwant to sing his praises and let all who hear this know what a great \nloss his departure means to so many of us. I recognize, though, that \nTom is embarking on another new and exciting chapter in his life, both \npersonally and professionally. I know that one of Tom's goals is to \nspend more time with his wife, Gail, and their two daughters, which his \nretirement will allow him to do. I also know that Tom plans to continue \nto use his talents and gifts to help others in his new position with \nJohns Hopkins University. He deserves the very best in these future \nendeavors and, therefore, today I extend my heartfelt praise, thanks, \nand best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10379-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CAPTAIN ROBERT E. DOLAN, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to \nthe life of one of our servicemen who perished at the Pentagon during \nthe horrific events of 11 September, Navy Captain Robert E. Dolan. \nDuring one of my many recent visits to the site where so many \ntragically lost their lives, I met Captain Dolan's widow, Mrs. Lisa \nDolan. As we stood together on the southwest lawn of the Pentagon, we \nspoke of her husband and of his devotion to his family and the Navy in \nwhich he was so proud to serve. Mrs. Dolan then handed me a copy of a \nletter of tribute to her husband which she had written. While this \nletter was written to specifically honor Mrs. Dolan's husband, it could \neasily apply to many of those who paid the ultimate price on that \nterrible morning.\n  Captain Bob Dolan, a 1981 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was \nfirst and foremost, a loving husband and devoted father to his two \nchildren. He was also a model Naval officer, having spent nearly half \nof his 20 year career on sea duty. Captain Dolan served on a variety of \nsurface ships, ranging from the amphibious helicopter carrier, U.S.S. \nInchon, LPH-12, to the state-of-the art Aegis cruiser, U.S.S. Thomas S. \nGates, CG-51, and culminating in his superb command of the destroyer, \nU.S.S. John Hancock, DD-981, with its very appropriate motto, ``First \nfor Freedom''. His shore tours included time on the staff of the \nChairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff and his exceptional service was \nrecognized with multiple awards, including the Defense Meritorious \nService Medal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of tribute which Mrs. Dolan \nwrote to the friends and family of her late husband be printed in the \nRecord. I hope it will serve as a reminder to us all of the terrible \nlosses inflicted on this Nation by an unseen and cowardly enemy.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       My husband, Captain Robert E. Dolan, and the people who \n     perished along with him at the Pentagon, died as he lived: a \n     hero.\n       He saw himself as an American with a simple life.\n       He was a man who saw his duty clearly, and did it \n     unselfishly.\n       He was a man who knew honor as a badge, and wore it \n     proudly.\n       He was a man who viewed service as a privilege, and \n     performed it to the best of his ability.\n       To him, that was a simple life. But Captain Robert E. Dolan \n     was anything but simple. He was a leader of men. He \n     influenced thousands of members of the military family as \n     Commander of the USS John Hancock, which has a motto of \n     ``First for Freedom.'' He influenced many more as a fellow \n     citizen, because Bob Dolan was every American. A quiet \n     patriot. A good neighbor. A friend and fellow citizen. You \n     see him every week coaching at Little League games and \n     chaperoning at school dances. You sit next to him in churches \n     and synagogues. You stand in line with him to vote.\n       And he was so much more than just a military leader to \n     those who knew him best. He was:\n       A loving father to his daughter, Rebecca, and son, Beau,\n       A faithful and devoted husband,\n       A dutiful and respectful son,\n       A wonderful brother,\n       A good and true friend.\n       Bob Dolan was the best and the brightest this country had \n     to offer to the altar of freedom. That very freedom is an \n     ideal that the rest of the world can only wonder at, and \n     strive to comprehend the magnitude and glory of.\n       The Americans--both civilian and military--killed and \n     wounded in the past few days under this unwarranted attack, \n     join the ranks of patriots fallen in other conflicts. They \n     are Americans all, and our duty is to remember them as \n     heroes. Let us record that as their tribute. Let history \n     record that as their legacy.\n       Abraham Lincoln once said: ``there is a divinity that \n     shapes our ends.'' That divinity has now shaped Bob's \n     destiny. Like Lincoln, ``he belongs to the ages.''\n       We pray that his rest is peaceful. Although ours cannot be, \n     we rest easy in the memories of an American hero, and many \n     more like him, so very much touched by the hand of God.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lisa Dolan\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10379-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10379-S10380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESS EMERGENCY RELIEF AND RECOVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am proud to have joined last week \nwith the Chairman and Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee, as well as a bipartisan group \nof my colleagues to cosponsor S. 1499, the American Small Business \nEmergency Relief and Recovery Act of 2001.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that small businesses have always \nsolidified the economic foundation of our country. While the Fortune \n500 companies make the news, small businesses create most of the jobs \nand are responsible for much of the economy's growth. When terrorists \nattacked our country on September 11, there were many unforeseen and \nunfortunate side-effects. Our economy, which was going through a tough \nperiod anyway, suffered a significant blow that day and in the days \nthat followed, and we can only hope that the recovery is rapid and \nsteady. Unfortunately, the adverse effects of the September 11 attacks \non many our Nation's 25 million small businesses may turn out to be \neven more profound than those sustained by the economy as a whole.\n  The bipartisan proposal that my colleagues and I have introduced will \nprovide a measure of the critical financial relief necessary to help \nsmall businesses recover from the financial losses and other damages \nincurred in the days and weeks following the attacks.\n  Specifically, this emergency legislation will ensure greater \nstability in the industry by strengthening and expanding access to the \nSmall Business Administration's loans and management counseling. By \naiding small businesses in their efforts to meet payments on existing \ndebts, to finance their businesses, and to maintain and create new \njobs, this legislation helps entrepreneurs and their employees to \nremain productive and self-sufficient. This bill attempts to save \nvaluable jobs and resources placed in jeopardy by addressing the \ndecreasing availability of credit and venture capital afforded small \nbusinesses by traditional lenders and investors. In an effort to \nencourage new investment, this measure includes changes to two of SBA's \nmain non-disaster lending programs put in place to facilitate borrowing \nand lending.\n  By providing incentives for loans and investment, this bill protects \nthose small businesses directly affected because they are physically \nlocated in or near the buildings and areas attacked. Our hearts go out \nto the businesses and workers in this category, because on top of \nsevere financial hardships, many in this category may have also \nsuffered the loss of loved ones and co-workers.\n  The bill also targets small businesses directly or indirectly \naffected because they are suppliers, service providers, or \ncomplementary industries to any affected industry. This is the type of \nassistance that might help small businesses like the Galley Restaurant \nin the Benedum Airport in Bridgeport, WV. When the FAA shut down \ncommercial aviation for several days in the wake of the attacks, \nbusiness at the Galley just stopped. Likewise, the bill could help the \nMountain State Travel Agency in Clarksburg, WV. In the days after the \nattacks, Mountain State has seen its business dry up to virtually \nnothing. It is my hope and belief that this legislation may help the \nGalley's owner, Beverly Bland, and Mountain State's owner, Maria Elena \nOliverio, and the owners of thousands of small businesses in West \nVirginia and throughout the country, from having to close the doors of \ntheir small businesses.\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\n  Finally, the bill will provide assistance to small businesses in need \nof capital and investment financing, procurement assistance or \nmanagement counseling. The incentives include physical and economic \ninjury disaster loans, reductions in interest rates, and easier \napproval standards on Guaranteed Business Loans.\n  Small businesses across our Nation are in great need of economic \nassistance. The vitality of this sector is of crucial importance to our \neconomy. This bill will allow thousands of working families the \nopportunity to maintain a reasonable standard of living, and give small \nbusiness owners the boost they need to maintain and hopefully grow \ntheir businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10380-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESSING GRATITUDE TO THE MEXICAN SENATE FOR ITS SUPPORT IN THE FIGHT \n                           AGAINST TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, last week representatives of the Mexican \nSenate came to the U.S. Senate to meet with legislators and express \ntheir support for the U.S.-led effort against terrorism. Mexico has \nalways been a close neighbor and friend to the United States, and the \nSenators traveled here to ensure us that, in this time of need, our \nfriend and ally Mexico stands by us.\n  The delegation of Mexican Senators presented the Majority Leader, Mr. \nDaschle, with a letter from Diego Fernandez De Cevallos, the President \nof the Mexican Senate, which expresses the Mexican Senate's condolences \nin the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11th. That letter \nalso contained a statement from the entire membership of the Mexican \nSenate commenting on the attacks and the unique relationship between \nMexico and the United States. I think that my colleagues would benefit \nfrom seeing these comments in the Record.\n  At times like these every expression of support from our allies is \nimportant. However, given the special relationship between the United \nStates and Mexico, it is even more important to see evidence that out \nallegiance is strong. These letters prove exactly that. I thank the \nMexican Senate for their support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and statement from the \nMexican Senators be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  Mexico D.F.,\n\n                                                  October 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On the occasion of the visit of a \n     delegation of Mexican Senators to the United States, and in \n     the name of the Senate of the Republic of Mexico, allow me to \n     express to the people and to the Government of the United \n     States, our profound shock and most sincere condolences with \n     respect to the acts of terrorism perpetrated on September 11, \n     2001 against humanity itself.\n       It is truly hard to find words adequate to convey the \n     sadness and anguish that all Mexicans feel at the loss of so \n     many innocent lives.\n       As legislators there are many things we can do together \n     with the U.S. and other Congresses to confront the barbaric \n     threat of terrorism of any kind, as well as the harm that is \n     caused by various forms of fanaticism.\n       We declare ourselves once again unequivocally in favor of \n     peace, justice, and international solidarity.\n       I have asked the delegation of Mexican Senators who are \n     visiting your Congress this week to provide you with a copy \n     of the statement which was made by the Mexican Senate on \n     September 11 in response to that tragic act, which we also \n     provided to his Excellency Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow so that \n     it might be known to the American people and the Government \n     of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Diego Fernandez de Cevallos,\n     President of the Mexican Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Statement of the Mexican Senate\n\n                                               September 11, 2001.\n       ``The Mexican Senate wishes to express to the Government of \n     the United States of America as well as to all Nations, its \n     most profound sympathy and deep indignation relative to the \n     barbarous acts which today have offended the entire world.\n       ``The Mexican Senate calls upon all men and women of good \n     faith to prevent this tragedy from escalating into an \n     interminable blood bath.\n       ``Let us bring together the governments and peoples of the \n     world to work together to guard against further harm; to \n     scrupulously respect human rights throughout the world; and \n     to build together a peaceful, dignified, and just world for \n     all mankind.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10380-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10380-S10381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE U.S. ROLE IN OCEAN EXPLORATION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, as we contend with the threats of global \nterrorism and our national sorrow in the aftermath of September 11th, \nwe must focus on the accomplishments, ideals, and spirit that make \nAmerica great and look to the future with a renewed sense of resolve \nand hope. As we engaged in exploring the American continent in the 19th \ncentury, and the far reaches of space in the 20th century, we must \nwelcome, in this new century, the challenge of exploring our oceans, \nthe last uncharted frontier. Oceans make up 70 percent of the earth's \nsurface, yet we have characterized less than ten percent of the United \nStates' Exclusive Economic Zone. Within our EEZ, the United States has \njurisdiction over more submerged lands than terrestrial lands. Newly \ncharted research voyages and state-of-the-art underwater technology \ngive us the tools we need to make new discoveries to aid us in better \nunderstanding this underwater world.\n  My focus on ocean exploration is timely because the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration celebrated the culmination of two \nvoyages of discovery in Charleston, South Carolina, on October 1, 2001. \nThe ``Deep East Expedition'' and ``Islands in the Stream'' projects \nrepresent two important steps in revitalizing our exploration of the \noceans. Through these journeys, NOAA scientists and their partners are \nuncovering the ocean's secrets.\n  The ``Deep East Expedition'' sailed from Maine to Georgia to \ninvestigate the diversity of deep-sea coral beds and gas hydrate \ncommunities that may contain new energy resources. On a simultaneous \ntimetable, ``Islands in the Stream'' followed the Gulf Stream both from \nBelize to North Carolina. Scientists investigated ocean currents in the \nGulf of Mexico, dove in submersibles examining coral reef and hard-\nbottom communities, and conducted acoustic surveys to characterize the \nocean floor. NOAA partnered on these two projects with Woods Hole and \nHarbor Branch Oceanographic Institutes, the National Geographic \nSociety, numerous universities and other federal agencies, such as NASA \nand the U.S. Geological Survey.\n  This summer, NOAA's flagship research vessel, the Ronald H. Brown, \nreturned from an unparalleled journey of discovery in the undersea \nAstoria Canyon, beyond the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon. This \nvoyage was titled the ``Lewis and Clark Legacy Expedition'' and was \nintended to be an extension of that historic journey which ended at the \nmouth of the Columbia River almost two hundred years ago. The \nscientists discovered two new species of invertebrates and viewed deep-\nwater communities never before seen, at depths of over one half mile. \nUsing advanced sonar technology, scientists created three-dimensional \nviews of the canyon's sea floor texture and discovered an ancient \nshoreline from the last ice age, over 17,000 years ago. These \ndiscoveries will help answer questions about how glaciers, earthquakes, \nand plate movement affect the earth's geological history and its \nfuture.\n  Just as Thomas Jefferson commissioned Lewis and Clark in 1803 to \ngather scientific facts of the uncharted Western lands, so too must we \nbe visionary in commissioning our best scientists to map and discover \nunknown reaches of the oceans. We must duplicate Jefferson's ``Corps of \nDiscovery'' for our ocean depths. This undiscovered domain is believed \nto contain many times the biomass of all the rainforests and \nterrestrial life forms combined.\n  Today's pioneers in ocean exploration have already embarked upon this \njourney. Just as explorers of the past mapped the mountain ranges and \nthe riverways of our nation, these modern explorers have begun mapping \nthe ranges and riverways beneath the surface of the ocean. Two weeks \nago Congress heard many of these explorers, researchers and managers \nspeak about the important role of the oceans in global climate change, \nweather patterns and carbon cycling, as we celebrated the first annual \nCongressional Oceans Day. Presenters highlighted the successes of ocean \nexploration and the challenges that lie ahead.\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\n  Recent developments in sonar and submersible vehicles promise to \naccelerate discoveries in ocean depths. Multibeam sonar, emitting a \nwide swath, gives the exact contour of the ocean bottom, rather than \nextrapolating from a single beam directed below a vessel. Advanced \nsonar can detect temperature fluctuations to fractions of a degree. The \nupper few hundred feet of the oceans hold 1000 times more heat than the \natmosphere, but scientists do not yet know how this may affect changes \nin global climate. The private sector is improving the capabilities of \nremotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles. These \nvehicles, armed with the newest in sonar equipment, will gain better \nknowledge of bathymetry, resources and navigation.\n\n  Two years ago, President Clinton convened an internationally renowned \npanel of oceanographers and charged them to develop a United States \nstrategy for ocean exploration. In October of 2000, the Ocean \nExploration Panel presented its recommendations. The panel challenged \nthe federal government to embrace the discovery of the unknown, to \ndedicate a vessel for ocean exploration, and to establish an Ocean \nExploration Program.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provided \nleadership on this directive by establishing the Office of Ocean \nExploration. The Bush Administration proposed $14 million for NOAA to \naccomplish this significant endeavor for Fiscal Year 2002. The Senate \nAppropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State \nprovided for this amount, and it is my hope that it will be retained in \nconference.\n  The panel further recommended designating a lead federal agency for \nocean exploration. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nin the U.S. Department of Commerce has the authority, the mission, the \ntrack record, the desire, and the capabilities to provide a leadership \nrole. For these reasons, NOAA should be recognized as the federal \nleader for ocean exploration.\n  In the Senate of Hawaii, our cultural history is entwined in the \nhistory of the ocean. From fishermen to tourists, researchers to \nsnorkelers, we integrate the oceans into our daily lives. Marine life \nembodies those very elements which define Hawaii. The Hawaiian Islands \nHumpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary, the Northwest Hawaiian \nIslands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, and many other federal and state \nmarine protected areas illustrate the importance we as a community \nplace on our marine resources. The commitment to nurture, protect, and \neducate people about the ocean represents the essence of malama kai, \ncare for the sea, which is so important to the Hawaiian culture. Given \nthe importance of the sea to our sustenance and livelihoods, it is \nessential that we learn about and share the responsibility to protect \nour ocean and coastal resources.\n  The steep terrain of Hawaii's coastal underwater lands and its \nlocation in the Pacific Ocean make Hawaii a prime candidate from which \nto launch deep-sea exploration. The Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory \n(HURL), established by NOAA under the National Undersea Research \nProgram and the University of Hawaii, works through private, state and \nfederal grants to study the processes of the deep ocean. HURL's Ocean \nBottom Observatory has been studying the volcanic activity of the \nundersea volcano, Loihi, and its effects on the global carbon cycle and \ntsunamis. Studying this dramatic phenomenon is critical to \nunderstanding the creation of Pacific Islands and submerged land masses \nthat provide essential habitat for marine life.\n  I applaud the efforts of those who continue down the unmarked path \ntoward ocean exploration, constructing the framework for future \ndiscoveries. At this time of national resolve and sorrow, I call \nattention to the global challenges that we face to understand the inner \nspace of our earth--the oceans. A true ocean odyssey under the \nleadership of NOAA should be developed in cooperation with the Navy, \nNational Science Foundation, NASA, the USGS, universities and private \nnot-for-profit organizations. Our oceans are crucial to our existence \nand national security; we must understand them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10381-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10381-S10382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICA MUST OPPOSE HATE CRIME\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, one of the guiding principles upon \nwhich the United States of America was founded is that of religious \nfreedom. Indeed, it is guaranteed in the Constitution, and it is a \nright that we as Americans hold dear.\n  Our forefathers came to these shores from nations all over the world \nsearching for the ability to worship as they pleased, and even now, \nmen, women and children still come to the United States to do so. \nToday, virtually every branch of religion known to man is represented \nhere in the United States. That fact should not only be expected in a \nNation of immigrants, but our diversity of cultures and religions \nshould be celebrated.\n  However, in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, events \nhave occurred across this Nation that fly in the face of our \nConstitutional guarantees. Acts of hatred have been perpetrated against \nArab-Americans and Muslim-Americans as if they had carried out or even \ncondoned the killing of thousands of innocents.\n  I am disturbed by the stories I have heard in the last few weeks; a \nSikh gas station owner in Mesa, AZ, who was shot and killed in the \nweekend following the attack simply because he was wearing a turban; a \nPakistani Muslim grocer in Texas, as well as an Egyptian Christian in \nCalifornia, both killed in crimes of hate as a result of the attacks; \ntwo girls in Palos Hills, IL, beaten because they were Muslim; a mosque \nin Evansville, IN, damaged by a man who rammed his car through a wall. \nWe have had incidences of intolerance in my own home state of Ohio, I'm \nsad to say, where large ball bearings have been tossed through the \nwindows of Arab-American owned businesses in Hamilton, and an Islamic \nCenter in Cincinnati continues to receive harassing and threatening \nphone calls.\n  These stories, which have resonated across the country, do not \nconstitute the views of the majority of Americans. Indeed, most \nAmericans are peaceful and tolerant. The individuals perpetrating these \ncrimes may think these acts represent patriotism, but they are far from \nit. Instead, they are perpetuating a hatred similar to that which drove \n19 terrorists to take so many lives on that fateful Tuesday, and it \nmust stop.\n  There are 6.5 million Muslims living in the United States today. By \nSeptember 27, the FBI was investigating over 90 hate crimes committed \nagainst Muslims, individuals of Middle Eastern descent, or in some \ncases, individuals who appear Muslim or Middle Eastern. While these \ncases are under investigation, the Council on American-Islamic \nRelations has received reports of more than 625 attacks against Arab-\nAmericans. This type of bigotry cannot go on.\n  On September 11, the terrorists did not single out their victims \nbased on what they looked like or how they worshiped. They killed \nAmerican citizens and foreign nationals of dozens of other nations \nindiscriminately. They murdered men, women and children of different \nethnic backgrounds and religions, many of whom were themselves Muslims.\n  Some of our citizens have lost loved ones and friends, yet the vast \nmajority of us have lost only our innocence. Our Nation is hurting \nright now, and we will all grieve in our own fashion, but we must not \nredirect our anger and frustration against one another.\n  Even in the face of such hatred in our own Nation, the rays of hope \nand compassion still shine. The same Islamic Center in Cincinnati that \nhas been the target of hate has raised $6,000 for the American Red \nCross, and will hold a blood drive soon to help in rescue efforts. \nMuslims from the tri-state area, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, have also \nhelped in the relief efforts, calling on their community to donate \nblood, give money, and pray for the victims and their families.\n  As President George W. Bush stated in his September 20 speech to the \nNation, ``[Islam's] teachings are good and peaceful, and those who \ncommit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah.'' We must \nnot only remember these words in the weeks to come, but we need to \nassure men and women of all backgrounds that the American\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\npeople understand that the terrorists who attacked the United States do \nnot represent all Muslims, just like those who commit hate crimes \nagainst Americans of Muslim or Middle Eastern origin do not represent \nall Americans. The more that we understand one another, the greater the \nchance for peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10382-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE AS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to call attention to the \ndedicated men and women in our Federal workforce and the invaluable \ncontributions they make to our Nation.\n  The tragic events three weeks ago appropriately has focused our \nattention on new ways to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure. \nA number of activities have been identified including communication, \nemergency services, and transportation. All are essential to the \nrunning of our country. However, on September 11 we were all quickly \nreminded of another critical infrastructure--our Federal Government and \nits workforce. For every essential service these attacks disrupted, we \nexpected our government to respond quickly and effectively--and those \nin government did. Our Nation's recovery will be aided because of the \ntalents and professionalism of our Federal workforce.\n  Like us all, I was struck by the heroism of rescue workers in the \nmoments following the events of September 11. Law enforcement officers, \nfirefighters, and others raced into buildings to save lives. Teachers \ncalmed children in schools and kept them safe from the surrounding \nhorrors. Local officials executed response plans and coordinated \nresources. These are among the many examples we will long remember.\n  Representatives from the Federal Government worked side by side with \nthose brave and selfless local and State heroes. Various federal \nagencies responded to immediate social and community needs by providing \ntemporary food and shelter, emergency child care, and other support \nservices. At ground-zero, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, and other Federal agencies worked with State \nand local rescue workers. They set up emergency and coordinated \ndisaster responses, opened communications, and provided needed medical \nassistance. Federal transportation agencies worked with industry to put \nour air, rail, and road networks back into operation. Our Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers and intelligence specialists spent long hours in \nintense investigations to track down the terrorists and their networks. \nMore than 2,100 federal employees were deployed in disaster response \nteams alone, not counting the thousands of others who responded to this \nnational crisis as a part of their normal duties.\n  Despite the attacks, Americans were able to rely on their government. \nWe received our mail. The Federal Government ensured the stability of \nour financial markets and Americans were able to count on the \nreliability of their banks.\n  Our Federal workforce responded in other ways not as immediately \nobvious, but just as important to our country's needs. Federal \nemployees ensured the availability of a clean blood supply and \nmonitored the quality of our air and water. Aid was provided through \nthe timely processing of claims for survivors of victims and financial \nassistance for those not covered by unemployment insurance. Special \nloans were made available to small businesses and residents displaced \nby the disaster.\n  Despite the events of September 11, our Nation is functioning and \nrecovering. This is due in part to the efforts of our Federal workforce \nwhose response was immediate and thorough. The Federal workforce is \nthis nation's backbone. Our ability to be resolute in confronting a \nfaceless enemy is partially attributable to the strength of our \nbackbone. We can take comfort and pride in the resilience and fortitude \nof our government workers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10382-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 25, 2001 \nin Honolulu, HI. Two teens were charged with attempted murder after \nallegedly dousing the tents of gay campers, while people were inside, \nwith flammable liquid and setting one on fire in Polihale State Park. \nPolice believe the crime is a hate crime based on ``insinuations and \nremarks'' made by the suspects at the time.

Madam President, I rise today to honor a man who \nhas served not only the City of Chicago with tireless dedication but \nwho has served his county with selfless valor. Alderman James Balcer is \na hero by any definition, and the Bronze Star recently pinned to his \nchest is only a token symbol of a life marked by bravery and service.\n  The people of Chicago know Jim Balcer as Alderman Balcer, \nrepresenting the 11th ward on the City Council. They know him as a \nstrong advocate for the city's veterans and as an effective voice for \nhis community. Few know more about military history or are more \ndedicated to understanding the challenges facing those who have fought \nfor our country. During his four years on the city council, Alderman \nBalcer has worked tirelessly for his constituents and sung their \npraises without so much as a note from his own horn.\n  But long before he was Alderman Balcer, Jim was Pfc. Balcer in the \nU.S. Marine Corps. As an 18-year-old soldier more familiar with the \nstreets of his home area of Bridgeport than the jungles of southeast \nAsia, Balcer was a member of the 9th Marine Regiment during the Vietnam \nWar. In late February of 1969, Pfc. Balcer and his company were holding \ntheir position on a hilltop in the A Shau Valley in Laos. As a group of \nthe soldiers descended into the valley below on a reconnaissance \nmission, enemy fire erupted from the dense foliage, trapping the group \nin a hail of bullets and shrapnel.\n  With dozens of young Marines killed and wounded at the bottom of the \nhill, it was Pfc. Jim Balcer who volunteered to lead the mission to \nrescue them. Through that long Laotian night, in the pouring rain and \ndeep, treacherous mud, Balcer made trip after trip into the valley to \nreach his fallen comrades. Half-hour descents through the jungle were \nfollowed by nearly four hours of backbreaking climbs up steep and \nslippery embankments, under enemy fire and carrying makeshift \nstretchers made from ponchos.\n  Thanks to Pfc. Balcer and his fellow Marines, every member of the 9th \nRegiment who went into the valley that night in 1969 came out.

Madam President, I rise today to honor a man who \nhas served not only the City of Chicago with tireless dedication but \nwho has served his county with selfless valor. Alderman James Balcer is \na hero by any definition, and the Bronze Star recently pinned to his \nchest is only a token symbol of a life marked by bravery and service.\n  The people of Chicago know Jim Balcer as Alderman Balcer, \nrepresenting the 11th ward on the City Council. They know him as a \nstrong advocate for the city's veterans and as an effective voice for \nhis community. Few know more about military history or are more \ndedicated to understanding the challenges facing those who have fought \nfor our country. During his four years on the city council, Alderman \nBalcer has worked tirelessly for his constituents and sung their \npraises without so much as a note from his own horn.\n  But long before he was Alderman Balcer, Jim was Pfc. Balcer in the \nU.S. Marine Corps. As an 18-year-old soldier more familiar with the \nstreets of his home area of Bridgeport than the jungles of southeast \nAsia, Balcer was a member of the 9th Marine Regiment during the Vietnam \nWar. In late February of 1969, Pfc. Balcer and his company were holding \ntheir position on a hilltop in the A Shau Valley in Laos. As a group of \nthe soldiers descended into the valley below on a reconnaissance \nmission, enemy fire erupted from the dense foliage, trapping the group \nin a hail of bullets and shrapnel.\n  With dozens of young Marines killed and wounded at the bottom of the \nhill, it was Pfc. Jim Balcer who volunteered to lead the mission to \nrescue them. Through that long Laotian night, in the pouring rain and \ndeep, treacherous mud, Balcer made trip after trip into the valley to \nreach his fallen comrades. Half-hour descents through the jungle were \nfollowed by nearly four hours of backbreaking climbs up steep and \nslippery embankments, under enemy fire and carrying makeshift \nstretchers made from ponchos.\n  Thanks to Pfc. Balcer and his fellow Marines, every member of the 9th \nRegiment who went into the valley that night in 1969 came out. The \nBronze Star is given to soldiers who distinguish themselves ``by heroic \nor meritorious achievement or service . . . while engaged in an action \nagainst an enemy of the United States or while engaged in military \noperations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force.'' \nOrdinary language to describe extraordinary courage, but hardly enough \nto describe the actions of someone who to this day still tells his own \nstory without a hint of bravado.\n  The City of Chicago is fortunate to have someone so tenacious and \nselfless on its side. Alderman Jim Balcer is as dedicated to Chicago \nand its people now as he was to his fellow soldiers then. A man of \nintegrity and honor, he is to be commended on receiving the Bronze \nStar. Wear it proudly, Jim, for we are proud of you.\n\n[[Page S10383]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/09/senate-section/article/S10383-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO S.

Its millions of practitioners work to attain \n     inner peace, good health, and better skills to deal with \n     stress and conflict in life; and\n       Whereas, Over the past several years, authorities in the \n     People's Republic of China have taken strong and brutal \n     actions against practitioners of Falun Gong. Reports indicate \n     that tens of thousands of people have been tortured and sent \n     to labor camps, and property owned by those who follow this \n     discipline has been destroyed or confiscated. The aggressive \n     actions taken by the state reflect a systematic commitment to \n     eliminate Falun Gong and those who pursue it; and\n       Whereas, The persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong is \n     in apparent violation of the People's Republic of China's own \n     constitution and a flagrant violation of standards of human \n     rights recognized by the United Nations and most governments \n     of the world; and\n       Whereas, Citizens of Michigan who practice Falun Gong and \n     those who understand this discipline cannot fathom the \n     reaction of the Chinese authorities. Indeed, those who value \n     human rights seek an increase of efforts to urge the People's \n     Republic of China to halt this persecution; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     United States Secretary of State to increase efforts to urge \n     the People's Republic of China to recognize and protect the \n     human rights of its citizens and halt the persecution against \n     practitioners of Falun Gong; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Secretary of State, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, June 19, 2001.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-188. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to Latvia; to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 136\n\n       Whereas, Since its founding in the wake of World War II, \n     NATO has been an important force in bringing peace, \n     stability, and partnership to the member nations. In addition \n     to its role to work for the security of an area of the world \n     wracked by the horrors of wars, NATO has promoted the growth \n     of democracy and accountability that are vital to the well-\n     being not only of the individual countries, but also the \n     future of Europe and much of the world; and\n       Whereas, Since the restoration of its independence in 1991, \n     Latvia has been a leader among former Iron Curtain countries \n     in developing democratic institutions and fostering a free-\n     market economy. Latvia has already proven its commitment to \n     the ideals of NATO through its work in a host of world and \n     trade organizations; and\n       Whereas, Latvia has a long and distinguished record of \n     leadership among the Baltic nations. Hundreds of years ago, \n     it was a key member of the Hanseatic League, and Latvia has \n     remained a strategic trading partner with its European \n     neighbors throughout history. From the ruins of World War I, \n     it developed a vibrant economy with democratic principles; \n     and\n       Whereas, Latvia is strongly committed to NATO's defense \n     priorities. Further, it has set\n\n[[Page S10385]]\n\n     in place prudent monetary and social policies well in keeping \n     with those of other eastern European nations that have \n     recently become part of NATO. Opening the doors of welcome to \n     Latvia will expand the breadth of this vitally important \n     organization; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to work for the admission of Latvia into NATO; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, June 19, 2001.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-189.

and\n       Whereas, under President Bush's tax relief plan, the \n     largest percentage reductions will go to the lowest income \n     earners: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the United States Congress to support and work to pass the \n     tax relief plan introduced by President Bush; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-197 A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to rescinding the call for \n     constitutional convention; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the state of Utah, acting with \n     the best of intentions, has, at various times, previously \n     made applications to the Congress of the United States of \n     America for one or more constitutional conventions for \n     general purposes or for the limited purposes of considering \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States of \n     America on various subjects and for various purposes;\n       Whereas, former Justices of the United States Supreme Court \n     and other leading constitutional scholars are in general \n     agreement that a constitutional convention, notwithstanding \n     whatever limitations have been specified in the applications \n     of the several states for a convention, would have within the \n     scope of its authority the complete redrafting of the \n     Constitution of the United States of America, thereby \n     creating an imminent peril to the well-established rights of \n     the people and to the constitutional principles under which \n     we are presently governed;\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     has been amended many times in the history of the nation and \n     may yet be amended many more times, and has been interpreted \n     for 200 years and been found to be a sound document which \n     protects the rights and liberties of the people without the \n     need for a constitutional convention;\n       Whereas, there is no need for--rather, there is great \n     danger in--a new constitution, the adoption of which would \n     only create legal chaos in America and only begin the process \n     of another two centuries of litigation over its meaning and \n     interpretation; and\n       Whereas, such changes or amendments as may be needed in the \n     present Constitution may be proposed and enacted, pursuant to \n     the process provided therein and previously used throughout \n     the history of this nation, without resort to a \n     constitutional convention: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah, That any \n     and all existing applications to the Congress of the United \n     States of America for a constitutional convention or \n     conventions heretofore made by the Legislature of the state \n     of Utah under Article V of the Constitution of the United \n     States of America for any purpose, whether limited or \n     general, be hereby repealed, rescinded, and canceled and \n     rendered null and void to the same effect as if the \n     applications had never been made; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the legislatures of each and every state which have applied \n     to Congress for either a general or a limited constitutional \n     convention to repeal and rescind the applications; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to \n     presiding officers of both houses of the legislatures of each \n     of the other states of the Union, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-198. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to the regulation of poll closing; \n     to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, during election night in 2000, television networks \n     made declarations of victory for both candidates for \n     President of the United States before the polls had closed;\n       Whereas, in one erroneous declaration, the winner of the \n     eventually decisive state of Florida was announced hours \n     before polls in the western region of the nation were closed \n     and before all polls in western Florida has closed;\n       Whereas, when news services declare winners before the \n     nation's polls close, voters in states where polls are not \n     yet closed may conclude that their vote will not affect the \n     outcome and choose not to vote;\n       Whereas, releasing the vote count results for states whose \n     polls are closed before the closure of polling places in \n     other regions of the country can distort the results of an \n     election by suggesting that votes not yet cast will have no \n     bearing on the outcome;\n       Whereas, in close races like the most recent election of \n     President of the United States, declarations of victory \n     before polls close can affect the outcome of the vote;\n       Whereas, a uniform poll closing time would prevent the \n     publicizing of early election returns in one region of the \n     nation from impacting the vote in other regions;\n       Whereas, if a uniform poll closing time was established for \n     the Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones, \n     polling places in western regions of the country could open \n     earlier on the morning of election day to compensate for \n     their earlier closing time; and\n       Whereas, uniform poll closing times in these time zones \n     would significantly reduce the possibility that an election \n     could be tainted by premature declarations of victory: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urge \n     the United States Congress to institute uniform poll closing \n     times for states in the Eastern, Central, Mountain, and \n     Pacific time zones; be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Congress review the \n     factors that contributed to the problems in the 2000 General \n     Election vote for the Presidency of the United States; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be presented to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-199. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to Social Security; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, Social Security is a federal program that requires \n     almost unanimous participation by employed workers in the \n     state of Utah and throughout the United States;\n       Whereas, the retirement portion of the Social Security tax \n     is high, having risen from an initial rate of 1% of the first \n     $3,000 of a worker's income, up to a maximum of $30 per year, \n     to the present rate of 12.4% of the first $80,400 of employee \n     wages or self-employment income up to a maximum of $830.80 \n     per month or $9,969.60 per year;\n       Whereas, the maximum Social Security retirement tax, paid \n     by almost 11 million workers, has risen 5.51% in 2001 over \n     the year 2000, and is now 57% higher than in 1990;\n       Whereas, because neither the employee's direct tax \n     contribution to Social Security nor the employer's \n     contribution on the employee's behalf appears on the \n     employee's federal tax return, few employees understand the \n     amount of Social Security retirement tax they actually pay \n     each month;\n       Whereas, individuals can estimate their own Social Security \n     tax cost by estimating 1% of annual compensation paid each \n     month--for example, an annual income of $30,000 would yield \n     an estimated monthly Social Security retirement tax cost of \n     $300 per month;\n       Whereas, the Social Security retirement tax consumes nearly \n     every dollar that many workers of modest income might \n     otherwise be able to save and invest;\n       Whereas, because higher income workers are better able to \n     save and invest over and above the amounts paid in Social \n     Security taxes, escaping Social Security dependence, but \n     modest income workers cannot, the system creates \n     disproportionate dependence on the system by low and middle-\n     income workers;\n       Whereas, for many lower income American workers, the Social \n     Security retirement tax represents virtually all of the \n     monthly retirement savings they assemble;\n       Whereas, with the individual retirement benefit currently \n     ranging from a low of just a few dollars per month to a high \n     of approximately $1,400 per month, and the average monthly \n     retirement benefit currently at about $845 per month, Social \n     Security retirement benefits amount to a below poverty level \n     subsistence for many retirees;\n       Whereas, although Social Security was originally intended \n     to merely supplement other core retirement income sources, \n     the high tax rate prohibits many workers from ever adequately \n     saving and investing, and as a consequence, Social Security \n     has become the core retirement income source for many \n     Americans;\n       Whereas, national demographics have shifted significantly \n     since the system was created as a part of President \n     Roosevelt's New Deal policies;\n       Whereas, in 1945, 41.9 workers supported each retiree, and \n     today just 3.3 workers support each retiree;\n       Whereas, the ratio is expected to dwindle to 2 workers per \n     retiree within the next 30 years, making the current system \n     unsustainable;\n       Whereas, tax receipts currently exceed benefit payments, \n     yet, Social Security Trustees estimate that benefit payments \n     will exceed tax receipts, producing annual deficits, \n     beginning in approximately 15 years, or the year 2015;\n       Whereas, the Social Security Trustees estimate the \n     cumulative annual deficits for years 2015 through 2075 to \n     reach $21.6 trillion;\n       Whereas, it is unethical to perpetuate a system that \n     accrues benefits for a current generation of retirees at the \n     expense of younger workers who will likely never collect \n     benefits but will inherit the mounting debt;\n       Whereas, the current system is unfair to future retirees \n     because after a lifetime of\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\n     paying into the system, a worker retains no legal right nor \n     claim to any amount or benefit, but is subject to future \n     congresses who will set the benefit rates;\n       Whereas, the current system is unfair to those who die \n     prematurely because it is possible to pay for a lifetime into \n     the system yet draw only minimal benefit or even no benefit \n     prior to death and leave no residual value to any heir;\n       Whereas, the current system is unfair to widows and \n     widowers because they must forego either their own benefit or \n     their deceased spouse's benefit (``widow(er)'' benefit), and \n     may claim the widow(er) benefit only after attaining \n     qualification age themselves regardless of the age of the \n     deceased spouse;\n       Whereas, the current system is unfair to women who leave \n     employment to raise families because many women in Utah and \n     throughout the United States work and pay retirement taxes \n     into the system for many years but never complete the \n     required 10 years or 40 quarters, before leaving employment, \n     making them ineligible for retirement benefits;\n       Whereas, the system is unfair to some ethnic minorities, \n     including African-Americans, whose life expectancies are \n     shorter and will typically collect benefits for a shorter \n     time period;\n       Whereas, retirement security is best achieved by regularly \n     saving and investing one's own money over a lifetime of work, \n     and public policy regarding Social Security should support, \n     facilitate, and encourage saving rather than discourage or \n     deter it;\n       Whereas, the objective of Social Security privatization is \n     for individual workers to have legal ownership in a \n     retirement asset that can be used and ultimately passed on to \n     heirs;\n       Whereas, even with modest return assumptions, the private, \n     individually owned account can be expected to produce a \n     significantly enhanced retirement income;\n       Whereas, private, individually owned accounts accrue value \n     and future benefits to the workers regardless of future \n     congressional actions;\n       Whereas, private, individually owned account grow on behalf \n     of the worker whether or not the worker completes 40 quarters \n     of contributions;\n       Whereas, private, individually owned account can be passed \n     on by inheritance to spouses, children, or grandchildren, \n     affording an opportunity for long-term inter-generational \n     wealth accumulation;\n       Whereas, a national system of private, individual accounts \n     can be perpetuated without end and without concern for \n     projected dates of insolvency;\n       Whereas, private, individual accounts afford workers the \n     opportunity to select from among multiple investment options, \n     including government bonds or prudent, diversified investment \n     models like those used by large pension or endowment funds;\n       Whereas, workers around the world are embracing privatized \n     systems as a workable solution to an overburdened government \n     Social Security program;\n       Whereas, the successful pioneer Chilean model was commenced \n     20 years ago with at least seven other Latin American \n     countries following suit;\n       Whereas, Great Britain, Australia, and Singapore have also \n     adopted private options, similar reforms are underway in \n     Russia, Hungary, Poland, and Kazakhstan, and the People's \n     Republic of China have embraced a private option with workers \n     contributing one-half of their retirement funds into an \n     individual account system since 1996;\n       Whereas, some U.S. workers have enjoyed a private account \n     system as certain municipalities, including Galveston, Texas \n     were allowed to opt out of Social Security in favor of a \n     privatized system prior to 1981; and\n       Whereas, since many Americans are unable to save and invest \n     for retirement beyond the 12.4% payroll tax, a privatized \n     Social Security option may be the only hope for many lower \n     income or economically disadvantaged Americans to achieve \n     financial empowerment and retirement security; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urge \n     the United States Congress to enact legislation to allow \n     individual workers to choose to remain in the current system \n     or to select a private account option; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urge that the legislation \n     not disrupt the benefits paid to existing Social Security \n     recipients; be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislation create private accounts to \n     be owned and controlled by individual employees or workers, \n     allow the individual employee or worker discretion to \n     invest among multiple prudent and diversified investment \n     options, and create minimum guaranteed income, disability, \n     and death benefits in the private account; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President of the United States Senate, and the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url":

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \nmarriage penalty relief effective immediately in the 15-percent bracket \nand the standard deduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will build upon the historic Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 by accelerating the marriage penalty \ntax relief in that bill and make it effective beginning next year. I am \njoined in my effort by Senators Brownback, Miller, Smith of New \nHampshire, Hutchinson, Fitzgerald, and Allen.\n  Earlier this year we delivered to the American people long overdue \ntax relief. Unfortunately, we did not have the ability to give married \ncouples the relief from the marriage penalty as soon as we would have \nliked. My bill will complete this unfinished business by treating \nmarried couples fairly in the tax code beginning next year. \nParticularly now, as the President and Congress consider additional tax \nrelief to bolster the economy in these difficult times, this \nlegislation would be a smart option. At times like this, what better \nway to help our Nation than by strengthening the building blocks of \nsociety, our families, by adding to their budgets through marriage \npenalty relief.\n  Every year for the past four years I introduced a bill to eliminate \nthe marriage penalty tax as I simply could not understand why two \nsingle people should be thrown into a higher tax bracket and pay more \nin taxes simply because they got married. Not because of a promotion, \nnot because of a raise, but because they got married! This year, we \nfinally told all Americans that they do not have to choose between love \nand money, that they should not be penalized for exchanging wedding \nvows. I am proud to say that in this year's tax relief plan we \ncorrected this quirk in the tax code. We returned to the commonsense \nprinciples that made this country great, and away from the concept that \n``no good deed goes unpunished.''\n  The marriage penalty relief that was passed earlier this year will \noffer critical relief to our married couples, but unfortunately it will \nnot take place immediately. I want to improve this timing because when \nthe situation is as ridiculous as the marriage penalty, that is wrong. \nThere are more than 20 million married couples in America today that \npay a penalty just because they got married, a penalty that averages \naround $1,400. That is a lot of money! Especially when you are just \nstarting out, $1,400 to a young couple could be part of the down \npayment on the new house or the new car for the expenses associated \nwith having children. However, they choose to spend that money, or for \nwhatever expenses they need it for, we want them to be able to make \ntheir own choices with the money they earn.\n  And we want them to have the ability to do so now, not several years \nfrom now. What the bill does that I am introducing today is that it \ntakes the relief we finally offered in the tax plan and makes it \neffective immediately for the 15 percent bracket and the standard \ndeduction.\n  Today, if you take the standard deduction when you do your taxes as \nan individual, you do not get the same amount of deduction if you get \nmarried. That is, the standard deduction does not simply double for \ncouples. Whereas today the standard deduction for a single person is \n$4,550, and for a married couple is $7,600, our tax relief bill \ninsisted that married couples receive a standard deduction that is \nexactly double that of the single person, or $9,100. Under my bill \ntoday, this doubling of the standard deduction will occur immediately.\n  In addition, we addressed the fact that when most couples marry, the \nsecond income bumps them up to a higher tax bracket. Therefore, we \ndecided to widen every tax bracket so that a married couple will not \nhave to pay more in income taxes simply because they go into a higher \nbracket when they combined incomes.\n  In this way, a combined income will be taxed at the same rate as if \nit was a single person making two incomes. For example, if each \nindividual in a relationship is in the 15-percent income tax bracket \nbut they get married and their combined incomes now bump them into the \n30-percent bracket, our tax relief means that they will effectively \nremain in the 15 percent bracket.\n  This is critically important, especially to those who are at the \nlower income rates and for whom jumping from the 15 percent bracket to \nthe next one could make all the difference in their budget. Our earlier \nlegislation widens\n\n[[Page S10391]]\n\nthe 15-percent bracket by $9,000 for married couples. My bill today \nwill accelerate this relief by making this change now, thereby \neliminating the marriage penalty for those couples who are in the 15 \npercent bracket.\n  Earlier this year a bipartisan majority agreed that it is very \nimportant that we relieve the pressure on the more than 20 million \nAmerican couples who pay the marriage penalty tax. We all agreed then \nthat this is wrong, and must be changed. Today, we have the chance to \nput our money where our mouth is and offer help to struggling couples \nnow. I call upon my colleagues to join in this effort to provide this \nimmediate assistance to the working families of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 1515. A bill to provide for enhanced security with respect to \naircraft; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to introduce the \n``Safe Ground through Safe Skies Act of 2001.'' This legislation \nstrengthens security measures for those aircraft that are currently not \nrequired to comply with an FAA approved security program. The events of \nSeptember 11 have shown us a new reality, that our aircraft can be used \nas lethal weapons against innocent civilians on the ground.\n  I applaud the FAA, the Administration, and Congress for quickly \nmoving to address this threat as it applies to commercial aircraft. \nWith the new security measures put in place by S. 1447, I am certain we \nwill not again see a commercial common carrier be hijacked and turned \ninto a bomb. However, the proposals under consideration today do \nnothing to stop other aircraft, such as chartered planes, leased \nplanes, and cargo planes, from being hijacked and crashed into \nbuildings or landmarks.\n  I believe many of my colleagues would be surprised to learn that, for \npurposes of security, these aircraft are virtually unregulated. The \nprotection of these aircraft, some as big or bigger than those used in \nthe September 11 attack, is left to the private sector owners and \noperators, an approach we now reject for commercial common carriers.\n  As the Senate continues to work on legislation to enhance security \nmeasures for commercial common carriers, it is vital that we address \nthe gaping hole in our security as it relates to currently unregulated \naircraft. It would be criminally negligent to pass an Aviation Security \nAct that leaves thousands of aircraft still unprotected from those \nterrorists who would turn our own planes into weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The Safe Ground through Safe Skies Act is an attempt to address this \ndifficult problem. It is based on three goals:\n  First, the legislation seeks to maintain the FAA's flexibility to \ndesign different screening systems for all sorts of aircraft, used for \nall sorts of purposes and boarding and deplaning at airports with a \nwide variety of experience in security.\n  Second, the legislation recognizes the time consuming and difficult \ntask of putting together a security program for smaller aircraft, many \nof which operate out of very small airports without any security in \nplace currently.\n  And third, and perhaps most importantly, the legislation addresses \nthe immediate threat of a near term repeat terrorist attack.\n  To achieve these goals, this legislation requires the FAA \nAdministrator to issue a security screening program for all aircraft \noperations with an aircraft that weighs more than 12,500 pounds. That \nmeans every operator of an aircraft that takes-off in this country with \nmore than approximately 15 seats will be subject to new security \nmeasures. To address the varying types of aircraft and aircraft \noperations, the Administrator will have the authority to waive this new \nrequirement in cases reviewed and approved by the Administrator and \nCongress.\n  For those aircraft weighing less than 12,500 pounds, this legislation \nrequires the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress, within \n6 months of enactment, recommendations on how to improve security for \ngeneral aviation. Within one year of enactment, the Administrator must \nturn that report into an actual program.\n  Finally, effective immediately upon enactment, this legislation \nrequires aliens and persons identified by the Secretary of \nTransportation to undergo a background check before buying, leasing, or \nchartering any aircraft. This provision would expire as the \nAdministrator issues security rules for each class of aircraft.\n  Though this final step may seem extreme, it is a quick and simple way \nto immediately protect our entire aircraft fleet from capture and use \nas a weapon. The section is designed to mirror the requirements for \nbackground checks for aliens and others seeking flight school training \nalready agreed to in S. 1447. If we need to protect ourselves from \nterrorists seeking flight school training in the future, we have an \nequal, if not greater need to protect our aircraft from terrorists who \nmay have already received their flight training.\n  Current policy falls short of the level of protection that the \nAmerican people require and deserve. Any comprehensive airline safety \nlegislation must include all types of aircraft conducting operations in \nour sky. While not placing a heavy burden on the FAA or the general \naviation industry, the Safe Ground through Safe Skies Act protects our \nairline passengers and those of us on the ground by reducing the \nlikelihood of another attack from the skies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1515\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to remove civil liability barriers that discourage \nthe donation of fire equipment to volunteer fire companies; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Good \nSamaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2001. On September \n11, the Nation witnessed the tragic loss of hundreds of heroic \nfirefighters. Amazingly, every year quality firefighting equipment \nworth millions of dollars is wasted. In order to avoid civil liability \nlawsuits, heavy industry and wealthier fire departments destroy surplus \nequipment, including hoses, fire trucks, protective gear and breathing \napparatus, instead of donating it to volunteer fire departments. The \nbasic purpose of the bill is to induce donations of surplus \nfirefighting equipment by reducing the threat of civil liability for \norganizations, most commonly heavy industry, and individuals who wish \nto make these donations. The bill eliminates civil liability barriers \nto donations of surplus firefighting equipment by raising the liability \nstandard for donors from ``negligence'' to ``gross negligence.''\n  The legislation is modeled after legislation passed into law in Texas \nin 1997 which has resulted in an additional $6 million of equipment \ndonations from companies and other fire departments for volunteer \ndepartments which may not be as well equipped. Representative Castle \nhas introduced the Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act, \nH.R. 1919, which has 63 bipartisan cosponsors in the House of \nRepresentatives. It is also supported by the National Volunteer Fire \nCouncil, the Firemen's Association of the State of New York, and a \nformer director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, James \nLee Witt.\n  The Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2001 is \nmodeled after a bill passed by the Texas state legislature in 1997 and \nsigned into law by then-Governor George W. Bush. Now companies in Texas \ncan donate surplus equipment to the Texas Forest Service, which then \ncertifies the equipment and passes it on to volunteer fire departments \nthat are in need. The donated equipment must meet all original \nspecifications before it can be sent to volunteer departments. The \nTexas program has already received more then $6 million worth of \nequipment for volunteer fire departments. Arizona, Missouri, Indiana, \nand South Carolina have passed similar legislation at the State level. \nThe legislation saves taxpayer dollars by encouraging donations thereby \nreducing the taxpayers' burden of purchasing expensive equipment for \nvolunteer fire departments.\n  This bill does not cost taxpayer dollars nor does it create \nadditional bureaucracies to inspect equipment. The bill gets rid of \nunnecessary inspection bureaucracies, whether they are State run or a \nmanufacturer's technician. This is for three reasons. First, \nbureaucracies are not necessary for inspections because the fire chiefs \nmake the inspections themselves. Second, some of the State \nbureaucracies control who gets the equipment. These donations are \nprivate property transactions, not a good that is donated to the State, \nallowing the State to pick who will get the equipment. Third, there is \nno desire to create the temptation for waste, fraud, and abuse in a \nState bureaucracy in charge of picking the winners and losers.\n  The bill reflects the purpose of the Texas state law. Federally, \nprecedent for similar measures includes the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan \nFood Act, Public Law 104-210, named for the last Representative Bill \nEmerson, which encourages restaurants, hotels and businesses to donate \nmillions of dollars worth of food. The Volunteer Protection Act of \n1997, Public Law 105-101, also immunizes individuals who do volunteer \nwork for non-profit organizations or governmental entities from \nliability for ordinary negligence in the course of their volunteer \nwork. I have also previously introduced three Good Samaritan measures \nin the 106th Congress, S. 843, S. 844 and S. 845. These provisions were \nalso included in a broader charitable package in S. 997, the Charity \nEmpowerment Act, to provide additional incentives for corporate in-kind \ncharitable contributions for motor vehicle, aircraft, and facility use. \nThe same provision passed the House of Representatives as part of H.R. \n7, the Community Solutions Act, in July of 2001.\n  Volunteers comprise 74 percent of firefighters in the United States. \nOf the total estimated 1,082,500 volunteer and paid firefighters across \nthe country, 804,200 are volunteer. Of the total 31,114 fire \ndepartments in the country, 22,636 are all volunteer; 4,848 are mostly \nvolunteer; 1,602 are mostly career; and 2,028 are all career. In 1998, \n54 of the 91 firefighters who died in the line of duty were volunteers.\n  This legislation provides a commonsense incentive for additional \ncontributions to volunteer fire departments around the country and \nwould make it more attractive for corporations to give equipment to \nfire departments in the other States. At this time when all of America \nhas witnessed the heroic acts of selflessness and sacrifice of \nfirefighters in New York City and in the Washington, D.C. area, I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this incentive for the provision \nof additional safety equipment for volunteer firefighters who put their \nlives on the line every day throughout this great Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1517. A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nenhance the Montgomery GI bill, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing today to put into effect several \nrecommendations made by the United States Commission on National \nSecurity/21st century relative to Montgomery GI bill, MGIB, educational \nassistance benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nVA. The Commission, co-chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren \nRudman, was tasked with reexamining U.S. national security policies and \nprocesses, and making recommendations on how the United States could \nbest ensure the safety of its citizenry against emerging national \nsecurity threats. Sadly, one of the emerging threats anticipated by the \nCommission, the threat of state or group-sponsored terrorism, was \nrealized on September 11, 2001.\n  Our Armed Forces, the best in the world, have now engaged the enemy, \nand we rely on these dedicated men and women in service to sacrifice \ntheir lives, if necessary, to defend liberty and secure justice. The \nNation must reciprocate by assuring that the benefits provided to \nservice members during, and after, their service measure up to the \ngrave responsibilities entrusted to them. The Hart-Rudman Commission \nunderstood that, and, consistent with that understanding, the \nCommission recommended specific improvements in veterans' educational \nassistance benefits to assure that the armed forces are able to \nattract, and retain, highly qualified, dedicated service members.\n  The Commission made, in total, seven recommendations on how MGIB\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\nbenefits could be enhanced. It recommended that the MGIB monthly \nbenefit be increased and indexed to the average education costs at \nfour-year public colleges. It recommended, further, that the payment of \nbenefits be accelerated to the beginning of a student's school term. \nThe Commission recommended, in addition, that MGIB benefits be made \navailable to students taking technical training courses. Further, it \nrecommended the repeal of the requirement that service members make \ncontributions totaling $1200 in order to ``buy'' eligibility for MGIB \nbenefits. It recommended, in addition, that potential beneficiaries be \ngiven 20 years after discharge from the service, not just 10 years, as \nis currently specified by law, to make use of their MGIB benefits. It \nalso recommended that service members with 15 years of service or more \nbe entitled to transfer their entitlement to MGIB benefits to their \nspouse or dependent children. Finally, the Commission recommended that \nMGIB benefits made available to Reserves called to serve in overseas \ncontingency operations be increased on a sliding scale basis.\n  The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, a Committee on which I \nserve as ranking minority member, has considered, and moved favorably \non, the first three Commission recommendations listed above; \nlegislation which would, in whole or in part, accomplish these \nrecommendations will soon be before the Senate. The committee has not, \nhowever, acted on the final four recommendations of the Commission, \nmainly because those proposals were not before the committee. It is my \nhope that by introducing this legislation, I will assure that the \ncommittee continues its consideration of MGIB improvements in the \nmonths ahead.\n  To summarize the bill briefly, section 2 of my bill would eliminate \nthe $1,200 pay reduction currently required of service members during \ntheir first 12 months of active duty as a precondition to eligibility \nfor MGIB benefits. The Hart-Rudman Commission is not alone in \nrecommending the repeal of this requirement. In 1999, the Commission on \nService Members and Veterans Transition Assistance, a commission headed \nby the current Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Honorable Anthony J. \nPrincipi, made the same recommendation. It surely can be argued with \nconsiderable force that service members, who are asked to risk life and \nlimb in service to the Nation, should not be asked, in addition, to \ncontribute a portion of their pay, while in service, to ``earn'' \neligibility for veterans' educational assistance benefits.\n  Section 3 of this legislation would allow service members with at \nleast 15 years of active duty to transfer their entitlement to MGIB \nbenefits to their spouses or dependent children. This past January, I \nmet with some of our troops stationed in Bosnia who expressed \nconsiderable interest in this idea. Many of them mentioned that they \nhave families back home and that, rather than paying for their own \neducation, they needed funds to pay for their children's education. At \nthe very least, the idea needs to be further considered. I am aware \nthat Senator Cleland has been working on a concept which is similar, \nbut not identical to, this provision. I would like to work with Senator \nCleland on this important issue.\n  Section 4 of my bill would allow former service members 20 years \nafter discharge, rather than 10 years, as is specified in current law, \nto utilize their MGIB benefits. I understand that, historically, MGIB \nbenefits are intended to assist in the transition to civilian status, \nso that economic opportunities lost due to temporary military service \ncan be ameliorated upon transition back to civilian life. This concept \nmay have been useful when most departing service members were single \npersons with no family or financial obligations preventing the use of \neducation benefits very quickly after discharge. Many former service \nmembers, however, are married and have children and, with these \nobligations, often find it difficult to return to school immediately \nafter separation from service. In addition, today's rapidly-changing \neconomy demonstrates that the skills which employers demand today may \nchange tomorrow. Extending the MGIB ``delimiting date'' would encourage \n``lifetime learning'' and enable veterans to keep their skills current.\n  Finally, section 5 of my bill would enable members of the Selected \nReserve who are called to active duty as part of a ``contingency \noperation,'' such as the operations to which Reserves are now being \ncalled, to be eligible for increased MGIB benefits if they serve in \nsuch an operation for more than one year. Currently, those who enlist \nfor a six year reserve commitment are eligible for $251 per month in \neducation benefits, whether or not they are called to active duty. It \nwould seem to me that Reserves who are activated, especially during \ntimes of conflict or war, bear close resemblance to individuals who are \nserving an active duty enlistment, and so too should the educational \nbenefits made available to such persons. Therefore, my legislation \nwould provide that, in cases where a member of the Selected Reserves \nserves one year in a contingency operation, his or her education \nbenefit would be adjusted to the half-way point between the benefit \nafforded to a Reserve Member under current law, now, $251 per month, \nand that provided to service members who have served two years active \nduty, currently, $528 per month. In cases involving members of the \nSelected Reserves who serve two years of active service in a \ncontingency operation, the amount of educational assistance afforded to \nthem would be the same as that which is provided to veterans who had \nserved two years of active duty, currently, $528 per month. And for \nthose who have served three years active duty in a contingency \noperation, their benefit amount would be the same, currently, $650 per \nmonth, as that afforded to service members who have served a three year \nenlistment. In this national emergency, it is time to recognize the \nsacrifices made by reservists called to active duty by increasing their \nbenefits commensurate with time served on active duty.\n  One of the Hart-Rudman Commission's recommendations, that an Office \nof Homeland Security be created to coordinate the Federal government's \ncounterterrorism efforts, has already been embraced the President. \nGovernor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who was just sworn in yesterday, \nwill, I am sure, serve with great distinction as head of that office. \nWe need to address more of the Commission's recommendations, including \nthose that would enhance national security by making the military a \nmore competitive employer so it can attract and retain quality people. \nBeyond that, we need to let our fighting men and women know that we \nvalue their service by providing them with the tools to succeed upon \ncompletion of their military careers. This legislation would accomplish \nthose purposes. I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1518. A bill to improve procedures with respect to the admission \nto, and departure from, the United States of aliens; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, among the many things that makes our \ncountry great is the freedom we possess to move about the country and \nexit and return to our country as we desire. Being a great Nation that \nbelieves strongly in that freedom and that has paid a tremendous price \nin defending that freedom, we like it to be on display to the rest of \nthe world and we continually and generously open our doors to others. \nWe as a Nation benefit from foreign visitors coming to the United \nStates and other countries benefit when their citizens visit this \ncountry, whether it be to study at our schools and universities, learn \nat our institutions, use our medical facilities, do business with our \ndynamic private sector or visit our great cities and parks.\n  However, on September 11, this great Nation endured a terrible \ntragedy, perpetrated by individuals who entered this country legally, \nas guests, on a visa. Nineteen people who were in this country on \ntravel, work and student visas carried out the most deadly attack ever \non our soil. Three of those people had stayed beyond the expiration of \ntheir visa. As the investigation of the Attorney General proceeds, many \nothers have been detained. Initial reports indicated that a large \nnumber of these people were in this country on expired visas and I \nsuspect we will find that a large number of those involved in the \nplanning of the attack\n\n[[Page S10394]]\n\nwere in the United States on expired visas.\n  At this time, the only system in place to track the entry and exit of \nvisa holders is antiquated and completely inadequate. The government \nhas little ability to track those who have entered the United States \nand to be notified if they violate the terms of their visa. As there \nare approximately 300 million immigrants and visitors that enter this \ncountry every year, getting a handle on this problem will not be \nsimple. However, we must know if those who enter the United States to \nstudy arrive and attend school, if those who come her to work are at \ntheir jobs, if those who come here to do business do their business and \nreturn home and if those who we admit into the United States to \nvacation return home at the end of their time in the United States. We \nshould strive to keep our borders open, to keep commerce flowing freely \nand not let the terrorist attack disrupt our relations with our good \nneighbors and other friends. But at the same time, we must have a \nbetter idea of who is entering this country, catch and screen out those \nwho may pose a threat and know who has violated the terms of their visa \nand remained in the United States beyond the expiration date.\n  I would like to acknowledge and thank my colleagues Kent Conrad and \nOlympia Snowe for their assistance and valuable input on this \nlegislation.\n  Specifically, this bill calls for the improvement of the information \nreceived by the Department of State for checking the backgrounds of \nvisa applicants. It calls on law enforcement and intelligence agencies \nto share regularly information that will be useful to the State \nDepartment in identifying those who pose any type of threat to the \nsecurity or people of this country.\n  This bill calls for the improvement and implementation of the system \nto track foreign students. Including a requirement that universities \nnotify the INS when foreign students do not show up for school, as Hani \nHanjour failed to do before participating in the attack on the World \nTrade Center.\n  It is time to begin the roll of the Integrated Entry and Exit \nTracking system called for in legislation passed five years ago to \nrecord the entry of visa holders, record their exit and notify the INS \nand law enforcement agencies of the identity of anyone overstaying \ntheir visa. This system should also utilize the latest technology, \nincluding biometrics, to ensure that visas cannot be tampered with or \nstolen. Finally, it is time for the members of the task force to be \nappointed, including the Director of Homeland Security, so that the \nissues surrounding this system can be settled.\n  The bill also calls for the tightening of the Visa Waiver Pilot \nprogram to ensure that passports for participating countries are not \nstolen or defaced by those trying to sneak into the country. It also \ncalls for those employing work visa holders to report to the INS if \nthat person leaves or is terminated from their job.\n  These are all reasonable proposals that will not impact commerce, \ntravel and relationships with friendly countries. It will also begin \nthe process of having an accurate picture of who has entered the \ncountry and who has departed. It is one of many steps that needs to be \ntaken to avoid further terrorist attacks. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to implement this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1518\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ENTRY-EXIT TRACKING SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Development of the System.--In the development of the \n     entry-exit tracking system, as described in the preceeding \n     section, the Attorney General shall particularly focus--\n       (1) on the utilization of biometric technology, including, \n     but not limited to, electronic fingerprinting, face \n     recognition, and retinal scan technology; and\n       (2) on developing a tamper-proof identification, readable \n     at ports of entry as a part of any nonimmigrant visa issued \n     by the Secretary of State.\n       (b) Integration With Law Enforcement Databases.--The entry \n     and exit data system described in this section shall be able \n     to be integrated with law enforcement databases for use by \n     State and Federal law enforcement to identify and detain \n     individuals in the United States after the expiration of \n     their visa.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to provide farm credit assistance for activated reservists; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am proud to be joined by Senators \nLugar, Kerry, Crapo, McConnell, Helms, Dayton, Leahy, Hutchinson, \nMiller, Lincoln, Baucus, Roberts, Conrad, and Nelson today as we \nintroduce legislation in support of those men and women who voluntarily \nleave their communities, leave their jobs, and leave their families to \nserve our country. In the past few weeks, thousands of men and women \nhave been called to duty as reservists and members of the National \nGuard. Many of these people have volunteered to leave their farms to \nrespond to the call. Some of these people borrow money from the USDA to \nsustain their farms. Because these reservists and members of the \nNational Guard have been called up, they may find it difficult to \ncontinue to meet the terms of these loans. The bill offered today would \nalleviate some of the financial stress caused by the activation.\n  The bill directs the USDA to use its lending authority to minimize \nthe financial impact of a reservist being activated. The Secretary of \nAgriculture is directed to take actions to help keep the farm of an \nactivated reservist in operation, including deferring scheduled \npayments, reducing interest rates, reamortizing or consolidating loans, \nor taking other restructuring actions. The bill also provides the USDA \nnew authority to provide emergency loan assistance to farms financially \ninjured because of the activation of a reservist.\n  I thank Senator Kerry for this idea. He introduced legislation in \n1999, of which I was a cosponsor, that provided similar relief to \nborrowers from the Small Business Administration who are called up. \nJust as small businesses can be greatly affected by the absence of one \nperson, farms many times rely entirely on the labor and ingenuity of \njust one or two key people.\n  At this time, when these men and women are sacrificing so much, the \nleast we can do is alleviate the financial strain at home caused by \ntheir willingness to serve. By enacting this modest measure, we can \nhelp lift worries about the farm at home from the minds of the \nindividuals and families directly affected by activation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1519\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the FREEDOM Support Act to authorize the \nPresident to waive the restriction of assistance for Azerbaijan if the \nPresident determines that it is in the national security interest of \nthe United States to do so; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, in the coming weeks, we are going to \nbe debating several very contentious bills. However, more than at any \nother point in my career we are considering these issues in an \nextremely congenial, collegial, thoughtful and deliberative way. \nCertainly, many of us disagree about the details of one issue or \nanother, however, we have consistently put the interest of the nation \nahead of the our own interests as political actors.\n  This is very encouraging to me. This should be very encouraging to \nthe American people. This should be very encouraging to freedom loving \npeople of the world. The tenor of the debates on this floor should \nsignify to everyone that the United States Government is operating not \nsimply as well as it did before September 11th, but better that it did \non September 11th. In the face of this attack, the American Government \nis operating just as it was always intended to operate.\n  Today, Madam President I rise to offer a bill that will ensure that \nour government continues to operate just as intended.\n  The administration is going about the business of fighting a war. \nThat process relies greatly on our government's ability to strengthen \nties with countries that agree to help us wage this war on terrorism. \nThese countries, in many cases, will be taking on factions within their \nown borders in order to do what is right. For these efforts to prevail, \nwe must use all our assets. One of the most important and appealing \nbeing trade and foreign assistance--particularly with regard to the \nnations of Central and South Asia.\n  In this spirit, I am introducing a bill which will grant the \nPresident the authority to waive the restriction on assistance to the \ncountry of Azerbaijan, if the President determines that our national \nsecurity and interests will benefit from greater assistance and trade \nwith this country--he should have the right to pursue that policy.\n  Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act places sanctions on Azerbaijan \nthat prevent any support from the United States government for the \nyoung nation. This language ties the administration's hands as they \nattempt to work with this strategically important ally in the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  Unlike past efforts to repeal or waive section 907 sanctions on \nAzebaijan, today our debate is about more than regional stability in \nCentral Asia--our debate now centers on United States national security \ninterests.\n  Section 907 stands in the way of training and assistance for \nAzerbaijani military hospitals that may have to deal with casualties in \nthis campaign.\n  Section 907 stands in the way of airport and air traffic control \nupgrades that may need to happen to assist our airforce.\n  There are over 71 million people in the Central Asian region which \nincludes Azerbaijan. Many of these emerging democracies are battling \nfundamentalist factions. If we do not assist those who want to move \nwestward, we empower the factions coming in from countries which \nsupport terrorist activities.\n  With the horrific attack on our country, we have been painfully \nawakened to the global and complex network that terrorists have created \nand aimed at our country and its interests. Our foreign policy must \nhelp fight against the creation of new terrorist breeding grounds as we \nfight the existing terrorist plague.\n  Azerbaijan itself is a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism in the \nregion. Since its independence, Azebaijan has endured Iranian pressure \nto adopt its style of government. Iran secretly funds hundreds of \nreligious schools and colleges in Azerbaijan. Iranian diplomats and \nsecret service representatives have been expelled from Azerbaijan on \ngrounds that they are fomenting disturbances.\n  Iran criticizes Azerbaijan for its pro-U.S. stance and is concerned \nabout the Azeris increasing ties to the West--particularly with U.S. \ncompanies. Iran seeks to ensure that Azerbaijan fails with its free \nmarket and democratic reforms, because secular independence and \ndemocratic Azerbaijan is perceived as a threat for the fundamentalist \nregime in Iran.\n  Right now, we need the help and cooperation of the entire Central \nAsian region--we can not afford to tie the President's hands over a \nconflict between two countries. This is particularly important now \nsince these restrictions are used as anti-American fodder by \nfundamentalist factions hoping to shape the development of the region.\n  To reiterate, this provides national waiver authority to the \nPresident to lift sanctions on Azerbaijan. Briefly, the United States \nhas had for a series of years, now, sanctions against Azerbaijan. For \npeople not familiar, Azerbaijan sits in the Caspian Sea region right \nabove Iran.\n  It is part of the former Soviet Union. It is an oil- and gas-rich \narea. It is a small country. But it is a small Islamic country that is \nstrongly supportive of the United States.\n  Their President, President Aliyev, has issued statements about the \nstrong support for the United States in the face of our attack on \nterrorism and dealing with terrorism. They have provided the United \nStates fly-over rights, landing rights, refueling rights, and \nintelligence information as well. This is in that key strategic part of \nthe world, the south Caucasus, just leading into central Asia. It has \nthe gateway city, Baku, going into Asia. Baku is an old, really \nEuropean-style city--a gorgeous place. But more important, they are \nsupportive of the United States, and yet as they support us, we are \nsanctioning them.\n  We are likely to use military bases in Azerbaijan as a staging area \nor as a refueling area or, potentially if we have casualties in the \nregion, as a hospital area as well. Yet we are sanctioning them.\n  If we continue with these sanctions, the Azeris are not going to be \nable to effectively help us and use their territories. Because of the \nsanctions we have against Azerbaijan, we cannot train their personnel \nto help us in guarding the perimeter of military bases where our \naircraft may be. Because of the sanctions we have against Azerbaijan, \nwe cannot train their hospital personnel to be able to help treat any \npotential difficulties that we may have in that region. Because of the \nsanctions we have against Azerbaijan, we cannot train their personnel \nin counterintelligence to help us in the gathering of information as to \nwhat is\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\ntaking place, what is moving in the region, so we can be more effective \nin our fight against terrorism. This is against a country that has been \nstrongly supportive of the United States.\n  There has been a long, ongoing battle between the Azeris and the \nArmenians in this region of the world, and this has gone on for a long \nperiod of time. The sanctions are somewhat associated with that. But \nthe point being, we have a fight now against terrorism. The President \nneeds to have national security waiver authority so, in those specific \nareas that would be beneficial to us, he can lift those sanctions \nagainst Azerbaijan. This will be a tough issue, but that authority is \nsomething we should provide the President if we are going to prosecute \nthis effort successfully. I think it is very important that we put this \nforward, that we pass it.\n  This is not taking the sanctions off completely. It is providing the \nPresident with waiver authority, national security waiver authority. \nThere has to be a national security interest. If it is not needed, if \nthe reason to have it is not there, the President doesn't have the \nauthority to exercise it. So we should provide him that authority.\n  I am introducing this bill tonight.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 169 submitted earlier \ntoday by the two leaders, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 169) relative to the death of the \n     Honorable Mike Mansfield, formerly a Senator from the State \n     of Montana.\n\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, it is a great honor for me to join Senator \nDaschle in sponsoring a resolution memorializing our friend and the \ngreat Senator from Montana, our former majority leader in the Senate \nand Ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield.\n  I didn't get to know Senator Mansfield as well as many Senators who \nactually served with him. I was in the House during many of the years \nhe was serving as the majority leader through 1976. I remember watching \nand liking the fact he would go on some of the talk shows and be \ninterviewed. They would ask this convoluted, complicated, long \nquestion; he would answer with a one-syllable word. I loved that. Quite \noften that is all that is necessary: Yes; no. It makes it very \ndifficult to drag out a long program.\n  As I watched him closer over the years, there was something about his \ndemeanor that was very attractive. When I became majority leader, I \nread books on previous majority leaders. There had only been 15 before \nI had the opportunity to be majority leader. There were some in \nparticular, and I went over the style of their leadership: Lyndon \nJohnson, Mike Mansfield, Howard Baker, and all of our majority leaders.\n  I particularly was attracted to Senator Mansfield's style. It was one \nof letting the Senate work its will. It was not threatening. By the \nway, the style was so different from Lyndon Johnson's. Lyndon Johnson \nwas very effective but worked Senators late hours and weekends. Behind \nLyndon Johnson came Mike Mansfield who took a completely different \ntack. Yet he got as much done. If you look at the substance of what was \nproduced during the leadership period of Lyndon Johnson compared to the \ncritical period that Mike Mansfield served, he got as much done.\n  While some will disagree that I did this, I decided in my own mind I \nwould try to adopt more of the style of Mike Mansfield, and not \nnecessarily keep the staff here when it was not necessary, and see if I \ncouldn't get more done by not being in session late at night or \nthreatening weekends. I think it had an effect. I found quite often if \nyou don't try to punish Senators, you get more done than you do if you \npress them to the wall. He was a great leader from Montana. He served \nlonger than any other majority leader in history. Of the now 17 \nmajority leaders, only he served 15 years in that position.\n  He also had the exact personality that we needed to have for \nAmbassador to Japan. In a way, he was maybe even Japanese in his \ndemeanor: Soft spoken, courteous, honorable, man of high integrity, man \nof few words. When he spoke, it was worth listening.\n  So we have lost a great leader in the Senate, a friend. He came back \nand spoke to our Leader's Lecture Series. I was totally enthralled with \nwhat he had to say. He gave us the speech he was going to give on the \nFriday that John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He had not given that \nspeech. It was a speech defending his style of leadership. It was quite \ninteresting to get the juxtaposition of what we go through today and \nwhat he was going through, the historical nature of that speech. In \nfact, he delivered it to the Senate some 35 years later.\n  So we will miss Mike Mansfield. He stayed active until the very end. \nBut somehow I felt when Mrs. Mansfield passed away not too long ago \nthat he wouldn't be long because they were inseparable. He loved her so \ndearly. And, once again, I think they exhibited the type of couple we \nwant in government but also in life.\n  As a Republican, but more importantly as a Senator of America, I came \nto admire Mike Mansfield. We owe him a great debt of gratitude. He has \nbeen a legend. He has made this institution a better place for his \nservice. We shall miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I add my statement of support to what \nSenator Lott has said about Mike Mansfield. I had the opportunity to \nmeet him at the Senate prayer breakfast. He was a regular attendee, a \ngentleman from appearance, demeanor, and actions, deep spiritually as \nan individual. He spoke often by not speaking, just by the way he was. \nHe spoke volumes, really, of the beauty of a person who leads a good \nlife. He led a life that was really lived and a model for many of us to \nfollow. He will be dearly missed.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor of this resolution, and I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the resolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, that the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 76) honoring law \n     enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency personnel and \n     health care professionals who have worked tirelessly to \n     search for and rescue the victims of the horrific attacks on \n     the United States on September 11, 2001.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today in support of this \nresolution honoring the efforts and sacrifices of law enforcement \nofficers, firefighters, emergency rescue personnel, and health care \nprofessionals in responding to the horrific attacks on the United \nStates on September 11, 2001.\n  In New York and Washington, D.C., emergency calls went out on the \nmorning of September 11 just after those attacks occurred. Those alarms \nwere heard by first-responders throughout the country. Law enforcement, \nfirefighters, emergency rescue personnel, and health care professionals \nanswered the call with the same selfless courage and determination that \nhas long distinguished our emergency response community. While the \nworld looked on in\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\nstunned disbelief, these workers, always prepared and ever vigilant, \ninstinctively donned their uniforms and raced to the scene.\n  At ground zero, as many as 400 of these brave men and women \nsacrificed their very lives in service to their communities that \nmorning. Since that time hundreds more have labored tirelessly in \nefforts to save and recover their fellow rescuers and other victims. \nAlthough we react with awe and commend them for working above and \nbeyond the call of duty, these courageous souls expect no less from \nthemselves and carry on despite the heavy emotional and physical \nburdens of their mission.\n  This instinct to respond has shown in the efforts of emergency \nresponse personnel nationwide. On seeing the events of September 11 \nunfold, volunteers from all parts of the country, including \nfirefighters and other workers from the State of Wisconsin, travelled \nacross the country to the impact zones to assist in whatever means \nnecessary. From home, firefighters and other rescue workers have \norganized fund-raising and supply drives to support rescue and recovery \nefforts and the families of their fallen brethren. In Madison, WI, \nlocal firefighters have raised over $200,000 for families of their New \nYork counterparts who died at the World Trade Center. Other community \nfire departments throughout Wisconsin have responded in kind.\n  I am proud to recognize the contribution of our Wisconsin emergency \nresponse community. More than three-quarters of our fire and rescue \nworkers in Wisconsin are volunteers, individuals who balance this \nsubstantial public service commitment while working full-time jobs \nthroughout our communities. These workers know, like no other, the \nsacrifices that were made at the World Trade Center on September 11, \nand our prayers go out to them as they grieve for their comrades-in-\narms.\n  As we prepare to respond to this vicious attack on our Nation, we \nmust not forget the integral part that emergency response workers will \nplay in this campaign. The threat of terrorism knows no boundaries, as \nwe were so painfully reminded, and these first-responders will be on \nthe front lines of our defense. These workers have been quietly \npreparing for years for this mission, but they will need our continued \nsupport to remain at-the-ready. It will be these workers who will \nensure that America ``gets back to work,'' because their efforts give \nus security in our streets, our public facilities, and our homes. I \nwould like to say to all of our emergency response workers thank you \nfor your service to our communities. Your work has never been so \nneeded, never so appreciated.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements \nrelating thereto be printed in the Record with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
