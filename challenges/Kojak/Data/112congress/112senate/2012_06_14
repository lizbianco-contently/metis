I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            EPA Mercury Rule\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, last December, the Environmental \nProtection Agency finalized a rule called the Mercury Air Toxics \nStandard for powerplants. This rule is important, and it was long \noverdue.\n  Many Americans might not realize that before last December, there \nwere no Federal standards for mercury or the other toxic air pollution \npouring out of our Nation's powerplants. Thirty-two years ago, Congress \ndirected EPA to limit toxic air pollution from all big polluting \nindustries. In response, EPA set standards for nearly 100 industries \nacross our Nation. However, until December, there were no such \nstandards for the utility industry--the biggest source of mercury, \narsenic, and other toxic air pollution in the country.\n\n  Now there are standards in place, estimated to provide $3 to $9 of \nhealth and economic benefits for every $1 invested in pollution \ncontrols. We should be celebrating this sensible yet significant public \nhealth achievement. Yet from the other side of the aisle we only hear \nabout the $1 that the polluters have to spend to clean up. We never \nhear about the $3 to $9 the rest of the public saves as a result of the \npollution being cleaned up.\n  We hear about the cost to the polluter all the time. We never hear \nabout the cost, for example, of an asthma attack caused by soot and \nozone. We never hear about the public health cost to all of us of the \nchild having to go to the emergency room for an asthma attack. We never \nhear about the cost to the business of the mom who is not at work that \nday because she is off on a sick day taking care of that child in the \nemergency room or, if she is working on a regular wage, maybe it is on \nher. Maybe she does not get paid for that day because she is in the \nemergency room with her child. We never hear about that cost.\n  How about the simple cost of a mother stuck in an emergency room with \na child having a pollution-provoked asthma attack, waiting anxiously--\nwaiting for the nebulizer to kick in, waiting for that little oxygen \nmeter on the child's finger to show that the oxygen levels are back \nwhere they should be? That is not even counted--the worry of a mom for \nher child having a pollution-caused asthma incident. We never hear \nabout that. We never hear about the dollar side. All they talk about, \nall we hear about from them is the $1 the polluter has to pay to clean \nup their pollution--never, in this case, the $3 to $9; in other cases \nit is $35 to $1, over $100 to $1.\n  Instead, we have colleagues on the other side who want to halt this \nprogress--notwithstanding the savings for virtually every American--\nwith a resolution we are facing now that would void these new \nstandards--standards that have just emerged after 32 years for the \nfirst time regulating toxic pollution out of utility plants. This \nresolution would not only void the new standard, but it would bar EPA \nfrom ever setting similar limits on powerplants in the future.\n  In speeches against these public health standards, one of my \ncolleagues appears somewhat confused about the mercury air toxic \nstandards. I wish to set the record straight on two points. One, this \ncolleague has complained that the technology does not exist to meet \nthese standards. That is the complaint: the technology does not exist \nto meet these standards. But if you look at the Clean Air Act, it \ndirects the EPA--as EPA did--to set these standards based upon the \nperformance of the top 12 percent in the industry--the actual \nperformance of the top 12 percent in the industry. In other words, at \nleast one out of every eight powerplant units must already be meeting \neach of the standards that is set. This is not a case in which the \ntechnology does not exist. This is a situation in which one out of \nevery eight plants is already meeting it. The technology assuredly \nexists, demonstrably exists. What EPA is doing is leveling the field so \nthat utilities do not get a competitive advantage by running dirtier \npowerplants than their fellow utilities.\n  This colleague has also complained that the rule establishes \nstandards for toxic air pollution other than mercury. Well, limiting \nall toxic air pollution at once is more efficient for the utilities \nthan tackling each pollutant separately. Frankly, if we are going at \nmercury once, and then later arsenic--and over and over the utilities \nhad to go back and recalibrate--we would be hearing complaints that was \nthe wrong way to do it. So if you do it all at once, they complain; if \nyou do it separately, they would complain. The bottom line is, any time \npolluters are asked to clean up their act, some people are going to \ncomplain.\n  In section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act, Congress told the EPA that \nthey shall establish emission standards for each category of major \nsources of the toxic air pollutants listed in section 112(c). Congress \nprovided a list of 180 pollutants, which EPA used as the basis for the \npowerplant standards. You cannot fault EPA for that. Moreover, the \nstaggering health benefits of this rule--4,700 fewer anticipated heart \nattacks, 130,000 fewer cases of child asthma symptoms, 5,700 fewer \nemergency room visits each year--flow from limiting all toxic air \npollution from powerplants--not eliminating, limiting all toxic air \npollution from powerplants rather than just mercury.\n  In pointing out that EPA correctly sought to limit all toxic air \npollution from powerplants, I do not want to gloss over the importance \nof setting those Federal mercury standards. As I indicated earlier, \npowerplants are the largest source of airborne mercury pollution in the \nUnited States.\n  Mercury, as everybody knows, is a neurotoxin that can be most \ndevastating to developing nervous systems. The reason we have the \nphrase ``mad as a hatter'' is because hatters used mercury in their \nwork and it affected their brains. It is a neurotoxin. Exposure to \nmercury in utero, or as a child, can permanently reduce a person's \nability to think and learn. For this reason, women of childbearing age, \ninfants, and children must avoid mercury exposure.\n  What does this mean for Rhode Island? Many of you have heard me talk \nabout the out-of-State air pollution that plagues my State. Most air \npollution in Rhode Island is not generated from within our borders. It \nis sent from sources hundreds, even thousands of miles away. It is sent \nby powerplants out of State in significant measure.\n  On a clear summer day in Rhode Island, we will be commuting in to \nwork, and we will hear on the drive-time radio: Today is a bad air day \nin Rhode Island. Infants, seniors, and people with respiratory \ndifficulties should stay indoors today; otherwise, it is a beautiful \nday--a summer day when kids should be out playing. But if they have \nasthma, if they have a respiratory ailment, no, they are condemned to \nstay indoors--not because of anything that happened in Rhode Island but \nbecause of out-of-State pollution, mostly from these powerplants.\n  So the same sources that create those bad air days for Rhode Island--\nthat force seniors and infants and children, people with respiratory \ndifficulties to stay indoors on an otherwise fine summer day--also send \nus mercury pollution, which is why, although Rhode Island does not have \na single coal-fired generating unit within its borders, our health \ndepartment has to issue fish advisories.\n  If there is one emblematic image of American families doing something \nin the out-of-doors, it is the parent or grandparent taking their \nchild--their son or their daughter--or their grandchild fishing. Norman \nRockwell has captured this image. Many of us have similar images stored \naway in our childhood memories.\n\n  Yet today if a child goes fishing with her grandfather in Rhode \nIsland, she cannot eat the fish she caught. The Rhode Island Department \nof Health warns that pregnant women, women thinking of becoming \npregnant, and small children should not eat any\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\nfreshwater fish in Rhode Island. The health department also warns these \npopulations not to eat some saltwater fish, such as shark and \nswordfish, because they have high levels of mercury stored in their \nfat. The health department suggests that no one in Rhode Island should \neat more than one serving of freshwater fish--not just children, women \nwho are pregnant, and women thinking of becoming pregnant--no one in \nRhode Island should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught \nin our State each month in order to protect against mercury poisoning.\n  Finally, the health department warns that no one should ever eat any \nof the fish caught in three bodies of water in Rhode Island: The \nQuidnick Reservoir, Wincheck Pond, and Yawgoog Pond. For those of us \nwho remember fishing as kids and eating what we caught, this is a sad \nstate of affairs, and this is a state of affairs caused by polluters. \nThis cost of a family not being able to go to Quidnick Reservoir, to \nWincheck Pond to catch a fish, to take it home, to fry it up, to eat \nit--to do things that are as American as apple pie, in some respects--\nis because of the polluters.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield at this point for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Of course.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, I want to thank the Senator so much--so much--for \ntaking to the floor today and explaining to everyone within the sound \nof his voice that we face a very important vote, because we have a \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle who wants to say to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency: Stop your work and allow polluters to \ncontinue to poison this atmosphere and those of us who live in it. You \nare talking about mercury. There is arsenic, there is lead, there is \nformaldehyde. We have to say to the utilities: Clean up your act. We \nare giving them enough time to do it.\n  I want to ask my friend a question, and then I will yield altogether \nto him. The question is, is my friend aware that the cost-benefit ratio \nof this rule that Senator Inhofe wants to now repeal is 9 to 1? In \nother words, for every $1 that we put in to make sure this pollution \ngoes away or is controlled, there is $9 of benefits in health? Is my \ncolleague aware of that?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. First of all, let me thank my wonderful chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee for joining me on the floor \nand asking me this question. The figure I have used--I have been more \nconservative--is in a range between $3 and $9. But there is a very \nsignificant payback. As I was pointing out, that payback actually \ncounts in hard dollars to the public. It does not count things such as, \nas I mentioned in my speech, the worry of a mom spending the day in the \nemergency room waiting for her child's breathing to recover. It may \ntake into account her or her employer's economic loss. It does not take \ninto account her worry. It does not take into account the grandfather \nnot being able to take the fish home from Yawgoog Pond because it is \nnow poisonous because out-of-State polluters have dumped mercury into \nthe atmosphere and into the pond for so long.\n  Those are real costs if you have a traditional American kind of \nfamily and people go fishing together and do things such as that. You \ncannot do that any longer. That does not even count in the equation. \nThe polluters get to take that away from America for free in that \nequation.\n  But, as I said, what is interesting is that our friends on the other \nside only seem to think about, only seem to notice, only seem to talk \nabout the $1 that the polluters have to pay to clean up their act. They \ndo not talk about the folks who get the jobs repairing the pollution, \nbuilding the scrubbers--the American jobs that creates. They just talk \nabout their cost, and they do not talk at all about the cost on the \nother side--the health care costs, the job losses, the loss of \neducation, the long-term health damage that people undertake.\n\n\n                         Surface Transportation\n\n  While the Senator is on the floor, let me tell my chairman how proud \nI am of the job she did yesterday on our highway bill. Getting out \nthere with those big trucks and with the big, heavy paving equipment \nwas a wonderful way of demonstrating to the public what has happened \nhere, which is that the most important jobs bill the Senate has passed \nthis year is being blocked by the House to eliminate or damage the \nsummer construction season for highway work.\n  In my State, as I think I have told the Senator, we have more than 90 \nprojects on the roster for this summer's highway construction season. \nForty of them are falling off because of the delay from March until \nJune that the Republicans already forced on us.\n  As the Senator has told me, they are trying to push for another delay \nthat is going to knock more projects off, put more people out of work. \nOurs was a bipartisan bill. It could not have been better and more \nopenly and transparently run by the Senator and her ranking member, \nSenator Inhofe.\n  There are 2.9 million jobs at stake. Everybody gets that our roads \nand highways need repair. Yet a group of Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives will not agree to go forward. And time is running out \non this summer's construction season.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. They get the benefit of knocking down jobs in the \nrunup to the election, which I think is a disgraceful way to go about \nthe Nation's business. But we cannot move them. The irony and the \ntragedy here is, if Speaker Boehner would call up this bipartisan \nSenate transportation bill, it would pass.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It would pass with Republican votes and Democratic \nvotes, and we could put people back to work across this country right \nnow, doing the work that every American knows our highway system needs. \nThis is not bridges to nowhere. This is bridges that people drive \nacross to get to work. This is potholes and highways and places like 95 \nthat goes through Providence on a viaduct. It is falling in so much \nthat they have put planks underneath it to keep the pieces that fall \nthrough from landing on the Amtrak trains and the car traffic \nunderneath.\n  We need this work. We need these jobs. It is so disingenuous and so \ncynical to stop this work just because there is an election coming. \nWhat the Senator did yesterday to press on that was very important. I \nappreciate that.\n  I see Senator Udall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                Wind PTC\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise again to continue the \nfight for our effort to extend the production tax credit for wind. I am \ngoing to continue to return to the floor every morning until we get the \nPTC extended.\n  It has a positive economic effect on each and every one of our States \nand we ought to immediately extend it. If we do not, there are \ntremendous risks because there will be uncertainty. There will be \n37,000 jobs at risk, per the estimate of the American Wind Energy \nAssociation, in 2013, if we let this important, crucial tax credit \nexpire.\n  On the other hand, looking at this prohibitively, a recent study by \nNavigant concludes that a stable tax policy would allow the wind \nindustry to create and save 54,000 jobs. That is a clear choice. Do we \nwant to lose 37,000 jobs or do we want to create and save 54,000 more?\n  Over the last number of years in tough economic times, the wind \nindustry has been a bright spot. We have seen growth in the wind \nindustry on the manufacturing side, and these are good-paying jobs. But \nwe are at a make-or-break moment for wind energy. If we let the wind \nPTC expire, we will lose thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in \ninvestment.\n  We also run the real risk of losing our position in the global \neconomic race for clean energy technology. Other countries are taking \nnote. While we are dithering in the Congress, our foreign competitors \nare literally eating our lunch.\n  I am about to attend a hearing in the Energy Committee on our \ncompetitiveness in the clean energy sector. We are going to be \ndiscussing how China is outpacing us in the clean energy economy. The \nwitnesses, I know, will emphasize--because I have seen their \ntestimony--that we have to improve and maximize domestic manufacturing \ncapacity or we risk losing these jobs to overseas competitors.\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\n  I wish to give an example this morning. In North Carolina, there is a \ncompany, PPG Industries. It is a fiberglass company, hundreds of \nemployees. They have been threatened by foreign competition in the last \nfew years. Fiberglass is a primary component of wind turbine blades. \nThe company has found new buyers in the wind industry.\n  I wish to quote the manager, Cheryl Richards, of this factory. She \nhas urged us to act. She said:\n\n       That's investment in the U.S. That's investment in jobs, in \n     technology, in the future, in clean energy. If we're not \n     doing it, there are people across the ocean who will. And \n     they'll be happy to sell their products here.\n\n  So while we cannot get our act together in Congress to pass the wind \nPTC, our economic competitors in Europe and Asia have moved ahead. They \nhave developed robust manufacturing capacity to serve both their \ndomestic demands, and now they are beginning to sell all over the \nworld.\n  To emphasize how real this threat is, I wish to show all of the \nviewers and my colleagues what has happened in the past when the PTC \nhas expired. Look back in 2000. There was a 93-percent drop. There was \na 73-percent drop from 2001 to 2002. It does not make sense. I hear \nthis from Coloradans. I hear this from Americans.\n  Wind project developers in the United States and American \nmanufacturers are not receiving orders. We could see another boom-and-\nbust cycle, where we get a 73-percent or 93-percent drop in \ninstallations. Our economy does not need that, especially right now. So \nthere is a time for leadership. It is time to show the American people \nwe can bridge partisan divides in the Congress, we can act, and we can \ntake urgent action.\n  Let's get the wind PTC reauthorized as soon as possible. It is within \nour power to stop sending jobs overseas, to prevent falling behind \nmajor economies such as China, Germany, India, and to stop harming \ndomestic industries and manufacturing.\n  Again, look at this chart. This tells the story. We have to stand and \ndo the right thing. Let's start by passing the wind PTC extension now. \nWe can do it today. I am going to continue coming back to the floor of \nthe Senate until we get the wind PTC extended.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Tejal Shah\n\n  As my time begins to expire, I wished to take a moment of personal \nprivilege and note that Tejal Shah, who has been working in my office \nas a fellow from the State Department, is leaving my office this week. \nShe is returning to the State Department to continue doing her work \nthere.\n  I wish to thank her for the phenomenal support she has given me, for \nthe knowledge and skill she has brought to my office. I wish her well \nin her efforts at the State Department.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                              Utility MACT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I also, as my colleague \nSenator Whitehouse did, wish to thank the chairman, Barbara Boxer, for \nher hard work and her leadership to protect our air and our public \nhealth on this crucial vote that is going to come up later this month.\n  I rise in opposition to the resolution of disapproval that we expect \nSenator Inhofe to offer. This resolution would permanently block the \nEPA from reducing mercury and toxic pollution from powerplants in the \nUnited States. The standard is called the Maximum Achievable Control \nTechnology standard or Utility MACT.\n  By blocking this standard, this resolution is bad for public health. \nThis resolution is also bad for America's natural gas producers. This \nresolution is especially bad for electric utilities that did the right \nthing and followed the law. Environmental protection should be a \nbipartisan issue. Republicans and Democrats both passed the Clean \nAir Act, the Clean Water Act, and other environmental laws by wide \nmargins.\n\n  I urge both parties not to support this resolution. Here are some key \npoints on the public health issues that are before us when this \nresolution comes to the floor: The Environmental Protection Agency \nestimates this standard will save 4,000 to 11,000 lives per year by \nreducing toxic pollution. The EPA also estimates this standard will \nprevent nearly 5,000 heart attacks and 130,000 childhood asthma \nattacks.\n  Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin. It is mostly a threat to pregnant \nwomen and young children. We took lead out of gasoline, we can also \ntake mercury out of smokestacks. Similar to many westerners, I know the \nPresiding Officer and I both enjoy fly fishing. In too many areas in \nAmerica, we have mercury advisories for fish from American lakes and \nrivers.\n  In New Mexico, most of our streams are under mercury advisories, \nwhich means pregnant women and children cannot eat the fish from those \nstreams. We cannot put a price on healthy children. But if we try, this \nrule produces tens of billions of health benefits each year.\n  This resolution of disapproval could permanently block these \nbenefits. I would also like to talk about the impact of this resolution \non natural gas. Natural gas has much lower toxic emissions than coal. \nIt has no mercury. It has no soot, known as particulate matter. Recent \ndiscoveries of U.S. natural gas have led to a 100-year supply. Natural \ngas prices are low. While that is actually bad for New Mexico's economy \nin some places, it is good for consumers.\n  Natural gas has increased its market share in the power sector from \n20 to 29 percent recently because it is a lower cost and cleaner fuel. \nEPA standards do not ban coal, but they do call on coal to compete on a \nlevel playing field and reduce its pollution. If we pass this \nresolution, we will inject further uncertainty into the utility sector, \nwhich is balancing its portfolio to more equal shares of coal and gas \nas opposed to being overly reliant on coal.\n  I support research in defining ways to clean up coal. If we put our \nminds to it, we may be able to take out the toxic pollutants.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona is on the floor. I first wish to thank \nhim for allowing me a couple minutes to get my statement in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from New Mexico desires a few extra \nminutes, I would be more than happy to yield.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator. I will take 1 more \nminute to finish.\n  Finally, I would like to note that this resolution is a bailout of \ncompanies that would rather spend money on lobbying than on pollution \ncontrols. The EPA standard does not harm responsible coal companies. It \nis achievable with current technology. It is my understanding that most \nor all of the coal plants in New Mexico already have the technology to \nmeet these standards. The Public Service Company of New Mexico has \ninvested in mercury controls to reduce pollution in our State. Across \nthe Nation, many other utilities have as well.\n  A variety of business groups support EPA's mercury standard, \nincluding the Clean Energy Group of utilities, the American Sustainable \nBusiness Council, and the Main Street Alliance. Those standards are \nrequired by the Clean Air Act. If we block them, we will punish the law \nabiders and bail out the procrastinators. I urge my colleagues to \noppose the resolution of disapproval.\n  Once again, I thank Senator McCain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                         Farm Bill Authorizing\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the Presiding Officer was paying \nclose attention to the Senator from New Mexico. I think that is \nentirely appropriate for that to happen. I am sure it certainly has \nnothing to do with family allegiance.\n  The Senate is considering the farm bill, which we do every 5 years. \nDuring\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\nthis debate, Americans will hear speeches about spending reductions and \ncuts to farm subsidies. I concede that there is some of that in this \nbill.\n  Unfortunately, so far we have failed to have an open and fair \namendment process that should be the case in the Senate. I have several \namendments I would like to have considered. Similar to my other \ncolleagues, we have been prevented from doing so. I have been in this \nbody for some years during the consideration of previous farm bills. I \nhave always been able to have a couple amendments considered and voted \non.\n  Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case in the consideration \nof this farm bill.\n  It is very regrettable and unfortunate that we cannot just start \nvoting on amendments and then see where we are. Instead, we have the \nfilling of the tree and other language, and most Americans have no idea \nwhat we are talking about. But it does prevent this body from \nconsidering the amendments of Members on both sides of the aisle. It is \nunfortunate.\n  Also, the fact remains that the programs authorized under this farm \nbill consume a colossal sum of taxpayer dollars. It is over 1,000 pages \nand is estimated to cost $969 billion over 10 years. Again, that is \n$969 billion over 10 years. That is about $1 billion per page. It is a \n60-percent increase from the previous farm bill, which was passed in \n2008. While I believe it is necessary to assist low-income families \nwith nutrition programs, we should keep farmers out of the red when a \nnatural disaster strikes.\n  I am also mindful of the taxpayers who are saddled with a $1.5 \ntrillion deficit and a ballooning $15 trillion national debt. The farm \nbill is certainly ripe for spending cuts. Some have taken place--not \nnearly as much are necessary. As usual, the farm bill, being 1,000 \npages long, is filled with special deals for special interests.\n  I acknowledge that the Senate bill generates $23 billion in savings, \nand that is a notable accomplishment. We have finally done away with \nDepression-era farm subsidies such as ``direct payments'' and the \n``countercyclical program,'' which encourages overproduction, thereby \ntriggering more farm subsidies to compensate for depressed prices. \nUnfortunately, it seems that Congress's idea of farm bill reform is to \neliminate one subsidy program only to invent a new one to take its \nplace. Cutting direct and countercyclical payments actually saved the \ntaxpayers about $50 billion, but rather than plug that money into \ndeficit reduction this farm bill blows $35 billion of its own savings \non several new subsidy programs.\n  For example, we have a new agricultural risk coverage subsidy \nprogram, or ARC, which works by locking in today's record-high crop \nprices and guaranteeing farmers up to an 89-percent return on their \ncrop. ARC could cost taxpayers anywhere from $3 billion to $14 billion \neach year, depending on market conditions. We also create a new $3 \nbillion cotton subsidy program called STAX, which the Brazilian Trade \nRepresentative has signaled will escalate their WTO antidumping \ncomplaint against the United States. I wonder how many of our taxpayers \nknow that we already pay Brazil $150 million a year to keep our cotton \nprograms. Why would we make things worse?\n  This bill authorizes the creation of a new marginal loss subsidy \nprogram for catfish. This bill maintains a $95 billion federally backed \ncrop insurance program, which also subsidizes crop insurance premiums. \nWe then pile on a new $4 billion program called supplemental coverage \noption, or SCO, that subsidizes crop insurance deductibles. Subsidized \ninsurance, subsidized premiums, and subsidized deductibles--I am hard \npressed to think of any other industry that operates with less risk at \nthe expense of the American taxpayer.\n  This is all part of farm bill politics. In order to pass the farm \nbill, Congress must find a way to appease every special interest of \nevery commodity association, from asparagus farmers to wheat growers. \nIf you cut somebody's subsidy, you give them a grant. If you kill their \ngrant, then you cover their insurance programs.\n  Let's look at several other handouts that special interests have \nreaped in this year's farm bill, which may account for the size of the \nbill.\n  The bill authorizes $15 million to establish a new grant program to \n``improve'' the U.S. sheep industry. We are going to spend 15 million \nof your taxpayer dollars to improve the U.S. sheep industry.\n  The bill authorizes $10 million to establish a new USDA--Department \nof Agriculture--program to eradicate feral pigs. I have always been \nagainst pork spending, but now we are going to spend $10 million to \nestablish a new USDA program to eradicate feral pigs.\n  The bill authorizes $25 million to study the health benefits of peas, \nlentils, and garbanzo beans--$25 million to study the health benefits \nof peas, lentils, and garbanzo beans. I know mothers all over America \nwho have advocated for their children to eat their peas will be pleased \nto know there is a study that will cost them $25 million as to the \nhealth benefits of peas, lentils, and garbanzo beans.\n  It authorizes $200 million for the Value Added Grant Program, which \ngives grants to novelty producers such as small wineries and--I am not \nkidding--the occasional cheesemaker.\n  There is $40 million in grants from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to encourage private landowners to use their land for bird-\nwatching or hunting. We are looking at a $1.5 trillion deficit this \nyear, and we are going to spend $40 million to encourage private \nlandowners to use their land for bird-watching or hunting. I am all for \nbird-watching, and I support hunters--not to the tune of $40 million.\n  The bill authorizes $700 million for the Agriculture and Food \nResearch Initiative--$700 million. That funds a variety of research \ngrants, such as testing pine tree growth in Florida or studying moth \npheromones. I have no clue what a moth pheromone is. When did it become \na national priority to study moth pheromones?\n  There is $250 million for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Urban \nForest Assistance Program, which spends Federal funds to plant trees in \nurban parks and city streets. There is a new program that spends $125 \nmillion to promote healthy food choices in schools. There are already \nat least four other healthy eating educational programs in this bill. \nThere are already four, but we are going to add another $125 million \nprogram for another healthy eating educational program.\n  There is $200 million for one of my all-time favorites, the Market \nAccess Program, which has been there for years, which subsidizes \noverseas advertising campaigns of large corporations. We have, of \ncourse, the infamous mohair wool subsidy, which has been fleecing the \nAmerican people since 1954. When Congress passed the 1954 farm bill, \nthey wanted to ensure a domestic supply of wool for military uniforms \nby paying farmers to raise, among other things, angora goats for \nmohair. This may have held merit then, but nobody can dispute that \nmohair became obsolete, thanks to synthetic fibers. Today we use mohair \nin custom socks, fashionable scarves, and trendy throw rugs. Some of my \ncolleagues may recall that Congress killed off mohair subsidies in the \n1990s. Unfortunately, goats are reputed to eat just about anything, and \nour hard-earned tax dollars are no exception.\n  By the time Congress passed the 2002 farm bill, mohair subsidies had \nbeen restored. The mohair program, which costs taxpayers about $1 \nmillion a year, may not be particularly expensive compared to most farm \nprograms. I suppose where some of my colleagues see a minor government \npittance for wool socks I see a disgraceful example of how special \ninterests can embed themselves in a farm bill for generations.\n\n  As if field corn and ethanol subsidies weren't nefarious enough, this \nfarm bill includes a new carve-out for popcorn subsidies--I am not \nmaking it up. This is a perfect example of farm bill politics. Thanks \nto a provision snuck into a 2003 appropriations bill, popcorn started \nreceiving millions of dollars in ``direct payment'' subsidies. However, \nbecause the new farm bill eliminates direct payments, the popcorn \nindustry is scrambling to be added to the newly created ARC Program. \nUnder this farm bill, popcorn will be subsidized to the tune of $91 \nmillion over 10 years, according to CBO.\n  The cooking oil that movie theaters use to heat popcorn is already \nsubsidized, as well as the butter they put on top. So popcorn is doing \nfine is the\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\ntruth of the matter. The price of popcorn has risen 40 percent in \nrecent years, thanks in part to ethanol, and recent free-trade \nagreements with Colombia and South Korea are creating a boom for \nAmerican popcorn exports. There isn't a kernel of evidence that they \nneed this support from taxpayers.\n  The Sugar Program is another masterful scam. The USDA operates a \ncomplex system of important tariffs, loans, and government production \nquotas that restrict sugar imports and keeps sugar prices artificially \nhigh. The sugar barons will tell us that the Department of Agriculture \nSugar Program operates at ``no net cost'' to the American taxpayers \nbecause sugar didn't receive ``direct payments.''\n  In actuality, businesses and consumers bear the burden of the Sugar \nProgram by paying higher costs for any sweetened product. Every year, \nAmerican consumers are forced to pay an extra $3.5 billion on sweetened \nfood products.\n  Just yesterday, the Senate voted to table an amendment to phase out \nthe Sugar Program, which is quite a sweetheart deal for sugar growers.\n  Finally, one of my favorites of all time is regarding catfish. I have \nan amendment that will repeal the farm bill provision that directs the \nUSDA to create a new catfish inspection office. I am grateful for the \nsupport of my colleagues who cosponsored it. What we are attempting to \ndo with this amendment is simple: It puts an end to the latest attempt \nby southern catfish farmers to restrict catfish imports.\n  Five years ago, a protectionist provision was snuck into the 2008 \nfarm bill that requires the Department of Agriculture to begin \ninspecting catfish. As my colleagues know, the USDA inspects meat, \neggs, and poultry but not seafood. That is a whole new government \noffice. It is being developed at USDA just to inspect catfish. Catfish \nfarmers have tried to argue that we need a catfish inspection office to \nensure Americans are eating safe and healthy catfish.\n  I wholeheartedly agree that catfish should be safe for consumers. The \nproblem is that FDA already inspects catfish, just as it does all \nseafood, screening it for biological and chemical hazards. If there \nwere legitimate food safety reasons for having USDA inspect catfish, we \nwould not be having this discussion. Don't take my word for it, just \nask USDA.\n  When the Department of Agriculture completed an internal assessment \nfor the program in December 2010, the Department said it could not \nestablish a ``rational relationship'' between the catfish office and \nthe risks to human health, concluding, ``There is substantial \nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the catfish inspection \nprogram.'' The Department of Agriculture estimates that this \nquestionable program will come at a cost to taxpayers of $30 million \njust to create the office and another $14 million each year thereafter.\n  GAO has also extensively examined the catfish office. In February \n2011, GAO released a report saying the catfish office is at ``high \nrisk'' for fraud, waste, and abuse, and it is ``duplicative'' of FDA's \nfunctions and would fragment our food safety system. Just last week GAO \nissued a new report, titled ``Responsibility For Inspecting Catfish \nShould Not Be Assigned to USDA,'' and they called upon Congress to \nrepeal the catfish office.\n  This isn't the first time consumers have been hoodwinked by southern \ncatfish farmers. When the Senate considered the 2002 farm bill, they \nslipped in an obscure provision that made it illegal to label \nVietnamese catfish as ``catfish'' in the United States. At that time, \nthe State Department had recently reopened trade relations with \nVietnam, and domestic catfish farmers in Southern States found \nthemselves competing against cheaper catfish imports. Domestic catfish \nfarmers wanted to discourage American consumers from buying Vietnamese \ncatfish by marketing it under the Latin name ``pangasius,'' or \n``panga,'' even though it is virtually indistinguishable from U.S.-\ngrown catfish.\n  Although the panga labeling law was enacted, it ultimately backfired \non catfish farmers because panga catfish remained popular with American \nconsumers. It is a senseless law, and my colleagues may recall that I \ncame to the floor to fight against it. I asked the question: ``When is \na catfish not a catfish?'' Why would Congress pass a law that renames a \nspecies of catfish into something else? Why single out catfish and put \nit in the same category as USDA-inspected beef. Ironically, catfish \nfarmers are lobbying USDA to re-relabel Vietnamese ``panga'' back to \n``catfish'' to ensure Asian imports are subject to this new catfish \noffice.\n\n  So the catfish office offers no legitimate food safety benefit. Its \ntrue goal is to erect trade barriers on Asian catfish imports to prop \nup the domestic catfish industry and make American consumers pay more.\n  The farm bill before us has some laudable parts to it. There are some \nreductions in spending. When we examine the bill, however, we find more \nand more of this kind of special interest, unnecessary spending, and \nprograms that either are protectionist in nature or programs that have \nbeen inserted sometimes in the middle of the night in the past. We have \nalso just begun to examine a number of provisions in this bill, which I \ndid not discuss today.\n  I wish the small business men and women in my State had a bill for \nsmall business, a bill that would help them in the very difficult times \nthey are experiencing, in the terrible economic times which have caused \nthem to not be in business anymore so that they and their families are \ngoing through the most difficult of times. This is obviously a well-\nintentioned bill, but I also think in these harsh economic times it is \nfar from the kind of legislation we owe the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Preserving Waters of the USA Act\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the biggest \nthreats to economic growth in this country, and that is this \nadministration's job-killing regulatory agenda.\n  My goal in the Senate is to promote policies that create jobs. With \nmy home State of Nevada leading the Nation in unemployment, I do not \nbelieve the private sector is doing just fine, and I support \ncommonsense policies that give our job creators the necessary tools to \nprovide for long-term economic growth.\n  Under the current administration, they seem bent upon issuing \nregulation after regulation that threatens existing jobs and preventing \nnew ones from being created. As I have stated before, you cannot be \nprojobs and antibusiness at the same time.\n  With unemployment at 11.7 percent in Nevada--and it continues to lead \nthe Nation in unemployment--the only things as scarce as jobs in Nevada \nare private property and water. Roughly 87 percent of Nevada is \ncontrolled by the Federal Government, and the remaining 13 percent is \nheavily regulated by the Federal Government also. Nevada is also one of \nthe driest States in the Nation. Because of this, water is a very \nprecious commodity.\n  As we debate the farm bill, I am proud to join with some of my \ncolleagues in their efforts to provide some much needed regulatory \nrelief for American farmers in rural America. However, the latest \nefforts by this administration go well beyond the agricultural sector.\n  For years there has been a concerted effort to expand the regulatory \nreach over water in this country. After years of failed attempts to \nlegislatively change the scope of regulatory authority over water, the \nEPA is now trying to overturn both congressional intent and multiple \nSupreme Court decisions to further their goal of overregulation.\n  To put it into context, if this regulation were enacted, it would \ngive the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers the ability to regulate \nirrigation ditches, large mud puddles, or anything that contains \nstanding water, regardless of whether it is permanent, seasonal, or \nmanmade. Never before under the Clean Water Act have Federal \nregulations extended this far. This was not the intent of Congress when \nwriting the Clean Water Act, and Congress has repeatedly rejected any \nlegislative effort to alter the existing law.\n  More disturbing, the administration has bypassed public outreach and \nhas\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nneglected to consider the economic impact of their proposed action. \nThis is in addition to ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court twice \naffirmed the limits of the Federal authority under the Clean Water Act. \nBut apparently the EPA believes it does not have to adhere to laws of \nthe land.\n  Expanding the Federal regulatory overreach into water also infringes \non private property rights. It stops investments and development and \ninfrastructure projects, including housing, schools, hospitals, roads, \nhighways, agriculture, and energy. In my home State, this regulation \nwill hurt farming, ranching, mining, and construction--the same middle-\nclass, blue-collar jobs this administration claims to care about.\n  In an already struggling economy, we cannot afford to create \nadditional regulatory barriers that will cost jobs and prevent future \neconomic growth. That is why Senators Barrasso, Inhofe, Sessions, and I \nhave offered an amendment to the farm bill, as well as a stand-alone \npiece of legislation that would preserve the current definition of \nwaters of the United States. The Preserve the Waters of the United \nStates Act is simply straightforward legislation that would preserve \nthe current definition of Federal waters as well as uphold private \nproperty rights.\n  Opposition to this legislation has been disingenuous. It is \nridiculous to assert that supporters of this important legislation are \nopposed to clean water. What I am opposed to is the Federal Government \ncontinuing its overreach and further hurting our economy and \njeopardizing personal property rights and States rights. I am opposed \nto giving Washington bureaucrats the authority to regulate your \nbackyard. And I am opposed to this administration using a closed-door \nprocess to issue job-killing regulations that have become far too \ncommon.\n  I had hoped for a vote on this amendment that will allow the Senate \nto make a clear choice between jobs and an extreme environmental \nagenda. Unfortunately, the amendment process has once again broken \ndown, and we will not have the ability to openly debate this important \nissue.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Preserve the Waters of the \nUnited States Act and show their constituents that they stand with job \ncreators. There is a vast and diverse coalition of support for our \nefforts to limit the Federal Government's overreach. It includes local \ngovernments, municipalities, manufacturers, small businesses, and many \nmore.\n  As an outdoorsman, I am committed to good stewardship of our natural \nresources and believe that we do not have to choose between a healthy \nenvironment and economic prosperity. The Preserve the Waters of the \nUnited States Act is a commonsense solution that will prevent jobs from \nbeing destroyed and keep private property rights from being further \neroded by this Federal Government. I respectfully urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and bring it to a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Farm Bill Amendments\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will be speaking about two amendments \nthat I intend to offer as part of the farm bill. I think both \namendments are extremely important, and both amendments have the \nsupport of the vast majority of the people of our country. They may not \nhave the support of powerful special interests, but I think that from \nMaine to California, people will be supporting these amendments.\n  The first one is amendment No. 2310, which is cosponsored by Senator \nBarbara Boxer of California.\n  All across our country, people are becoming more and more conscious \nabout the foods they are eating and the foods they are serving to their \nkids, and this is certainly true for genetically engineered foods. This \nis a major concern in my State of Vermont, I know it is a major concern \nin Senator Boxer's State of California, and it is a major concern all \nover our country.\n  This year in my State of Vermont, our legislature tried to pass a \nbill that would have required foods that contain genetically engineered \ningredients to have that information on their labels. That information \nwould simply give consumers in the State of Vermont the knowledge about \nthe ingredients that are in the food they are ingesting--not, I \nbelieve, a terribly radical idea.\n\n  I personally believe, and I think most Americans believe, that when a \nmother goes to the store and purchases food for her child, she has the \nright to know what she is feeding her child, what is in the food she is \ngiving to her kids and her family. This concern about genetically \nengineered labeling brought out a huge turnout to the Vermont State \nlegislature of people who were supportive of this concept. In fact, it \nwas one of the most hotly debated and discussed issues in our \nlegislature this year. Over 100 Vermonters testified at a committee \nmeeting--the Committee on Agriculture meeting of the State of Vermont--\nin favor of this legislation. We are a small State. Hundreds more \ncrowded in the statehouse to show their support.\n  What people in Vermont, and I believe all over this country, are \nsaying, simply and straightforwardly, is: We want to know what is in \nthe food we are eating and whether that food is genetically engineered. \nClearly, this is not just a Vermont issue. Almost 1 million people in \nthe State of California signed a petition to get labeling of \ngenetically engineered food on the November ballot. In California, a \nbig State, 1 million people is a lot of people. In other words, what we \nare seeing from Vermont and California and all over this country is \npeople want to know what is in the food they are eating and they want \nto know whether that food is genetically engineered. I thank Senator \nBoxer of California for representing the people of her State in \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  This is not just a Vermont issue. It is not just a California issue. \nAccording to an MSNBC poll in February of 2011, 95 percent of Americans \nagree that labeling of food with genetically engineered ingredients \nshould be allowed. Those polling numbers have been consistently over 90 \npercent dating back to 2001.\n  What we are seeing in polling, year after year, is people want to \nknow what is in the food they are eating. Not everybody agrees. \nMonsanto, one of the world's largest producers of genetically \nengineered food, does not like this idea. Monsanto is also the world's \nlargest producer of the herbicide Roundup, as well as so-called Roundup \nReady seeds that have been genetically engineered to resist the \npesticide. It is no mystery why Monsanto would fight people's right to \nknow. Business is booming for this huge chemical company. It raked in \nover $11 billion in revenues and cleared $1.6 billion in profits in \n2011. This year is going pretty well for Monsanto.\n  Once it seemed possible that Vermont could pass the bill. That is \nbecause the people of the State of Vermont want to see that legislation \npassed. But our friends at Monsanto threatened to sue the State if that \nbill was passed. Sadly--and this is what goes on in politics, not just \non this issue but on so many issues--despite passing out of the House \nCommittee on Agriculture by a vote of 9 to 1, the bill did not make it \nany further because of the fear of a lawsuit from this huge, \nmultinational corporation.\n  Today, we have an opportunity, with the Sanders-Boxer amendment, \namendment No. 2310, to affirm States rights to label food that contains \ngenetically engineered ingredients. This amendment recognizes that the \n10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution clearly reserves powers in our \nsystem of federalism to the States and to the people. In other words, \nthat is what federalism is about. This amendment acknowledges that \nStates have the right to require the labeling of foods produced through \ngenetic engineering or derived from organisms that have been \ngenetically engineered. Simply put, this amendment gives people the \nright to know. It says that a State, if its legislature so chooses, may \nrequire that any food or beverage containing a genetically engineered \ningredient offered for sale in that State have a label that makes that \ninformation public and clear.\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\n  It also requires that the Commissioner of the FDA, with the Secretary \nof Agriculture, shall report to Congress within 2 years on the \npercentage of food and beverages in the United States that contain \ngenetically engineered ingredients.\n  There are strong precedents for labeling. The FDA, as everybody \nknows, already requires the labeling of over 3,000 ingredients, \nadditives, and processes. If we want to know if our food contains \ngluten, aspartame, high-fructose corn syrup, trans fats or MSG, we \nsimply read the ingredients label. Similarly, the FDA requires labeling \nfor major food allergens such as peanuts, wheat, shellfish, and others. \nBut Americans, for some reason, are not afforded that same information \nwhen it comes to genetically engineered foods.\n  Here is a very important point to make. What I am asking now, for the \npeople of America, is something that exists right now all over the \nworld. Genetically engineered foods are already required to be labeled \nin 49 countries around the world, including Russia, the United Kingdom, \nAustralia, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, China, New Zealand, and others, \nand the entire European Union allows its countries to require such \nlabels, which is essentially what this amendment is about. It is not \ntelling, but it is allowing States the right to go forward, if that is \nwhat the people of those States want.\n  If this is good for 49 or more countries around the world, why is it \nnot acceptable in the United States of America? The answer is pretty \nsimple. We have a large, powerful, multinational corporation that is \nmore concerned about their own profits than they are about allowing the \nAmerican people to know what is in the food they are eating.\n  Let me clarify just a few pieces of information regarding genetically \nengineered foods. Monsanto claims there is nothing to be concerned \nabout with genetically engineered foods. In the 1990s, there was a \nconsensus among scientists and doctors at the FDA that GE foods could \nhave new and different risks, such as hidden allergens, increased plant \ntoxin levels, and the potential to hasten the spread of antibiotic-\nresistant disease, but those concerns were quickly pushed aside in the \nname of biotechnology progress. Their concerns were not, however, \nunfounded.\n  In May 2012, a landmark independent study by Canadian doctors \npublished in the peer-reviewed journal Reproductive Toxicology found \nthat toxins from soil bacterium which had been engineered into Bt corn \nto kill pests was present in the bloodstream of 93 percent of pregnant \nwomen as well as in 80 percent of their fetal cord blood. In the wake \nof this study, action is being taken. In 3 days, on June 17, the \nAmerican Medical Association will consider resolutions that ask for \nstudies on the impacts of GE foods and labeling. Resolutions calling \nfor labeling of GE foods have already been passed by the American \nPublic Health Association and the American Nurses Association.\n\n  There is a great need for this information because there have never \nbeen mandatory human clinical trials of genetically engineered crops--\nno tests for the possibility of it causing cancer or for harm to \nfetuses, no long-term testing for human health risks, no requirement \nfor long-term testing on animals, and only limited allergy testing. \nWhat this means is that for all intents and purposes, the long-term \nhealth study on GE food is being done on the American people. We are \nthe clinical test.\n  Let me clarify just a few things about labeling genetically \nengineered food. GE food labels will not increase costs to shoppers. \nEverybody knows companies change their labels all the time. They market \ntheir products differently and adding a label does not change this. In \nfact, many products already voluntarily label their food as ``GMO \nfree.'' Further, genetically engineered crops are not better for the \nenvironment. For example, the use of Monsanto Roundup Ready soybeans \nengineered to withstand the exposure to the herbicide Roundup has \ncaused the spread of Roundup-resistant weeds which now infest 10 \nmillion acres in 22 States, with predictions of 40 million acres or \nmore by mid-decade. Resistant weeds increase the use of herbicides and \nthe use of older and more toxic herbicides.\n  Further, there are no international agreements that prohibit the \nmandatory identification of foods produced through genetic engineering. \nBut as I mentioned, 49 other countries already require it.\n  The Sanders-Boxer consumers right to know about genetically \nengineered food amendment, amendment No. 2310, is about allowing States \nto honor the wishes of their residents and allowing consumers to know \nwhat they are eating. If this is not a conservative amendment, I do not \nknow what is. Americans deserve the right to know what they and their \nchildren are eating and that is what this amendment is all about. \nMonsanto and other major corporations should not be the ones to decide \nthis issue. The Congress and the American people should make that \ndecision. Without commonsense labeling requirements, the 295 million \nAmerican citizens who favor labeling, the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans who in poll after poll said yes, want to know whether the \nfood they are eating contains genetically engineered products. They are \nnot being listened to. On behalf of the American people who want to \nknow what is in their food, I urge support for this important \namendment.\n  I have another amendment, but I will come back at another time to \ntalk about the amendment, which will demand that the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission do what the law requires of them; that is, end \nexcessive speculation in the oil futures market, but I will hold off on \nthat until a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from New \nJersey is recognized.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon \ntoday, the Senate proceed to executive session and that the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the cloture vote by which cloture \nwas not invoked on Executive Calendar No. 501 be agreed to, the motion \nto reconsider be agreed to, and that there be 30 minutes for debate \nequally divided in the usual form; and that following the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on cloture on the \nnomination, upon reconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                         Agriculture Production\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments talking \nabout one of our job-creating titles in the farm bill, but first I want \nto thank colleagues who are continuing to work on this bill. As we \ncontinue to do the business of the Senate, they are working through the \namendment process and coming together with what I am optimistic will be \nan agreement for us to be able to move forward so we can complete our \ntask on the farm bill.\n  I thank the ranking member of the committee, Senator Roberts, for his \nleadership and his staff and my staff for working so hard together. \nThere has been a lot of coffee involved for folks to be able to stay \nawake on some late nights right now. They are doing a great job, and we \nare very optimistic as we move forward in this process.\n  One of the reasons we need to get this done, as I have stressed many \ntimes but it bears repeating, is this is a jobs bill. As the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer from Ohio knows--as well as myself, \ncoming from Michigan--jobs are a big deal. Jobs are a big deal across \nthe country, but we have been in the middle of it in terms of the \nrecession. We are now seeing optimism because we are recommitting \nourselves to making things and growing things in this country.\n  We make a lot of great things in Michigan, not the least of which is \nautomobiles, but a lot of other things also. I know Ohio, as well, is a \ngreat State for making things. Both of our States are also States where \nwe grow things, and I appreciate the leadership of the Presiding \nOfficer who is on our Agriculture Committee and has played a very \nsignificant role in getting us to\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\nthis point. The distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Brown, has \nhelped with major reforms in this bill. He has put forward a bipartisan \nproposal that relates to moving a risk-based system to support our \nfarmers. I appreciate very much the Senator's leadership on that as \nwell as a number of other things.\n  But this is about growing things. Almost one out of four people in \nMichigan has a job because we grow things. We have more diversity of \ncrops than any State, with the exception of California, and so that \nmeans every page of the farm bill matters to Michigan, which is why \nover the years I have paid attention to every single page of the farm \nbill.\n  Overall in our country 16 million people work because of agriculture. \nThey may be involved in production, they may be involved in packaging, \nthey may be involved in processing, they may make the farm equipment, \nor they may be involved in a variety of things, but they work because \nwe grow things in America. Our one area of huge trade surplus, and \nwhere we have grown in the last 2 years by 270 percent, is in \nagriculture. We are creating jobs here and exporting, and so this is a \njobs bill.\n  I want to talk specifically about a very important piece where we \nbring together making things and growing things in our economy, and \nthat is the energy title of the farm bill. The energy title reflects \nthe important work being done by America's farmers, ranchers, forest \nmanagers, and rural small businesses to help improve our energy \nsecurity.\n  Since we added this title in the 2002 farm bill--I was pleased to be \na strong supporter in doing that--the Rural Energy for America Program \nhas helped put in place nearly 8,000 projects and jobs that have helped \nfarmers lower their energy bills and actually produce electricity that \ngoes back to the electric grid. In the last 10 years, we have seen \nincredible advances in advanced biofuels and biobased manufacturing, \nwhich is the ultimate way to bring together making things and growing \nthings, both of which are supported and strengthened in this bill.\n  The farm bill is also an energy bill and it is a jobs bill. There are \nmore than 3,000 companies doing innovative, biobased manufacturing, and \nusing agricultural products instead of petroleum to manufacture \nfinished products. Those companies have already created over 100,000 \njobs and are growing every day. Many of these businesses are in rural \ncommunities, and supporting those businesses is one of the best ways we \ncan create jobs and economic growth in small towns all across our \ncountry.\n  This kind of manufacturing is also a win-win for the farmers. They \nget new markets for their products and, in some cases, markets for \ntheir waste products.\n  We have also seen tremendous growth in biofuels. This farm bill \nshifts our focus to the next generation of advanced biofuels, such as \ncellulosic ethanol, to continue lowering prices for families at the \npump. According to a study by the University of Wisconsin and the \nUniversity of Iowa, ethanol has already helped keep gas prices more \nthan $1 lower than they otherwise would be. It is the only competition \nwe have at the moment at the pump. As a consumer, what we need is more \nchoice and more competition so that depending on foreign oil is not the \nonly choice.\n  Many of our colleagues have different feelings about our energy \npolicies, and the great thing about the farm bill is that it doesn't \nmatter what we believe or where we come from, it is a winner because it \ncreates choices. If we want to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, this \nbill is a winner. If we want to make America more energy independent so \nwe are not relying so much on foreign oil, this bill is a winner. If we \nwant farmers to pay lower energy bills so they have more money to hire \nworkers and improve their business, this bill is a winner. And if we \nwant Americans to pay lower prices at the gas pump, as we all do, this \nbill is a winner for every American.\n  I especially want to thank Senators Conrad, Lugar, Harkin, Ben \nNelson, Bennet, Brown, Klobuchar, Thune, Casey, and Hoeven, who worked \nvery hard at putting together the energy title and the necessary \nfunding to continue supporting these innovative farmers and businesses \nall across our country. I appreciate their leadership in working with \nus and being able to get this done.\n  I want to talk about some of the specific areas we have in the energy \ntitle. There is something called the Rural Energy for America Program, \nalso known as REAP. It is one of the most successful programs in the \nenergy title, and one we hear about most often from farmers and \nranchers across the country.\n  This program helps farmers with loan guarantees and grants to \npurchase and install renewable energy systems and make energy \nefficiency upgrades. Farmers have been able to put solar panels, wind \nturbines, as well as biomass energy and geothermal and hydroelectric \nand other forms of renewable energy technology on the farm. Since 2003, \nREAP has supported 7,997 different energy-efficient projects that have \ngenerated or saved 6.5 million megawatt hours, which is enough power to \nmeet the annual needs of nearly 600,000 households.\n  As a caveat, I also want to say that when we talk about all of these \nalternatives, I also see this from the standpoint of making things. \nWhen we look at a big wind turbine, a lot of folks see energy use. I \nsee 8,000 parts. We can make every one of them in Michigan and probably \nan awful lot of them in Ohio. So when we talk about creating energy \nefficiency opportunities, we are also talking about creating \nmanufacturing jobs in the process. REAP is a big success story, which \nis why we continued the program and streamlined the application process \nfor farmers and small businesses applying for small and medium-sized \nprojects.\n\n  Each project funded by REAP can make a significant impact, as I said, \non utility costs incurred by the businesses. For example, one company \nin Georgia created an on-farm solar system that will produce about \n60,000 kilowatt hours per year to lower the company's power bills. \nAnother Kentucky company used an energy efficiency grant to improve \nlighting and support a refrigeration/freezer project that would give \nthem 63 percent energy savings--63 percent. That is a pretty big deal \nwhen we are paying the bills.\n  The next part I want to talk about is something called biobased \nmarkets and part of a larger biobased manufacturing effort that I am \nvery enthused about. Biobased manufacturing is rapidly becoming a \ncritical component of our new economy. According to USDA, there are \n3,118 registered biobased companies in the United States that have so \nfar created about 100,000 jobs, and growing. With customers demanding \nmore choices, oil prices rising, these innovative companies are taking \nnew approaches, turning agricultural products into manufactured \nproducts. So as we can see, all across the country there are 3,000 \ncompanies. This is a huge area that is growing, the innovation process, \nwhere we are literally taking agricultural products and replacing \nchemicals, replacing petroleum and plastics, and doing a variety of \nthings that allow us to create new markets for farmers, get us off of \nforeign oil, and create jobs. I would argue that in the next 5 years we \nwill see many, many, many more dots on this map as a result of the farm \nbill and private sector efforts that are going on across the country.\n  In the 2008 farm bill, we created the biobased program to develop and \nexpand markets for these biobased products. Here are a few examples: \nPapermate makes a biodegradable, retractable grip pen manufactured by \nSanford Newell Rubbermaid in Georgia. This pen is made from \nbiodegradable components that include an exclusive corn-based material \nto produce less waste and more compost.\n  Purell Advanced Green Certified Instant Hand Sanitizer is a green-\ncertified product made by a company in Ohio, containing ingredients \nfrom renewable resources. It kills more than 99.9 percent of most \ngerms. It is a product that is biodegradable.\n  Greenware Cold Portion Cups made by Fabri-Kal Corporation in Michigan \nare made from materials such as plant-based and post-consumer recycled \nresins. My colleagues will note that this looks familiar because it is \nthe same kind of cup we use in the Senate. This is something we are \nusing and thereby supporting the biobased economy.\n  By including biobased manufacturing in the Biorefinery Assistance \nProgram\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\nwithin the energy title, we are expanding economic opportunities for \nfarmers by giving them new markets for crops to grow and we are \nsupporting cutting-edge manufacturing businesses that are making these \nproducts and creating these jobs.\n  We also have done other pieces that will strengthen this effort. I \nmight mention, though we don't have a picture of it with us on a chart, \none of the exciting things I am seeing in Michigan, as we bring \ntogether making things and growing things, is the extent to which our \nautomakers are using biobased products in the making of automobiles. So \nfor anyone who is buying a new Ford vehicle today--I sound like an \nadvertisement--but a new Ford vehicle or a great new Chevy Volt or a \nnumber of new great American-made vehicles we have today, we are \nsitting on seats made from soy-based foam. We have soybean in the \nseats. Soy-based foam was actually started over 80 years ago with Henry \nFord and has been something we have focused on, on and off, for 80 \nyears. But now it has become a major effort. A major company in \nMichigan called Lear is making these seats. They are biodegradable. \nThey are lightweight. We get better fuel economy. And as I often tell \nmy friends, if you get hungry, you get something to munch on.\n  So the truth is we are seeing huge advances. One may very well have \ncupholders in their car that have a corn-based or wheat-based or other \nkind of agricultural-based product in the plastic, rather than \npetroleum--another way to get off of foreign oil. They are \nexperimenting with tires, rather than using petroleum in tires. I think \nthere is an explosion here of opportunity for innovation with our \nfarmers and our manufacturers, with our universities, our scientists. \nIt is very exciting, and it is part of the next generation for us of a \nnew economy and new jobs. This farm bill strengthens that effort, \nworking with the private sector, to help us rapidly move forward on \njobs.\n  One of the other ways we support efforts to create and then the \ncommercialization of products, to be able to move forward as it relates \nto creating, producing more products and so on, is to give consumers a \nway to find these products. So we have something called the USDA \nCertified Biobased Product label.\n  The mission of the BioPreferred Program is to develop and expand \nmarkets for biobased products through preferred Federal purchases of \nbiobased products across the Federal Government and a voluntary \nlabeling program to raise consumers' awareness and to help make sure we \nknow that what we are buying is, in fact, a biobased product. Since the \nprogram was created in the last farm bill in 2008, there are now 64 \ndifferent categories of biobased products and almost 9,000 products--\n9,000 products--approved for preferred Federal purchases. It is in \neverybody's best interests for us to be encouraging these new markets, \nencouraging innovation, and at the same time addressing other critical \nneeds for our country, including getting off of foreign oil. In \naddition, another 430 products from 150 companies have been certified \nto carry the USDA Certified Biobased Product label. So this is \nimportant. And there are new efforts happening. The President, the \nSecretary of Agriculture, and I have come together to urge, in fact, \nthat we increase the amount of biobased labeling that is going on and \nmake sure that consumers are looking for this label.\n  We then have the Biorefinery Assistance Program which is a very \nimportant piece of all of this. The Biorefinery Assistance Program was \noriginally created in the 2002 farm bill to support the development and \nconstruction of demonstration-scale biorefineries to determine the \ncommercial viability of some of the processes that are involved in \nconverting renewable biomass to advanced biofuels. It also guarantees \nloans for companies that are developing, constructing, or retrofitting \ncommercial-scale biorefineries using these new technologies. In the \nlast 2 years, companies participating in this effort have created \nnearly 300 direct jobs, and it is estimated that as this program is \nwritten into the 2012 farm bill, it will help these innovative \nbusinesses hire another 450 people as well.\n\n  We also expand eligibility for the program to include biobased \nmanufacturing. This is a very important piece of this bill. We are now \ngoing from refineries, talking about advanced biofuels, to expanding \nthe opportunity for tools for our biobased manufacturers within the \nrubric of the energy title and the focus on jobs.\n  We are talking about loan guarantees for companies to leverage \nprivate dollars. So for just over $400 million in loan guarantees, we \nhave leveraged $1.5 billion in private dollars to help companies with \nthe cost of retrofitting and building new commercial biofuels plants. \nWhen operational, these facilities are expected to produce 113 million \ngallons of advanced biofuels and generate almost 25 million kilowatt \nhours of renewable energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an \nestimated 600,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide which, by the way, is \nthe equivalent of taking 11,000 cars off the road. I have a little bit \nof a mixed feeling about that. Actually, we would much prefer to do it \nthis way and keep great new advanced vehicles on the road.\n  In 2011, the USDA awarded $6.9 million in grants and $13.1 million in \nloan guarantees to 17 anaerobic digester projects--here we are talking \nabout waste on the farm and turning it into energy--which will create \nenough energy to power 10,000 homes.\n  There are so many opportunities for us, whether it is animal waste, \nfood waste. We have a facility in Michigan that will be opening in the \nfall that is up by Gerber Baby Food. We are the international home of \nGerber Baby Food in Fremont, MI. There is a new biobased facility \nopening that will use all the food waste to generate energy--\nelectricity--for the northwestern area of Michigan. There are so many \nopportunities for us right now, using, again, food waste, byproducts \nfrom agriculture, and so on, where we can blend those together and \ncreate jobs and get us off of foreign oil.\n  The Biorefinery Assistance Program has helped build seven first-of-\ntheir-kind biorefineries to produce advanced biofuels in States from \nFlorida to Oregon, Michigan to New Mexico. One of the companies, called \nINEOS New Plant Bioenergy, has just begun commissioning their plant in \nIndian River County, FL, which will use citrus and other municipal \nsolid waste to produce 8 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol every \nyear and 6 megawatts of renewable electricity. They have over 100 \npeople working on the job, completing this first-of-a-kind plant, using \n85 percent U.S.-manufactured equipment, by the way, for the facility.\n  There is so much. I could spend a long time going through all of the \nexciting efforts going on, literally from the east coast to the west \ncoast, North and South, where creative entrepreneurs are coming \nforward, with support from the USDA to be able to get them through what \nis often called the valley of death, as they have a great idea but are \ntrying to get it to commercialization, and efforts that are leveraging \nprivate dollars and public dollars to be able to have these companies \nmove forward into full commercialization. Then they can create jobs, \ncreate renewable energy, get us off of foreign oil or create other \nkinds of products--all kinds of opportunities for us around products.\n  That leads me to another important piece, which is R, which is \nalways a very important part of what needs to be done as we are looking \nat these new ideas. Entrepreneurs, companies large and small, many \nsmall businesses--in fact, most of them start as small businesses with \na great idea, and they are looking for how to turn that into a great \nbusiness, and hiring people, and so on. The Biomass Research and \nDevelopment Initiative is an integral component to bridging the gap \nbetween technology development and commercialization. As I said, this \nis often called the valley of death. If you are somebody out there who \nis an entrepreneur with a great idea, how do you actually convince \nsomebody to invest in it so you can move forward? Nearly $133 million \nin grants was provided through the research and development effort from \n2003 to 2010 and they helped leverage $61 million in private \ninvestment.\n  One of the great success stories among many comes out of Wisconsin. \nWe heard about this during one of our farm bill hearings when Lee \nEdwards, CEO of Virent Energy, came in to tell us about the great work \nhis company is doing. They were awarded a grant as\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\nseed money to develop their technology with the University of \nWisconsin. Virent now has over 120 employees and plans to expand again \nafter receiving a contract from Coca-Cola to develop a 100-percent \nplant-based bottle for its carbonated beverages. Virent's technology is \nfeedstock-neutral and produces drop-in jet fuel and renewable \nchemicals. Their corporate partners include Cargill, Coca-Cola, and \nShell.\n\n  We also have the Biomass Crop Assistance Program, which helps farmers \nand ranchers who want to plant energy crops for biomass that would be \nconverted to biofuels or bioenergy. In 2011, this program supported \nbetween 3,000 and 4,000 jobs.\n  Our investment in the BCAP could result in companies hiring--in this \nfarm bill, we are told--between 2,000 and 2,600 additional new \nemployees. We have also addressed issues around collection, harvest, \nstorage, and transport to address problems that had occurred in the \nlast farm bill.\n  This program provides financial assistance to owners and operators of \nagricultural and nonindustrial private forest land as well. I have not \ntalked a lot about forest land, but certainly biomass efforts--what has \nbeen done around forest by-products--are very important as well.\n  Steve Flick of Show Me Energy received the first BCAP project area, \ncovering approximately 50,000 acres in 38 counties in Missouri and \nKansas. Individual farmers within the boundaries of the project area \ncan now sign contracts with the USDA to grow dedicated energy crops. \nThis is another provision we have in the bill. Show Me's plant in \nCenterview currently pelletizes crops into biomass fuel for space heat \nand electric power. This technology will eventually provide liquid \nfuels that can replace gasoline and diesel. Steve Flick also testified \nat our hearing in February.\n  I could go on and on with examples. We have a very exciting project I \nvisited not long ago in Alpena, MI, in the northeastern part of the \nState, which is a plant working with a paneling company that makes \ndecorative panels, doing beautiful paneling work with 100-percent wood \npaneling. They are now taking what used to be waste that they sent to a \nwaste treatment facility and pumping it right next door to a new \ncompany that is creating cellulosic ethanol. And they are now looking \nfor other products. One of them will be a new green biodegradable \neffort to de-ice runways. So there are all kinds of possibilities.\n  What I am excited about is that this farm bill is focused on small \nbusinesses, farmers, ranchers, working with the forestry industry. How \ndo we grow the economy by taking the two great strengths that have \ncreated the middle class of this country--growing things and making \nthings? That is what this title is about; that is what this bill is \nabout.\n  I am anxious to get us through this process so we can complete this \nbill and get on to the next generation of jobs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, first, let me thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan for her extraordinary leadership on a milestone \nbill. I am so proud to be supporting this bill and to be in this \nChamber speaking with her on issues that affect every American, not \njust farmers or those in States that may be recognized as farm States. \nThe kind of leadership that has just been heard, I think, is a model \nfor all of us, and I thank her.\n\n\n                              S.J. Res. 37\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk today about two issues that directly \naffect the health and safety of Americans of all ages, but particularly \nour seniors, and begin by associating myself with the remarks made \nearlier by Senators Whitehouse and Boxer with respect to S.J. Res. 37.\n  I strongly oppose efforts underway to roll back Clean Air Act \nprovisions that are critical to the health and safety and well-being of \nevery man, woman, and child in this country.\n  Last December, the EPA finalized a rule aimed at reducing mercury and \nother toxic emissions from electric-generating units by about 90 \npercent. This rule affects the most toxic emissions in the United \nStates--mercury, acid gas, nickel, selenium, cyanide. These rules are \nmore important than ever.\n  The effort to roll them back should be resisted and rejected, and I \nhope my colleagues will join with me in opposing the Senate joint \nresolution that would not only stymie but stop efforts to protect \nAmericans against the most toxic emissions.\n  I fought for these kinds of protections as attorney general. In fact, \nI took action as attorney general to compel these kinds of rules, and I \nbelieve the EPA is acting responsibly now in promulgating them.\n\n\n                    World Elder Abuse Awareness Day\n\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Kirk, for approving, Tuesday, a resolution designating \ntomorrow, June 15, as ``World Elder Abuse Awareness Day.''\n  The resolution Senator Kirk and I submitted, and that this body \nagreed to, recognizes the scourge that elder abuse represents here in \nAmerica and around the world. I thank my colleagues for supporting it \noverwhelmingly, and I thank the President of the United States for \nproclaiming tomorrow, June 15, as ``World Elder Abuse Awareness Day,'' \nand I thank Secretary Sebelius for announcing today that $5.5 million \nin funding for States and tribes will be available to test ways to \nprevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.\n  This initiative helps to implement the Elder Justice Act which was \nenacted as parted of the Affordable Care Act. I believe this kind of \ninitiative brings together in partnership local, State, and Federal \nauthorities and private groups to combat this epidemic.\n  The abuse of elders is a spreading epidemic. We have statistics that \nindicate how it is, in fact, spreading. Elder abuse incidents have \nincreased by 150 percent in the last 10 years alone. A recent study of \nthe GAO shows that every year 14 percent of all noninstitutionalized \nadults are victims of abuse or neglect or exploitation, whether it is \nphysical or financial or even sexual. So the statistics show a trend \nthat is undeniable--not only in the 2 million adults who are maltreated \nevery year but in the $2.9 billion taken from older adults each year as \na result of financial abuse and exploitation. That is $2.9 billion \nevery year taken from older Americans.\n  But the statistics only tell a fraction of the story because the fact \nis only 1 out of every 44 incidents of financial abuse is reported. Mr. \nPresident, 43 out of 44 incidents are unreported. In fact, of all \nincidents of abuse, 22 out of 23 are unreported. And the reasons are \ndiverse. They may be because of shame, embarrassment. In fact, one of \nthe most common reasons for underreporting is that the victim is \nrelated to the perpetrator.\n  Sadly, shamefully, tragically, all too many victims of elder abuse \nsuffer at the hands of relatives. It may be a daughter or son. It may \nbe a brother or sister. All too often they are victims at the hands of \ncaregivers who are entrusted with their care, literally in positions of \ntrust for people who may suffer physically from debilitating illnesses \nor from dementia or other kinds of afflictions. So this population is \namong our most vulnerable, and we must take stronger steps to protect \nthem.\n  As attorney general, I sought to lead such efforts. In fact, \nConnecticut now has stronger measures against elder abuse, such as more \nthorough background checks as a result of these initiatives.\n  As a member of the Committee on Aging, I held a hearing in Hartford \nvery recently to document this spreading epidemic and the way it \naffects all of us--all of our relatives, all of our friends. It cuts \nacross all lines of geography, race, gender, even income group. So this \nepidemic must be stopped.\n  That is why this resolution is important in calling attention to the \nproblem. The President's proclamation enhances awareness, and I thank \nmy colleagues for their continued effort and their involvement in this \ncause.\n  What is required at the end of the day is more resources--more \nresources for law enforcement authorities who have such a critical role \nin protecting\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nthose who suffer from it, and deterring those who would commit it, and \nhaving partnerships among State, local, and Federal authorities. Those \npartnerships must seek out and encourage greater reporting so that \nefforts can be taken to stop and deter it.\n  I will continue this battle. I thank my colleagues for joining me and \nfor agreeing to this resolution and for demonstrating that we care. We \ncare as a body and as an institution. It is not a Republican or \nDemocratic issue. It is truly bipartisan because this generation has \nworked hard, accumulated savings, counted on security, and is depending \non us, trusting us for their safety. We know the number in this age \ngroup will only grow--in fact, double--within the next years. That is \nwhy we must address it. I thank, again, my colleagues for doing so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4174-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4174-S4181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF MARI CARMEN APONTE TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND \n PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF EL \n                           SALVADOR--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session.\n  The motion to proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which \ncloture was not invoked on Executive Calendar No. 501 is agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider is agreed to, and there will now be 30 minutes of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to address and \nadvocate for the nomination of an extraordinary woman, a qualified, \ntalented Latina, Mari Carmen Aponte, to be the U.S. Ambassador to El \nSalvador.\n  Over 2 years ago I first chaired the nomination hearing for \nAmbassador Aponte to serve as President Obama's Ambassador to El \nSalvador, to San Salvador. The reality is that as a member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, I found her to be an exceptional \ncandidate. Last November I chaired yet another hearing for Ambassador \nAponte, and then last December this Chamber met to vote on her \nconfirmation. In addition to last year's vote, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has held a series of meetings to consider her nomination. \nFrankly, I have not seen any nominee forced to go through such an \narduous and drawn-out confirmation process as Ms. Aponte.\n  Let me talk about her record. Mari Carmen Aponte is a respected \nAmerican diplomat who has been on the job and has served this Nation \nwith distinction. During the 15 months Ambassador Aponte was sworn in \nas the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, she impressed the diplomatic \nestablishment with her professionalism and won the respect of parties \nboth on the right and the left in El Salvador. She has won the respect \nof civilian and military forces. She has won the respect of the public \nand private sectors. She has won everyone's support and fostered a \nstrong U.S.-Salvadorian bilateral relationship that culminated with \nPresident Obama announcing El Salvador as one of only four countries in \nthe world and the only country in Latin America chosen to participate \nin the Partnership for Growth Initiative.\n  Most importantly, Ambassador Aponte has been an advocate for American \nnational security and democratic values. As a result of her advocacy, \nEl Salvador is again a key ally in Central America. Its troops were the \nonly ones from a Latin American country fighting aside American troops \nin both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  As a result of her negotiating skills, the United States and El \nSalvador will open a new jointly funded electronic monitoring center \nthat will be an invaluable tool in fighting transnational crime.\n  Before that period of time in which she had a recess appointment, \nAmbassador Aponte had been the Executive Director of the Puerto Rican \nFederal Affairs Administration. In 2001 she had served as a director at \nthe National Council of La Raza, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund. She presided over the Hispanic Bar Association of the \nDistrict of Columbia and the Hispanic National Bar Association.\n  This is a record of success. It is a record of honor. It is a record \nof diplomatic and political distinction. It is a record of a dedicated, \nqualified, experienced, and engaged American diplomat, a 15-month \nrecord that brought our nations together. What more could we ask? What \nmore should we ask?\n  Finally, I will simply say that I believe the statements that have \nbeen used by some against Ambassador Aponte are baseless. As someone \nwho personally reviewed her record, as someone who personally looked at \nall of the files, I believe there is absolutely nothing to prevent \nAmbassador Aponte from being confirmed by the Senate. It is my hope, \nwith having had the whole history of her tremendous service and all of \nthe issues vetted, that today the Senate will take a vote that will \nconfirm an incredibly qualified person who has a long history of \ntremendous service to the Hispanic community in this country, to our \nNation, and who did an exceptional job in the 15 months she was \nappointed by President Obama during a recess appointment as the \nAmbassador to El Salvador. She served the national interests and \nsecurity of the United States very well.\n  We have had an incredible period of time in which we have had no \nAmbassador confirmed there. That sends the wrong message to a country \nthat is willing to embrace its relationship with the United States in \nCentral America, in the midst of other countries that are not as \nfriendly to the United States. We need to confirm an Ambassador, send \nher there, and have her continue the work she was doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that any time in which there is a quorum call \nbe equally divided against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise to speak about Mari Carmen Aponte, \nthe President's nominee to be Ambassador to El Salvador.\n  Those of us who have had the privilege of being here for some period \nof time--Senator Inouye has been here almost 50 years; I have been here \nfor 27; Senators Leahy, Lugar, Baucus, and others have also served for \na significant period of time. Brief as my stay has been, never have I \nseen this institution behaving as it does today.\n  Certainly, ideology isn't new to the American political arena and \nideology isn't unhealthy. But in a Senate where the extraordinary \nmeasure of a filibuster has become an ordinary expedient, where Senate \nprocedure is used as a political tool to undermine almost every \nproposal by the President and his Democratic colleagues, I think we all \nneed to take a long, hard look at our priorities.\n  One priority that is staring us in the face is to work for the swift \nconfirmation of Ms. Aponte. El Salvador has been without a U.S. \nAmbassador for 5 months. And I would ask colleagues how does this serve \nour national security or economic interests? El Salvador is the only \nLatin American country to send troops to Afghanistan. It is an \nincreasingly important partner on counternarcotics and trade. Right \nnow, more than 300 U.S. companies are operating on its soil. Bottom \nline: We are long overdue in bringing Ms. Aponte's nomination to a vote \non the floor.\n  I have said before--and I repeat today--that the Senate should not \nhold Ms. Aponte hostage to the partisan infighting that has consumed \nour politics. It should allow her the right to a full appointment as \nAmbassador, given the commendable job she has already done in that \ncapacity.\n  Let's review the facts because I think there has been some confusion \nhere. Ms. Aponte has already received three high-level security \nclearances from national security experts in our government. Let me \nrepeat. After three separate and thorough reviews, our national \nsecurity experts gave Ms. Aponte the green light to represent our \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\n  We have been down this road many times. Senators have reviewed Ms. \nAponte's FBI file for themselves. Along with the administration, I have \nsought repeatedly and in good faith to address the concerns of some of \nmy colleagues. The administration even offered high-level briefings, \nbut their offers were turned down. To continue addressing patently \npartisan concerns about her personal background, in my judgment, would \nbe counterproductive.\n  So let's talk about her accomplishments. Ms. Aponte will bring \nintelligence, diligence, and broad experience to this important \nresponsibility. Prior to serving as Ambassador, she was a practicing \nattorney for over 30 years. She has been a proud champion of Hispanics \nin the United States and is a highly respected leader within the Puerto \nRican community on the mainland.\n  Ms. Aponte served a recess appointment as Ambassador to El Salvador \nuntil the end of the last congressional session. During her \napproximately 16-month tenure, Ms. Aponte served our country with \ndistinction. She did a tremendous job negotiating an agreement with the \nSalvadoran Government to open a new bilateral initiative to fight \ntransnational crime. She aggressively promoted initiatives to remove \nconstraints on economic growth in El Salvador and brought together the \nU.S. and Salvadoran Governments to sign a comprehensive Partnership for \nGrowth Joint Action Plan. These aren't small achievements.\n  But you don't need to take my word for it. Just ask the eight former \nForeign Ministers from El Salvador who wrote to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in support of her nomination. Their position on Ms. Aponte is \ncrystal clear:\n\n       Her endeavors are very valued in all segments of political, \n     social and economic centers. There is no doubt that \n     Ambassador Aponte will continue to find areas of common \n     interest to build consensus not only between the United \n     States and El Salvador, but will also continue to collaborate \n     towards the strengthening of our institutions and will \n     support the ongoing development process of our country.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Mr. President: Thomas Jefferson used to say that he could ``never \nfear that things will go far wrong where common sense has fair play.'' \nMs. Aponte has already demonstrated that she was a superb Ambassador to \nEl Salvador. She deserves to be sent back, where she will represent our \ncountry with distinction. All we need to do now is allow our narrow \ninterests to yield to the national interest and give common sense fair \nplay.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 San Salvador,\n\n                                                November 11, 2011.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators: The undersigned are all former Ministers of \n     Foreign Relations of the Republic of El Salvador, covering \n     various Administrations lead by different political parties \n     until 2009. We write this letter in support of the \n     confirmation of Mari Carmen Aponte as United States \n     Ambassador to El Salvador.\n       As experienced diplomats, we have closely watched \n     Ambassador Aponte's work since her arrival. She came to El \n     Salvador at a critical, delicate and politically complicated \n     time. With the first FMLN government in power after the armed \n     conflict, there was uncertainty as to which direction the \n     country would take. Ambassador Aponte immediately commenced \n     an even-handed and balanced approach, reaching out to all \n     sides of the political spectrum. Systematically, she gained \n     key players trust and since then, has consistently brought \n     the government, private sector and civil society to the table \n     on a myriad of issues, and has worked to cement a stronger \n     democracy built on free market. El Salvador has experienced a \n     very successful political transition and her impartial \n     efforts have contributed to this goal.\n       With very minor exceptions, one can hear in our capital in \n     private conversations as well as read in opinion and press \n     articles the deep sense of respect and confidence Ambassador \n     Aponte enjoys in our country. Her endeavors are very valued \n     in all segments of political, social and economic centers. \n     There is no doubt that Ambassador Aponte will continue to \n     find areas of common interest to build consensus not only \n     between the United States and El Salvador, but will also \n     continue to collaborate towards the strengthening of our \n     institutions and will support the ongoing development process \n     of our country.\n       We urge you to confirm her appointment as U.S. Ambassador \n     to El Salvador. We are also grateful if you could share this \n     letter with all the members of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n         Marisol Argueta de Barillas; Jose Manuel Pacas Castro; \n           Fidel Chavez Mena; Alfredo Martinez Moreno; Francisco \n           E. Lainez; Oscar Alfredo Santamaria; Maria Eugenia \n           Brizuela de Avila; Ramon Gonzalez Giner.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am urge that the Senate confirm the \nnomination of Mari Aponte to be the Ambassador to El Salvador. She has \nbeen waiting in the aisle too long, and I hope she will be able to \nrenew her old job.\n  She was an exemplary nominee of whom the Puerto Rican community, and \nHispanics in general, can feel proud. She is an excellent Ambassador.\n  President Obama recess-appointed her as an Acting Ambassador to El \nSalvador in 2010, and she has served with distinction. That is why she \nwill be confirmed today.\n  During her time as Acting Ambassador, Ms. Aponte was an outspoken \nadvocate for American values and democracy and a staunch supporter of \nthe U.S. private enterprise. She persuaded the government of El \nSalvador to deploy troops to Afghanistan. El Salvador is the first and \nonly Latin American country to send military forces to join our NATO \ndeployment. That says it all.\n  She reached an agreement with the Salvadoran Government to open a \nnew, jointly-funded electronic monitoring center to fight transnational \ncrime. She has already proved her strengths and qualifications on the \njob. That is what she has already done.\n  She has the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and \ncountless local and national Latino organizations around the country. \nThey are very proud of her--as they should be. I am proud of her.\n  President Obama supported her and, to his credit, the Obama \nadministration did a lot of heavy lifting to get her confirmed.\n  White House staff worked diligently for the past month to round up \nevery vote possible. Secretary Clinton personally called Senators this \nweek, Democrats and Republicans, to support this Aponte nomination. I \ncommend Senator Menendez for his tireless leadership on this issue. It \nis high time the United States has a Senate-confirmed Ambassador to El \nSalvador, our ally.\n  I also wish to express my appreciation to my Republican colleagues \nwho dropped their unwarranted opposition and will help us confirm this \nwell-qualified nominee. I am sorry for her and the country that El \nSalvador has been without someone doing advocacy for our country within \nEl Salvador. That will not happen anymore. She will be able to go to \nwork tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nthe remaining time before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, we are about to vote--what I hope will \nbe a positive vote--to send a message to the people of El Salvador that \nwe appreciate their positive engagement with the United States, at a \ntime in which many Central and Latin American countries have taken a \ndifferent view.\n  This is a country that has been engaged with us on the whole issue of \nnarcotic trafficking and has sent their sons and daughters to fight \nalongside us, and they have shown a willingness to engage in democracy \nand the rule of law.\n  We have an incredibly qualified American of Latina descent, Mari \nCarmen Aponte. She is someone who has served with distinction for 15 \nmonths. I\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\nassume the absence of voices to the contrary in the Chamber up to this \ntime speaks volumes of the process we have had and the opportunity in \nwhich we are about to engage.\n  It is my hope that we will see a strong bipartisan vote on behalf of \nAmbassador Aponte and send her back to El Salvador to get back to work \nfor the United States and our collective interests.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order and pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     Mari Carmen Aponte, of the District of Columbia, to be \n     Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United \n     States of America to the Republic of El Salvador.\n         Harry Reid, John F.

Madam President, in a moment I am going to propound a \nunanimous consent request. Before I do, I would like to say what it is \non so people will understand the time and effort that has gone into \ngetting legislation passed. I am referring now to S. 3268.\n  When John Glenn retired from this body, that left me as kind of the \nlast acting commercial pilot. Consequently, I ended up getting a lot \nmore of the complaints and problems within the FAA and the way \naccusations are made and enforcement actions are taken. I have gone to \nbat for a lot of these people when I believed there was really a \nfairness problem.\n  It was not until I had an experience, a personal experience, that I \nrealized the depth of the problem. It is very hard for people in this \nroom to understand. If you have been, as I have been, a private pilot, \ncommercial pilot, and flight instructor for 55 years, what it would \nmean to have that license taken away from you if that were merely at \nthe whim of some enforcement officer in the field. I think all of us \nknow--when I was mayor of Tulsa, now and then we had a few police \nofficers who could not handle the authority. It happens all the time. \nCertainly we hear about it with enforcement actions brought about by \nthe FAA.\n  What happened to me, and I will share this with you--I think it is \nvery important--I have probably more hours than most airline pilots \nhave and I was still active in aviation. I was flying down to the \nsouthern part of Texas, the furthest south part of Texas, way down by \nBrownsville, to Cameron County Airport. Papa India Lima is the \nidentifier for it. In this effort, with several passengers with me, I \nwas going by the controllers. This is what you do not have to do but I \nalways do for safety purposes. I went through the Corpus Christi \napproach control. He handed me off to the Valley approach control. I \nwas going into a field that was uncontrolled, so the only control is \nthe Valley approach control. They are watching on a screen, and they \nhave all the information they need to direct you and authorize you to \ndo things. They are looking for traffic and you are squawking, so they \nknow exactly where you are, how high you are, and all the things that \nare happening. Again, you don't have to do that. On this day in \nOctober, a year ago October, I did not have to do it, but I did it \nanyway.\n  As I approached--the wind is always out of the south down there. The \nrunway is 1 3--that coordinates with 130 degrees. When I was on about--\nI would have to go back and listen again to the voice recorder--about a \n2- or 3-mile final to runway 1 3, the controller said: Twin Cessna 115 \necho alpha, you are cleared to land runway 1 3.\n  When you do this, you dirty up your plane so you can land. This \nhappens to be a pretty sophisticated twin-engine plane; you have to let \nthe flaps down and gears down and all that stuff. You get to the point, \nif you have a full plane, beyond which you cannot go around. When I \ncame in to make a landing, I did not see X on the runway because it was \nnot very prominent, but nevertheless there was one there. But there \nwere some workers on the far east side of the runway. This was a 8,000- \nor 9,000-foot runway. I only needed 2,000 or 3,000 feet. So I went over \nthe workers and I landed. Immediately they got upset that I landed.\n  A lot of people, because I am a Member of the U.S. Senate, started \ncalling the New York Times and the Washington Post. They had a \nwonderful time with this. I started looking at it and talking to the \npeople who do the enforcement action. I have to say they were good, and \nthey were responding to a lot of hysterical people, frankly, who did \nnot like me. So they came with an enforcement action against me which \nmerely was to go around the pattern with a CFI, a flight instructor. So \nI did this. I am also a flight instructor. I had given him his license, \nas a matter of fact. I went through this procedure, and everything was \nfine.\n  However, the problem was this: I was denied access to the information \nthey were going to use against me. When I told them that I was cleared \nto land by the controller, it took me, a U.S. Senator, 4 months to get \nthe voice recording to prove I was right.\n  Second, there is a thing called Notices to Airmen. NOTAMS are \nsupposed to be published every time there is work on a runway. Pilots \nare supposed to have access to NOTAMS. You look through your resources, \nas I always do, to see if there are NOTAMS on the runways where I land. \nWhen I go back on\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\nweekends, normally I will fly--gosh, I will be at five or six different \ntowns, but I look up the NOTAMS on all the towns. I had done that. \nThere were no NOTAMS on Cameron County Airport. We checked afterward. \nWe could never find any. No one says there were NOTAMS now. So, No. 1, \nI was clear to land, and No. 2, there were no NOTAMS that were \npublished.\n  What they could have done--they could have very well done is taken my \nlicense away. It doesn't mean much to people who are listening to me \nright now because you are not pilots, but it means a lot to the 400,000 \nmembers of the AOPA who are watching us right now and to the 175,000 \ngeneral aviation pilots with the EAA, Experimental Aircraft \nAssociation, who are watching us right now. They know that they, at the \nwhim of one bureaucrat, could lose their licenses.\n  Anyway, I came back and drafted legislation. I have to say this was \nway back a year ago now--July 6 of 2011. I introduced a bill with 25 \ncosponsors that would do three things:\n  No. 1, it would let the accused have access to all relevant evidence \nwithin 30 days prior to a decision to proceed with an enforcement \naction.\n  No. 2, it would allow the accused to have access to the Federal \ncourts. As it is right now, the National Transportation Safety Board--\nit goes to them, and they rubberstamp whatever the FAA does. In fiscal \nyear 2010, there were 61 appeals, and of those only 5 were reversed. Of \nthe 24 petitions in 2010 seeking review for emergency determinations, \nonly 1 was granted and 23 were denied. It is a rubberstamp. Everybody \nknows it. Ask any pilot you can find, and they will tell you that is \nwhat it is.\n  This way, they would have access to the Federal courts. It is not \ngoing to happen because I can assure you, that inspector in the field, \nthe enforcement officer in the field is not going to put his reputation \non the line knowing that someone is going to be looking at it with a \nsense of fairness. The district court doesn't have to know anything \nabout piloting an airplane, it is just a fairness issue.\n  In my case, they would have looked at this and said: Wait, you are \ncleared to land by the FAA, and there are no NOTAMS published. What did \nyou do wrong?\n  I did nothing wrong.\n  They would make sure flight station communications are available to \nall airmen. They are supposed to be. But if it took me 4 months--and I \nam a U.S. Senator--to get a voice recording to show I was cleared to \nland at this airport, what about somebody who is not a Senator? What \nabout somebody who would be intimidated to the point he would lose his \nlicense?\n  The second thing this does is it forces the NOTAMS--Notices to \nAirmen--to be put in a place where they are visible, a central \nlocation.\n  The third thing. If you talk to the aircraft owners and the pilots \nassociation, of all the problems that they get called to their \nattention, 28 percent of all the requests for assistance received by \nthem relate to the medical certification process. In other words, \nsomeone might lose his medical and then find he has corrected any kind \nof physical problem and wants to get it back, and he gets it back. \nHowever, if he happens to live in a different town and there are \nhundreds of doctors around to do this, there is no uniformity to it.\n  So it sets up a process or helps facilitate setting up a process by \nhaving general aviation, having the FAA, having the NTSB, having anyone \nwho is relevant and interested in this to look at and coordinate the \nmedical certification process.\n  That is essentially it. I am prepared to go into a lot of detail. I \nknow I now have 66 cosponsors in this body. I could have had a lot \nmore; we quit after we got two-thirds. I think everyone knows that is \nnormally what you do. I do know we may have one objection to this \nunanimous consent request, but I am going to make it now.\n  As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 422, S. 3268, \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, \nfirst of all, I know this bill is very important to the Senator who is \noffering it. I understand that, and I respect the Senator. He is a good \nSenator. But my objection is not based so much on what he said, it is \nbased on the whole concept of public safety.\n  This is about public safety. We should not have to worry that \npotentially unqualified pilots are in the air. We have so many tens of \nthousands of airplanes in the air every hour of every day. This bill \nwould create a process which would be new which could result in the \nFederal Government being unable to pursue enforcement action because of \nthe limited resources. It is a fact of life these days. FAA has to cut \nway back. We are having to address other mandated priorities which are \nperhaps more important than this one. That could very well mean that \nthe FAA and the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board, which \nare ultimately responsible for making decisions about whether pilots \nhave violated aviation regulations, could be barred from taking actions \nto prevent unsafe pilots from continuing to fly. That is heavy water. \nThat could have serious safety consequences.\n  According to the FAA, in some cases which would typically warrant \nrevocation of a pilot's license, some unqualified pilots would be able \nto avoid losing their certificates by avoiding FAA prosecution of the \nmatter before the NTSB.\n  This bill, in closing, would stand the FAA's enforcement structure on \nits head. As a result, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me respond. This in no way has anything to do with \nsafety because we are talking--the first arbitrator is the FAA. That is \nnot what this is about at all. When we have had a chance to talk, as we \nhave to almost all the Senators in this body, we have talked about \nsafety. We bounced that off many people. We had a hearing at Oshkosh \nabout safety. I had the air traffic controllers support me on this. \nThey are the ones concerned with safety.\n  I would say I don't agree with the argument, but I respect the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I too object, along with Senator \nRockefeller. I have been on the National Transportation Safety Board, \nand I know well the kinds of cases that are pilots' license revocations \nand the NTSB process for appeals of those. I understand Senator \nInhofe's explanation for what happened with him and that he is in \nsomewhat of a disagreement with some of the reporting of that incident.\n  I also understand the Senator from Oklahoma's long-time record of \nbeing a pilot, and I respect that very much, but I am afraid that what \nhe is not taking into consideration is most certainly a safety issue.\n  We have tasked the FAA with air safety, and we have given them the \nresponsibility for revoking pilots' licenses when there is a need to do \nthat in their opinion, whether it be for a violation of landing on a \nrunway that has an X, which pilots know means that runway cannot be \nused at that time.\n  As happened with Senator Inhofe's case, he is saying that he had a \nclearance, but the X was there and the FAA cited him for that. They did \nnot revoke his pilot's license at all, yet he is coming forward with a \nbill that not only addresses some of his legitimate concerns, which I \nagree with. The FAA's expertise and its mission, which is given to it \nby Congress, is to provide for safety and to revoke a private pilot's \nlicense or commercial pilot's license or aviation mechanic's license. \nSenator Inhofe's bill that would allow pilots to not have to go through \nthe appellate process with the National Transportation Safety Board, \nwhich is the appellate authority, which also has the expertise and \nexperience to know when a revocation would be questionable or if the \nFAA was right. They have the pilots, they have the expertise to make \nthose decisions, and after the NTSB appeal, they then have the right to \ngo to Federal court if they so choose.\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\n  What Senator Inhofe's bill does is take away the NTSB portion of the \nappeals process. Let me say that I have offered to Senator Inhofe--\nbecause he knew I objected to this bill--to do everything in his bill \nthat he has addressed, including the openness, the requirement that an \nenforcement action that the FAA would grant the pilot all the relevant \nevidence in 30 days prior to a decision, that it would clarify the \nstatutory deference as it relates to NTSB. NTSB is not a rubberstamp at \nall. I think they have been fair with their expertise. The FAA has the \nresponsibility for aviation safety. Requiring the FAA to undertake a \nnotice to the Airmen Improvement Program, I think, is certainly \nlegitimate. Making flight service station communications available to \nall airmen is a legitimate piece of this legislation.\n  What I object to and have asked Senator Inhofe to let us work \ntogether to do is not to bypass NTSB, but to let the appellate process \ngo forward, and then at the end, if there is still a feeling of \nunfairness on the part of the pilot, that they would have access to the \nFederal courts. They can do that now.\n  So I think Senator Inhofe insisting on bypassing NTSB is holding up \nthe good parts of his bill because it is very important, in my opinion, \nthat we keep the expertise for safety in the skies where it is, in the \nFAA, the NTSB, and then go to the Federal courts if rights are \nviolated.\n  In 2011, the NTSB had 350 appeal cases for administrative law judges \nand the number was similar in 2010. Cases are typically disposed of in \n90 to 120 days, so there is not a long lag time in which the pilot \ndoesn't have the access to his or her license. The NTSB held 62 appeals \nhearings in 2011 and 36 cases went to the full board. The breakdown of \nthe cases was private pilots, 48 percent; airline mechanics or aviation \nmechanics, 13 percent; commercial pilots, 6 percent; air carriers, 8 \npercent; and medical with 25 percent.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I, as the relevant chairman and ranking \nmember on the Commerce Committee, have agreed to have a hearing on \nSenator Inhofe's bill so that this can be fully vetted, and most \ncertainly I have on many occasions offered to work with Senator Inhofe \nto get the notification requirements, the openness requirements--every \npart of his bill that would require reforms of the process for fairness \nto the pilots--I would agree with and work to help him pass. But I \nthink taking out the NTSB and going directly to Federal courts is not \nnecessary, and I think it will hurt aviation safety.\n  I also believe that a different, extraneous issue is that our Federal \ncourts are pretty clogged already and the Federal courts do not have \nthose with pilots' licenses on their staff clerkship rolls, to a great \nextent. Maybe they happen to be. But they don't have the familiarity \nwith the requirements of FAA and the issues that FAA looks at, and they \ndo have access to Federal courts in the end anyway. But I think the \nNTSB part is important so that the experienced pilots in the NTSB have \nthe appellate authority, as they do now, to decipher what happened with \nthe FAA and determine if fairness was given to the pilot. It is also to \nhelp determine if that pilot should continue to fly or if it would \nendanger aviation safety, which should not be the role of the Federal \ncourts.\n  So Senator Rockefeller and I do object. I hold my hand out to Senator \nInhofe to work with him on the notification and fairness issues in his \nbill, which I support. I just don't think bypassing the expertise of \nthe NTSB and adding another burden to the Federal courts where they do \nnot have the expertise is in anyone's best interest in this country, \nand I am happy to work with anyone who is interested in this issue and \nhope we can resolve it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think it would be redundant for me to \ngo back and repeat what I said before. The Senator from Texas talked \nabout the X on the runway. I made it very clear by the time you can see \nthe X on the runway when you are cleared to land and you have a \nsophisticated plane that is full of passengers, there is a point beyond \nwhich you can't go in terms of your plane is dirtied up making a go-\naround. Obviously it wasn't necessary because I had 7,000 empty feet to \ncome around, but that is not important because that is not the issue.\n  I recognize and respect Senator Hutchison in the fact that she was on \nthe NTSB, and I know that obviously is meaningful to her, as it is to \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  What we are dealing with here is we have a committee--and I have a \nlot of respect for the committee for which Senator Rockefeller is the \nchairman and Senator Hutchison is the ranking member, and this \ncommittee is the committee of jurisdiction.\n  Now, what did I do? I introduced this bill a year ago. I talked about \nit. We had 25 cosponsors at that time. We had endorsements from all \nover the country. We had the National Air Traffic Controllers \nAssociation come in. We sent out ``Dear Colleagues'' to talk to people. \nAgain, we sent a letter to the Commerce Committee that Senator \nHutchison was on at that time requesting a hearing. We had 32 \ncosponsors signing that letter, requesting a hearing, some of which \nwere on the Commerce Committee. Nothing happened.\n\n  On September 20, as the months go by, we made more requests. We \ntalked about this, and every time they said we are going to be doing \nthis. You finally get to the point where you have to go ahead and get \nit done. And that is why we have a rule XIV. I am not a \nParliamentarian, and I don't know exactly how things work.\n  I remember I had experience with this when I worked in the House of \nRepresentatives, that when something is bogged up in a committee we had \nwhat is called the discharge petition reform of 1994. It was considered \nby the Wall Street Journal, or perhaps Business Daily, as the single \ngreatest reform in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives. It \naddressed this same thing. It is a way of bottling up bills in \ncommittees so they could never have hearings and never be able to get \non the floor for a vote. That discharge petition reform became a \nreality, and now the light is shining and everything is great.\n  But when you have been trying to get a hearing before a committee for \na year and you have 66 cosponsors, you have to resort to whatever is \nout there available to you for a remedy. That remedy happens to be rule \nXIV. Rule XIV will allow me to do this, and with the two people holding \nthe bill up, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison, I will have no \nchoice but to file cloture and to go ahead and get a vote on this bill, \nrecognizing it takes a supermajority when you file cloture. So I would \ndo that.\n  I didn't think I would get into this or need to enter it into the \nRecord. I have an article which I will find here and will submit for \nthe Record. I think it is very important. It goes into detailed \ndocumentary cases where they have been unable to get fairness through \nthis system.\n  How many cases would ultimately go to the district court? I think \nvery few. The idea that there is going to be an opportunity for a pilot \nto take what he is accused of to the district court to see it in a \nsense of fairness has nothing to do with how many pilots are sitting on \nthat district court. It is a sense of fairness, and that is what they \ndeal with. The people in the district court system don't have expertise \nin all of these areas, but they can look at fairness. And I can tell \nyou in my case, if they had looked at that and said, wait a minute, the \nFAA has cleared him to land and there are no NOTAMs published, he \ndidn't do anything wrong. It finally gets to the point--and I have been \nvery patient. I have waited a whole year for this and finally I have \ncome to the point where I have flat given up, so I decided that we are \ngoing to have to do it this way since it is clearly the will of the \nSenate to pass this legislation.\n  So, with that, I have some things I want to have printed in the \nRecord. First of all, I have the sequence of events, the request that \nwe made of the Commerce Committee to hear this legislation.\n  I have an article that was in Pilot magazine by John Yodice, who is \nconsidered to be the single foremost legal authority in this area.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have both items printed \nin the Record.\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         S. 1335, Inhofe-Begich Pilot's Bill of Rights Summary\n\n\n              The Pilot's Bill of Rights Does Three Things\n\n       1. Makes the FAA Enforcement Process Fairer for Pilots--\n     Requires that in an FAA enforcement action against a pilot, \n     the FAA must grant the pilot all relevant evidence 30 days \n     prior to a decision to proceed with an enforcement action. \n     This is currently not done and often leaves the pilot grossly \n     uninformed of his violation and recourse. Eliminates the NTSB \n     rubber stamp review of FAA actions. Too often the NTSB, which \n     hears appeals from the FAA, gives wide latitude to the FAA, \n     making the appeals process meaningless. In FY10, of the 61 \n     appeals of FAA certificate actions considered by the NTSB, \n     only five were reversed. Of the 24 petitions seeking review \n     of emergency determinations considered by the NTSB, only one \n     was granted and 23 were denied. The bill clarifies the \n     deference NTSB gives to FAA actions. Allows for federal \n     district court review of appeals from the FAA, at the \n     election of the appellant. Makes flight service station \n     communications available to all airmen. Currently, the FAA \n     contracts with Lockheed Martin to run its flight service \n     stations. If a request is made for flight service station \n     briefings or other flight service information under FOIA, it \n     is denied to the requestor because Lockheed Martin is not the \n     government, per se. However, they are performing an \n     inherently governmental function and this information should \n     be available to pilots who need it to defend themselves in an \n     enforcement proceeding.\n       2. Improves the Notices to Airmen System--Requires the FAA \n     undertake a NOTAm Improvement Program, requiring \n     simplification and archival of NOTAMs in a central location. \n     The process by which Notices to Airmen are provided by the \n     FAA has long needed revision. This will ensure that the most \n     relevant information reaches the pilot. Non-profit general \n     aviation groups will make up an advisory panel.\n       3. Requires a Review of the Medical Certification Process--\n     The FAA's medical certification process has long been known \n     to present a multitude of problems for pilots seeking an \n     airman certificate. In fact, 28% of all requests for \n     assistance received by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots \n     Association relates to the medical certification process. The \n     bill requires a review of the FAA's medical certification \n     process and forms, to provide greater clarity in the \n     questions and reduce the instances of misinterpretation that \n     have, in the past, lead to allegations of intentional \n     falsification against pilots. Non-profit general aviation \n     groups will make up an advisory panel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Action on Pilot's Bill of Rights\n\n       July 6, 2011--Introduced Pilot's Bill of Rights with 25 \n     cosponsors and endorsements from Aicraft Owners and Pilots \n     Association and Experimental Aircraft Association.\n       July 11--National Air Traffic Controllers Association \n     endorses.\n       July 28--Dear Colleague from Begich and Pryor sent to \n     Democrats requesting cosponsorship.\n       July 30--Presented PBOR at OshKosh Airventure.\n       September 15--Sent letter (with 32 signatures) to Commerce \n     Committee requesting hearing.\n       September 20--EAA sends e-Hotline to members regarding \n     hearing request.\n       November 10--Roundtable event with Harrison Ford, endorses \n     PBOR.\n       November 17--Acquires 60th Cosponsor.\n       November 19--AOPA makes PBOR front-page story on website.\n       January 19, 2012--Staff meeting with Gael Sullivan \n     (Rockefeller), Jarrod Thompson (KBH), and Michael Daum \n     (Cantwell) to discuss committee consideration of PBOR (staff \n     requested hearing).\n       January 25--Sam Graves introduces H.R. 3816, a companion \n     measure.\n       March--AOPA publishes story highlighting Pilot's Bill of \n     Rights.\n       May 5--Acquires 66th cosponsor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         [From the AOPA Pilot]\n\n                  NTSB: An Impartial Forum for Pilots?\n\n                          (By John S. Yodice)\n\n       Under the Federal Aviation Act, the National Transportation \n     Safety Board functions as a court of appeals for pilots when \n     the FAA has suspended or revoked a pilot or medical \n     certificate. In our increasingly complex airspace system and \n     the more intensive regulation of our flying activities, no \n     pilot is immune. This appellate function is given to the NTSB \n     because it is independent of the FAA, and presumably able to \n     provide a fair and impartial forum for the hearing of such \n     appeals. Under the Act, an appealing pilot is entitled to \n     ``an opportunity for a hearing.'' It also provides that an \n     FAA order of suspension or revocation must be reversed if the \n     NTSB finds after a hearing that ``safety in air commerce or \n     air transportation and the public interest do not require \n     affirmation of the order.''\n       Decisions of the current NTSB cause us to question its \n     fairness and impartiality in pilot appeals. Many of these \n     decisions have been reported in this column, one as recently \n     as last month (``Pilot Counsel: No `Statute of Limitations,' \n     '' July AOPA Pilot). Here is another case that raises doubts.\n       The FAA ordered the suspension of a private pilot's \n     certificate for 30 days for piloting a Piper Cherokee 140 \n     into the Washington, D.C., Air Defense Identification Zone \n     (now the ``Special Flight Rules Area''). The FAA said that \n     the pilot failed to comply with the special security \n     procedures of the relevant notam, and was ``careless or \n     reckless'' in the operation. The pilot appealed the order of \n     suspension to the NTSB. He filed an answer to the FAA's order \n     admitting the inadvertent incursion, but defending that ``the \n     special procedures required pursuant to FDC notam 7/0206 are \n     unique, complex, and ambiguous.'' (To prove the pilot's \n     point, although it never came up in the case, there have been \n     thousands of such inadvertent incursions, as opposed to very \n     few, if any, intentional ones.) He also adamantly denied that \n     he was ``careless or reckless'' in his operation.\n       The result of the appeal to the NTSB was that the pilot was \n     denied a hearing to contest the FAA charges; he was denied a \n     waiver of the suspension even though he timely filed a report \n     with NASA under the Aviation Safety Reporting Program \n     (``Pilot Counsel: ASRP,'' June AOPA Pilot); and he wound up \n     with a ``careless or reckless'' violation on his public FAA \n     airman record.\n       This result was achieved by a series of procedural, \n     regulatory, and policy interpretations by the NTSB, all one-\n     sided. To start with, the NTSB has a procedural rule allowing \n     summary judgment, i.e., no hearing, if there are no factual \n     issues to be heard. (In my experience the only party \n     routinely granted summary judgment is the FAA, never the \n     pilot.) Based on the pilot's admission that he inadvertently \n     entered the ADIZ, the FAA moved for summary judgment, and the \n     board granted the motion. What the FAA and the board ignored \n     in denying a hearing were the three issues raised by the \n     pilot: one, that he was not ``careless or reckless;'' two, \n     that ``the special procedures required pursuant to FDC notam \n     7/0206 are unique, complex, and ambiguous;'' and three, that \n     he was entitled to a waiver under ASRP.\n       The FAA has a catchall regulation, FAR 91.13(a), that \n     provides: ``No person may operate an aircraft in a careless \n     or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of \n     another.'' In a one-sided interpretation, the NTSB has \n     written out of the rule the required element of proof that \n     life or property has been endangered. The pilot was never \n     afforded the opportunity to prove that there was no danger to \n     anyone or anything. In another one-sided interpretation of \n     the same rule, the board held that the ``careless or \n     reckless'' part of the charge is merely ``residual'' to the \n     ADIZ incursion charge and therefore does not warrant a \n     hearing.\n       The board rejected without serious discussion, the pilot's \n     defense that the security procedures are unique, complex, and \n     ambiguous. Apparently the board could not bring itself to \n     acknowledge that there could be something wrong with a rule \n     that is unintentionally violated by thousands of otherwise \n     law-abiding and safety-conscious pilots.\n       The pilot timely filed a report with NASA under ASRP that \n     should have entitled him to a waiver of the 30-day \n     suspension. Most pilots charged with inadvertent incursions \n     have been granted waivers. The board, although conceding that \n     the pilot raised this issue in his reply to the FAA's motion \n     for summary judgment, denied that this was an issue for \n     hearing because, technically, the pilot did not raise it in \n     his answer. Merely raising it in a different pleading filed \n     with the board was not sufficient.\n       Notice that every one of these issues, without exception, \n     went against the pilot and in favor of the FAA, all without \n     granting the pilot the hearing, which the Act contemplates, \n     to put on his side of the case. This case would not be so \n     remarkable if it stood alone, and not in context with the \n     many other cases we have seen, many of which we have \n     reported, in which the NTSB one-sidedly seems to favor the \n     FAA and disfavor pilots.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. He talks about the decision of the current NTSB calls \ninto question its fairness and impartiality in pilot appeals. And he \ntalks about all the notices that have gone out and the problems they \nhave had with this.\n  Of the 100,000 pilots who are interested in this today--actually, \nwell over that--but just those who are involved in this process right \nnow, they have had documented cases where the fairness is not there. \nThis would offer fairness, and that is all we are asking, just to be \ntreated as fairly as every other citizen in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on the point of the hearing, Senator \nRockefeller and I have agreed certainly with Senator Inhofe to hold a \nhearing, which we notified Senator Inhofe we would, and I expect it to \nbe next month for the hearing schedule. I just hope we can pass a good \npart of his bill, which I would like to work with him on, but I think \nthe motivation should be safety and assuring safety. I know the \npersonal conflict Senator Inhofe has with what happened to him, and I \nam sympathetic, but I don't think passing legislation that could hurt \nthe aviation safety community is the right approach to meet the \nobjections of Senator Inhofe.\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n  I would love to have a hearing and have all the witnesses he would \nput forward to get an objective look at what this would do to taking \nthe expertise and the mission from FAA and allow it to be bypassed at \nthe NTSB level and go to Federal courts where there is not the \nexperience and the aviation safety mission that is well protected \ntoday.\n  I hope we can work together on this. I understand the Senator's \nfrustration, but I don't think this is the right solution for what \nhappened to him with one incident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I am not aware that I was offered a \nhearing. But let me make sure I have in the Record, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a letter dated September 15, \n2011, which was 9 months ago, signed by 32 Members of this Senate, \nincluding the occupier of the chair right now, the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2011.\n     John D.

It currently has 32 cosponsors, 13 of which are \n     members of the Commerce Committee. With a majority of \n     committee members having already voiced their support for \n     this legislation, we respectfully request that you hold a \n     committee or subcommittee hearing and markup of this \n     legislation.\n       During the drafting of this legislation, Senator Inhofe \n     worked extensively with the Aircraft Owners and Pilot's \n     Association and the Experimental Aircraft Association, both \n     of which have strongly endorsed this bill, as well as private \n     aviation attorneys. It became clear during this process that \n     several common sense changes should be made to enhance the \n     relationship between the FAA and general aviation, and those \n     were incorporated into the bill.\n       First, the bill requires that in an FAA enforcement action \n     against a pilot, the FAA must grant the pilot all relevant \n     evidence, such as air traffic communication tapes, flight \n     data, investigative reports, flight service station \n     communications, and other relevant air traffic data 30 days \n     before the FAA can proceed in an enforcement action against \n     the pilot. This is currently not done and often leaves the \n     pilot grossly uninformed of his alleged violation and \n     recourse.\n       Second, the bill also allows for federal district court \n     review of appeals from the FAA, at the election of the \n     appellant, and states that the NTSB shall not grant deference \n     to the FAA in an appeal, should the pilot choose to go the \n     NTSB route. Both of these things are done because too often \n     the NTSB rubber stamps a decision of the FAA, giving wide \n     latitude to the FAA and making the appeals process \n     meaningless.\n       Third, this bill requires that the FAA undertake a Notice \n     to Airmen Improvement Program, requiring simplification and \n     archival of NOTAMs in a central location. The process by \n     which Notices to Airmen are provided by the FAA has long \n     needed revision. This will ensure that the most relevant \n     information reaches the pilot. Non-profit general aviation \n     groups will make up an advisory panel, which we believe will \n     give pilots a seat at the table when deciding how the NOTAM \n     system can be improved.\n       Fourth and finally, the FAA's medical certification process \n     has long been known to present a multitude of problems for \n     pilots seeking an airman certificate. The bill simply \n     requires a review of the FAA's medical certification process \n     and forms, to provide greater clarity in the questions and \n     reduce the instances of misinterpretation that have, in the \n     past, led to allegations of intentional falsification against \n     pilots. Non-profit general aviation groups, aviation medical \n     examiners, and other qualified medical experts will make up \n     an advisory panel to advise the Administrator, again giving \n     the right people a voice in the overall determination.\n       Again, we hope that you will schedule a hearing and markup \n     of this legislation that is extremely important to the \n     general aviation community. As many of us sit on your \n     committee, we look forward to being an active part of this \n     process.\n           Sincerely,\n         James M. Inhofe; John Hoeven; Jim DeMint; Roger F. \n           Wicker; Dean Heller; Pat Toomey; Joe Manchin III; Lisa \n           Murkowski; Mark Begich; Kelly Ayotte; Jerry Moran; \n           Lamar Alexander; Roy Blunt; John Boozman; Marco Rubio; \n           John Cornyn; Olympia J.

Pryor; Debbie Stabenow; Susan \n           M. Collins; Daniel Coats; Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't think anyone is going to say we \nhaven't done everything we could to go through the committee process to \nget a hearing. I just flat gave up. That is why we have this rule.\n  I will be looking forward to taking the next steps. I know there are \na lot of people out there who want to have this type of justice \nafforded the pilots of the United States of America, the same as every \nother citizen enjoys.\n  With that, I appreciate the patience of my colleagues, because I know \nwe have other business, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I rise to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Ending Veteran Housing Discrimination\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a \nterrible shortcoming in our housing discrimination laws and legislation \nwhich I have introduced and which I encourage the Presiding Officer to \nsign on to.\n  Last week, the Boston Herald reported that a veteran of Iraq and \nAfghanistan had been forced to file suit in Massachusetts because a \npolitical activist landlord allegedly discouraged him from renting \nbecause of his military background, claiming the situation would be \n``uncomfortable.''\n  This brave veteran brought his fight to the press and to the courts \nof Massachusetts, where State law makes it illegal to discriminate \nagainst veterans who are seeking housing. In Massachusetts, that is, in \nfact, the law. It is illegal. When I read this, I was angry, as I know \nthe Presiding Officer would be angry if it happened in his State. That \nthis could happen today is mind-boggling. So my staff and I started \nworking to see what we could do to right this wrong and see if it was \nsomething that was systemic throughout the country. We started digging \ninto this issue and found that when it comes to housing, it is \napparently not illegal--let me repeat that, it is apparently not \nillegal--under Federal law to discriminate against a veteran or a \nmember of our Armed Forces on the basis of their brave service to our \nNation.\n  Back when I was a State senator and State representative in \nMassachusetts, at the statehouse, we took action, as I referenced, to \nensure our veterans are protected, whether it is a welcome home bonus \nfor first- and second-time soldiers who have served, antidiscrimination \nreemployment or educational benefits. I could go on and on.\n  Quite frankly, I think Massachusetts does it better than any other \nState in the country. So it came as a surprise to learn that fewer than \none-half dozen States have similar protections. With tens of thousands \nof veterans returning home in the next few years and the size of our \nArmed Forces actually shrinking dramatically, now is clearly the time \nto fix the problem. I know the Presiding Officer as well does not want \nto hear more stories such as this one because I recognize how important \nthat issue is for the Presiding Officer.\n  No one who puts on the uniform of our Nation and serves should be \nfaced with discrimination. There is no one who should ever face that \ndiscrimination when they are trying to put a roof over their head and \nthe heads of their family. The idea that anyone would deny a home to \nsomeone who has put their life on the line for our freedom is, quite \nfrankly, un-American. It should be condemned by every Member of this \nbody.\n  In order to understand today's problem, however, we must go back to \n1968, when I was 9 years old, when one of my predecessors, Senator \nEdward Brooke, a great legislator from my home State of Massachusetts--\na gentleman whom I still speak with--helped author the Fair Housing Act \nwhich was signed into law by then-President Johnson. That civil rights \nlegislation broke new ground by banning housing discrimination on the \nbasis of race, color, religion or national origin. Another great \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Ted Kennedy, joined Senator Brooke \nin urging the bipartisan passage of that very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Then, in 1974, closer to the Presiding Officer, Senator Bill Brock of \nTennessee amended the act to prevent housing discrimination on the \nbasis of\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\ngender. Then, in 1988, Senator Kennedy extended the act's protections \nto those Americans with disabilities and families with children. Both \nof these expansions received broad bipartisan support and were actually \nsigned into law.\n  As Senator Brooke said 44 years ago:\n\n       Fair housing is not a political issue, except as we make it \n     one by the nature of our debate. It is purely and simply a \n     matter of equal justice for all Americans.\n\n  Well said by Senator Brooke 44 years ago.\n  Fair housing has a bipartisan history and we have a chance to do it \nagain. We can do it by protecting two additional groups from housing \ndiscrimination. My Ending Housing Discrimination Against Servicemembers \nand Veterans Act, S. 3283, is needed and it is needed right now. It \namends the Fair Housing Act to protect veterans and servicemembers from \nhousing discrimination.\n  By passing this bill right away, the Senate can say affirmatively and \nimmediately that veterans and servicemembers deserve the same rights to \nhousing as anyone else. This is a no-brainer. The Commander in Chief of \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States has endorsed my bill, \nas referenced for people looking on, saying:\n\n       Senator Brown's work to protect servicemembers and veterans \n     from housing discrimination is very positive. It is \n     unconscionable that members of our military and veterans \n     should fear not being able to rent or buy a home because of \n     their status as a veteran.\n\n  This bill will correct the issue.\n  By passing this bill right away, we can, once again, say to those \nveterans and servicemembers that they have our pride and respect. We \nneed the action right now. No veteran or servicemember should ever face \nthe indignity of being denied housing solely on the basis of their \nservice.\n  The Fair Housing Act of 1968 and Senator Kennedy's amendments in 1988 \npassed with overwhelming support. We should be able to do the same. I \nurge all my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation \nand work for its immediate and unanimous passage. It is time to fix \nthis shortcoming in our Nation's housing laws and it is, quite frankly, \nthe right thing to do.\n  I would like to also take this opportunity to wish the U.S. Army a \nhappy 237th birthday. I was honored to go to the cake-cutting last \nnight and honor those who have done so much for our great country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield back all postcloture time on the \nnomination of Mari Carmen Aponte.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Mari Carmen Aponte, of the District of Columbia, to be Ambassador \nExtraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to \nthe Republic of El Salvador?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nomination; that any statements related to the nomination be \nprinted in the Record; that President Obama be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4181-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, very quickly, that was the last vote today. \nIt appears we will have no votes tomorrow. But Senator Stabenow and \nSenator Roberts are working very diligently to come up with an \nagreement on the farm bill. We are going to have a vote Monday evening. \nWe have not decided exactly what that will be on. We have a number of \ndifferent alternatives. But we hope we can have common sense prevail \nand be able to come up with an agreement, if for no other reason than \nto recognize the hard work of the two managers of this bill.\n  It is so important we get this done. There are issues we are going to \nvote on, one of which Senator Kerry will talk about. There are relevant \namendments. We have a lot of them. We will agree to vote on those. We \nare trying to work out also the nonrelevant amendments, and we are not \nthere yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Aponte Nomination\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am grateful we finally have been able to \nget the nomination of Mari Aponte confirmed. I thank Senator Menendez \nfor managing for me.\n  I thank our colleagues in the Senate for finally getting our nominee \nin place and confirming her to be the Ambassador to El Salvador. I \nthink it is long overdue. She will do a terrific job, and I am grateful \nto colleagues that we finally have, in fact, confirmed this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I understand I can proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will do so, but I wish to speak with \nrespect to an amendment on the farm bill for when we get back to that.\n  I wish to call to the attention of my colleagues the fact that in \n2008, the farm bill's conferees inserted a provision that transfers \nauthority of the regulation of catfish, but only catfish--it was the \nonly particular item singled out to be transferred--from the Food and \nDrug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The \nprovision was not debated in either body. It is one of those things \nthat, as we all know, people have increasingly gotten incensed about in \nthe public as well as around here, in the Congress itself.\n  Because it was transferred over to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, the USDA subsequently published a proposal in order to \ncarry out the new mandate it had been given to regulate catfish. But \nthat proposal has remained, and properly so, stalled in the regulatory \nprocess. I say ``properly so'' because it serves no public interest, it \nis costly for taxpayers, and it is duplicative and confrontational with \nother entities that are engaged in that kind of oversight. As a result, \nit will invite trade retaliation abroad and put us on a train wreck, if \nyou will, of sort of excessive regulatory conflict.\n  Senator McCain and I have joined together, along with a bipartisan \ngroup of our colleagues, to offer an amendment, amendment No. 2199, to \nrepeal the 2008 catfish language. If we don't repeal it, the USDA is \ngoing to try to continue to proceed forward in this regulatory train \nwreck.\n  Let me give a little background. In February of 2011, the GAO cited \nthe proposed catfish regulatory program--cited it as part of its report \non those programs that were at high risk for waste, fraud, and abuse. \nThen, in March of 2011, the GAO again called this program duplicative \nas part of a totally separate report. Then, just last month, the GAO \nproduced an extensive and detailed analysis of why this program is not \nonly costly and duplicative but why it would have no food safety \nbenefit. If it is not going to have any food safety benefit, it is \ncostly, it is duplicative, the obvious question for all of us is: Why? \nWhat is going on here?\n  All of us care about jobs in our communities. Every State is always \nvying to find a way to try to guarantee that the jobs it has are \nprotected and that it is creating more jobs. We all understand that. So \nI don't have any animus against any particular Senator fighting to do \nthat. In this case, a number of catfish producers in the South managed \nto get protection that takes care of them but hurts a lot of other \nfolks in a lot of other parts of the country. So it may be good for \ncatfish producers in a few places in the South, but it is bad for \nconsumers in the United States generally because it raises costs, and \nit is very bad for seafood processors and for communities, in my State \namong others, but in other States in the country on the west coast and \neast coast. There are employers in my State that would like to process \nand distribute products that come from various other places, including \nabroad, and they\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\nought to be able to do so in a free market, in an open market that is \nnot protected and chopped up and diced and sliced in order to protect \npeople inappropriately. Playing protectionist games with the rules and \nregulations and agencies is bad public policy.\n  It is bad economic policy, particularly, and it is an invitation to \nour trading partners to do the same thing. And when they do it, we \ncomplain about it, and rightfully.\n  As Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, has pointed \nout:\n\n       U.S. agricultural products, including safe, high-quality \n     Montana beef, face unscientific trade restrictions in many \n     important markets. If we expect other countries to follow the \n     rules and drop these restrictions, it is critical that we \n     play by the rules and do not block imports for arbitrary and \n     unscientific reasons.\n\n  That is exactly what we are trying to undo with the amendment Senator \nMcCain and I are bringing to the farm bill. The only reason this bad \nidea that was codified in 2008 has not yet become an active program is \nthat--get this, Mr. President--the bill did not define the word \n``catfish.'' So as a result, for the last 4 years, lawyers, lobbyists, \npublic relations firms, foreign governments, legislators, and multiple \nCabinet officials have engaged in a definitional debate over what \nqualifies a fish to be called a catfish and, subsequently, fall into \nthis new regime.\n  Well, it turns out that whether a fish is or is not a catfish is \nsomething that experts can actually debate for hours, believe it or \nnot. It also turns out it does not matter because, according to the \nGAO, the FDA ought to retain jurisdiction over all fish, catfish and \nnoncatfish alike, and that is the simplest solution.\n  As I mentioned, apparently, you can debate forever about what kind of \nfish it is, and that is exactly what has been going on, as to whether \nit constitutes being a catfish. But this is very simple. The GAO put \nout a report in May of this year, and in the report the GAO could not \nhave been more clear. They made it about as simple as they could in \ntheir statement, saying:\n\n       Responsibility for Inspecting Catfish Should Not Be \n     Assigned to USDA.\n\n  A simple sentence. GAO, as we all know, gives nonpolitical \nassessments, is a watchdog, if you will, for the actions here in the \nCongress. In that report, they state:\n\n       The proposed program essentially mirrors the catfish \n     oversight efforts already underway by FDA and the National \n     Marine Fisheries Service. Furthermore, since FDA introduced \n     new requirements for seafood processing facilities, including \n     catfish facilities, in 1997, no outbreaks of illnesses caused \n     by Salmonella contamination of catfish have been reported. . \n     . . Consequently, if implemented, the catfish inspection \n     program would likely not enhance the safety of catfish but \n     would duplicate FDA and NMFS [National Marine Fisheries \n     Service] inspections at a cost to taxpayers.\n\n  So I think that is pretty clear-cut. We need to repeal the 2008 farm \nbill language related to catfish. We need to let the American consumer \ndecide from all of the safe food options that exist, let them decide \nwhat they want to consume. And, obviously, we have nothing specifically \nagainst catfish per se in any part of the country, and particularly the \njobs. We all want the jobs. But they should not come at the expense of \nanother part of the country, setting up a duplicative, completely \nwasteful, taxpayer-expenditure-duplicated program.\n  Mr. President, in addition to that, I want to say a quick word about \nanother amendment Senator Murkowski and I are sponsoring--my colleague, \nSenator Brown, is also a sponsor of it--and that is to resolve an \nimportant inequity that exists in the current law. We need to help \nprovide desperately needed disaster assistance to fishermen in \nMassachusetts and around the Nation. It is not just for Massachusetts.\n  I hope the managers of this legislation will let the bipartisan \namendment receive a vote during the Senate consideration of this \nlegislation. Everybody knows that in certain parts of New England and \nin places such as the State of Washington--I was out in Washington last \nweekend, in Seattle, they have a huge fishing industry--California, San \nDiego, various parts of the country, Louisiana, we have a lot of \nfishing. But, increasingly, those fishery resources are under pressure, \nand increasingly there is regulation in order to try to preserve the \nstocks.\n  So fishermen who have fished for a livelihood for a lifetime are \nbeing restricted in the numbers of days they can go to sea, restricted \nin the amount they can catch. People have lost homes. They have lost \nboats. Whole lives have been turned topsy-turvy because of conditions \nbeyond their control. Whether it is the ecosystem, Mother Nature, \nnobody knows, but it is no different from a drought in the Iowa \ncornfields or in other parts of the country. It is no different from a \ndisaster that takes place when crops are wiped out.\n  These folks are being wiped out. They are the farmers of the sea, the \nfarmers of the ocean, and they farm sustainably. But they need help. \nGloucester and New Bedford in Massachusetts are two of the largest \nfishing ports in our Nation, and the commercial fishing industry \nsupports about 83,000 jobs in the State and $4.4 billion in revenue. \nBut it is becoming harder and harder for these fishing families and for \nthe smaller boats to survive. These small boat fishermen, particularly, \nare part of the culture of our State and of our region, and we want to \ntry to preserve that.\n  Last fall, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration \nannounced a reversal in the most recent Gulf of Maine Cod Assessment. \nWithin 3 years of each other, two radically different stock assessments \nhave been issued--one saying the stocks are replenishing, another \nsaying they are disappearing. And fishermen are whipsawed between these \nstock assessments and are told different things. In one, they think \nthey can invest in their boats and in the future; in the next, they are \nbeing told: Sorry, folks, you are out of luck.\n  Well, it should not be that arbitrary, and it certainly should not \njust whack them and abandon them.\n  NOAA is now undertaking a new survey for next year because of the \nconflict of the surveys. So how are we going to help these people \nsurvive until next year? How are we going to help them get through \nthose hard times and keep those boats, so if the word comes back that \nthey can go back out to the ocean and continue their livelihoods, they \nare actually able to do that?\n  My amendment simply expands the eligibility for the Emergency \nDisaster Loan Program--underscore loan; it is not a grant; it is a loan \nprogram--to include commercial fishermen and shellfish fishermen. That \nis all we are asking. It would allow fishermen to be eligible for a \nlow-interest emergency disaster loan, available through the Department \nof Agriculture's Farm Service Agency. It is my understanding this \namendment would have no score.\n  Fishermen, as we know--many people saw ``The Perfect Storm.'' They \nrisked their lives to go out and put protein, food on the tables of \nAmerica. All you have to do is watch one of the shows--``Deadliest \nCatch''--to get a sense of what is at stake. I believe they are \nagricultural producers, like other kinds of farmers, and they ought to \nbe treated with the same respect.\n  We have put billions upon billions of dollars, often in grants, in \nemergency assistance, for one reason or another, to farmers across the \nStates of the Midwest, Far West, and some in the Northeast, where we do \nhave some farming, but usually it is in other parts of the country, and \nwe have consistently voted to do that, to help people.\n  We are asking our colleagues to treat our farmers of the sea with the \nsame respect that others are treated in this country. We simply end an \ninequity in the law that does not provide a legal mechanism for people \nto be able to do what they would like to do, which is being able to \nlegally help our fishermen with these low-interest loans.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Pilots' Bill of Rights\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a while ago we were talking about the \nunanimous consent request that was objected to by Senator Hutchison to \nbring up my pilots' bill of rights by\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\nunanimous consent, actually Senate rule XIV.\n  During that time, it was the intention of Senator Mark Begich from \nAlaska to be on the Senate floor with me. He was tied up with \nconstituents. I did not want to talk about him unless he was down here. \nBut I have visited with him. Right now we have--I do not know how \nmany--thousands and thousands of pilots who are watching this at this \nmoment. I want them to know that Mark Begich has been the cosponsor of \nmy legislation. We would not be able to be here and doing what we are \ndoing, as far along with 66 cosponsors, if we had not had his \ncooperation. I wish to thank him and the junior senator from West \nVirginia Mr. Manchin, who has been on my side on this legislation all \nof the way through.\n  I just want to make sure the pilots of America know who does want \nthem to have equal justice under the law and who, perhaps, does not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the good \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, for his leadership on this very \nimportant piece of legislation. I am proud to be part of that with him \nand the leadership he has shown for us fellow pilots and, basically, \nthe only connection we have in some rural parts of not only West \nVirginia but all of over the country, our private aviation. We hope to \nkeep that alive and well. I know it is the same in the Presiding \nOfficer's State. We appreciate all of the support and Senator Inhofe's \nleadership.\n\n\n                           Hydrocodone Abuse\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very important issue \nthat I believe will truly help each and every one of us, every Senator \nand every Congressman from all 50 States, accomplish something \nmeaningful when it comes to fighting the prescription drug abuse \nepidemic that is plaguing communities all over this great Nation.\n  I have not talked to a person in my State who has not been affected \nby a person in their immediate family or extended family with \nprescription drug abuse. It is something that is of epidemic \nproportions that we have to fight and work together on.\n  Less than a month ago, I was so proud when the Senate came together \nto unanimously support an amendment I offered with Senators Mark Kirk, \nKirsten Gillibrand, Chuck Schumer, and Jay Rockefeller that would make \nit far more difficult to abuse addictive pain medication by \nreclassifying drugs containing hydrocodone as schedule II substances.\n  Let me explain what this means in practical terms. Moving hydrocodone \nto a schedule II drug means that patients would need an original \nprescription to get their pills refilled. Pills would be stored and \ntransported more securely, and traffickers would be subject to \nincreased fines and penalties.\n  As we speak, negotiations are ongoing between the House and the \nSenate on a compromise version of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. \nThe Senate version contains my amendment and the House version does \nnot. So we are fighting as hard as we can to make sure this amendment \nis included in the final bill.\n  Last month I stood on the Senate floor and shared stories that I \nheard in communities across West Virginia about why this amendment is \nso urgently needed. Prescription drug abuse is responsible for about 75 \npercent of the drug-related deaths in the United States and 90 percent \nin my home State of West Virginia.\n  According to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, \nprescription drug abuse is the fastest growing drug problem in the \nUnited States. It is claiming the lives of thousands of Americans every \nyear. But no statistic can illustrate the scope of this problem like \nhearing the pleas of children who are begging their leaders to do \nsomething to get drugs out of their communities--children such as those \nI met in Wyoming County, West Virginia, last October where more than \n120 people have died from drug overdose in 7 years, including 41 last \nyear and 12 already this year.\n  Since that proud moment when the Senate unanimously passed my \nhydrocodone rescheduling amendment, it has come under fire--you can \nimagine--from groups that seem to think trying to limit the number of \nhydrocodone pills making their way into our communities, and oftentimes \ninto the wrong hands, is a bad idea because it affects their bottom \nlines.\n  I recognize this amendment does not fit into the business model of \nselling as many pills as possible. I understand that. But with that \nbeing said, I believe we have a responsibility to this great Nation, \nand especially to the youth of America. This will affect us for \ngenerations to come. To win this war on prescription drugs it needs to \nhappen now.\n  Hydrocodone is one of the most abused substances we have and the most \naddictive. I do not think I have talked to a person who does not \nrecognize that each and every State is experiencing these horrible \nproblems with this prescription drug abuse. The facts will bear this \nout.\n  According to a report issued by the Centers for Disease Control in \nNovember, the death toll from overdoses of prescription painkillers has \nmore than tripled in the last decade. The findings show that more than \n40 people die every day from overdoses involving narcotic pain \nrelievers such as hydrocodone, methadone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone.\n  These prescription painkillers are responsible for more deaths than \nheroin and cocaine combined. Yet still we are hearing from some folks \nwho just do not believe that rescheduling hydrocodone is a good idea. I \nhave said to those groups: Let's work together on a compromise that can \naddress your legitimate concerns. If anyone has a concern with this \namendment, just come to me and we will sit down with you and try to \nwork through it in a most reasonable manner.\n  We have already offered a number of compromises to different groups \nin an effort to get this bill passed and signed into law. I want to \nclarify some of these concerns.\n  We have heard from some with concerns that making hydrocodone a \nschedule II drug will mean that patients with legitimate needs for \nthose medications would face increased hurdles to obtaining them and \nthat those patients would have to visit the doctor more often.\n  To them, I would say the following: Look at what the DEA did in 2007 \nto reduce burdens facing patients when it came to refills. They \nfinalized a new rule allowing doctors to provide individual patients \nwith a 90-day supply of any schedule II medication by issuing three \nseparate prescriptions: one for an immediate supply and two additional \nprescriptions that cannot be filled until a certain specified date.\n  If they receive a 90-day supply, patients would only need to visit \ntheir doctor four times per year. If they have a chronic ailment, I \nwould think those patients would want that type of evaluation anyway. \nThat makes all the sense in the world to me, and I know to a lot of \nAmericans.\n  If a practitioner is prescribing medication as part of a usual course \nof professional practice and for legitimate medical reasons, there is \nno numerical limitation on the quantity they can prescribe. Federal law \ndoes not limit physicians to providing only a 30-day supply of \nmedication. The amount prescribed and length of treatment is within \neach doctor's discretion.\n  We have also heard from those who are worried that pharmacies could \nface increased operating costs caused by new storage requirements as \nwell as increased paperwork. But there is no difference in Federal \nstorage requirements between schedule III and schedule II drugs. \nFederal law requires that all controlled substances be stored and \nsecurely locked in substantially constructed cabinets.\n  As for more paperwork, pharmacies are already doing paperwork on \ntheir current schedule II drug orders. All this amendment would require \nis including an additional line on the existing form that specifies how \nmany hydrocodone combination pills they are ordering.\n  The bottom line is, we have to recognize this is a very addictive \ndrug. As a schedule III drug, hydrocodone is very available to people \nwho might not use it for the right purposes but for elicit purposes. \nAll we are saying is give us a chance to protect some of the most \nvulnerable people we have, especially our young people who are addicted \nto these prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\n  Look at all of the people who support this amendment, the folks who \nare out there on the front lines trying to keep our society safe and \nfight the war on drugs so that we can all be in a better society and \nmore protected. We have groups such as the Fraternal Order of Police, \nthe National District Attorney's Association, the National Narcotics \nOfficers' Association, the National Troopers Coalition, the National \nAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine, the National Association of \nDrug and Alcohol Interventionists, the West Virginia Medical \nProfessionals Health Program, the Drug Free America Foundation, Inc., \nthe National Coalition Against Prescription Drug Abuse, and the \nPrevention Partnership.\n  These people are on the front lines. They are saying this amendment \nis needed. This will help them immensely fight this war on drugs. Those \nare the people who are out there helping us every day in society.\n  We are willing to sit down and work with people if they have \nlegitimate concerns. But if the concern is that this amendment \ninterrupts their business plan, I hope they would rise above their \nbusiness plan and be an American first. What we are trying to do is \ngood for this country. It is good for each one of our States. I know it \nwould be good for the State of West Virginia and the Presiding \nOfficers's State of Vermont for generations to come.\n  We will be working hard and we will be protecting them for the \nquality of life as Americans. I am not trying to put anyone out of \nbusiness. I am a businessperson myself. I appreciate the hard work of \nbusinesses all across this country and the risks they take and the \ndedication they have. But when we have a problem, we have to fix it. We \nhave a problem. This amendment is not going to solve all of our \nproblems, we recognize that. It is not going to eliminate prescription \ndrug abuse once and for all. But it does give us one more tool to fight \nthe drug abuse problem we have in this country.\n  To get this passed, it is going to take the voices of the public--not \njust the voices in this Chamber or across the Capitol but the voices of \nthe public, the voices of people who have seen what it has done to our \nfamilies, to our children, and our communities. We need their voices \nsaying: We cannot stand by and watch this happen any longer; voices \nsuch as those from Oceana Middle School in Wyoming County in the State \nof West Virginia who participated in a letter-writing campaign to their \nelected leaders asking for help with a drug epidemic.\n  One of them wrote this to me:\n\n       My town, Oceana, has an issue about drugs. I write this \n     letter to you because I hope you can do something about it. \n     In 2006, my godmother died of an overdose. She was the only \n     person I could talk to. Drugs make people act in bad ways, \n     and if something doesn't happen about them, then our town \n     will be in worse shape.\n\n  Mr. President, I have been there many times. As a young person in \ncollege, my roommate was from Oceana. It was one of the most beautiful \ncities I had ever seen 40 years ago, but you would not recognize it \nwith what has happened. These are young middle-school children crying \nout for help. They are afraid to go out in the streets.\n  This is happening all over America. These students want a better life \nfor their parents, their siblings, their friends, and for their \ncommunities. Also, they want a better life for themselves. They are \nwilling to fight, and we should be willing to fight for them. That is \nour job and what we were sent here to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate \ntoday to speak about a number, a number that has a particular \nsignificance for us here, and that number is 400. Why is 400 an \nimportant number at this point in our history? What is important about \n400 is that it is the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide \nthat has been measured this spring in the Arctic.\n  This is a first. We have never hit 400 before. For 8,000 centuries \nmankind has inhabited this planet within an atmospheric carbon dioxide \nrange of 190 to 300 parts per million. That is the range, the \nbandwidth, within which we have lived.\n  How long is 800,000 years? It is a pretty darn long time. I don't \nthink there are any human remains or artifacts that go back further \nthan 200,000 years. If we go back more than 10,000 years, we are only \nseeing the very beginnings of agriculture, where people are beginning \nto scratch the soil and plant things. For longer than our species has \neffectively inhabited this Earth, we have been in this happy bandwidth \nthat has supported our lives, supported congenial climate for human \ndevelopment.\n  We are out of that now for the first time in that period--800,000 \nyears--and we are not just a little bit out of it. We didn't go to 302 \nor to 350. We have now crossed 400, and we are still going. We are \nstill going, and there is no end in sight.\n  We continue to dump gigatons of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere \nevery single year, and we continue to subsidize the people who do the \ndumping. At least in this building, and probably in the boardrooms of \nExxonMobil and a few other places, we studiously ignore the facts that \nare right before our faces.\n  Here are just a few stories from the past week or so: A June 4 story \nin the New York Times reported that ``climate change threatens power \noutput.''\n  Why would a warming climate change threaten power output? It is \nbecause warmer waters, when they are pumped through powerplants, don't \nprovide the same cooling capacity. So if we are going to keep plants \nfrom overheating, we have to dial back the power output. For places \nsuch as the heavily developed U.S. Northeast, we can be pretty close to \nour margins from time to time, particularly when air-conditioning loads \nare high in the summer, and those hot days increase the risk of power \ncutbacks or conceivably even power outages.\n  A June 5 story in the U.S. News and World Report described a recently \npublished article in which several European public health experts wrote \nthat climate change could alter patterns of food availability and \nchange disease distribution, all in ways that could harm human health.\n  If we want an example of how the change in climate changes the way \nthings move around on this Earth, we have to look no further than the \npine beetle, which is decimating our traditional western forests \nbecause the winters are no longer cold enough to kill off the larvae. \nAs the warmth moves ever northward, so do the larvae, and we can fly \nover mountains and look down and see the brown wasteland of trees that \nused to be green pine forests.\n  NOAA reported that the lower 48 States just experienced the warmest \nMay on record. The national average temperature for this spring--March \nthrough May--was 5.2 degrees above the 20th century's long-term \naverage, surpassing the previous warmest spring ever, in 1910, by 2 \nfull degrees.\n  Some States are warming faster than others, and Rhode Island, \nunfortunately for us, is at the top of the list. Climate Central, a \nresearch organization, crunched averages of the daily high and low \ntemperatures from the National Climatic Data Center's U.S. Historical \nClimatology Network of weather stations. Their recently published \nreport determined that over the past 100 years, Rhode Island has \nactually warmed the fastest of any State. This has terrible \nconsequences for us, from shifting our growing season to harming the \ncold-water fish we catch in our warming Narragansett Bay.\n  As an aside, when my wife was doing her graduate research out in \nNarragansett Bay, she was studying the interaction between winter \nflounder and a shrimp that lives in the bay called Crangon \nseptemspinosa. The reason that was important then was because winter \nflounder was a huge cash crop for our Rhode Island fishermen. It hasn't \nbeen that long since she did her graduate research, and winter flounder \nhas fallen off as a cash crop for our fishermen. Narragansett Bay has \nwarmed. The water temperature is up nearly 4 degrees, which may not \nseem much to terrestrial beings like us when we jump in the water and \nit is 64 degrees instead of 60 degrees. Does that really make \na difference to us? No. But for the fish for whom that is their entire \necosystem, that has shifted and\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\nhas demolished the winter flounder fisheries, which are down something \nlike 10 times.\n\n  Many people understand that there is a connection between carbon \npollution in our atmosphere and these warming temperatures. But it is \nbecoming incontrovertible that these things are happening. The science \nbehind this is rock solid. People say there are questions about the \ntheory. No. No, there are not. There are questions about some of the \ncomplicated modeling that people go through. But the theory has been \nclear since the time of the American Civil War. The scientist, John \nTyndall, determined that increasing moisture and carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere had a blanketing effect that kept heat in, trapped heat on \nour planet. That has been basic textbook science for a century. It has \nnever been controverted. It is a law, essentially, of science. Yet \nthere are special interests who try to deny that.\n  Set against those special interests is about as unanimous a coalition \nfrom science as has ever been assembled. Virtually every prestigious \nscientific and academic institution has stated that climate change is \nhappening, and human activities--specifically our reckless release of \ncarbon pollution--are the driving cause of this change.\n  In 2009, there was a very clear letter, signed by the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, American Chemical Society, \nAmerican Geophysical Union, American Institute of Biological Sciences, \nAmerican Meteorological Society, American Society of Agronomy, American \nSociety of Plant Biologists, American Statistical Association, \nAssociation of Ecosystem Research Centers, Botanical Society of \nAmerica, and on and on. Here is what they said in pretty darn hard-\nhitting words for scientists:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear--\n\n  ``Clear'' is the word they used--\n\n     that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific \n     research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by \n     human activities are the primary driver.\n\n  Not observations throughout the world make it ``likely'' that it is \noccurring, and not ``potentially'' indicates, and not the greenhouse \ngases emitted by human activities ``might be'' the primary driver. It \nis ``clear'' it has demonstrated that they are the primary drivers. \nThey go on:\n\n       These conclusions are based on multiple independent lines \n     of evidence--\n\n  Here is what we might call the sockdolager--\n\n     and contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective \n     assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  In a nutshell, if you are looking at the actual peer-reviewed science \nand being objective--if you are not putting your thumb on the scale--\ncontrary assertions are inconsistent with that. You are basically \nmaking it up.\n  So that is a pretty powerful statement. The argument that the jury is \nstill out on climate change is a false and bogus argument. The jury is \nnot out. In fact, the verdict is in. The effects are obvious. They \nsurround us every day, and we need to take action.\n  I have been on the Senate floor with Senator Franken before, and we \nhave talked about this. He makes a wonderful point, which is that 97 \npercent of the climate scientists agree that this is happening, it is \nhappening because of our carbon pollution, and we need to do something \nurgent about it.\n  Three percent question it. That is 97-to-3 odds. We are asked to \navoid taking any action, not to worry about it because there is doubt \nand debate. Translate that to real, ordinary human life, not this \npeculiar political world we are in here.\n  Let's say someone has a child, and the child appears to be sick. They \ngo in to see the doctor, and he says: Yes, your child is sick, and she \nis going to need treatment.\n  They say: Yes, but treatment is expensive, and it might be \nunpleasant. I will tell you what, I am going to get a second opinion.\n  So then they go to another doctor, and he says the same thing--that \ntheir child is sick and will need treatment. They say: Well, two \nopinions are kind of a lot, but let's just be sure and get a third \nopinion. That doctor says the same thing too.\n  What would we think of the parents who did that 100 times, who were \ntold by 97 out of 100 doctors that the child was sick and needed \ntreatment, and they said: You know what, there is doubt about this. I \nam not sure, so I am not going to give my child the treatment they \nneed.\n  It is a preposterous example, isn't it? It is an absolutely \nridiculous point of view for the parent to hold. Yet that is exactly \nthe point of view we are being asked to hold to deny and delay the \nsteps we have to take to protect us, our children, and our country from \nthe damage that is being done, frankly, by ourselves--the polluting \ninterests that we don't take adequate steps to put on the right track \ntoward a successful and clean energy future.\n  The last thing I will say is on that exact point. The more we depend \non fossil fuels, the more we depend on a diminishing resource that \npollutes our country. It is a diminishing force that goes up under the \nlaws of supply and demand, and in practice, and right now, forces us to \nengage with foreign oil-producing countries that do not have our best \ninterests at heart. We send our dollars--hundreds of millions of them--\ninto their treasuries so that money can filter out into organizations \nthat actually wish to do us harm. That is not a great state of affairs.\n  The alternative is a clean energy future where American homes are \nmore efficient. We have replaced windows and added insulation and \nimproved boilers. We have created innumerable jobs through all that \nwork, and we have paid for it with reduced energy costs. It pays for \nitself. Sometimes it pays for itself in 1 year, sometimes in 2 years, \nsometimes in 5 years, but it pays for itself and it creates work.\n\n  We are in a battle right now for clean energy technologies. It is an \ninternational competition. It is us against China, us against India, us \nagainst the European Union. Every single one of the other countries \ngets it, and they are trying to push resources onto their clean energy \nindustries so they can lap us in this race, so they can get so far \nahead of us that we become the world's biggest global consumer of clean \nenergy, not its biggest manufacturer.\n  We invented the solar cell. Fifteen years ago, we made 40 percent of \nall the solar cells in the world. I think we are down to 7 percent now. \nThe top 10 wind turbine companies in the world include one American \ncompany--one. And by knocking down the production tax credits, by \neliminating the 1603 Program, by subsidizing Big Oil like crazy, people \nin this building are doing their very best not to help us in the race \nagainst foreign competition but to put weights in the pockets of \nAmerican companies, to tie their shoelaces together, to interfere with \ntheir ability to compete. They do not see it yet as international \ncompetition. They are so tied to the fossil fuel industry that they \nonly see it as competition between fossil fuels and clean energy, and \nin that battle they want to be with the fossil fuel energy. They do not \nsee the future. They do not see how important these technologies are \ngoing to be in batteries, in wind, in clean energy, and in all these \nareas where we can not only command our energy future by building and \ncreating the power we use and unhinge ourselves from these foreign \ndictatorships that run off oil economies, but we can improve the future \nand the safety of our planet by dialing down the pollution.\n  My State pays a particular price. We are downwind of the midwestern \npolluters--the big utility companies, the big manufacturing companies, \nthe ones that have built thousand-foot-high smokestacks for the \nspecific purpose of shoving as much of their pollution as high in the \natmosphere as they can so that it doesn't rain down on their States--\nnot on Missouri, Ohio, or Pennsylvania--but that it rains down on Rhode \nIsland, on Massachusetts, on Vermont, and on other States.\n  I was here earlier this morning talking about the mercury rule. We \nhave ponds and lakes and reservoirs in Rhode Island where it is unsafe \nto eat the fish you catch because of mercury poisoning. It is unsafe \neverywhere in Rhode Island to eat the fish you catch if you are a child \nor an expectant mother. Nobody can safely eat the fish you catch in \nthese ponds because there is so much mercury in them. How did the \nmercury get there? How did the mercury get there? From pollution out of \nthe smokestacks dumped down on our State. And there is nothing we can \ndo to prevent it other than to support the EPA in these mercury-limit \nrules.\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\n  There is a real cost to continuing down this fossil fuel path. My \nhome State pays it all the time. And when it comes time to reap the \nwhirlwind of storm activity, of sea level rise, coastal States such as \nRhode Island will pay a particularly high price.\n  I am going to continue to come to the Senate floor. This is not a \npopular topic. The Presiding Officer, Senator Sanders of Vermont, is \neloquent, articulate, and a constant ally on these subjects. There are \na handful of us who are regulars on this subject, but I think a great \nmany of my colleagues and virtually everybody on the other side of the \naisle would just as soon wash their hands of it, forget about it, \npretend it is not happening, and continue to sleepwalk toward disaster. \nSo I will keep doing this. It is important to my State. I believe it is \nimportant for our country.\n  I appreciate the attention of the Presiding Officer and those who \nhave the attention of the floor.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        National Security Leaks\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious concern \nabout a matter of national security. It is a matter that is \nincreasingly more visible with the American people. It is a matter that \nthey are more and more concerned about as they hear more. It is an \nissue that is not going away until it is properly investigated by the \nexecutive branch of this government. That, of course, is the recent \nnews publications that discussed details of counterterrorism plans, \nprograms, and operations of our government. These publications refer to \nspecific counterterrorism military and intelligence activities that are \namong the most classified and highly sensitive national security \noperations involving our military and our intelligence community. The \nleaks of this information constitute a grave breach of our vital \nnational security interests.\n  The President, in his press conference last Friday, attempted to \ndistance his administration from these damaging leaks, stating, ``The \nnotion that my White House would purposefully release classified \nnational security information is offensive.''\n  The matter is certainly offensive and needs to be fully investigated.\n  I must point out that the President did not explicitly deny that \nmembers of his administration were responsible for leaking classified \nor sensitive information to the media. As a matter of fact, so many of \nthe news reports, quite frankly, point to members of this \nadministration for these damaging and criminal leaks.\n  Any mishandling of classified material must be taken with the utmost \nseriousness. The authors of these publications cite unnamed senior \nadministration officials and Presidential aides as their sources. We \nneed to know the names of these senior administration officials, we \nneed to know the names of these Presidential aides, and we need to \nknow, quite frankly, if they were engaged in criminal breaches of our \nespionage and intelligence statutes.\n  Our men and women in the military and our intelligence community \nofficials work under extremely difficult conditions. These leaks have \nput their lives in danger. These leaks have put their methods and their \nongoing operations at risk. They need to stop, and they need to be \ninvestigated.\n  All individuals privy to the White House discussions regarding \ncounterterrorism and intelligence operations hold security clearances \nat the very highest levels. Before being granted access to these \nclassified items of information, individuals must undergo a thorough \nbackground investigation and receive extensive security training \nregarding proper procedures for handling classified materials. They are \ntrained as to what they can say and what they ought not to say. They \nare trained as to what the law requires and what the law prohibits. It \nis clear that any potential leak of classified material was not an \naccidental slip of the tongue but a deliberate and brazen violation of \nFederal law, and we need to get to the bottom of this.\n  I will also add that we are not talking about an isolated instance of \na leak. As the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nSenator Dianne Feinstein, rightly observed last Wednesday, we are \ntalking about what she described as an ``avalanche'' of leaks--an \navalanche of leaks--on national security matters that have, in her \nwords, put our Nation's security in jeopardy, to quote the chair of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Quoting from the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nJohn Kerry:\n\n       A number of those leaks, and others in the last months \n     about drone activities and other activities, are frankly all \n     against national-security interests.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I think they're dangerous, damaging, and whoever is doing \n     that is not acting in the interest of the United States of \n     America.\n\n  Yet, news reports say these reports come from senior administration \nofficials. We need to find out who these administration officials are.\n  Then, further to quote Senator Feinstein, whom I began quoting \nearlier:\n\n       When people say they don't want to work with the United \n     States because they can't trust us to keep a secret, that's \n     serious. When allies become concerned when an asset's life is \n     in jeopardy or the asset's family's life is in jeopardy, \n     that's a problem. The point of intelligence is to be able to \n     know what might happen to protect this country.\n\n  I could go on and on.\n  I have joined 10 of my colleagues in cosponsoring a Senate resolution \nthat urges the U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder, to appoint an \nindependent special counsel to investigate classified information leaks \nby the administration. Yet instead of a special counsel, the Attorney \nGeneral has merely appointed two Justice Department attorneys to \ninvestigate the leaks, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, \nRonald Machen, and his counterpart in Maryland, Rod Rosenstein.\n  Although I have no question about their abilities, the appointment of \nthese two Obama administration officials is unacceptable and raises \nquestions as to their independence. A truly independent investigation \nwould almost certainly reveal any breaches of the criminal law \nconcerning classified information essential to national security. A \ntruly independent counsel would have his or her own prosecutorial \ndiscretion. If the administration leaks such information, the public \nhas a right to know and the public has a right to be outraged. The \nlives of Americans and our friends have already been put at risk. The \nObama administration cannot be expected to pursue a complete self-\ninvestigation of allegations of this magnitude. In the midst of an \nelection, they simply cannot be asked to do this, especially when those \nresponsible could well be members of the administration themselves.\n  Attorney General Holder is a principal on the President's national \nsecurity team. Members of this team may very well have been the sources \nof these leaks--members of the Attorney General's team. I wish to ask \nthis: Does the administration want the truth in this or is the \nadministration simply looking for cover? What is it about an \nindependent special counsel that frightens this administration? Is it \nthe truth this administration is afraid of? Are Americans more likely \nto get the truth from a truly independent counsel or from U.S. \nattorneys who will still report directly to the Attorney General?\n  The administration's concern about special counsels is \nunderstandable. If an independent counsel investigation reveals proof \nof leaks for political gain, it will not be pretty and will not sit \nwell with the American people.\n  This Sunday marks the 40th anniversary of the Watergate break-in. It \nstarted small, but as more and more people began to ask questions and \nas more and more people began to demand a true investigation, the truth \nfinally was revealed and it brought down a Presidency. Early on in \nWatergate, a member of my political party, a member of President \nNixon's political party, a former nominee for President, Barry \nGoldwater, came forward to the\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\nAmerican people and said: Let's get the truth out. No more coverups. \nLet's get rid of the stink and let's find out what was going on.\n  Members of my party should have heeded the words of Barry Goldwater \nat that moment and perhaps the scandal could have been brought to light \nand people involved in the subsequent coverup would not have been asked \nto do so. Barry Goldwater was right.\n  Members of both political parties would be well advised to ask this \nadministration to come forward, appoint a truly independent counsel to \nhave a truly independent investigation of these breaches of national \nsecurity. What I am talking about is evidence of criminal disclosures \nof national intelligence secrets, disclosures that have damaged our \nnational security and continue to damage our national security. This \nissue is not going away. I urge the Attorney General, I urge my \nPresident, to ensure confidence in government, to appoint a special \ncounsel to investigate and hold accountable anyone responsible for \nthese flagrant violations of our national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise to challenge the obstinacy of \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle to prevent us from doing \nanything that can help ordinary families in our country get back on \ntheir feet and succeed. As a matter of fact, it was very clearly stated \nby the minority leader, the Republican leader, to tell us that his No. \n1 priority--imagine that, the leader of the Republican Party in the \nSenate, his No. 1 priority is to make sure President Obama is a one-\nterm President. I ask, what good is that to the people who do not have \njobs or the people whose mortgages are about to be foreclosed or their \nkids can't get an education no matter how smart they are because it is \nimpossible to afford it? Imagine, stated proudly on the floor of this \nSenate, that the mission is to destroy the Presidency. Shame on him.\n  His No. 1 priority--not to create jobs, prevent another financial \ncrisis or keep our children safe and healthy; it is just that cynical \ngoal of destroying the Presidency, no matter how much harm, no matter \nhow much pain these actions inflict on our general population. It is a \ndisgrace.\n  We have seen what the Republicans are willing to do to accomplish \nthis goal. They brought our Nation to the brink of default. They shut \ndown the Federal Aviation Administration. They had to be dragged \nkicking and screaming to extend the payroll tax cut--just to name a few \nof the most egregious examples.\n  Now the Republican mission appears to be punishing the American \npeople with longer waits in courtrooms for judgments to be concluded. \nThere are currently 74 Federal judicial vacancies waiting to be filled. \nIn other words, nearly 1 in 11 Federal judgeships across this country \nis vacant. These vacancies are not some abstract problem only lawyers \nand academics care about. Judicial vacancies deny everyday Americans \nand businesses the justice and redress our Constitution guarantees. \nMillions of them have had their cases delayed. At a time when our \neconomy is making a fragile recovery, we cannot afford to have a legal \nsystem that makes it more difficult for businesses to get legal \njudgment, certainty about their rights and responsibilities, to move \ntheir operations, for instance, to full gear, perhaps.\n  But now we have learned the Senate Republicans are committed to \nmaking matters even worse. Roll Call reports that at yesterday's weekly \nluncheon of the conservative steering committee, Minority Leader \nMcConnell decided to halt--stop all circuit court confirmations. How \ncan our democracy function when we cannot even put judges in the \ncourtroom?\n  The very next nominee in line to be confirmed for the circuit court \nis a highly qualified nominee from New Jersey and we need her on the \nbench now. Magistrate Judge Patty Shwartz has been nominated to serve \non the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Her nomination was favorably \nreported by the Judiciary Committee on March 8, nearly 100 days ago. \nThey refused to let us take it up. For more than 3 months she has \nwaited patiently for a confirmation vote. She is anxious to get to work \nand we need her, while the Republicans in the Senate play games with \nthe confirmation process.\n  Now that Judge Shwartz is on the verge of receiving a vote and \nfilling a critical vacancy, the Republicans have pulled the rug out to \nmake sure she does not sit there. It is not fair to the judge--to Judge \nShwartz or to the people of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware who \ndeserve to have a fully staffed Federal bench. It sends a particularly \nnoxious message to the women of this country. If confirmed, Patty \nShwartz would fill a void, and she would be only the second woman ever \nto represent New Jersey on that appeals court.\n\n  This obstruction is especially outrageous, given the record of skill, \nconfidence and admiration Judge Shwartz has earned in the legal \ncommunity. Her nomination has received strong bipartisan support in our \nState. Her supporters include Republican Gov. Chris Christie. He is a \nformer U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.\n  He says:\n\n       Judge Patty Shwartz has committed her entire professional \n     life to public service, and New Jersey is the better for it.\n\n  That is his statement. If Governor Christie and I agree on someone, \nyou know she's really got to be good.\n  We are not the only ones who feel so strongly about Patty Shwartz's \nstellar qualifications for the bench. John Lacey, who is the past \nPresident of the Association of the New Jersey Federal Bar, said that \nJudge Shwartz ``is thoughtful, intelligent, and has an extraordinarily \nhigh level of common sense.''\n  Thomas Curtin, chairman of the Lawyers' Advisory Committee for the \nU.S. District Court of New Jersey, said: ``Every lawyer in the world \nwill tell you she is extraordinarily qualified, a decent person and an \nexcellent judge.''\n  The American Bar Association clearly agrees. They gave her their \nhighest rating of ``unanimously well qualified.''\n  A review of Judge Shwartz's experience shows why she has earned such \nrespect and praise. Since 2003, Patty Shwartz has served as a U.S. \nmagistrate judge in the District of New Jersey, where she has handled \nmore than 4,000 civil and criminal cases. She graduated from Rutgers \nUniversity with the highest honors, from the University of Pennsylvania \nLaw School, at which she was an editor of the Law Review and was named \nher class's Outstanding Woman Law Graduate.\n  As Governor Christie said, Patty Shwartz has devoted her entire \ncareer to public service. Preventing her from doing so will only hurt \nthe American people, people in our area, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, \nDelaware. It will only hurt those people seeking justice and our very \nsystem of democracy. It has often been said justice delayed is justice \ndenied. It is a lesson people in New Jersey and all over the country \nare learning and it has to stop. All Americans should be aware of the \nprice they pay for the obstruction of the Republicans on their side of \nthe aisle. When these confirmations are blocked, it is not just \nnominees who suffer, the justice system suffers under the weight of \nvacancies and the American people suffer longer waits for justice in \noverburdened courts. It is time for Republican politicians to stop \nblocking votes on those well-qualified nominees and allow the Senate to \nconfirm them without further delay.\n\n  Make no mistake: I take very seriously the Senate's constitutional \nduty of advice and consent regarding Presidential nominees. I do not \nbelieve the Senate should rubberstamp judicial nominees without \nconsideration or deliberation. However, what we see today is an \nunprecedented level of obstruction in confirming judges.\n  At this point in the term of President George W. Bush's Presidency, \nthe Senate had confirmed 179 judges, 28 more than the 151 of President \nObama's nominees who have been confirmed today. President Obama's \nnominees have been forced to wait approximately four times as long as \nPresident Bush's nominees to be confirmed after being favorably \nreported by the Judiciary Committee. When we had the numbers favoring \nour majority, we didn't permit delays like this. We would never use \nthat as a punishment for a Presidency we disagree with.\n  As a result, the vacancy rate is nearly twice what it was at this \npoint in\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\nPresident Bush's first term. These delay-and-destroy tactics cannot be \nwhat our Founding Fathers had in mind when they gave us the power of \nadvise and consent.\n  I am the son of immigrants who came to this country, and I got the \nmessage often from my parents and my grandparents to come to America \nand find a better way of life than they had in Russia or Poland, their \nbirthplace. I view our justice system as the Nation's premier \ninstitution. It demonstrates so well what America is about.\n  I am proud that a courthouse in Newark, NJ, bears my name. It has an \ninscription that I authored. We spent a lot of time talking about the \ninscription and what it would look like. I came up with this: ``The \ntrue measure of a democracy is its dispensation of justice.''\n  When people walk into that courtroom, they have to know that they \nhave an equal chance at a proper decision just like anybody else. There \nshouldn't be the discrimination that exists when we don't fill \nvacancies that are begging to be filled with qualified candidates. All \nin this Chamber know when the dispensation of justice is obstructed and \ndelayed, our democracy suffers.\n  I plead with our Republican colleagues: Stop the obstruction, allow \nthe Senate to vote on Judge Patty Shwartz's confirmation without \nfurther delay. Put off your attempt to discredit President Obama's \ntenure as President. That doesn't fit in here. If you want to do it in \nthe political mainstream, and you want those wild gestures and those \nridiculous claims that they want to destroy President Obama's tenure, \ndon't do that. Don't do that to the American people. Be fair. Do your \njob, and let's get on with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we are running out of time. The interest \nrate on subsidized student loans is set to double in just over 2 weeks. \nThis will hit middle-class families hard at a time when they are \ndealing with the devastating effects of the most severe recession that \nwe have witnessed in our lifetime.\n  Earlier this week the Federal Reserve reported additional sobering \nnews. Between 2007 and 2010, median family wealth declined by nearly 40 \npercent. Median family income declined by nearly 8 percent, and the \nshare of families with education-related debt rose from 15.2 percent to \n19.2 percent.\n  This is no time to increase the interest rate on need-based student \nloans on the more than 7,000 moderate and low-income students who rely \non them to go to college. What we have seen is a middle-class that in \nterms of wealth and income has been shrinking dramatically. \nIronically--perhaps not ironically--the very wealthy have seen income \nand wealth increase. However, for the vast majority of Americans, they \nhave seen their economic position deteriorate.\n  Closely allied with economic opportunity and the idea of making your \nway in this country is the necessity to go on to higher education. We \nhave been preaching that. That is what our parents told us, go on to \ncollege. They said, when you go to college, you will be prepared to go \ninto the workforce, increase your family income, contribute more to \nyour country. Yet now we see a situation where not only is there a \ncompression in middle-income wealth and income, there is also a \nstaggering amount of student debt. It is almost $1 trillion. In fact, I \nheard reports suggesting that it eclipsed credit card debt in terms of \nwhat households in America are holding.\n  There is a generation of college students who have graduated and are \nstruggling with this debt. The worst thing we can do now is double the \ninterest rate on those who need more loans to finish their school and \nput an even greater burden on them and their family as they go forward.\n  We need to pass this legislation that will prevent the doubling of \ninterest on student loans, and we need to do it before July 1. We are \nlooking at a period of time when interest rates are very low. The \nFederal Reserve is charging financial institutions somewhere around 1 \npercent or less to borrow money, and yet we are going to students and \nsaying, the interest rate used to be 3.4 percent, now it will be 6.8 \npercent. That seems not only incongruous but incomprehensible, that we \nwill allow the interest rate to double, particularly in this \nenvironment.\n  Students' families can't afford this increase. They are stretched too \nthin already. Every statistic--forget the statistics. Talk to people \nback home in New Hampshire or Rhode Island or New Jersey, and they will \ntell you it is tough. There are children who are moving back in with \ntheir families because they are struggling to find a good job so they \ncan pay their student debt and get by. This is not the time to double \nthe interest rate on these loans.\n  It is an issue of fairness. It is an issue of the future of this \ncountry. It is an issue of avoiding innumerable personal tragedies. We \nwere just on a conference call when a woman called in and said she is \ninvolved with many students who have graduated in the last few years \nand they are literally at their wit's end that they can't pay their \ndebts. They don't have jobs that will give them the chance to move on. \nThey are saddled with debt. How will they even begin to think of \nstarting a family and buying a home? That was something my generation \nsort of took for granted in their mid twenties. We have to deal with \nthis issue. This is the first step.\n  According to Georgetown University Center on Education Workforce, \nover 60 percent of jobs will require some postsecondary education by \n2018. No longer is higher education some nice thing to do, it has \nbecome a necessity to get jobs that will provide for a family. Yet in \n2010 only 38.3 percent of working-age adults have a 2-year or 4-year \ndegree. So we know there is a gap already. We have 40 percent of people \nwith a postsecondary education, and experts are telling us we will need \n60 percent by 2018, and that is just 6 years away. And we are proposing \nto make it harder to pay for college? Again, it does not make any \nsense.\n\n  That is why last January, working with my colleague Joe Courtney in \nthe House of Representatives, we introduced the Student Loan \nAffordability Act. We saw this coming. We knew we had to prevent this \nincrease. Initially the response from our colleagues on the other side \nwas, no way. In fact, they voted for two budgets that assumed the \ninterest rate would double, therefore giving more resources for tax \ncuts and other preferences that certainly won't be as effective to help \nthe middle class as giving a youngster a chance to go to college. But \nwe continued to push. With the President and students and families and \nstudent organizations across the country, I think we have made some \nprogress. We have seen at least a change in rhetoric.\n  Governor Romney said he was in favor of keeping the rates low. There \nhas been no specifications on how to do this or urging on how to do \nthis, but at least conceptually there seems to be agreement on that one \npoint. The Republican leaders then followed suit saying, yes, we have \nto keep this interest rate from doubling. But we have not seen the \nactions to match these words.\n  They initially made a proposal to keep the interest rates low by \ngoing after preventive health care, and that is a nonstarter. I hope we \nall understand that, one, if we are going to improve the quality of \nhealth care in this country, we have to emphasize preventive care. By \nthe way, if we are going to bend that proverbial cost curve, we better \nstart to do more prevention than treatment because it is a lot more \ncost effective to prevent than treat disease.\n  Then they proposed another offset that would take resources from low- \nand middle-income families through various programs, taking from one \npocket of a low- and middle-income family and giving it to them in the \neducation pocket. That didn't work.\n  They continued to resist a proposal we made to pay for it because we \ndo understand in this environment we have to be fiscally responsible. \nWe proposed to close one of the most egregious loopholes in the Tax \nCode. There is a provision that allows high-paid lobbyists, high-paid \nlawyers, high-paid consultants to avoid their payroll taxes, Medicare \ntaxes, and other taxes by forming a subchapter S corporation. At the \nend of the year they give themselves a dividend, which is not wages \nsubject to these taxes, and is actually\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\ntreated at a very preferential tax rate. This is such an outrageous \nloophole that it was condemned by Bob Novak, late conservative \ncolumnist. It was condemned by the Wall Street Journal. It was \ncondemned by everyone, but it was not something they could accept.\n  Well, we have moved forward. We have put a new offer on the table, \nled by Leader Harry Reid, and that would effectively help with respect \nto pension liabilities. First, it would give employers more \npredictability in terms of their contribution by allowing them to \nsmooth out the interest rate which they assume in their contributions \nto the fund.\n  If you are trying to fund a pension liability over many years, you \nhave to put in principal, but then you have to assume an interest rate \nto see if that principal will grow to an adequate amount. So the \npresent law looks back about 2 years, and this is a remarkably low \ninterest rate environment. So with low interest rates, they have to put \nmore principal in. This way they could look much farther back, smooth \nit out, and take a more realistic interest rate that will reflect not \njust the last 2 years, which one would argue is very exceptional in \nterms of interest rates, but look at something that is more \nrepresentative of the 25 or so years that they must provide for in \ntheir pension fund. In fact, this is a provision that employers think \nis very important to them.\n  The other side is to provide an increase of premiums paid to the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the insurance fund for defined \nbenefit pension plans. Too often today the PBGC has to step in where \ncompanies go bankrupt and their pension funds are not adequate to pay \nfor even part of the bona fide liabilities that they owe to workers, \nmany of whom spent years in their employ and are depending on their \npension.\n  This is a very balanced approach. It is an approach in the past that \nhas had bipartisan support. I hope we are reaching a point now where we \ncan come together. This is an incredibly difficult issue for families \nacross this country.\n  I have heard pleas from Rhode Island families to fix this. I received \nletters and calls. One of them came in and said:\n\n       Please continue to fight for keeping the interest rate of \n     Stafford loans down to 3.4 percent. It is difficult enough to \n     pay for college. With unemployment so high for recent \n     college graduates, our financial future seems bleak. My \n     parents and I have taken loans to pay for my and my \n     sister's tuition. We are from a middle class family. We \n     appreciate your support and help with this issue.\n\n  Those words are more eloquent than mine.\n  Let's just get this done. We have no time to waste. July 1 is almost \nupon us. We have 2 weeks. Let's come together. Let's help people across \nthis country and help our country.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and note the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, the President of the United States \nearlier today was in Cleveland. He spoke for 54 minutes, yet he said \nalmost nothing--at least certainly nothing that most of us have not \nheard before.\n  It was 2 years ago this very weekend that the White House announced \nthe start of what it referred to as the ``recovery summer.'' That \ncampaign was an effort to convince the American people that the Obama \nadministration's policies to create jobs were working.\n  David Axelrod, who was the senior adviser to the President, said at \nthe time, talking about the summer of 2010, ``This summer will be the \nmost active Recovery Act season yet.'' Again, that was the summer of \n2010. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner wrote an op-ed in the New York \nTimes, and it was entitled ``Welcome to the Recovery.'' Again, that was \n2010. Now here we are, 2 years later, and Americans are still waiting \nfor a real recovery. The ``recovery summer'' failed to produce results \nbecause it was never more than just a cheap slogan. It was designed to \nhide the fact that an unaccountable administration had no real \nsolutions.\n  Instead of working to create a healthier economy, President Obama has \noffered more excuses, more gimmicks, and more empty promises, and he \ncontinues to say the economy is about to turn the corner.\n  This past March President Obama said things would get better soon. \n``Day by day,'' he promised, ``we're restoring this economy from \ncrisis.'' We have heard this all before.\n  In February 2009 the President said his stimulus bill was ``the \nbeginning of the first steps to set our economy on a firmer foundation, \npaving the way to long-term growth and prosperity.''\n  In April 2010 he said, ``Our economy is stronger; that economic \nheartbeat is growing stronger.''\n  In January 2011 he claimed that ``the next two years, our job now, is \nputting our economy into overdrive.''\n  Now, after disappointing jobs numbers for May of this year, when just \n69,000 jobs were created, the President once again promises that ``we \nwill come back stronger.''\n  It is a shame that our economy doesn't run on the President's \nrhetoric. Saying that things will get better does not make them better.\n  Well, the President's record speaks for itself. For starters, we all \nremember early 2009 when the incoming Obama administration told the \nAmerican people that its stimulus plan would keep unemployment below 8 \npercent. That is what they said--it would keep unemployment below 8 \npercent. Instead, we have now had 40 straight months, 40 consecutive \nmonths with unemployment over 8 percent. By now, unemployment was \nsupposed to be even much better because the administration had said \nthat by mid-2012--where we are right now, today--their projections were \nthat unemployment would be below 6 percent if the stimulus bill passed. \nWell, the stimulus bill passed. I voted against it. Instead, \nunemployment has ticked up again in May to 8.2 percent.\n  Last month one official at the Federal Reserve said it might take 4 \nto 5 more years to get unemployment down to 6 percent, which is where \nthe President promised it would be today. The latest jobs report also \nsaid that over 23 million Americans are unemployed or are working at \nless of a job than what they would like.\n  President Obama said the other day that ``the private sector is doing \nfine.'' He said that in a nationally televised press conference, that \nthe private sector is doing fine. He went on to say that it was only \ngovernment jobs that were lagging behind. Well, I think many of these \n23 million-plus Americans who are unemployed or underemployed would \nabsolutely disagree with this President.\n  Under the Obama economy, since early 2009 we have lost 433,000 \nmanufacturing jobs; 79,000 real estate jobs have been lost; and 160,000 \njobs in communications industries, such as wireless carriers, have been \nlost. We have lost 932,000 construction jobs. These may sound like a \nlot of numbers upon numbers, but behind each one of these statistics is \na person--a homebuilder, a phone salesman in the mall, a real estate \nagent in our communities--real people who have lost the private sector \njobs their families rely on to put food on the table, a roof over their \nhead, and to help their kids get through school.\n  Many Americans have gotten so discouraged by the Obama economy that \nthey have actually given up looking for work entirely. Those Americans \nwho have not given up are finding it more difficult to get jobs. Even \nif they are trying to find a job, they are finding that their job \nsearch is taking much longer than they ever imagined. Over 5 million \nAmericans have been searching for work for more than 27 weeks. That is \nover 5 million Americans who have spent more than half a year looking \nfor work. The unemployed now spend an average of nearly 40 weeks \nlooking for work--double the average when President Obama took office. \nThat is the\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nequivalent of losing a job on New Year's Day and not finding work again \nuntil October.\n  So why are the jobs so scarce? Well, it is because President Obama's \npolicies have done far too little to help our struggling economy, and \nin many cases his policies have actually hurt the economy and made \nthings worse. Contrary to what President Obama believes, the private \nsector is not doing fine, and the problem is not just that we don't \nhave enough bureaucrats.\n  Growth in America's GDP for the first quarter of 2012 was just 1.9 \npercent. That is nowhere near the level we need for a healthy economy. \nDuring past recoveries from economic downturns, other Presidents have \npresided over much faster growth. After the recession of the early \n1980s, President Reagan's economy grew much faster. Well, there is a \nsimple reason why, and it has to do with the policies coming out of \nthis President's administration.\n  President Obama keeps repeating that we face economic headwinds. \nWell, the biggest headwinds we are facing come from the President's own \neconomic policies. The American people understand this. They read the \npapers. Headlines such as the one from the Washington Post on Tuesday, \njust 2 days ago--``Families See Their Wealth Sapped.'' The American \npeople read about the bad economic data saying that durable goods \norders were down 3.7 percent in March. People know that when the \nmanufacturing sector, which is an important source of jobs, slows down \ndramatically, it does not bode well for job growth in other sectors of \nthe economy.\n\n  When people hear this drumbeat of bad economic news, it explains why \nthe Consumer Confidence Index fell again in May. When we ask people if \nthe country is on the right course, the majority say it is not on the \nright path. When we ask if they think the President is doing a good job \nwith the economy, they say no, he is not.\n  Confidence is down not just because the American people follow the \nnews and know what is going on in the country, it is because they also \nknow what is going on in their own lives--what they are seeing at home \nand what they are seeing with their families. For many people, they are \nnot earning as much as they had earned in the past. The median \nhousehold income has fallen by over $4,000 since President Obama took \noffice. Meanwhile, the actual costs of everyday living continue to \nrise. More and more people every day are finding that for them and for \ntheir families, they just can't keep up.\n  Today there are more than 46 million Americans on food stamps. That \nis 14 million more than relied on the program in January of 2009 when \nPresident Obama was sworn into office. Sadly, the Congressional Budget \nOffice expects the number to go even higher over the next 2 years. \nWell, that is obviously the wrong direction, and it is a result of bad \ndecisions and bad policies out of the President's administration. Those \npolicies have contributed to the lower wages we are seeing, to higher \nunemployment we are living with, and to more people living in poverty. \nThose policies are contributing as well to the sagging home markets \nthat threaten to keep millions of American families in dire financial \nstraits for years to come. We all know President Obama faced a \ndifficult economic situation when he took office in 2009. His failed \npolicies have not healed our economy. Higher taxes, more bureaucracy, \nmore borrowing, and more wasteful spending by Washington will continue \nto make things worse.\n  When we take a look at what is happening around the world, with \nEurope facing collapse and the global slowdown that threatens our \neconomy, the President seems more concerned with his next election than \nwith actually taking action to make things better. Alongside all the \nbad economic news, ABC News reported the other day that President Obama \nwill continue his record-smashing fundraising schedule--record-smashing \nfundraising schedule. That is not the kind of leadership our economy \nneeds today.\n  Republicans are focused on real solutions: making our Tax Code \nsimpler, flatter, fairer for every American; reducing the debt and the \ndeficit; ending overregulation, the redtape that is burdensome, \nexpensive, and time-consuming; putting patients and doctors--their own \ndoctors--in control of health care and not creating more Washington \nbureaucracy; and, of course, reducing our dependency on foreign oil and \nsending so much American money overseas.\n  Two years ago, when the Obama administration was putting out press \nreleases and staging photo-ops to proclaim the ``recovery summer,'' \nRepublicans were proposing real solutions to help create a healthy \neconomy. When voters had a chance to compare the two approaches that \nNovember--November of 2010--Republicans earned control of the House of \nRepresentatives, and at that time they started passing a jobs agenda.\n  Democrats in the Senate still do not get it, and they have refused to \neven consider these bills passed by the House.\n  There are 27 jobs bills that have passed the House of Representatives \non bipartisan votes. The bills are still today waiting for Senate \naction.\n  The President of the United States remains silent on these bills that \nwould actually get people back to work. He is offering nothing but \nscare tactics, excuses, and blame.\n  He gave another speech today--this very afternoon--in Ohio and what \nhe did was more of that: more scare tactics, excuses, and blame. \nBecause in his mind, it seems it is always someone else's fault.\n  Imagine where our economy would be today if Democrats had been \nwilling to accept commonsense Republican solutions 2 years ago. We \nwould actually be in recovery today. We would have seen significant \nimprovements to the economy. If Democrats had been willing to work with \nus, instead of giving speeches and pushing more wasteful stimulus \nspending, millions of more people would be working today across the \ncountry.\n  If President Obama had been focused on putting people back to work, \ninstead of on keeping his own job, then today--today--in the summer of \n2012, the private sector and the American people really would be doing \nfine.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank my colleague for his remarks. \nI caught part of the President's statement this afternoon and have \ngotten a transcript of some of the things he said.\n  As ranking member on the Budget Committee, as someone who has \nwrestled very intensely with these numbers for 2 years, I was shocked, \nI say to Senator Barrasso, by some of the things he said.\n  I would ask the Senator, based on the world we are in, how he reacts \nto the summary the Presidential adviser gave to the New York Times \nbefore the President's speech today, saying his plan ``focuses on \neducation, energy, innovation, and infrastructure.''\n  First, does that suggest to the Senator spending?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into \na colloquy with my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Just talking about those things, isn't this the same \nPresident who lobbied this body, this Senate, to block the Keystone XL \nPipeline that would have brought energy from our northern neighbor \nCanada to the United States, creating jobs on the ground here in terms \nof construction of that pipeline? So you are talking about energy, and \nyou are talking about construction, and that was not government \nspending. Yet the President lobbied the Senate to block that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There would have been private growth and private \ninvestment--not an increase in our deficit.\n  But it goes on. In their summary of what the President was going to \nsay, it said he favored a ``tax code that creates American jobs and \npays down our debt.''\n  First of all, is the Senator aware that under the President's plan \nthat he submitted to us--his budget--the lowest single year's deficit \nin the 10-year window is $488 billion--that we never come close to \npaying down the debt in the plan he submitted to us? And how can the \nPresident--this is an unfair question, but I will ask the Senator from \nWyoming--how can the President say he has a plan that pays down our \ndebt when the lowest single deficit he proposes is nearly $500 billion?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would say to my colleague, who is on the Budget \nCommittee, who watches these things very\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\ncarefully, as I look at what the President proposed, it never got to \nbalance, it never even addressed dealing with the large deficit, let \nalone the monumental debt. In the time we have been talking here in the \nlast 4 or 5 minutes, we have continued to borrow money from overseas, \nspecifically from China. We in the United States are borrowing at a \nrate of $2 million a minute. Nothing I have seen coming from the \nPresident or from the Democrats, as a matter of fact, in the Senate has \ndealt with any of those things, to the point that we have not passed a \nbudget for the last 3 years in this Senate, which is irresponsible.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It absolutely is.\n  Let me say this, in his speech--this is a quote from the transcript I \nhave of it--he declared:\n\n       Both parties have laid out their policies on the table for \n     all to see.\n\n  Isn't it a fact that the House Republicans passed a long-term budget \nthat would change the debt course of America and three Members of the \nRepublican Senate laid out budgets that would have balanced the budget \nin the United States of America, and that the Democratic leadership \nnever laid out a plan, refused to lay out a plan, and violated a law--\nthe Congressional Budget Act--by refusing to lay out a plan? Isn't that \ntrue? Or am I missing something?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, that is exactly the way I see it. And I voted for \nthe plan that was submitted by the House, which actually does get to a \nbalance of our budget, and the plans of three of our Senate colleagues \nfrom our side of the aisle whose plans also get to a balance of the \nbudget. I voted in favor of all of those. But not one Democrat in the \nSenate--not one Democrat--cast one vote in favor of any one budget, \nwhether it was a Republican budget, whether it was the President's \nbudget. Yet the President goes to Ohio today and gives a speech for 54 \nminutes--and it was supposed to be a big speech on the economy--and I \nheard nothing new, nothing we had not heard before, no new ideas other \nthan to spend more money, at a time when we are $15 trillion in debt, \nand adding to that by the minute.\n  The President did make one interesting statement. He said some of the \nregulations that are coming out--he said all the regulations are not \ngood. Well, who can do anything about it but the President; his \nregulations. And he has over 1,000 new regulations that have come out \nunder his administration that are called economically significant \nregulations--regulations that have an impact to the economy of over \n$100 million. Those regulations, all of that redtape is putting people \nout of work. It provides so much uncertainty to the economy as to what \nis the next regulation that is coming out, where businesses do not have \nthe certainty to go hire people. What is going to happen with the \nhealth care law? Is it going to be found constitutional or \nunconstitutional? I believe it is unconstitutional. What are the costs \ngoing to be to business?\n  In statement after statement that the President makes, it shows there \nis a fundamental question as to his understanding of how the economy \nworks versus people who have been out in the private sector who have \ncreated jobs and have put people to work, who have written the \npaycheck, who have signed the front of the paycheck, who have \nhired folks and helped the economy in a community in a way that makes a \ndifference and builds that community. Yet I do not see those things \ncoming out of the President's speeches, certainly not today in Ohio.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague for those insights because this is \na bit disappointing. It is more than disappointing. The President said, \nagain, that he has a plan, and he has a vision ``of how to create \nstrong, sustained growth,'' and ``how to pay down our long-term debt.'' \nHe does not have such a plan. His plan comes nowhere close to balancing \nthe budget. In 10 years, the lowest single deficit he would have is \n$488 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office--not me, the \nindependent Congressional Budget Office.\n  His statement is not accurate. How can we have a bipartisan \ndiscussion on how to solve the sustained debt threat we have in this \nNation if the President goes around saying his plan will help pay down \nour debt? It does not pay down the debt. It does not come close to \npaying down the debt.\n  He said that last year, and I grilled his Budget Director at a Budget \nCommittee hearing. He could not defend that statement because it is \nindefensible. Nobody can defend that statement. And I say to any Member \nof this Congress, this Senate--a Democratic Member--I urge you to come \ndown and tell me if the plan laid out by the President of the United \nStates--the only plan we have seen, his budget--pays down the debt. It \ndoes not.\n  He goes on to say in this speech:\n\n       I've signed a law--\n\n  Forgive me if this is distressing to me, but we have been involved in \nthe discussion a good long time. We have the U.S. Congress, including \nthe Senate, and we have the President of the United States, and we all \nhave a role in formulating an economic policy for America that will put \nour country on a growth path to eliminate the unsustainable debt course \nwe are on.\n  The statement cited so often from President Obama's own debt \ncommission--Simpson-Bowles--is: This Nation has never faced a more \npredictable financial crisis. Why? Because of the increasing debt, they \nsaid. The numbers are relentless. It is unsustainable. That is what it \nmeans. At some point, it means there will be a credit reaction, a \nfinancial collapse, or a reaction that will put us back into recession \nand distress. They pleaded with us to get off the path we are on.\n  So the President says:\n\n       I've signed a law that cuts spending and reduces our \n     deficit by $2 trillion.\n\n  What does he mean by that? Well, I think most Americans can remember \nthat last August we reached the debt ceiling. We borrowed so much money \nthat we hit the limit of money the U.S. Government can borrow. The \nPresident asked Congress to raise that debt limit so he could keep \nspending and keep borrowing, and basically the Republican House and \nMembers in the Senate--to the extent we had influence--said: Mr. \nPresident, we will raise the debt limit, but we want you to reduce \nspending some. So they agreed, after much debate, in the wee hours of \nthe morning--at the latest possible time--to cut $2.1 trillion in \nspending. The President went kicking and screaming to that point. The \nDemocrats pretended it was a disaster and Americans were going to sink \ninto the ocean. That is what that was all about.\n  Here we came with this plan, and the President now claims it is his \ndeal, that he cut $2 trillion. I remember how it went down, and that is \nnot a fair thing to say. He signed that law because if he did not sign \nit, spending would have to be cut 40 percent immediately, because that \nis how much, out of every dollar we spend, we borrow. We are borrowing \n40 cents of every $1 we spend.\n  So if we had not raised the debt ceiling, the U.S. Government would \nhave had to immediately cut all expenditures by 40 percent. That is why \nwe are on an unsustainable course. It is not a little bitty matter.\n  The President suggests, if you listen to his speech: Don't worry \nabout it. I have a plan. We are moving along fine. You do not have to \nsacrifice. We are going to have more education, energy, innovation, \ninfrastructure. More spending--that is what that means. Investments, \nthey say--that means spending. But we do not have the money. This \ncountry is out of money. This is a serious time. We have to make some \ntough decisions, and we need a Chief Executive telling the American \npeople the truth about where we are, rather than promising some \nbalanced budget and paying down debt when that is nowhere in his plan.\n  He says:\n\n       My own deficit plan would strengthen Medicare and Medicaid \n     for the long haul by slowing the growth of health care costs.\n\n  He has steadfastly refused to reform Medicare and Medicaid. Under \nthis $2.1 trillion, the President insisted that Medicaid not receive a \ndime of cuts. And it did not receive a dime of cuts. The Defense \nDepartment gets a big time hammering under the cuts and the sequester. \nMedicaid--not a dime cut out of it. No reforms in Medicaid that would \nprovide any benefit--anything other than to drive up the cost and \nincrease the cost of Medicaid.\n  So how can he say that? And he has attacked Congressman Ryan, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee in the House, for actually laying out \na vision to try to put Medicare on sound\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\nfooting, where it can actually be sustainable over time.\n  Congressman Ryan has the support of Senator Wyden, a Democratic \nMember of the Senate. He has the support of Alice Rivlin who was \nPresident Clinton's budget director at OMB. Alice Rivlin basically \nagreed with the policy that Congressman Ryan laid out to save Medicare. \nWhat happened? The President called in Congressman Ryan and attacked \nhim on the spot. They are still accusing him of having a radical scheme \nto destroy Medicare. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a \nplan to strengthen Medicare, to save Medicare, and put it on a sound \nbasis so that people working today can be confident that when they \nretire and become eligible for it, it will be there.\n  But we cannot create something from nothing. We have to have a plan \nthat provides the funding for it. This is not smoke and mirrors. \nNothing comes from nothing, I have to tell you.\n  One more thing. The President said, ``I signed a law that cuts \nspending and reduces our deficit by $2 trillion.''\n  Well, he was forced into signing that bill. Did he really want to \nsign it? No, he did not. We all know that. Anyone could tell that from \nreading the newspapers and how the negotiations went. Our big spenders \nresisted that dramatically.\n  How much is $2 trillion over 10 years? We planned to spend $37 \ntrillion over 10 years, increasing the debt by about $10 to $11 \ntrillion. This would have cut it from $37 trillion being spent to $35 \ntrillion being spent. It meant we would have increased the deficit by \nonly $10 to $11 trillion, I guess. Not nearly enough, but at least some \nstep toward reining in soaring spending.\n  So the President bragged on that just a few minutes ago. He is \nbragging about it. What is the real truth? The budget he submitted \neviscerates that agreement. The budget he submitted in February of this \nyear--5 months after the agreement last August--would wipe out the \nentire sequester, would eliminate $1 trillion in cuts, and add more \nspending.\n  In fact, he would add, under that plan, $1.5 trillion more in \nspending than the Budget Control Act agreement he is taking credit for \nsigning would have allowed to be spent. This is not a matter of \ndispute. This is a fact. The budget he has submitted wiped out more \nthan half of the cuts that were in that agreement, and he had big tax \nincreases, about $1.8 trillion in tax increases. So $1.6 trillion more \nin spending than we agreed to just last summer, and $1.8 trillion in \nmore taxes.\n  Tax, spend. Tax, spend. That is this President's philosophy. If he \nwants to stand for that, campaign on that, run on that, well and good. \nBe honest with the American people. But do not come in and take credit \nfor things he resisted. Do not come in and take credit for budget cuts \nthat he proposed to eliminate. How can we have a bipartisan discussion \nto try to reach an agreement on what to do about the unsustainable \ncourse we are on if the President is going out and saying things that \nare not connected to reality? I think it is irresponsible. I really do.\n  I do not see how a President of the United States could possibly not \nspend a great deal of time with the American people explaining to them \nwhy we are all going to have to tighten our belts, that we do not have \nthe money we wish we had, that we are going to have to do this. Is \nthere some sort of political fear that big spenders will ultimately get \ncaught if they tell the truth about how much debt their big spending \nhas caused the country, so they just have to pretend it is not so?\n  Well, they said President Bush had big debt. He did spend too much \nmoney. I criticized him some on that, and none of us are perfect in \nthis Congress. We all voted for things probably we should not have.\n  The largest annual deficit that President Bush ever had was $470 \nbillion. That is big. It is a lot of money.\n  President Obama's deficits have been $1.2, $1.3 trillion all 4 years \nhe has been in office, more than twice President Bush's deficits. He \nhas been in office now 4 years. In the plan he has laid out, even \nassuming our economy continues to grow--as we assume in these budget \nanalyses--he does not come close to balancing the budget.\n  Every year we are adding hundreds of billions of dollars more in \ndebt. The lowest single year in his 10-year plan would add $488 billion \nmore to the debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \ninterest on the debt soars. The largest single increase in spending is \ninterest.\n  Interest last year was $225 billion on the debt, and in the 10th year \nof the President's budget the Congressional Budget Office projects that \nthe interest in that 1 year--10 years from now--will be $743 billion, \nexceeding virtually every item in the government including the Defense \nDepartment.\n  This is not healthy. In May, at a fundraiser--he is going to a lot of \nthose, but sometimes, somebody has to stay home in Washington and bring \nthis wasteful spending under control. He was at a fundraiser in Denver \nand he said, ``I'm running to pay down our debt.'' He said: I am \nrunning to pay down our debt. Do not worry. Let me. I am going to pay \ndown our debt.\n  Well, that is just not what the numbers show. No plan has been laid \nout other than his budget: to tax, spend, and keep the debt on the same \nlevel we were on if he had no changes at all in the budget situation.\n  I am not happy about this. It is very distressing to me that this \nNation is facing a financial crisis. We are all going to have to \nrecognize we do not have the money that we would like to have to spend \nas we would like to spend. I told some people this morning at a \nbreakfast/luncheon, a group from the Air Force Association, that the \ndefense people needed to know we do not have the money. We do not have \nthe money. For years we are going to have to be tightening our belts.\n  But we can work our way through it. We can do the right things. Who \nknows, by producing efficiencies and encouraging productivity, we could \nget our country on a healthier course than we can imagine at this \npoint. I actually think we could. But we have to be honest about the \nsituation. We have to have somebody who stays in the office for a while \nand actually drives the restraints in spending and insists that every \nCabinet Member, sub-Cabinet Member, GSA person going to a resort in Las \nVegas who is spending the taxpayers' money, that they do it with \nrestraint and that wasteful actions are eliminated.\n  That is the kind of leadership we need, and the American people need \nto be told, and we all need to understand, we just do not have the \nmoney we wished we did. So we will have to alter our spending levels \nfor a few years, get this country on a sound path, and create \nconfidence. That will come when the world knows that we have gotten off \nthe unsustainable debt path and gotten on a path that is sustainable, \nare set on a sound path, a path that leads to prosperity, not a path \nthat leads to debt crisis and decline, but growth, prosperity and \nfreedom. That is what it is all about.\n  Forgive me if it is irritating to me. But I did conclude, after \ntoday's speech, that the President has made a decision that he is going \nto run to November. He is going to run on the fact that he is reducing \nthe debt. That is what he has apparently said. ``I'm running to pay \ndown the debt'' is what he said in Denver. He repeated that again \ntoday. So that has to be confronted.\n  If I am wrong, I ask any Member of the Senate to come forward and \nshow me what in the President's plan leads to any conclusion that he \nhas laid out a plan that would pay down the debt of the United States. \nI do not see it. I do not think it is close.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         World War II Veterans\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, George Washington once said:\n\n       The willingness of future generations to serve in our \n     military will be directly dependent upon how we have treated \n     those we have served in the past.\n\n  Tomorrow, 95 World War II veterans will fly from Montana to \nWashington to see their memorial with their own eyes for the first \ntime.\n  This trip is made possible by the Big Sky Honor Flight Program. Their \nmission is to recognize American veterans\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\nby flying them to Washington, DC, to see their memorials at no cost.\n  These veterans, and the volunteers who helped send them here, say a \nlot about what makes the United States of America the greatest country \non Earth.\n  Who are these veterans? Their average age is 90. They hail from all \nparts of our State--from Plentywood to Superior, from Miles City to \nLibby, and many places in between. Each veteran has a story to tell.\n  Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Bill Smith left his job as \nan accountant in Billings and volunteered to fly B 24 Liberator bombers \nwith the 466th Bomb Group.\n  Bill went on to fly 30 missions over Europe from 1943 to 1945. He \nrose through the ranks and eventually took command of an entire crew.\n  On a typical day, Bill and his crew would rise at 4 a.m., eat a quick \nbreakfast, and receive a mission brief. As crew commander, Bill was \nresponsible for seeing to it that the bomber safely navigated enemy \nairspace, accomplished its mission on time and on target, and returned \nto base safely.\n  Bill's B 24 flew at 22,000 feet in subzero temperatures in \nnonpressurized cabins. Think about that. We are not talking about the \ncozy airplane cabins you and I are used to today. We are talking about \nopen air, very loud and very cold cabins.\n  Imagine, if one can, doing all that with Nazi fighters on your tail. \nIn one instance, incoming enemy fire shot the oxygen mask right off the \nface of one of the gunners on Bill's crew.\n  Bill is 96 now. When asked about his service, he said:\n\n       I am proud of what we did. I know we hit a lot of targets. \n     That's what we were there for. We weren't there for a joy \n     ride.\n\n  In March, I had the privilege of meeting Del Olson from Billings. Del \nwas born and raised on a farm in Rapleje, Montana, which is a very \nsmall town.\n  In 1944, Del joined the Women's Army Corps as an airplane mechanic. \nThe Women's Army Corps was the first female unit, besides nurses, to \nserve within the ranks of the U.S. Army. They were patriots and \ntrailblazers. Similar to all trailblazers, their service didn't come \nwithout controversy.\n  Del didn't let the controversy get in the way of her mission. She \ndedicated herself to fixing up bomber aircraft in Texas, which was her \njob, including the B 24 Liberator that Bill Smith was flying over \nEurope.\n  Later in the war, Del moved to Bakersfield, CA, where she worked as a \nnurse caring for the countless wounded warriors.\n  Now, at age 92, when you ask Del about her service, she will tell \nyou, ``I didn't do much during the war. Others did so much more.''\n  Del's humility is a testament to what real selfless service looks \nlike. When Del visits the World War II memorial, she plans to pay her \nrespects to those who made the ultimate sacrifice during the war. Del \nsaid she will think of her brothers, of her sister, who all served \nunder General Eisenhower in Europe. She especially wants to honor her \nfirst and second husbands, both of whom served in the South Pacific \nduring the war.\n  I met with Del and talked with her about coming to Washington, DC, on \nthe Honor Flight. She is such a special lady.\n  When I talked to her, I said: Boy, Del, we have to make sure we raise \nenough money so you get a seat on the plane.\n  She said: Oh, no, no, not me. There are others who are so much more \ndeserving than I am. Not me.\n  That is exactly the kind of selfless attitude she and others who \nserved in World War II have. But she now has a seat. She will be back \nhere in Washington, DC. The first event is tomorrow night, with a \nservice earlier at the memorial tomorrow.\n  But Honor Flights just don't happen automatically. It takes work--a \nlot of work. Kathy Shannon, Beth Bouley, Tina Vauthier, Chris Reinhard, \nVicky Steven, Yellowstone County commissioner Bill Kennedy, and \ncountless other volunteers have all been instrumental in organizing \nMontana's first Honor Flight. Students, friends, neighbors, and \nbusinesses pooled together more than $150,000 to make this happen. In \ntoday's tough times, when families are struggling to make ends meet, \npooling together that kind of contribution is no small feat.\n  This will be the first Honor Flight from Montana, but I know it won't \nbe the last. I know because I have seen the passion and dedication of \nthese volunteers firsthand. In March I had the incredible opportunity \nto pitch in by serving burgers at a fundraiser in Billings. It was a \nlot of fun. It was very inspiring seeing all these folks, inspiring to \nsee our young Montanans demonstrating their spirit of service. For \nexample, students from the Huntley Project Schools raised an amazing \n$2,425 to make this flight happen--just kids. In the process, they \nlearned a valuable lesson about the sacrifices that made it possible \nfor them to grow up strong and free in this country.\n  This Honor Flight visit is larger than just a thank-you to our World \nWar II veterans. It shows the commitment we Americans consider a sacred \nobligation to all our veterans--to those who served on the frozen \nbattlefields of Korea, to the jungles of Vietnam, to the deserts of \nIraq, and to those who on this very day are fighting in the mountains \nof Afghanistan. So I ask the Senate to join me in welcoming these \nheroes to our Nation's Capital this weekend. And a special thanks to \nall 18,000 World War II veterans living in Montana. We are forever \ngrateful for your service and your sacrifice.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that as we honor our veterans, especially \nthose who served during World War II, it is a good reminder to all of \nus here who aspire to public service. In many cases, these veterans put \nthemselves in harm's way, sacrificing themselves for their country, so \nthe very least we can do here in the Senate is to remember our veterans \nwho sacrifice so much, remember our Armed Forces today who serve us so \nwell, and at the very least we should work together as a Senate, as a \nCongress, to solve the problems ahead of us and not be so partisan and \nso divisive, which is clearly not a public service.\n\n\n                            Citizens United\n\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I also would like to say a few \nwords on another important topic impacting our democracy; that is, the \nfreedom of a people to choose their own elected representatives.\n  Today, the Supreme Court is considering a challenge to Montana's 1912 \nCorrupt Practices Act. One hundred years ago, Montanans said, in \npassing legislation, that elections should not be bought by the Copper \nKings. Who were the Copper Kings? They were basically three very \nwealthy corporate titans trying to control copper production in the \nState of Montana, and they virtually controlled our State. Montanans \nsaid: No, elections should not be bought by copper kings or by any \ncorporation. Today, we in Montana say the same thing.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United \ncleared the way for unlimited out-of-State corporations throughout the \ncountry. I applaud Montana's attorney general Steve Bullock for \nsticking up for Montanans as the Supreme Court takes a closer look at \nthis case. I have introduced a constitutional amendment to limit \ncorporate campaign expenditures, and I have supported every piece of \ncampaign reform legislation that has come before me.\n  As the Supreme Court looks at Montana's 1912 Corrupt Practices Act \ntoday, it is my hope that Montana can continue to lead the Nation in \nsaying that elections belong in the hands of the people, not out-of-\nState foreign corporations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Improving the Economy\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, a week or so ago, I was being interviewed \nby CNN. I think it was a couple days after the jobs report had come out \nfor the month of May. The reporter who was interviewing me was \ncommenting on those job numbers--which I think were disappointing to \nall of us--and asking me if we were back in the soup, were we heading \nback into a recession. Instead of continuing to recover from a\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\nreally deep, awful recession, an awfully hard, tough recession, would \nwe go back into the soup? And I said to her that I know there are \npeople in my State and across the country who are still hurting, still \nsuffering. People have lost jobs, and in too many cases people have \nlost their homes and are fearful of losing their health care and not \nbeing able to maybe send their son or daughter back to school. And I \nsaid that I realize we still have more pain in our country, more than \nany of us would like.\n  But, I said, maybe there are four things we should keep in mind:\n  No. 1, let's not talk ourselves back into a recession, which we have \nthe ability to do. Our hair is not on fire. Let's continue to make sure \nwe are looking at the underlying fundamentals of the economy, and while \nthey are not universally up or upbeat, the underlying fundamentals are \nnot entirely bad either. Our energy costs are way down. We are not just \nthe Saudi Arabia of coal, we are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. We \nare now a net exporter of oil, and we are seeing significant reductions \nover the last half-dozen or so years in our dependence on foreign oil, \nfrom about 60 percent of the oil we use being from foreign sources to \napproaching 40 percent. So the movement is right.\n\n  Another underlying factor is the cost of health care in this country. \nFor years we have seen double-digit increases in the rate of health \ncare costs in this country, and last year health care costs in this \ncountry rose by only 4 percent. That is a positive factor as we try to \nbe more competitive with the rest of the world.\n  Another factor is the difference in labor costs between our country \nand other countries with which we compete, one of them China and \nanother, believe it or not, Vietnam--a very low-cost producer of \nmanufactured products. What we have seen in those other countries--\nVietnam, China, and some of the other Asian countries--is that their \nwage levels have come up, and our wage levels in this country have \npretty much remained the same. As a result, the inducements for \ncompanies here, particularly manufacturing companies, to move offshore \ntheir manufacturing operations have diminished from where they were a \ncouple of years ago.\n  I think those are all encouraging factors, again, to lay the \ngroundwork for a sustained economic recovery, if our friends in Europe \ncan work their way through, navigate their way through their problems \nin places such as Greece and Spain. So it is not all bad news. It is \nnot all bad news.\n  In the near term, what should we do? Again, No. 1, not talk ourselves \nback into a recession. No. 2, prepare to hit a home run. From a guy who \nlikes baseball a lot, we need to hit a home run. I don't think we will \nhit a home run here in this Chamber, in this building, in this city \nbefore the election.\n  But the best thing, in my view, we can do for the economy is to adopt \na bipartisan, comprehensive deficit reduction deal, much like that \nproposed by the deficit commission led by Erskine Bowles, former Chief \nof Staff to President Clinton, and by former U.S. Senator from Wyoming, \nRepublican Alan Simpson--the so-called Bowles-Simpson Deficit Reduction \nPlan. That plan provides for $4 trillion to $5 trillion in deficit \nreduction over the next 10 years--$3 on the spending side for every $1 \non the revenue side. That actually lowers both corporate and individual \ntax rates. It lowers the rates and bottoms the base of income that is \ntaxable, eliminating half of our so-called tax exemptions, tax breaks, \ntax deductions, tax credits, and tax loopholes.\n  That is how we end up with lower rates both on the corporate and \nindividual sides, and also actually creating revenue: $1 for every $3 \nof spending reduction. That is a home run. I don't know if we are going \nto hit that home run before the election, but sometime between the day \nafter the election and, hopefully, by the end of the year we will adopt \nsomething similar to that and provide certainty: One, can we govern? \nYes, we can. Two, can we be fiscally responsible? Yes, we can. Three, \ncan we provide certainty with respect to our Tax Code? Yes, we can. I \nthink the adoption of that kind of plan answers all those questions \nwith, yes, we can. And we are.\n  But while we prepare to hit a home run, I don't think we ought to \nwait around until the end of the year to do something. In the meantime, \nwe need to hit a lot of singles. So rather than hitting a home run with \nrunners on base, let's see if we can't hit some singles and maybe some \ndoubles and score some runs for the economy.\n  I spend a lot of time, as my colleagues will tell folks, on how to \ncreate a more nurturing environment here for job creation and job \npreservation. How do we do that? Our friend, John Chambers from West \nVirginia, a native of West Virginia--as am I--who now heads up Cisco, a \nbig technology company, likes to say the jobs of the 21st century will \ngo to those States and those countries that do two things especially \nwell: One, a productive workforce--students who can read, write, think, \ndo math and science coming out of our high schools, coming out of our \ncolleges and universities, into the workforce; and, the States and \nnations that do another thing very well; that is, create a world-class \ninfrastructure; broadly defined, roads, highways, bridges, transit, \nrail, port, airports, waterways, water treatment, broadband--all of the \nabove, broadly defined infrastructure.\n  In addition to that, there are a number of other things we can do to \nprovide a nurturing environment, and they include cost-effective \nregulations, commonsense regulations, access to leaders like us.\n  Another positive development in job creation and job preservation is \naccess to capital, the ability to actually borrow money for businesses, \nlarge and small, at reasonable rates; the ability to export into \nforeign markets and to get financing for those exports if they need it; \nincentives to do basic research and development that actually can be \ncommercialized and create products that we can sell around the world. \nThose are some of the things that actually contribute to a nurturing \nenvironment--not all, not the only things, but some of them.\n  The other thing that we can do in terms of hitting singles and \ndoubles is some things that we have done in this Chamber this year, and \nI want to mention a few of those. They include actually doing something \nabout our aviation infrastructure.\n  When we passed the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization \nearlier this year, we not only provided for a source of revenues--\nprovided by the general aviation community and the civilian airlines \nhere, the sorts of revenues to upgrade, modernize, and improve \nairports--but we also provided money to bring an analogue air traffic \ncontrol system into the 21st century, arguably a digital system. So \nthat is one in terms of a more nurturing environment.\n  No. 2, I actually said the idea that in the past, if someone comes up \nwith an idea--like this young woman who is typing down my words on the \nfloor today. If she comes up with a good idea and goes to the Patent \nOffice--in the past she could go to the Patent Office and say: I have a \ngreat idea--maybe for a better machine than the one she is taking down \nmy words with here today--and she files for a patent on that machine. A \nyear later, I show up at the Patent Office and say: No, that was really \nmy idea, and I thought of it first. She just filed first, but I really \nhad it first. I end up going and litigating with her, and it may string \nout for months, years, and provide a lot of uncertainty. I don't have a \npatent, but I just want to be bought out and basically paid off. Maybe \nI had the idea first, but in a lot of cases I didn't, and I want to be \ngiven something of financial consequence so I will go away.\n  We have changed that with the law we passed here and the President \nsigned that says: Whoever files first--if she files first for that new \nmachine, it is her patent. It is an important thing for us to do with \nrespect to providing certainty for innovation and creativity.\n  Another thing we did that I think is a smart idea is we said: We are \nhaving a hard time selling our goods and services in places such as \nSouth Korea, Panama, Colombia, and a lot of other places around the \nworld. We negotiated in the Bush administration--with George W. Bush--\nand further in the Obama administration, free-trade agreements with \nSouth Korea, Panama, and with Colombia. They have been approved by the \nSenate, agreed to by the President, and they are now the\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\nlaw of our land and the lands of those free countries.\n  What does it mean for us and South Korea, a place where they sold to \nus last year 500,000 cars, trucks, and vans; a country we sold 5,000 \ncars, trucks, and vans to? That is going to change, and their ability \nto keep our vehicles out will phase out over time, and we will have the \nopportunity to sell our vehicles there just as they have the ability to \nsell their vehicles here.\n  We will have the ability to sell poultry products. We raise a lot of \npoultry on the Delmarva Peninsula in Delaware. We will have the ability \nto sell poultry products into countries such as Panama and Colombia \nwithout impediment and tariff barriers to keep them out.\n  So the idea to provide better access to foreign markets, we have done \nthat at least with respect to those three, and we are trying to \nnegotiate now something called the Transpacific Partnership, which \nwould allow a number of countries in this hemisphere--including us and \nmaybe Chile and a couple other countries south of us, maybe even Canada \nand Mexico--to create a trading partnership with countries such as \nMalaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, and a couple of other \ncountries over there.\n  I am told the Japanese are interested in being part of that as well. \nThat could be an enormous new global partnership that would enhance \ntrade between all the countries that are a part of it.\n  Another piece of legislation for a single that we have hit over here \nis something called the JOBS Act. You may recall that IPO onramp--\ninitial public offering--for changing the shareholder threshold, \nraising it from 500 shareholders to 2,000, something I worked on. The \nIPO onramp will make it easier for companies, if they want to \ngo public, to do so.\n\n  John Carney, a Congressman from Delaware, worked on that in the House \nand did a very nice job. But that is legislation endorsed by the \nPresident, supported by Democrats and Republicans, now the law of the \nland--another single, maybe a double, I don't know--where middle-sized \ncompanies and smaller companies that want to grow either remain \nprivately held or become publicly traded.\n  Other potential singles and doubles are the postal legislation that \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Collins, Senator Brown, and myself and \nothers have worked on to try to save the Postal Service, which is \nlosing $25 million a day in the 21st century. We have a pretty good \nidea on how to stem that hemorrhaging and how to help them help \nthemselves become sustainable again in a break-even operation. That \nlegislation, a bipartisan bill, passed the Senate and was sent over to \nthe House awaiting action. We need for the House to take up that \nlegislation. If they do, that is something that can help save and \npreserve 7 to 8 million jobs and affect a significant part of our \ncountry.\n  Another potential double--maybe even a triple--is transportation \nlegislation and the 2 or 3 million jobs that flow from that. A lot of \ntransportation projects in my State and 49 other States are literally \ngrinding to a halt because of the inability, in this case, of the House \nto agree with bipartisan legislation that we passed in the Senate to \nfund and to go forward with transportation projects in all 50 States \nthat nobody is arguing with. They are not bridges to nowhere. They are \nactually smart ideas, and a lot of them involve State funding as well, \nbut they need some Federal help.\n  We passed it in the Senate, and the House has sort of gone to \nconference with it. But we are having a tough time getting to yes. If \nthey do, that is a double or triple with runners on base, 2 to 3 \nmillion jobs.\n  Those are things that we can do to actually enhance and nurture the \nenvironment for economic growth, for job creation, job preservation in \nthis State.\n  There is one more single or double I want to talk about, and it is \nthe agriculture legislation. We have an agriculture bill that has been \nbrought out of committee by a big bipartisan vote. It would enable us \nto do what I think we need to do in a lot of areas of our government; \nthat is, get better results for less money. I like to say in everything \nwe do, everything I do, I know I can do better. I think the same is \ntrue of my 99 colleagues. I believe that is true of most Federal \nprograms. One of our challenges is to figure out how to get better \nresults for everything we do.\n  Today we had a very interesting hearing on the Medicaid Program and \nhow to get better results for less money with respect to Medicaid and \nhow we reduce improper payments--mistakes and so forth--and how we \nreduce fraud losses, which are about 10 percent of what we spend in \nMedicaid and Medicare. But a recurring theme for me and for the \nsubcommittee I lead on Federal financial management in the Senate is \nhow do we get better results in almost everything we do for less money \nor better results for the same amount of money? That is not a \nDemocratic idea, it is not a Republican idea, it is not a liberal idea \nor a conservative idea. It is just a smart idea.\n  In a day and age of these trillion-dollar deficits--and deficits are \ncoming down, but it is still too high. While we wait to do that big \ndeal, hit that home run with something like the Bowles-Simpson Deficit \nCommission recommendation later this year, we need to continue to hit \nsingles in terms of reducing spending taxpayers' money in a smart and \nmore cost-effective way.\n  That brings us to the legislation that has been before the Senate \nthis week, and that is the Agriculture bill. Believe it or not, in \nDelaware, our little State, we have 300 million people in about 100 \nmiles from one end to the other, north-south, right here on the Mid-\nAtlantic between Washington, DC and New York City. For us, agriculture \nis still a big deal. We don't have a lot of cows--we have some. We \ndon't have a lot of hogs--we have some. What we have a lot of is \nchickens. We have a lot of chickens.\n  For every person who lives in my State, there are 300 chickens. As \nyou go from north to south, the chickens have us outnumbered even more \nthan 300 to 1.\n  Eighty percent of our agricultural economy in Delaware is poultry \nrelated. The poultry industry doesn't need a lot or ask for a lot in \nterms of support or investment from the Federal Government. But we \nraise a lot of corn and soybeans in Delaware, and so we care about \nagriculture and we care about the farm bill. Other parts of the country \ncare about it even more, maybe, than we do. But I want to talk about it \nfor a few more minutes before I head back to my office.\n  I am here today to say that the farm bill that has been before us \nthis week, when compared to the ones that have come before it in recent \nyears, makes great strides toward reforming a process that was too \noften--and I think rightly--criticized as regressive and, \nunfortunately, wasteful.\n  All told, the bill that has been brought to the floor--a bipartisan \nbill. Great kudos to the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the \nSenate, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and the Ranking Republican \nSenator, Pat Roberts from Kansas. They have done great work in steering \nthis legislation through committee, again with strong bipartisan \nsupport, and bringing it to the Senate floor, saving the Federal \nGovernment almost $24 billion over the next 10 years compared to what \nwe would otherwise be spending under current law.\n  The legislation eliminates wasteful spending by getting rid of the \nso-called direct payments program, which too often gave money to \nfarmers even when farmers didn't grow anything or even own the land. \nBut I think the bill is also humane, and this legislation is not unfair \nto our farmers. I believe it embraces the Golden Rule of treating other \npeople the way we want to be treated, and that includes farmers and \nfarm families and taxpayers.\n  But instead of continuing the direct payments program that has \nprevailed for years, this legislation institutes a new crop insurance \nprogram, a long sought after goal by those of us wanting to make \nprogressive changes to farm law.\n  Instead of giving money to farmers who, again, sometimes don't grow \neven a single crop in a year, this legislation only helps farmers when \nthey actually experience a loss on the crops they are actually growing.\n  For a lot of people in this country, that would just sound like \ncommon sense. But in Washington, DC, and across the country, it is an \nuncommon approach to farm legislation. This is a much smarter approach.\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\n  In the end, the new crop insurance program, the Agriculture bill \nbefore the Senate this week, still would give farmers the security they \nneed to continue farming. There is a lot of uncertainty in farming. Is \nit going to rain? Is it going to be cold? Are we going to have hail? \nAre we going to have drought? There is a huge amount of uncertainty, \nand it is important for us--to the extent that we can reasonably do \nthat--to reduce uncertainty and lack of predictability for all kinds of \nbusinesses. It is hard to do that. We don't control the weather; we \ndon't control the temperature--well, indirectly maybe. But to the \nextent that we can help provide some certainty, security, and \npredictability for the farmers at a lower cost to the taxpayers, we \nought to do that.\n  I think this committee has pretty well thought that through and \nfigured out a way to do crop insurance--an old program--with a new \napproach, a smarter approach that is good for farmers and, I think, \ngood for taxpayers.\n  Another thing this legislation focuses on is nutrition and how we can \nencourage farmers to grow and people to eat more healthful foods as \npart of their daily diets.\n  We live in a country where, sadly, one-third of the American people \nare overweight or on their way to being overweight, and maybe on their \nway to being obese--about one-third of us. The trend is not good.\n  In terms of cost for health care, it is killing us: Medicaid costs, \ndialysis, diabetes, hospitalization, loss of limbs, loss of eyesight, \nand for our ability to fund Medicare, again, the same kind of \nchallenges and hardships in the ability for us to compete with the rest \nof the world when we are so much heavier than they are. We know the \nfour major cost factors in health care are, No. 1, weight; No. 2, \ntobacco; No. 3, high blood pressure; No. 4, high cholesterol. If we \ncould do a better job on all those fronts, we would be off to the races \non our health care costs. We are making some progress bringing health \ncare costs down.\n\n  Believe it or not, this agricultural legislation is part of the \nsolution because it, among other things, encourages us to eat a diet \nthat is more healthy for us. This bill doesn't mandate what people eat, \nbut it helps to encourage and provide ways to make healthier foods \navailable, nutritious foods available in places such as health deserts. \nThere are some communities, some cities around the country, where the \nonly grocery store they have in their community is a convenience store. \nThere is nothing wrong with convenience stores, but if that is the only \nplace one can buy fruits and vegetables, and they don't have them--\nmaybe bananas if one is lucky--that is not good.\n  This effort, along with the First Lady Michelle Obama, will be \nreducing those food deserts. It includes support for programs that help \nfarmers produce fruits and fresh vegetables. In our State, we raise not \nonly corn and soybeans, we raise a lot of fruits and vegetables, most \nnotably watermelons, but we do a few lima beans and other products as \nwell. We grow most of those in the summer, some in the fall and the \nspring, but we will be able to bring it to market in ways that benefit \nfarmers and consumers and also support programs such as Farm to School, \nwhere we actually bring fresh fruits and vegetables from our farms to \nschools to feed our students.\n  We also talk a lot around here, as my colleagues know, about reducing \nour dependence on foreign oil. As I said earlier, dependence on foreign \noil in this country has dropped from about 6 years ago; a half dozen \nyears ago, 60 percent of our oil was from foreign sources; now we are \nturning down toward 40 percent. We hopefully will be there in another \nyear or two. But this legislation, the agriculture bill, actually helps \nmove us in that direction where we are lessening our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  It includes legislation I joined Senator Stabenow in introducing \nearlier this year that would support the expansion of products made in \ncountry from bio-based material, such as the renewable chemicals made \nfrom plant material which can be used to displace petroleum and our \nplastics.\n  The DuPont Company, which is a major employer in our State--frankly, \none of the great companies in this country for the last 200 years and \naround the world--does great work, exciting work not only in figuring \nout how to use corn, get more yield off an acre of land--as much as 300 \nbushels off an acre of land. Thirty years ago, a farmer was doing good \nif an acre was getting 50 bushels. Now DuPont has these experimental \nfarms where they are getting 300 bushels off an acre of land, so we can \nfeed ourselves and fuel ourselves. Not only that, we can take the \ncorn--the cornstalks, the leaves, the corncobs--and turn that into \ncellulosic ethanol. We can also take the byproduct of some of the \nvegetables and some of the plants we are raising to create carpeting, \nas attractive as the carpeting in this Chamber, and clothing. One of \nthe great growth businesses for DuPont, at least, is using plant life \nto create carpets and not to have to depend on petroleum to do that. It \nis very exciting. It reduces our dependence on oil, particularly on \nforeign oil.\n  It also creates new jobs in communities across our country, including \nmy State and I suspect including Minnesota, where our Presiding Officer \nis from.\n  Another key investment this bill continues, although it is at a \nsomewhat reduced Federal level from what we saw in the 2008 farm bill, \nis the agricultural bill's investment in conservation. Conservation and \nthe preservation of agricultural lands are the key to the future of \nagriculture in every State but are especially important in a little \nState such as Delaware. These investments are also particularly \ncritical to regions such as the Chesapeake Bay to our west, which \nDelawareans and Marylanders and Virginians especially are working hard \nto restore and to protect.\n  I might mention, if I could, in terms of conservation, we had a big \nproblem in our State. People like to come to Delaware. We have great \nbeaches, Cape Henlopen and Lewes and Rehobeth and Dewey and Bethany on \ndown to Fenwick Island. People come to our State a lot of times because \nthey want to retire there, maybe have a beach house in the summer and \nthen decide they want to live in Delaware. We have had a lot of demand \nfor housing in the southern part of our State crowding out some of our \nagricultural land. We are concerned about what does that do for open \nspaces and preserving our agriculture land.\n  When I was privileged to be Governor, initially proposed by Mike \nCastle, our previous Governor, we wrote a program to preserve our \nagricultural land. We have invested a fair amount of tax dollars in \nDelaware, with broad support from people who live in the suburbs and \nthe cities as well as farmers, to preserve the farmland and we have \npreserved a lot of it. I am very proud of that. One of the best ways to \npreserve farmland is to make sure farmers can make money off the land \nthey are farming. If they are able to make a good income in good years \nand bad years, if they have ways to get extra sources of income from \nthe farms--which include raising corn that can be turned to a \ncellulosic biofuel and help fuel our country or provide the materials \nthat are needed to create carpeting or clothing or to be a place we can \nbuild maybe windmill farms or solar energy and deploy those and harvest \nthat as well as crops, those are ways to supplement the income of our \nfarmers and promote conservation.\n  Beyond that, the bill we are looking at does focus some good \nattention, appropriate attention, on encouraging and nurturing \nconservation. I mentioned earlier, we have about 1 million people in \nDelaware and about 300 chickens for every person. About 60 percent of \nthe cost, I am told, of raising a chicken is the cost of feed. In \nrecent years, the cost of feed, including the cost of corn, has risen \ndramatically. Our new pages who are here for a 3-week period are \nanxious to know how much it costs to feed a chicken. We can actually \ntake a chicken from the time it comes out of an egg and in about 7 \nweeks or so it is ready to actually go to market. But what do we feed \nthem in the meantime? We feed them a lot of corn and we feed them a lot \nof soybeans. We have seen the cost of corn go from maybe a couple bucks \nfor a bushel of corn to rise to as much as maybe $7 or $8 a bushel of \ncorn. We have seen soybeans go from about $5 a bushel to as high as $12 \nor $13 a bushel. It is hard\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\nto pay that kind of money for corn and soybeans to feed chickens, to \nraise chickens, and make money. We have lost a major poultry integrator \nin our State and other places because of the difficulty in feeding the \nchickens with the high cost of corn and soybeans. About 60 percent of \nthe cost of raising a chicken is corn and about another 20 percent is \nsoybeans. It is a tough business when those prices have doubled and \nactually tripled. They are coming back down. We are working hard to \nbring them down, but they increased a strain on the poultry business \nand made a very profitable business in some places unprofitable.\n\n  That is why Senator John Boozman of Arkansas and I have introduced an \namendment to the bill we hope to be adopted, folded into the bill, that \nmakes a priority at USDA research to improve the efficiency, the \ndigestibility and nutritional value of food for poultry and livestock, \nincluding corn, soybean meal, grains, and grain byproducts. By \nimproving the feed that is used to raise our chickens, and I might add \nother livestock, hogs and cattle and so forth, we can provide the \npoultry and the livestock industries with a great variety of feed \nchoices to use in their operations which will ultimately help provide \nrelief to those producers that rely heavily on their commodities in \ntheir operations and still provide healthy food.\n  Let me go back to where I started; that is, to ask then how do we get \nbetter results with less money in everything we do or maybe for the \nsame amount of money? I think that every day I am here. I know many of \nmy colleagues do as well. The bill before us, the agriculture bill, \nseeks to answer that question in a number of ways. They do help us get \nbetter results for less money, not just a better result for the \ntaxpayer but I think maybe a better health result, reducing somewhat \nthis upward trend toward obesity, making sure people who are not eating \nthe kind of healthy foods they need, particularly fruits and \nvegetables, have access to fruits and vegetables. On both those counts, \nthis legislation helps not just to serve farmers who are literally the \nlifeblood of this country but the rest of us too, including taxpayers.\n  I will wrap up where I started. I asked the sort of rhetorical \nquestion of how is the economy doing, and we are still struggling. To \nsome extent, it is better than it was, but we know folks are having, in \nsome parts of the country, including some parts of my State, a tough \ntime finding a job, keeping a job, being able to keep their house and \nmake sure their kids can go to college, make sure they have health \ncare. We know there are challenges. We should be ever mindful of that.\n  I would say, though, in terms of moving out of the recession, the \nunderlying fundamentals of the economy are not all bad, and we should \nkeep that in mind. One of the surest ways to talk ourselves into \nanother recession--having just come out of the Great Depression, we can \nnow talk ourselves into depression. We can talk ourselves into a \nrecession. We don't need to do that. We have seen consistent job growth \nin the private sector side for over 24 months, manufacturing jobs for \nover 30 months. We need to keep a balanced view, knowing there is still \nwork to be done.\n  In baseball parlance, I was talking to a guy up here who follows the \nMinnesota Twins, the Presiding Officer pretty much. My guess is he is \njoined by the former Governor and now Senator from North Dakota. My \nguess is he might be a Twins fan too. I am not sure.\n  I got a thumbs up.\n  We pull for the Phillies. I pull for the Tigers as well, for some \nreason I will not bore everyone with today.\n  But we need to hit a home run to get the economy moving, and in my \nview the home run is bipartisan, comprehensive, balanced deficit \nreduction, not unlike the Bowles-Simpson Commission recommendation. \nWhen the elections are over, we can move and pass something along those \nlines before the end of the year. For me, that is a home run with men \non base.\n  In the meantime, there are a bunch of things we do to get singles, \ndoubles, and get the economy moving to create that nurturing \nenvironment; do what needs to be done and finish with our \ntransportation legislation to keep 2 or 3 million people working. The \nHouse has been less willing to help us find a good compromise, and they \nneed to--as well as postal legislation, which supports an industry of 7 \nor 8 million people.\n  We passed bipartisan legislation 2 months ago, and we are still \nwaiting for the House to move the bill 8 months after they reported the \nbill out of the committee. We need to get on with that. If they do that \nand we get a good compromise on a bipartisan bill on transportation, we \npreserve 2 or 3 million jobs, free a lot of money for transportation \nall over the country. That would be great. On the postal side, help the \nPostal Service rein in its deficits, move toward self-sufficiency and \nmake sure there are 7 or 8 million jobs remaining there and the \nindustry is strengthened.\n  The last thing we need to do is find a way, focus every day on how to \nget better results on everything we do. How do we do that? Not just \ndefense spending, defense projects, not just education, not just \ntransportation, not just environment, not just agriculture but all of \nthe above.\n  This bill doesn't help us rein in the growth in some other areas, but \nit sure does in respect to agriculture. It saves us about $24 billion \nabove what we would otherwise spend over the next 10 years. I think \nthat moves us in the right direction, in terms of healthy Americans, to \nbe a trimmer, less-obese population, and a healthier population by \nvirtue of eating our spinach and our broccoli and a lot of other \nvegetables and fruits that are making us healthier and maybe a little \nbit leaner than we would otherwise be.\n  I think that pretty well wraps up what I wanted to say today. I think \nmaybe I should yield the floor to my friend from North Dakota, a \nrecovering Governor and a good man. I am happy to yield the floor for \nhim at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank my esteemed colleague, who is not only a Senator \nbut a former Governor as well.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on the farm bill. I think we have a \nreal opportunity to pass a farm bill that will not only reduce the \ndeficit but provide strong support for our farmers and ranchers. Right \nnow at this point, there is something like 250 amendments that have \nbeen filed on the farm bill. Some are good, others are probably not so \ngood, and certainly many amendments have been filed by both parties. \nSome of them are germane, meaning they actually relate to the farm \nbill, and many of them are not. That means if we are going to get a \nfarm bill, we have to find a way to work through these amendments and \ncome to agreement on the amendments as far as the ones that will be \nvoted on, and that is going to take some compromise on the part of both \nparties. I mean that. We have to come together in a bipartisan way and \ncome up with an agreement so we can have a reasonable number of \namendments brought forward and we can vote on those amendments and pass \na farm bill. We should be able to do it. We absolutely should be able \nto get that done because this bill accomplishes some very important \nthings for our country.\n  As I said, this bill saves money. It saves $23.6 billion that will \nhelp with the deficit and the debt. It also provides a very strong farm \nprogram for our farmers and ranchers, and that is important not only \nfor our farmers and ranchers but for every American. It is important \nfor every single American. Good farm policy not only benefits farmers \nand ranchers, it benefits all Americans.\n  First, we have the highest quality, lowest cost food supply in the \nworld, bar none. We have the highest quality, lowest cost food supply \nin history. Every American benefits from that.\n  Second, it is a jobs bill. We are talking about millions of jobs, \nboth on a direct basis and on an indirect basis. If we talk about small \nbusinesses, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of small \nbusinesses across this country in every State. For farmers and ranchers \nand all of the businesses that go with farming and ranching, it is \nhundreds of thousands of businesses. So it really is a jobs bill at a \ntime when we need to get our economy going and we need to get people \nback to work.\n  It is also about national security. Think how important it is that we \nbe\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\nable to rely on our own farmers and ranchers across this country for \nour food supply. We are not beholden to other countries or relying on \nother countries, particularly countries that may have very different \ninterests than we have for our food supply. It really is an issue of \nnational security as well.\n  So for all of these reasons and more, we need to move forward on this \nfarm bill. We are talking about legislation that affects every single \nAmerican.\n  In addition, this is a cost-effective bill. It provides strong \nsupport to our farmers and ranchers, but, as I said, it also provides \nreal savings to help with our deficit and debt. Agriculture is doing \nits part to help reduce the deficit. I would like to go through the \nnumbers for just a minute to demonstrate that.\n  On an annual basis, the farm bill is about $100 billion out of a $3.7 \ntrillion budget. So it is $100 billion out of a $3.7 trillion budget, \nbut the portion that goes to farm programs and really goes to \nagriculture to maintain this network of farms and ranches across the \ncountry is only about $20 billion--actually less than $20 billion out \nof an annual budget of $3.7 trillion. Now, 80 percent of the farm bill, \nper se, is nutrition payments.\n  So let's go through these numbers. How does the farm bill score? How \ndo we get what is really spent and where it is spent and the savings \nthat we generate with this new legislation? The farm bill is scored, of \ncourse, over 10 years by the CBO. The total cost is $960 billion. Out \nof that 80 percent-plus is nutrition, primarily SNAP, which is the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the School Lunch \nProgram. So approximately $800 billion of that score is nutrition. Less \nthan $200 billion of the score relates to the farm program portion of \nthe farm bill. But, as we know, the farm bill is actually a 5-year \nlegislation, not a 10-year legislation. So the actual cost is half \nthat; it is $480 billion in total. Approximately $400 billion of that \ngoes to the nutrition programs I talked about. Less than $100 billion \nover 5 years or less than $20 billion a year is actually the farm \nprogram portion of the bill.\n  Back to the savings. There is $23.6 billion saved out of the portion \nthat is less than--or mostly out of the portion that is about $200 \nbillion. In fact, out of what are truly farm programs--the commodity \ntitle and crop insurance--we are talking about $15 billion in \nreductions and another $6 billion in reductions out of the conservation \nprograms. Again, those two programs alone are $21 billion of the $23 \nbillion, and only about $4 billion in total comes out of the nutrition \nprograms. Again, on a 5-year basis, cut that in half. We are reducing \nby 10 percent the funding that goes to support the farm program. That \nis a significant reduction.\n  Let's go back to my point about all of these amendments we have. We \nhave on the order of 250 amendments, and we have to get through them \nand have some agreement, again on a bipartisan basis, as to the \namendments that will be brought forward and voted on as part of this \npackage.\n  We have the core bill that came out of the Agriculture Committee. It \ncame out of the Agriculture Committee with a strong bipartisan vote--16 \nto 5--and that is for the underlying legislation. We have these 250 \namendments. We have to somehow get together, come to the floor, and \nhave a reasonable vote on these amendments--some will pass and some \nwill not--and move this legislation forward.\n  As I said, while many of the amendments relate to the farm program \nportion of the farm bill, they either seek to further reduce the cost \nof the bill or seek to improve the bill. Regarding the cost of the \nbill, as I have just explained, the farm program portion of the bill is \nless than $20 billion a year, and we have already saved 10 percent. We \nare already reducing 10 percent. So no amount of amending for \nadditional savings is going to make a large difference on the $3.7 \ntrillion budget.\n  Further, as I said, since we already reduced the 10 percent, \nagriculture is doing its part to help with the deficit. For example, \nthink if we went through the rest of the budget and were able to secure \na 10-percent reduction out of all of the other portions of the budget, \nright? Again, my point being, of course, we have to find savings, but \nwe are doing it in agriculture, and we are doing it in a big way. It \ntruly is a cost-effective measure.\n  There are also amendments that seek to improve the bill. Here I go \nback to the old saying that perfect is the enemy of good. I get that \nthere are a lot of amendments and everybody wants their amendment \npassed, but no amount of amending this bill is going to make it \nperfect. What this bill does is it already builds on the strengths of \nthe existing farm program and makes the program stronger.\n  The heart of this bill is enhanced crop insurance. That is what \nproducers across this country told us over and over again that they \nwant. It is what they need to continue to do the very best possible job \nto produce the food supply we rely on throughout this country and many \nother countries throughout the world. Enhanced crop insurance is the \nrisk tool they want. It is a market-based approach, and it is cost-\neffective.\n  In fact, we enhanced crop insurance with what we call the \nsupplemental coverage option. Essentially what we do in this farm bill \nis we say we are going to build on the core and strength of the \nexisting farm program because that is what the farmers and ranchers of \nthis country have told us they want.\n  As it is now, the farmer goes out and buys his crop insurance and \ninsures up to the level he thinks is appropriate. He tries to make the \nbest decision he can, all conditions considered, and buys the crop \ninsurance on a cost-effective basis. But the higher level he insures, \nthe more costly it becomes to insure. So we add a new element to this \nbill, and it is called the supplemental coverage option. Essentially \nwhat it does is once the farmers purchase their crop insurance at \nwhatever level they feel is cost-effective, then they can buy a \nsecondary policy on top of that to insure at a higher level on a cost-\neffective basis. It is not farm-level coverage, it is countywide \ncoverage that makes it more cost-effective. If the farmer has a \ndisaster, it truly makes sure the farmer can continue in business. So \nthey are able to buy crop insurance in a way that affords them better \ncoverage.\n  In addition, the legislation provides help with shallow or repetitive \nlosses that farmers sometimes face due to weather. That coverage is \ncalled ARC, or the Agriculture Risk Coverage Program. These are \nvoluntary programs. These are an effort to make sure farmers and \nranchers can insure like other types of businesses and continue even \nwhen weather conditions make it very hard for them to farm or ranch, \nnot only in a given year but if they face weather difficulties over a \nperiod of time.\n  I know some of the Senators from the Southern States think that in \nthis bill for their farmers, particularly for peanuts and rice and to \nsome extent cotton--although there is a STAX program for cotton--there \nneeds to be more price protection. In fact, we are working with them to \ndo just that. We have offered amendments that I think we are making \nreal progress on that will help them with some of the price protection \nthey want for the southern crops, particularly peanuts and rice. As I \nsaid, they do have a product that I think they feel works for cotton, \nbut this would provide additional price protection for cotton as well.\n  Again, I believe we are reaching out and doing what we need to do \nwith southern producers. I hope we can get their support on this bill \nas part of getting an amendment package that we can agree to and move \nforward on the bill.\n  The other point that I think is very important to keep in mind \nrelative to southern growers is that they will have additional \nopportunity in the House for some of the improvements they may feel \nthey need in the bill even though, as I say, I think the underlying \nbill itself is very strong, and we have, I believe, come to some \nagreement or gotten very close to some amendments that will afford them \nthe further price protection they feel is needed in the legislation.\n  So that is where we are. I want to return to where I started. We have \nto come together in a bipartisan way. Both sides of the aisle have to \ncome to reasonable agreement on these amendments so we can move forward \nand vote on this bill. I absolutely believe we can do it, but I want to \nbe very clear that it is incumbent on all of us to make it happen.\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\n  This bill is not just about our farmers and ranchers. This is a bill \nthat affects every single American, and it is time we come together on \nan amendment package and find a way to move forward and get this bill \ndone for the good of farm country and for the good of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the role.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Agricultural Reform\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as we wrap up today and the week, I wish \nto take a few moments to give a status report as to moving forward in \nour negotiations on the farm bill. We have actually had some very good \nprogress and overcome some obstacles and we are putting together \nsomething for the Senate for the beginning of the week that will allow \nus to move forward.\n  I wish to also thank the junior Senator from North Dakota whom I \nheard on the floor a little while ago, Mr. Hoeven, about the 250 \ndifferent amendments we have. Of course, the great thing about the \nSenate is we can all offer amendments whether they are relevant or not, \nand the challenge for someone managing a bill is that anyone can offer \namendments. So we have worked our way from the 250, we are working our \nway down from 50 to 40 and putting together an approach that will be \nfair and balanced and allow us to move forward and have the input of \neveryone on both sides of the aisle.\n  So I wish to thank Senator Roberts again for being truly a partner \nwith me all the way through this process and a terrific committee. We \nheard from one of those members, the junior Senator from North Dakota, \nin laying out what a positive and important bill this is for us. I wish \nto thank him as our newest member of the committee for all his \ncontributions as well.\n  To briefly recap as we bring the discussion to a close this week, \nthere are 16 million people who work because of agriculture. They may \nbe working in the fields. They may be packaging, processing, making \nmachinery for agriculture. They could be doing a number of things, but \n16 million people work because of agriculture. I am not sure we can say \nany other individual bill that has been brought to the floor of the \nSenate impacts that many people--16 million people.\n  As I have said so many times, I don't believe we have a middle class \nin this country unless we make things and grow things. I am proud of \nMichigan where we do that. We make things and grow things. The State of \nthe Presiding Officer as well makes things and grows things. That is \nthe strength of our economy.\n  One of the bright spots for us, even during the deepest, toughest \ntimes in the country, and certainly in Michigan, has been and continues \nto be agriculture, our major source of a trade surplus, having seen the \ntrades expand 270 percent just over a short period of time, and over \n8,000 jobs created for every $1 billion we do in trade exports. So \nthere are multiple facets to this jobs bill, from production \nagriculture, alternative energy, biomanufacturing, whether it is \nsupport for the critical needs of families through nutrition, whether \nit is conservation, where we have the largest investment in land and \nwater conservation in our country on working lands, done through the \nfarm bill.\n  This is important. It covers many important subjects that touch every \nsingle person in rural America and every person across this country as \nconsumers of the safest, most affordable food supply in the world. So \nwe have an obligation to get this right and to take the time to do it, \nand that is exactly what we are doing.\n  I am so proud this bill came out of committee with a broad, \nbipartisan vote and that we had such a very strong vote to proceed to \nthe bill and now we are moving through the process of bringing us down \nthe path to a final conclusion.\n  As we do that, I wish to stress again a few points. We could talk a \nlong time because this has many pieces to it, and I am not going to do \nthat this evening. But I do want to say one more time, to my knowledge, \nthis is the one piece of real deficit reduction done on a bipartisan \nbasis--in fact, on a House-Senate basis back in the fall--that we have \nhad before the Senate.\n  There is $23 billion in deficit reduction. So we all have an \nopportunity to vote to reduce the deficit--something we all care \nabout--and we can do that while passing the farm bill. This repeals \ndirect payments. Four different subsidies, in fact, are repealed. In \nits place, we put a risk management system.\n  So if there are losses, if there is a disaster from weather, such as \nwe have seen in Michigan, if there are other disasters on price \ndeclines, world actions that create a challenge for our farmers or \nranchers, we will be there to make sure nobody loses their farm because \nthere are a few days of bad weather or any other risk that is beyond \ntheir control. However, if things are going well, we are not going to \nbe giving a government payment.\n  We are going to cover farmers for what they plant and when there are \nlosses. We are strengthening payment limits so we again are focusing \nprecious dollars on those who need it, and we end more than 100 \ndifferent programs and authorizations. As we have scoured every single \npage of the farm bill and the USDA responsibilities, we have found \nareas where there is duplication, redundancy, things that are no longer \nneeded, and we have solidified, made things more flexible, cut \nduplication. In the process of that, we have actually eliminated 100 \ndifferent programs and authorizations, cut $23 billion. At the same \ntime, we have continued our commitment to families and children in this \nNation who have their own personal disasters and need food assistance \nhelp.\n  We continue a strong commitment on conservation. We have 643 \ndifferent conservation and environmental groups that have come together \nto support our approach, 125 different agriculture and hunger groups, \nand other organizations that say yes to this bill. We are anxious to \nget it done.\n  I would just say, as we conclude a very busy week--and I have to say \nit has been a very productive week--we began a process. We have had \nsome votes. We have had a number of folks come together. I thank people \non both sides of the aisle for their willingness to work with this as \nwe move forward on our path to completion of this very important 5-year \nbill. I wish to indicate to everyone that we will look forward to \nhaving the opportunity next week to present something to the body.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I was unable to arrive at the Senate \nChamber in time for Senate rollcall vote 119. I would have opposed \ntabling amendment No. 2393 to S. 3240. The outcome of the vote would \nnot have been changed had I been present.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz to be a member of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Justice Hurwitz is already an \nexperienced judge, having served for almost 10 years as a member of the \nArizona Supreme Court. He has disposed of hundreds of cases and has \nreceived the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, ``well qualified.''\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\n  Most important to my support, I have known Justice Hurwitz for \nliterally four decades, so I am exceptionally familiar with his \nprofessional and personal background and am certain that he will be an \noutstanding addition to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I first met him at Yale Law School, where we worked together on the \nYale Law Journal. He attended Yale after graduating from Princeton \nUniversity in 1968. Our lives intersected again when I followed him as \na law clerk to Judge Jon O. Newman and then as a law clerk on the U.S. \nSupreme Court, although in different years and for different Justices. \nAt every step of his career as a litigator and judge, as well as \nstudent and law clerk, he has been a paragon of intellect and \nintegrity.\n  Justice Hurwitz has built a distinguished record while serving on the \nArizona Supreme Court. Time and again, he has demonstrated an \nextraordinary capacity for analysis, thoughtfulness, and insight when \nfacing the most complex and challenging questions of law. He has the \nqualifications, both professionally and personally, to be a great \nFederal judge. His reasoning is often of such a caliber that even on \nhighly contested or controversial issues he has been able to build \nconsensus on the court. Indeed, many of his most significant opinions \nwere joined by all members of the Arizona Supreme Court.\n  Before his appointment to the Arizona Supreme Court, Justice Hurwitz \nspent 25 year in private practice in Arizona, where he represented a \nwide range of interests--from AT and the American Broadcasting \nCompany to the city of Phoenix and the Arizona State Compensation Fund. \nHe also developed a specialty in Native American law, representing, \namong others, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community and the \nHopi Tribe. Much of the work he did during his years of practice \ninvolved complex appellate litigation, including numerous arguments \nbefore the Ninth Circuit and two before the U.S. Supreme Court. This \nexperience gives Justice Hurwitz familiarity with a broad swath of \nFederal law.\n  Equally impressive is Justice Hurwitz's commitment to pro bono work \nand public service. While in private practice, Justice Hurwitz argued \nand won a groundbreaking death penalty Supreme Court case, Ring v. \nArizona, to vindicate the rights of death row inmates sentenced by \njudges rather than juries. He also took time out of his successful \npractice to work in Arizona government. Among other projects, Justice \nHurwitz was responsible for creating the Arizona Health Care Cost \nContainment System, a program designed to rein in State Medicaid costs. \nHe also worked with the Reagan administration to implement greater \ncontrol over transportation and education for State agencies. He served \nfrom 1988 until 1996 on the Arizona Board of Regents, including as \nboard president. During his tenure, he led an effort to require annual \nreports from universities certifying they had reached mandated \neducational goals. His commitment to public service work shows a \ndedication to the legal system that I believe should be shared by all \nmembers of the Federal bench.\n  Throughout the 40 years I have known him, Justice Hurwitz has always \nbeen open about his passion for the law. From private practice to \ngovernment to serving on the Arizona Supreme Court, he has shown \nunparalleled legal acumen and a devotion to public service. I have no \ndoubt that his adherence to precedent, coupled with his passion and his \nwisdom, will serve this Nation well. President Obama has made a truly \nexcellent nomination that will benefit the cause of justice in our \nNation for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4200-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ETHIOPIAN FREE PRESS ASSAULT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, later this month, I and other Members of \nCongress will be watching what happens in a courtroom 7,000 miles from \nWashington, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n  That is where a journalist named Eskinder Nega stands accused of \nsupporting terrorism simply for refusing to remain silent about the \nEthiopian government's increasingly authoritarian drift. The trial is \nfinished, and a verdict is expected on June 21.\n  Mr. Eskinder is not alone. Since 2011, the Ethiopian government has \ncharged 10 other journalists with terrorism or threatening national \nsecurity for questioning government actions and policies--activities \nthat you and I and people around the world would recognize as \nfundamental to any free press. Ironically, by trying to silence those \nwho do not toe the official line, the government is only helping to \nunderscore the concerns that many inside and outside of Ethiopia share \nabout the deterioration of democracy and human rights in that country.\n  Ethiopia is an important partner for the United States in at least \ntwo key areas: containing the real threat of terrorism in the region, \nand making gains against the region's recurring famines and fostering \nthe kind of development that can bring the cycle of poverty and hunger \nto an end. The United States has provided large amounts of assistance \nin furtherance of both goals, because a stable, democratic Ethiopia \ncould exert a positive influence throughout the Horn of Africa and help \npoint the way to a more peaceful and prosperous future.\n  That is why President Obama invited Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to \nlast month's G 8 Summit at Camp David. The subject was food security, \nand Prime Minister Meles and the leaders of several other African \ncountries helped inaugurate a new public-private alliance for nutrition \nthat aims to increase agricultural production and lift 50 million \npeople out of poverty in the next 10 years. I can think of nothing that \nwill do more to further peace and prosperity of the region than this \nkind of targeted, practical, and cooperative initiative.\n  But initiatives like this depend for their success on broad national \nconsultation, transparency and accountability. Consultation to \nintegrate ideas from diverse perspectives, transparency to maintain \npartner confidence that their investment is reaching its targets, and \naccountability to ensure it produces the desired results. And \ntransparency and accountability depend, in no small part, on a free \npress.\n  In Ethiopia, that means enabling journalists like Eskinder Nega to do \ntheir work of reporting and peaceful political participation.\n  But seven times in Prime Minister Meles's 20-year rule, Mr. Eskinder \nhas been detained for his reporting. In 2005, he and his journalist \nwife Serkalem Fasil were imprisoned for reporting on protests following \nthat year's disputed national elections. They spent 17 months in \nprison, their newspapers were shut down, and Mr. Eskinder has been \ndenied a license to practice journalism ever since. Yet he carried on, \npublishing articles online that highlight the government's denial of \nhuman rights and calling for an end to political repression and \ncorruption.\n  In some of those articles, Mr. Eskinder specifically criticized the \nMeles government for misusing a vaguely-worded 2009 antiterrorism law \nto jail journalists and political opponents. Now he stands accused of \nterrorism. At his trial, which opened in Addis Ababa on March 6, the \ngovernment reportedly offered as evidence against him a video of a town \nhall meeting in which Mr. Eskinder discusses the Arab spring and \nspeculates on whether similar protests were possible in Ethiopia. If \nconvicted, he could face the death penalty.\n  The trial of Eskinder Nega, the imprisonment of several of his \ncolleagues on similar spurious charges, and the fact that Ethiopia has \ndriven so many journalists into exile over the last decade has eroded \nconfidence in Prime Minister Meles' commitment to press freedom and to \nother individual liberties that are guaranteed by the Ethiopian \nconstitution and fundamental to any democracy.\n  The United States and Ethiopia share important interests, and the \nadministration's fiscal year 2013 budget requests $350 million in \nassistance for Ethiopia. However, to the extent that any of that \nassistance is intended for the Ethiopian government, the importance of \nrespecting freedom of the press cannot be overstated. What happens to \nMr. Eskinder and other journalists there will resonate loudly not only \nin Ethiopia, but also in the United States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4200-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4200-S4201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 96th \nanniversary of Flag Day in the United\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\nStates and to draw attention to its heightened significance in this \nyear, the 200th anniversary of the United States' `Second War of \nIndependence,' the War of 1812. Since its adoption by the Second \nContinental Congress in 1777, our flag, with its thirteen stripes and \nfifty stars, has proudly stood as a beacon of liberty and justice \nthroughout the world.\n  For more than 200 years our flag has stood as a tangible expression \nof our Nation and the lofty ideals it was created to protect. In 1916 \nPresident Woodrow Wilson sought to formally recognize the significant \ncultural and historical legacy that our flag embodies, proclaiming that \nthe fourteenth of June should be known as Flag Day as a means of \ncommemorating the Flag Resolution of 1777. While Flag Day was \ncelebrated in many communities across the country in the years \nfollowing Wilson's proclamation, it was not until 1949 that President \nTruman signed an Act of Congress designating June 14 of each year as \nNational Flag Day and the week on which it falls as National Flag Week.\n  My State of Maryland plays a prominent role in the rich and storied \nhistory of our national Flag. Shortly after the British sack of \nWashington, D.C., the Royal Navy turned its gaze north, moving in force \ntowards the strategic port city of Baltimore, MD. Despite the lack of \nformally trained, commissioned soldiers, the citizens of Baltimore \ndiligently prepared the city's defenses and steadfastly stood their \nground against the better equipped and trained forces of the British \nmilitary. Despite their manifold disadvantages, the volunteer militia \nfought valiantly during the Battle of North Point, holding off the \nBritish infantry long enough for reinforcements to arrive. With their \nground forces stymied, the British Navy commenced its intense, 25-hour \nbombardment of Fort McHenry. However, the bombardment was to no avail, \nas the stalwart American defenders refused to yield and the British \nwere forced to depart.\n  During the bombardment, American lawyer Francis Scott Key, who was \nbeing held aboard an American flag-of-truce vessel in Baltimore Harbor, \nbeheld by the dawns early light the American flag still fluttering in \nthe breeze atop Fort McHenry. At that moment, Key realized the \nAmericans had survived the assault and stopped the enemy advance. \nDeeply moved by the sight of the American flag after the devastating \nassault, he immortalized the event in a poem entitled ``The Defense of \nFort McHenry,'' which was later set to music and renamed ``The Star \nSpangled Banner.'' On March 3, 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed a \nCongressional resolution, formally making the ``Star Spangled Banner'' \nthe national anthem of the United States.\n  The flag that flew over Fort McHenry during that fateful night is now \na national treasure that remains on display at the Smithsonian \nInstitution as a stirring inspiration to all Americans. Each year the \nNational Flag Day Foundation of Baltimore sponsors a moving ceremony at \nthe Fort McHenry National Monument and Historical Shrine which brings \nour community together in celebration and remembrance of our \nillustrious history.\n  America's flag graces classrooms, statehouses, courtrooms, and \nchurches, serving as a daily reminder of this Nation's past \naccomplishments and ongoing dedication to safeguarding individual \nrights and political freedom. Whether it is being carried into battle \nby the brave members of our armed forces as they fulfill their missions \nin defense of democracy and peace or flying over the public buildings, \nthe flag is a badge of honor for all to see--a sign of our citizens' \ncommon purpose.\n  This week and throughout the year let us do all we can to teach \nyounger generations the significance of our flag and to respect the men \nand women who have fallen to protect it. In red, white, and blue, we \nsee the spirit of a Nation, the resilience of our Union, and the \npromise of a future forged in common purpose and dedication to the \nprinciples that have always kept America strong. As we reflect on our \nheritage, let us remember that our destiny is stitched together like \nthose 50 stars and 13 stripes, united as one, with liberty and justice \nfor all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4201-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ANGELO ROPPOLO\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in honoring Mr. Angelo Roppolo and extending my appreciation \nfor his extraordinary accomplishments and dedication to the city of \nShreveport and the State of Louisiana.\n  Mr. Roppolo is a modest man who seldom takes credit for his \nachievements and is known throughout his community as someone who \navoids the spotlight. He has an unwavering loyalty to his family and \nfriends and has never been known to abandon his core beliefs and \nprinciples.\n  Mr. Roppolo stands for righteousness and justice, and he has never \nhesitated to support a candidate who has challenged the norm. Mr. \nRoppolo has played integral roles in many landmark political events in \nLouisiana. He was involved in organizing and planning the campaigns of \nthe first African American judge to be elected in Shreveport and in \nCaddo Parish, along with the campaigns of the first female judge in \nCaddo Parish and the first female judge on the 2nd Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Mr. Roppolo also served as the north Louisiana campaign \nchairman for Governor Kathleen Blanco, who was the first female to be \nelected as Governor of Louisiana.\n  Along with his love for the political process, Mr. Roppolo is also a \nstrong supporter of entrepreneurs in Shreveport. He was a founder of \nthe South Shreveport Business Association, an organization dedicated to \nthe success of businesses within the rapidly growing area of his \ncommunity. He has also helped many individuals gain financing for their \nendeavors and has seen many of these ventures grow and prosper into \nsuccessful businesses.\n  Mr. Roppolo is a kind and caring man who has always given praise and \ngratitude to the men and women in the armed services who serve and \nprotect this country.

On June 23 and 24 of this year, \nthe community of Schefield will host a celebration to recognize St. \nPius Verein's history and founding.\n  The town of Schefield started with the establishment of the St. Pius \nCatholic Church, which was built in 1910. The town's name is said to be \nderived from ``schoenfeld,'' the German word for beautiful field. In \n1912, St. Pius Verein was founded by German settlers from Russia. The \norganization was first started as a way to unite the community. Members \nespecially enjoyed singing and playing instruments together. Today, St. \nPius Verein has 440 members. All members pay dues and contribute to a \nsurvivor benefit program that pays a benefit to families that \nexperience a loss. St. Pius Verein holds monthly meetings, in addition \nto an annual picnic held on St. Pius Day. Schefield takes great pride \nin the history of St. Pius Verein, and the community is expecting an \nenjoyable gathering.\n  To celebrate the 100-year anniversary of St. Pius Verein, Schefield \nresidents and visitors will participate in many fun-filled activities. \nOver the span of 2 days, the celebrants will enjoy children's games, a \ntown dance, a citywide mass at St. Pius Verein Hall, a parade, an \nantique tractor pull, and an old-time jam session. DVDs will also be \nsold that describe the proud history of the town. Although many St. \nPius Verein members no longer live in Schefield, the town is expecting \nbig numbers for the celebration.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating St. Pius\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\nVerein and the Schefield residents on the organization's 100th \nanniversary and in wishing them a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4202-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO IMRE HIR\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record of \nthe Senate an honorable American and a great Georgian, Mr. Imre Hir, on \nthe occasion of his retirement after 40 years as general manager of \nAtlanta Country Club.\n  Imre is a native of Hungary where, in 1956, he was part of a youth \nmovement in that country that helped drive the Soviets out. When the \nSoviets later returned to Hungary, Imre was forced to leave his country \nand sought refuge in Austria. While in Austria, Imre was debriefed by \nthe U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, which later arranged to bring him \nto the United States. Shortly after arriving in the United States, Imre \nserved in the U.S. Army.\n  After completing his service in the military, Imre worked his way up \nfrom a dishwasher at the Red Coach Grill in Boston, MA, to becoming the \ngeneral manager of Druid Hills Country Club in Atlanta in 1969. He then \nwent on to serve as the general manager of the Atlanta Country Club, \nwhere he has held that position until this month, retiring after 40 \ngreat years.\n  Imre is an example of an individual who has lived the American dream, \nand his story is one of many among immigrants who have come to the \nUnited States--the land of opportunity--and built successful lives \nthrough hard work and perseverance.\n  I congratulate Imre Hir for a successful career and the contributions \nhe has made to the United States. I wish him well in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4202-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SEEDS OF PEACE 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to join with \nindividuals across the world in recognizing the 20th anniversary of the \nfounding of Seeds of Peace, an organization dedicated to the \nadvancement of peace through understanding, reconciliation, acceptance, \nand coexistence among people, and established on the principle that \nlong-term peace within or between nations can only be achieved with the \nemergence of a new generation of leaders who choose dialogue over \nviolence.\n  Seeds of Peace's first camp session in 1993 was a labor of love for \nthe late founder and esteemed journalist, John Wallach. That summer, \nunder the leadership of Wallach, Bobbie Gottschalk, and Timothy Wilson, \nSeeds of Peace hosted 46 Arab and Israeli teenagers at its first summer \ncamp in my home State of Maine. Since that day, the organization has \nblossomed into a full-fledged leadership program, which spans 27 \ncountries with full staff in Amman, Gaza, Jerusalem, Kabul, Lahore, \nMumbai, New York, Otisfield, Ramallah, and Tel Aviv.\n  Today, for 3 weeks at a time, during the months of June, July, and \nAugust, on the beautiful shores of Pleasant Lake in Otisfield, ME, \nSeeds of Peace brings together young people and educators from areas \nimmersed in civil conflict, war, and other political and social unrest, \nto learn about coexistence and conflict resolution at their \ninternational summer camp. Camp participants engage with one another in \nboth guided coexistence sessions and typical summer camp activities, \nwhich expose the human face that lie behind ethnic, religious, and \npolitical differences.\n  Now, under the acclaimed leadership of Leslie Lewin, Seeds of Peace \nhas prepared over 5,000 alumni, known as ``Seeds,'' primarily from the \nMiddle East, South Asia, the Balkans, and Cyprus, for roles of \nleadership by offering them not only the unmatched summer camp \nexperience of sleeping next to, eating alongside, and swimming with \nthose who are their alleged enemies, but also a robust and worthwhile \nslate of intensive, year-round programs encircling the globe, which are \nfocused on further refining the skills learned and relationships built \nat camp.\n  Seeds of Peace is a testament to the importance of conflict \nresolution and reconciliation programs as a tool for creating peace, \nand the program is indisputably making a difference in the lives of its \nSeeds each and every day. It is no surprise that Seeds of Peace is \nstrongly supported by participating governments and many world leaders, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the organization's \ncontributions to the advancement of peace--which all began with a 3 \nweek stint at a summer camp in Maine 20 years ago. Seeds of Peace \nprovides a promise for a better future, and I enthusiastically welcome \nits continued efforts for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4202-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING FALMOUTH HERITAGE MUSEUM\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nFalmouth Historical Society and the Falmouth Heritage Museum, located \nin my hometown of Falmouth, ME. Through their steadfast commitment to \npreserving the past, future generations of Mainers and Americans alike \nwill be able to not only witness, but understand the richness of their \nheritage.\n  Established in 1966, the Falmouth Historical Society was founded upon \nthe venerable goal of preserving and sharing the town's vast and \nstoried history. In order to accomplish that objective, members have \ntirelessly researched, collected, and catalogued hundreds of years of \nFalmouth's sacred artifacts, while the society has sponsored several \noutreach and awareness events for local residents as well as visitors. \nIndeed, through educational programs, research assistance, and \nnewsletters, the society works diligently to reach an ever-broadening \naudience in the effort to showcase their many other activities, \nincluding photo exhibits, genealogical inquiries, and the Maine \nHeritage Day event held in September.\n  It was back in November of 2004 when the Falmouth Historical Society \nbegan the long and arduous process of opening a permanent museum to \nhouse their historical treasures. The original building which housed \nthe museum was first built in 1830 and donated to the Society by Dr. \nDavid Andrews and his wife Jan for whom the house was their private \nhome. The house was then moved in 2005 to land donated by the town of \nFalmouth, and following years of preparation and hard work the Falmouth \nHeritage Museum first opened its doors in June of 2008.\n  Today, the Falmouth Heritage Museum provides a unique glimpse into \nthe past and plays a vital role in the preservation of artifacts. By \nserving as a new home to pieces of Maine's history, the museum offers \nthe opportunity for historic items to serve as tools of learning and a \nwindow to the past. With knowledgeable docents to answer questions and \nprovide greater insight into the exhibits and the early history of \nFalmouth, the museum provides a fun and interactive way to engage our \npast. Furthermore, the museum recently completed work on a new storage \nand display barn, which will serve as a home to the ever growing number \nof historical treasures. The grand opening of the barn coincides with \nthe annual opening day festivities of the museum, this year being held \non June 23.\n  Falmouth's rich history is well preserved thanks to the efforts of \nthe Falmouth Historical Society and the Falmouth Heritage Museum. It is \nthrough their hard work that we are able to so readily access and learn \nfrom the past. As we look to the future of Falmouth and of Maine, we \ntreasure the path we have already traveled. I am proud to extend my \ngratitude, congratulations, and praise to the Falmouth Historical \nSociety and the Falmouth Heritage Museum for their many contributions \nand accomplishments. I look forward to seeing their continued growth, \nknowing that they will one day play a vital role in preserving the \nhistory of our present day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4202-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4202-5", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4202-S4203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4203-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC 6516.

Res. 493\n\n       Whereas the incidence of prostate cancer in African-\n     American men is more than one and a half times higher than in \n     any other racial or ethnic group in the United States;\n       Whereas African-American men have the highest mortality \n     rate of any ethnic and racial group in the United States, \n     dying at a rate that is approximately two and a half times \n     higher than other ethnic and racial groups;\n       Whereas that rate of mortality represents the largest \n     disparity of mortality rates in any of the major cancers;\n       Whereas prostate cancer can be cured with early detection \n     and the proper treatment, regardless of the ethnic or racial \n     group of the cancer patient;\n       Whereas African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed \n     at an earlier age and at a later stage of cancer progression \n     than all other ethnic and racial groups, leading to lower \n     cure rates and lower chances of survival;\n       Whereas, for cases diagnosed early, studies show a 5-year \n     survival rate of nearly 100 percent, but the survival rate \n     drops significantly to 28 percent for cases diagnosed in late \n     stages; and\n       Whereas recent genomics research has increased the ability \n     to identify men at high risk for aggressive prostate cancer: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that prostate cancer has created a health \n     crisis for African-American men;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of health coverage and access \n     to care, as well as promoting informed decision making \n     between men and their doctors, taking into consideration the \n     known risks and potential benefits of screening and treatment \n     options for prostate cancer;\n       (3) urges Federal agencies to support--\n       (A) research to address and attempt to end the health \n     crisis created by prostate cancer;\n       (B) efforts relating to education, awareness, and early \n     detection at the grassroots level to end that health crisis; \n     and\n       (C) the Office of Minority Health of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services in focusing on improving health and \n     healthcare outcomes for African Americans at an elevated risk \n     of prostate cancer; and\n       (4) urges investment by the National Cancer Institute and \n     National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, \n     and other elements of the National Institutes of Health, as \n     well as the Department of Defense, in research focusing on \n     the improvement of early detection and treatment of prostate \n     cancer, such as by using biomarkers to accurately distinguish \n     indolent forms of prostate cancer from lethal forms and \n     advanced imaging tools to assure the best level of \n     individualized patient care.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we approach Father's Day, I would like \nto take the opportunity to discuss an important men's health issue that \nhas personally affected my family and the families of many of my \ncolleagues in the Chamber.\n  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Every year, more \nthan 200,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer, and more than \n25,000 men die from it. When caught early, five-year survival rates are \nnear 100 percent. But when this cancer is caught in later stages, the \nsurvival rate drops significantly to only 28 percent.\n  African-American men are one and a half times more likely to get \nprostate cancer and two and a half times more likely to be killed by it \nthan any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. As we move \nforward with better screening and treatment options, we must also close \ndisparity gaps so all men have improved outcomes.\n  This is why Senators Chambliss, Cardin, Akaka, Wyden and I are \nsubmitting a resolution to recognize the disproportionate occurrence of \nprostate cancer in African-American men. This resolution acknowledges \nthe importance of health care coverage for prostate cancer screenings \nand the need for informed decision making between men and their \ndoctors, taking into consideration the known risks and potential \nbenefits of screening and treatment options. It also encourages Federal \nagencies to place a greater emphasis on education, awareness, and \nresearch focused on improved screening tools such\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\nas more effective biomarkers and advanced imaging.\n  I would like to recognize the Prostate Health Education Network, \nPHEN, AdMeTech Foundation, and ZERO--The Project to End Prostate Cancer \nfor their work on the development of this resolution and their ongoing \nadvocacy to support innovative research that holds real promise in \nturning the tide against cancer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass \nthis important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4207-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 494--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN \n FEDERATION FOR PROVIDING WEAPONS TO THE REGIME OF PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-\n                             ASSAD OF SYRIA\n\n  Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Gillibrand, \nMrs. Boxer, Mr. Risch, and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 494\n\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has an \n     extensive history of providing weapons and political support \n     to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a \n     country designated by the Secretary of State as a ``state \n     sponsor of terrorism'';\n       Whereas, at the Port of Tartus in Syria, the Government of \n     the Russian Federation maintains for the Russian Navy its \n     only permanent warm-water naval port outside of the former \n     Soviet Union, which bolsters the Assad regime;\n       Whereas the Assad regime responded to the widespread, \n     peaceful, and sustained calls for political reform that began \n     in March 2011 in a manner that has caused the deaths of more \n     than 10,000 people in Syria, mostly civilians, as of June \n     2012, according to an estimate by the United Nations;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation remains \n     the top supplier of weapons to the Government of Syria, \n     reportedly providing nearly $1,000,000,000 worth of arms to \n     the Government of Syria in 2011 alone;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     unabatedly continued to ship arms to the Government of Syria \n     during the ongoing popular uprisings;\n       Whereas, on October 4, 2011, the Russian Federation, \n     together with the People's Republic of China, vetoed a United \n     Nations Security Council resolution that would have condemned \n     ``grave and systematic human rights violations'' in Syria and \n     would have warned the Government of Syria of the actions, \n     including sanctions, to be considered against it, if \n     warranted;\n       Whereas, on January 18, 2012, Foreign Minister of the \n     Russian Federation Sergei Lavrov criticized ``the sending of \n     so-called humanitarian convoys to Syria'';\n       Whereas, on January 19, 2012, Foreign Minister Lavrov \n     stated that, with regard to the Government of Syria, ``For \n     us, the red line is fairly clearly drawn. We will not support \n     any sanctions.'';\n       Whereas, on February 4, 2012, the Russian Federation, \n     together with the People's Republic of China, vetoed a United \n     Nations Security Council resolution calling for an end to the \n     violence in Syria, demanding that all parties in Syria cease \n     all violence and reprisals and implement the plan set out by \n     the League of Arab States, expressing grave concern for the \n     deteriorating situation in Syria, and condemning the \n     widespread gross violations of human rights;\n       Whereas, on March 13, 2012, Deputy Minister of Defence of \n     the Russian Federation Anatoly Antonov stated that the \n     Government of the Russian Federation would not halt arms \n     shipments to Syria, acknowledging that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation has military instructors on the ground \n     training the Syrian Arab Army and stating, ``Russia enjoys \n     good and strong military technical co-operation with Syria, \n     and we see no reason to reconsider it. Russian-Syria military \n     co-operation is perfectly legitimate.'';\n       Whereas, on May 30, 2012, Permanent Representative of the \n     United States to the United Nations Susan Rice condemned \n     recent reports of an arms shipment that arrived in Syria from \n     the Russian Federation on May 26, 2012, as ``reprehensible,'' \n     stating that ``this is obviously of the utmost concern given \n     that the Syrian government continues to use deadly forces \n     against civilians'';\n       Whereas, on May 31, 2012, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton stated that the policy of the Government of the \n     Russian Federation toward the Government of Syria ``is going \n     to help contribute to a civil war,'' maintaining that Russian \n     officials ``are just vociferous in their claim that they are \n     providing a stabilizing influence,'' and stating, ``I reject \n     that. I think they are, in effect, propping up the regime at \n     a time when we should be working on a political \n     transition.'';\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has thus \n     far failed to effectively use its influence and relationship \n     with the Assad regime to halt the murder of civilians in \n     Syria, including the massacre of over 100 people, many of \n     them women and children, in Houla on May 25 to 26, 2012;\n       Whereas Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin \n     rejected appeals by President of France Francois Hollande for \n     tougher United Nations sanctions aimed at ending violence in \n     Syria;\n       Whereas, on June 5, 2012, Secretary of State Clinton stated \n     that ``it's pretty clear that we all have to intensify our \n     efforts to speed a political transition. . . . And we invite \n     the Russians and the Chinese to be part of the solution of \n     what is happening in Syria'';\n       Whereas, on June 7, 2012, Permanent Representative of the \n     Russian Federation to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin \n     publicly criticized the Governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar \n     for supporting the opposition in Syria; and\n       Whereas, on June 12, 2012, Secretary of State Clinton \n     stated that ``there are attack helicopters on the way from \n     Russia to Syria, which will escalate the conflict quite \n     dramatically'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Government of the Russian Federation for--\n       (A) its longstanding and ongoing support for the criminal \n     regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria;\n       (B) continuing to transfer weapons to the Assad regime, \n     which cannot be considered legitimate for purposes of self-\n     defense; and\n       (C) its troubling opposition to resolutions from the United \n     Nations Security Council regarding Syria, including those \n     recently tabled by the United States;\n       (2) concludes that the actions of the Government of the \n     Russian Federation--\n       (A) have enabled the Assad regime to maintain power and \n     perpetrate mass atrocities against its own people; and\n       (B) directly undermine the core national security interests \n     of the United States, as well as the stability of the entire \n     Middle East; and\n       (3) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to--\n       (A) immediately end all transfers of weapons to the Assad \n     regime;\n       (B) call on the Assad regime to end all violence against \n     civilians;\n       (C) support international sanctions against Syria; and\n       (D) support a peaceful transition of leadership in the \n     Government of Syria, starting with the early departure of \n     Bashar al-Assad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/14/senate-section/article/S4207-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4207-S4208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2423.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Citrus Disease Research \n     and Development Trust Fund Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 3302. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) duties collected on imports of citrus and citrus \n     products have ranged from $50,000,000 to $87,000,000 annually \n     since 2004, and are projected to increase, as United States \n     production declines due to the effects\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\n     of huanglongbing (also known as ``HLB'' or ``citrus greening \n     disease'') and imports increase in response to the shortfall \n     in the United States;\n       (2) in cases involving other similarly situated \n     agricultural commodities, notably wool, the Federal \n     Government has chosen to divert a portion of the tariff \n     revenue collected on imported products to support efforts of \n     the domestic industry to address challenges facing the \n     industry;\n       (3) citrus and citrus products are a highly nutritious and \n     healthy part of a balanced diet;\n       (4) citrus production is an important part of the \n     agricultural economy in Florida, California, Arizona, and \n     Texas;\n       (5) in the most recent years preceding the date of \n     enactment of this Act, citrus fruits have been produced on \n     900,000 acres, yielding 11,000,000 tons of citrus products \n     with a value at the farm of more than $3,200,000,000;\n       (6) the commercial citrus sector employs approximately \n     110,000 people and contributes approximately $13,500,000,000 \n     to the United States economy;\n       (7) the United States citrus industry has suffered billions \n     of dollars in damage from disease and pests, both domestic \n     and invasive, over the decade preceding the date of enactment \n     of this Act, particularly from huanglongbing;\n       (8) huanglongbing threatens the entire United States citrus \n     industry because the disease kills citrus trees;\n       (9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there are no \n     cost effective or environmentally sound treatments available \n     to suppress or eradicate huanglongbing;\n       (10) United States citrus producers working with Federal \n     and State governments have devoted tens of millions of \n     dollars toward research and efforts to combat huanglongbing \n     and other diseases and pests, but more funding is needed to \n     develop and commercialize disease and pest solutions;\n       (11) although imports constitute an increasing share of the \n     United States market, importers of citrus products into the \n     United States do not directly fund production research in the \n     United States;\n       (12) disease and pest suppression technologies require \n     determinations of safety and solutions must be commercialized \n     before use by citrus producers;\n       (13) the complex processes involved in discovery and \n     commercialization of safe and effective pest and disease \n     suppression technologies are expensive and lengthy and the \n     need for the technologies is urgent; and\n       (14) research to develop solutions to suppress \n     huanglongbing, or other domestic and invasive pests and \n     diseases will benefit all citrus producers and consumers \n     around the world.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to authorize the establishment of a trust funded by \n     certain tariff revenues to support scientific research, \n     technical assistance, and development activities to combat \n     citrus diseases and pests, both domestic and invasive, \n     harming the United States; and\n       (2) to require the President to notify the chairperson and \n     ranking member of the Committee on Finance of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives before entering into any trade agreement that \n     would decrease the amount of duties collected on imports of \n     citrus products to less than the amount necessary to provide \n     the grants authorized by section 1001(d) of the Trade Act of \n     1974, as added by section 3303(a) of this Act.\n       (c) Effect on Other Activities.--Nothing in this subtitle \n     restricts the use of any funds for scientific research and \n     technical activities in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3303.
