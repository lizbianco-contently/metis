Mr. President, America has the best, brightest, and most \ndedicated workers in the world. All those workers need is a fair shot \nto succeed. But right now many workers in this country don't enjoy the \nsame rights as the wealthy CEOs; that is, the right to negotiate the \nterms of their employment.\n  A new rule from the National Labor Relations Board will remove \nunnecessary obstacles to workers' rights to form a union. I solidly \nsupport this rule, and I urge my colleagues to vote tomorrow against \nthe resolution of disapproval which strikes down this commonsense rule.\n  The new rule doesn't change or do anything to encourage unions, but \nit doesn't discourage them either. It just gives workers the ability to \nvote yes or no while minimizing the chance of intimidation and \nstalling.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on a number of \namendments to a bipartisan postal reform bill. This important \nlegislation will safeguard more than 8 million jobs of people who \ndepend on a vibrant postal system. It will also protect postal \ncustomers--particularly elderly and disabled Americans and people who \nlive in rural parts of this country.\n  I am pleased we reached an agreement to allow Senators to offer \namendments to this bill. I hope once we work through the amendments to \nthe bill tomorrow we will see a strong bipartisan vote to modernize the \nPostal Service and save this important institution from insolvency. \nThis institution is so important it is contained in our Constitution.\n  Once we pass postal reform tomorrow, as I expect we will, the Senate \nwill move on to the consideration of another very important piece of \nlegislation, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. \nSince its passage in 1994, this legislation has reduced the annual \nincidence of domestic violence by more than 50 percent.\n  Despite that incredible progress, we still have work to do to keep \nwomen and their families safe. Three women die in this country every \nday at the hands of abusive partners--on weekends, all days, no days \noff. For every victim who is killed there are nine more who narrowly \nescape death and are beaten savagely. It would be unacceptable to step \nback from our national commitment to stop violence and abuse now.\n  This legislation was the brainchild of Vice President Joe Biden when \nhe was a Member of the Senate. It does very important work. For \nexample, it allows communities to get support in setting up shelters \nfor these women and their families to go in secret.\n\n  The legislation was unanimously reauthorized by the Senate in 2000 \nand 2005. This effort should be--and traditionally has been--above \npartisanship. I hope that proves to be the case again this year. This \nyear it has 60 cosponsors and the support of 47 State attorneys \ngeneral. I cannot imagine why my Republican colleagues would oppose \nsuch a worthy piece of legislation. I am hopeful and I am confident \nthey won't.\n  By joining Democrats to pass this legislation, Republicans can help \nus send a clear message that this country doesn't tolerate domestic \nviolence. If the Senate doesn't complete the work on this critical \nissue before we recess\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nfor this work period, we will continue after we come back to try to \nwork through any problems. I don't see any, Mr. President.\n  But the Violence Against Women Act isn't the only pressing matter the \nSenate has to complete the next work period. We must begin work on a \nnumber of appropriations bills, consider additional judicial \nnominations, and take up legislation to cut taxes for small businesses \nso that they can expand and hire.\n  Cybersecurity legislation, I have been told, the House will take up \nsoon, and I appreciate that. We must address the looming crisis for \nmillions of students in America: the July 1 deadline for interest rates \nto double on Federal student loans. That is fast approaching.\n  With middle-class families struggling and fewer families able to \nafford the rising cost of higher education, we cannot afford to put \ncollege out of reach for more promising young people. Doubling interest \nrates from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent--effectively socking 7.4 million \nstudents with $1,000 a year in student loan costs--would do irreparable \nharm to our ability to educate young men and women.\n  Today Americans have more student loan debt than credit card debt. \nWhy would we want to double what they pay? The average graduate owes \n$25,000 when they graduate. Getting a college education should not \nburden young people with unsustainable debt. Unfortunately, many of my \nRepublican colleagues have signaled that they would rather cut taxes \nfor the richest of the rich than invest in the next generation of \nAmerican workers. But the business community agrees that making college \naffordable is the key to keeping America competitive in a global \neconomy. An investment in education is an investment in our economy.\n  I hope we will all join together, hear the message, and work to stop \n8 million students in this country from having an increase in the \namount of money they are obligated to pay back for the loans they get \nfor an education in America today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2560-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the past several months, President \nObama has kept a pretty busy schedule of campaign events. But as the \nPresident heads out for more campaign-style events this week, let's not \nforget that what he is actually doing here in Washington is far more \nimportant than what he is saying out on the campaign trail because when \nthe speeches are over and all the chairs and posters are put away, \ngreat challenges remain.\n  Millions of Americans are still looking for work. The Federal debt \ncontinues to cast a shadow over the American dream. Despite assurances \nmade last year, there is no budget in sight from the Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate. As the Associated Press reported today, about half \nof college graduates can't even find a decent job in this country. I \nunderstand why the President wouldn't want to talk about these things, \nbut that doesn't change the fact that he should, and it doesn't change \nthe fact that his policies are the problem.\n  The American people elected this President to change direction, not \nto change the subject. They elected the President to change direction, \nnot change the subject. Yet, day after day, week after week, as our \nNation's challenges deepen and another economic crisis draws nearer, \nthis President wants to change the topic. He wants people to either \nfocus on something else or to overlook the things he is actually doing \nto make the situation worse.\n  Let's take, for example, gas prices. Gas prices have more than \ndoubled under this President. Yet, rather than doing something about \nit, he blames it on speculators and energy companies. Instead of \nincreasing domestic production, he is focused on a plan to tax American \nenergy manufacturers--a plan that would increase the cost of energy \nrather than lower the cost of gas.\n  The national debt has skyrocketed more than $5 trillion under this \nPresident. Yet, rather than actually doing something about it, he \npretends that we should erase it, that we could somehow erase it by \njust whacking millionaires.\n  Look, millions are looking for work. Yet, rather than doing something \nabout it, he passes a health care bill that would impose massive new \ncosts, he continues to threaten new taxes, and he empowers Federal \nbureaucrats to cook up new rules and regulations that make it even \nharder for businesses to grow and to hire. Unless Congress acts, one \nsuch rule goes into effect next week. Most people haven't heard about \nit because the President hasn't been talking about it. But I am happy \nto because it says all you need to know about this President's approach \nto jobs and the economy.\n  As a favor to big labor, the President is right now rushing a plan \nthat would restrict an employer's ability to educate workers about \nunionization efforts, as well as increase their legal bills and the \nalready high cost of complying with Federal regulations. And get this: \nThe administration hasn't even provided an analysis of the cost \ninvolved in moving forward with this proposal.\n  Tomorrow, Senators, led by Senator Enzi, will have an opportunity to \nvote on this effort to make it even harder to do business in this \ncountry. We will have a chance to stand up against what the President \nis doing to the economy, and in the process we will be reminding people \nto focus on what the President does rather than what he says.\n  Look, at a time when America's corporate income tax is now the \nhighest in the world, we should be looking for ways to make it easier \nfor businesses to hire, not harder. At a time when unemployment is \nabove 13 percent for young people between the ages of 20 and 24 in this \ncountry, we should be finding ways to make it more likely they can find \nwork, not less likely. But this is the Obama economy. This is the \nPresident's approach. This is the painful legacy of his failed economic \npolicies. The President may not want to discuss it, but Republicans \nwill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2560-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it has been announced by the clerk that \nthe Senate is now considering the motion to proceed to S. 1925, the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\n  At 2 p.m. this afternoon, the Republican leader or his designee will \nmove to proceed to S.J. Res. 36, a resolution of disapproval regarding \nthe NLRB election rule. The time until 4 p.m. will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  At 5 p.m., the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider \nthe nomination of Brian Wimes to be a U.S. district judge in Missouri. \nThere will be a rollcall vote on confirmation of the Wimes nomination \nat 5:30 p.m.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mr. President, as you and our colleagues know, after a lot of work \nand good-faith negotiations, we reached a bipartisan agreement last \nweek to complete action on the bipartisan postal reform bill tomorrow, \nwith an agreement that includes almost 40 amendments--39, I believe, is \nthe number--to be voted on tomorrow.\n  Although, we--and particularly our staffs--have been working with \nsponsors of the amendments, we expect that probably more than half of \nthem will be negotiated to agreements, modified, and/or accepted. But \nthere still will be a significant number of rollcall votes,\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nwhich will begin tomorrow afternoon after the respective party \ncaucuses.\n  There was a good amount of debate on the postal bill last week. \nTomorrow, once we go from S.J. Res. 36, the resolution on the NLRB \nelection rule, to the postal bill in the afternoon to begin voting on \nthe amendments, there will not be much time for debate.\n  As announced last week, last Thursday after this agreement was \nachieved, Senator Collins will be here from now until 2 p.m. when we go \nto the NLRB rule. We will be here from 4 to 5, the next open block \nbefore we go to the judicial nomination, and we are prepared to stay \nthis evening after the judicial nomination for as long as proponents or \ndiscussants of the various amendments want to come to the floor to \nengage in debate and discussion on them. I hope our colleagues will do \nthat.\n  As Senator Reid said, this is an important piece of legislation. \nNobody denies that the U.S. Postal Service is an iconic American \ninstitution which millions of people depend on not just for the mail \nbut for their jobs, both directly working for the Postal Service and \nindirectly--but not too indirectly because they work for related \nbusinesses that depend on the mail.\n  We simply can't turn aside, do nothing, and let the Postal Service \ncontinue a fiscal spiral downward. The Postal Service, as we said over \nand over last week, lost $13 billion in the last 2 years. It is going \nto go over its debt limit later this year. The Postmaster has been very \nclear that if we don't give him some authority to find a new business \nmodel, to economize, he will have to take very aggressive action, \npotentially closing--on one list he put out there were 3,700 post \noffices and approximately 250 mail processing facilities, which would \nbe extremely disruptive both to the post office and to the personal \nlife and commercial life of our country.\n  This bill Senator Collins and I, along with Senators Carper and Scott \nBrown, offered to our colleagues offers a sensible but tough way \nforward to preserve the U.S. Postal Service, but also to acknowledge \nthat it has to change to stay alive forever, certainly through the 21st \ncentury. Because of the impact of e-mail, it has dropped the volume of \nmail in the last 5 years by more than 20 percent. When that kind of \nrevenue is lost, we have to find ways to economize and a different kind \nof business model, including different ways to raise revenue, all of \nwhich is authorized in this bill.\n  I know some people think our bill doesn't do enough. They are ready \nto basically close down a lot of the Postal Service as we know it. Some \npeople think our bill does too much. We naturally think we have struck \na sweet spot or a point of common ground. In fact, the Postal Service \ntold us they believe if our bill is enacted, it would save--after fully \nimplemented over the next 2, 3 years--between $15 billion and $20 \nbillion a year, to be conservative--probably closer to $15 billion. \nThat is a significant amount of money. It creates a series of \nincentives to alter the business model of the post office, including \nauthorizing the post office to get into some businesses it has not been \nin before as a way to take advantage of its unique assets and raise \nmore money.\n  So this is a moment of truth for the Senate. In some sense, it is a \nsomewhat smaller version of the larger moment of truth we are going to \nhave to face sometime about our Federal budget overall, but here is a \ngreat American institution that is in real fiscal trouble.\n  We have the ability with this legislation to get it back on a path of \nbalance, stability, and even growth. Some post offices will be changed \nunder this bill. Mail processing facilities--some of them will be \nclosed. The Postmaster says he wants to have that happen.\n  We have authorized a significant amount of money to be spent to \nincentivize 100,000 postal employees to retire. They are eligible for \nretirement with an incentive. We think they will, and that itself would \nsave the Postal Service approximately $8 billion a year.\n\n  This is not one of those bills that people enjoy voting on, but it is \nour responsibility. It is necessary we face the crisis the Postal \nService is in and help it stay alive and flourish throughout this \ncentury.\n  That is what is on the line in the bill. The amendments cover a range \nof topics. This was a very broad bipartisan agreement on the \namendments. There are some that make the bill tougher, some make it \nsofter. They all deserve a good debate, and that is what Senator \nCollins and I are here to do now.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 2327\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I understand that S. 2327 is at the \ndesk and due for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2327) to prohibit direct foreign assistance to \n     the Government of Egypt until the President makes certain \n     certifications related to treatment of nongovernmental \n     organization workers, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar under rule XIV.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield for my distinguished ranking member, Senator \nCollins.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, we are going to resume debate today on the postal \nreform legislation our committee, on which the Presiding Officer \nserves, has worked very hard to produce and to do so in a bipartisan \nway. As Chairman Lieberman has indicated, last week, we labored very \nhard to produce a list of amendments that will allow Members to work \ntheir will on this legislation.\n  There are many different viewpoints on the path forward for the \nPostal Service, but there can be no doubt about one fact: The Postal \nService has lost more than $13 billion in the last 2 years. Despite \nbeing relieved from a payment that is required under law toward the \nhealth benefits of future retirees, it still lost billions of dollars. \nIf we fail to act, if we turn down this bill, the Postal Service will \nnot survive as we know it today, and that is a fact. The Postal \nService, later this year, will have great difficulty even meeting its \npayroll if we do not act. The Postal Service will max out on its credit \nthat it can borrow from the Treasury if we do not act. The Postal \nService will be forced to resort to dramatic and Draconian service cuts \nthat will drive still more customers from the system if we do not act. \nSo just closing our eyes and pretending somehow the Postal Service will \nfind a way through this, without our legislation, is not a realistic \noption.\n  As I have indicated, there are a variety of views on both sides of \nthe aisle on what the appropriate path forward should be, and we will \nhave a vigorous debate today--we started it last week--on what the best \noption is for the Postal Service. For me, the bottom line is this: The \nPostal Service will not survive if it pursues a course that risks \nalienating the remaining customers it does have. So resorting to \nwidespread closures of postal processing plants, which would \nessentially do away with overnight delivery of mail, and raising prices \nso big mailers pursue alternatives to using the Postal Service for \ndelivery are not the solutions to the Postal Service's woes.\n  On the other hand, the Postal Service clearly cannot continue to do \nbusiness as usual. It has to innovate. It has to look for new sources \nof revenue, and we have given some very specific ideas in our bill by \nallowing, for example, the Postal Service to provide services and share \nspace with Federal, State, and local governments and to also ship beer \nand wine with a signature from the customer, just as its competitors, \nFedEx and UPS--United Parcel Service--are able to do. We also do not \nprohibit the closure of all post offices, nor do we mandate a certain \nnumber be closed; instead, we set standards. We set service standards, \nand those service standards would govern the decisions the Postal \nService would make. I think that is the appropriate way to approach the \nvery difficult issue of how to reduce the infrastructure of the Postal \nService.\n  But the fact remains--and it is a painful fact--that 80 percent of \nthe Postal Service's budget is workforce related. It is always \ndifficult to recognize when a workforce, particularly one as dedicated \nas the American Postal Service workforce, is simply too big\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nfor the volume of work the Postal Service now has. But there are \ncompassionate ways to deal with this workforce problem, and our bill \nallows for a refund of an $11 billion overpayment the Postal Service \nhas made to the Federal Employees Retirement System--known as the FERS \nsystem. This is an overpayment that has been verified by an independent \nboard of private actuaries the Office of Personnel Management relies \nupon. It has also been verified by the Government Accountability \nOffice. This overpayment, in part, can be used and would be directed to \nbe used by the Postmaster General to offer retirement incentives and \nbuyouts up to and capped at $25,000, the exact same number that is used \nin buyouts in Federal agencies to reduce the workforce.\n\n  More than one-third of the Postal Service's employees are eligible \nfor retirement today. That is why the Postmaster General believes, if \nhe provides a bit of an incentive, he can reduce the size of the Postal \nService workforce by more than 100,000 workers. That is about 18 \npercent of the entire workforce. That approach of using retirement \nincentives, buyouts, and incentives such as that is very similar to the \napproach the private sector uses, that large corporations use when they \nare faced with the painful task of having to downsize their workforce.\n  The rest of the overpayment refund would be used to pay down debt, \nsomething the Postal Service desperately needs to do as it approaches \nthat $15 billion line-of-credit cap.\n  I wish to stress--because there is going to be a lot of discussion \nabout this, perhaps very shortly--these are not tax dollars being \nrefunded to the Postal Service. I read from a letter from the inspector \ngeneral on the floor last week that verifies the revenues for the FERS \npayment come from two sources: They come from the postal employees \nthemselves who contribute to the FERS system, and the revenues come \nfrom the Postal Service's own revenues, which are from selling stamps, \nmailing packages, and the other services the Postal Service provides.\n  This is not a taxpayer bailout. It is not a refund of taxpayer \ndollars. This is a refund of a substantial overpayment of money from \nthe Postal Service's employees and the Postal Service itself, from \nrevenues it generated, to the FERS system that never should have \noccurred. That is another whole issue--of how it occurred. This \noverpayment has been confirmed by the GAO and by an independent board \nof actuaries hired by the Office of Personnel Management.\n  That is a very important part of this bill. If the Postmaster General \nis successful--as I believe he will be if he aggressively implements \nthese provisions in compassionately reducing the size of the \nworkforce--the estimates are that provision alone would save about $8 \nbillion a year, and it would allow the Postmaster General to right size \nmany of the processing plants. Some of the processing plants are too \nbig for the volume they now have.\n  But the answer is not to close them altogether because that has such \na detrimental impact on the delivery of mail, and that leaves rural \nAmerica behind. That would result in there no longer being overnight \ndelivery for first-class mail.\n  Let me give an example from my State, where the Postmaster General \nhas unwisely proposed closing one of only two processing plants we have \nin a State as large as the State of Maine. He would keep the one in the \nsouthernmost tip of the State but close the one in Hampden, ME, which \nserves northern, central and eastern and parts of western Maine. It \nserves about two-thirds of the geography of the State. If that postal \nprocessing plant were to close, mail from northern Maine--being sent \nfrom one community in northern Maine to another--would have to undergo \na more than 600-mile round trip to the one remaining processing plant \nin Maine. I can't imagine how many days that would take, but I am \ncertain it would cause people to stop using the mail, and, thus, \nrevenue would decline still further because there would be no \npossibility of overnight delivery of bill payments, for example, or \nbill delivery.\n  This is not the answer. So what is the answer? That plant could be \ndownsized, not closed. We need to preserve the service.\n  If the plant is too large now for the volume of mail that goes \nthrough the plant, why doesn't the Postal Service rent out part of the \nplant? I am sure a mailer in the area--perhaps several mailers in the \narea--would welcome the opportunity to rent space in that building and \nbe right next to the postal processing plant. That would work very \nwell.\n  There are so many options, but the Postmaster General, in my view, \nhas not pursued those options. When it comes to rural post offices, \nthere are so many options. For example, a post office could be open in \na rural community, say, from 7:00 to 9:00 in the morning and 5:00 to \n7:00 at night so that individuals going to and from work could stop and \ndo their business, but the Postal Service would still be able to save \nfunds by not having the post office open the entire day. A small post \noffice could be colocated in a retail facility--the local pharmacy, \nperhaps, or the local grocery store.\n  There are possibilities which need to be explored--and which our bill \ndirects the Postmaster General to explore--in order to avoid the \nwidespread closure of post offices in rural America that will have a \ndetrimental impact on the individuals and the businesses located there. \nOur bill in essence forces more creativity on the Postal Service by \nagain setting standards with the Postal Regulatory Commission, which is \nthe regulator in this case, and then ensuring that the actions of the \nPostal Service with regard to infrastructure meet those standards.\n  This bill has many other provisions that we discussed at length last \nweek, so I am not going to repeat them now, but let me reiterate the \npoint I made at the beginning of my remarks.\n  We have been able to negotiate, with the cooperation of both the \nmajority leader and the Republican leader and with a lot of hard work \nby the members of the committee and the floor staff and our staff, a \nvery fair process that will allow many amendments to be offered, \nexpressing a wide variety of philosophies and views on the proper road \nahead. But what we cannot do is fail to act. If we do not act, that \nwill be a death sentence for the Postal Service--an American \ninstitution enshrined in our Constitution that is the linchpin of a $1 \ntrillion mailing industry that employs 8.7 million Americans.\n  This debate is not just about rural post offices, important though \nthey are. It is about our economy and not delivering a death blow to an \ninstitution that is the center of much of our economy. I hope Members \nkeep that in mind as they come to the floor with proposals, for \nexample, to essentially privatize the Postal Service or to do away with \nmost of its infrastructure because if those amendments prevail, they \nwill deliver a crushing blow to our economy at a time when we can least \nafford it, and they will jeopardize that trillion-dollar mailing \nindustry that includes everything from paper manufacturers, to magazine \npublishers, to newspapers, to financial services--all of these \nindustries that are so dependent on the U.S. Postal Service--and that \nis an outcome we must avoid.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss S. 1789, \nthe 21st Century Postal Service Act. I regret to say there is a \nfundamental problem with this bill that we have to address. I wish it \nweren't so, but I am afraid it is. The bill would increase the Federal \ndeficit by $34 billion. This violates the deficit neutrality provisions \nfor spending that we adopted as part of the Budget Control Act just \nlast summer. As a result, there are at least five budget points of \norder that lie against the bill, and I, the ranking Republican on the \nBudget Committee, will be raising points of order at the appropriate \ntime. That means it would take 60 votes of our 100 Members in the \nSenate to say we don't want to agree and follow the law we passed last \nsummer.\n  Under the Senate rules, no committee can bring a bill to the floor \nthat spends even one penny more than already is going to be spent under \nthe current law or increases the deficit more than it would increase \nunder current law. Current law is the Budget Control Act of last \nsummer, and it was passed, as we all recall, as part of a major debate \nover raising the debt ceiling, so we could continue to borrow money. \nBorrowing at the rate of--about 40 cents of every dollar we spend.\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\n  In August we agreed to modest, though insufficient savings. Although \nwe talked about big cuts, we only managed to reduce the growth in \nspending, not the actual level. The debt deal established basic \nspending limits. Not one word in that law prevents us or any Member of \nCongress from saving more. The law set the maximum, not the minimum, \nthat we can spend.\n  But this bill violates that legislation. It spends above the agreed-\nupon limits. Only in Washington does spending below a limit get one \naccused of breaking a deal while spending more than the agreement means \npeople just look the other way.\n  The majority leader and the chairman of the Budget Committee are \nproud of the Budget Control Act. They say it has iron-clad restraints \non spending. They say we do not even need a budget.\n  But where are they when it comes to making sure this agreement is \nactually followed? It is curious that we don't have leadership from the \nmajority leader or the Budget Committee chairman to tell the committee: \nLook, we understand the Postal Service has serious problems. We \nunderstand that. Something probably needs to be done to fix that and \nimprove that situation. It may even cost some money. But to do so, \nshouldn't we comply with the law of the United States and what we \nagreed to just last summer?\n  As this unfolds you will hear part of the reason that spending \nincreases is because the bill requires the Treasury to repay the Postal \nService $11 billion that the Postal Service has overpaid to the U.S. \nTreasury for retirement contributions of current employees.\n  I am not debating that argument and whether it is an overpayment. I \nam not debating it. We have experts who have looked at it and said it \nis basically accurate, that the Treasury does owe the postal department \n$11 billion. Maybe under some circumstances we are required to pay that \nback. I don't argue that at this point.\n  I say if we pay it back, is it not an expenditure of the United \nStates? If you are behind on your car payment shouldn't you look to see \nwhere else you can cut spending? That is all we are talking about. You \nhave to understand it costs money. The money comes from somewhere.\n  I think most people understand the U.S. Government borrows money \nthrough T-bill sales, and we pay interest on the money we are \nborrowing. The fastest growing item in our budget is interest on our \ndebt, so we ought to be cutting spending to pay for this. Over 10 years \nthat is $11 billion. That is a lot. But $11 billion is a little over $1 \nbillion a year, and this year alone we will spend, as I recall, \napproximately $3,600 billion. So we couldn't pay this money back? We \ncould not find $1 billion a year to pay the money back? We have to just \nborrow it in addition to the money we have agreed to borrow, breaching \nthe debt limit we have agreed not to breach?\n  I have to note, unfortunately, the $11 billion is only one-third of \nthe debt impact of the legislation. It is only one-third of the amount \nby which the bill breaks the agreement of last summer.\n  What else accounts for the total $34 billion? Most of the deficit \nincrease of the bill, about two-thirds, occurs because the bill would \nrestructure the amount the Postal Service is supposed to pay to the \nOffice of Personnel Management to fund the future retiree health \nbenefits of the current Postal Service employees--coverage for them \nwhen they retire.\n  In 2006 the Congress enacted the Postal Accountability Act to set the \nPostal Service on a self-sustaining course. According to one of the \nmanagers of the bill, that law included ``a requirement that the Postal \nService endorsed at the time,'' that the Postal Service prefund the \nfuture retiree health benefits of the current postal employees on an \naccrual basis. That 2006 law set out a schedule of those required \npayments to the government.\n  Now, 6 years later, the Postal Service says they are unable to make \nthose required payments. We already enacted a bill last year partially \nrelieving the Postal Service of some of their required 2011 payment, so \nthis bill would defer those payments and stretch out the amount of time \nto pay them.\n  How much is the Postal Service allowed to defer? The legislation \nallows the Postal Service to defer $23 billion in payments for retiree \nhealth benefits. This legislation would transfer, in part, the burden \nof these restructured payments from the users of the Postal Service, \nthe stamp buyers, to taxpayers.\n  This means the Treasury has to go out and borrow the money over the \nnext 10 years because the Postal Service is relieved from making the \nhealth care payments. Again, a budget produced under regular order that \nI have truly felt we should have done--and remain disappointed, deeply, \nthat has not occurred--should have planned for this by including policy \nchanges somewhere else in the budget that would have offset the cost of \nthis bill.\n  Because the bill does not do that, because it adds to the debt of the \nUnited States, and violates the Budget Control Act I will raise a point \nof order that will require 60 votes to waive it.\n  If this new spending is necessary, and I suspect some of it may be, \nthen isn't it worth cutting spending somewhere else to pay for it? Do \nwe really have to break our spending agreement when we are facing the \nfourth straight deficit in excess of $1 trillion.\n  Washington is in a state of financial chaos. We are in denial. We are \nnot owning up to the fact that there are limits on what we can do. You \ntell me how long we can borrow $1 trillion a year, substantially more \nthan we take in every year.\n  The Government Services Administration is throwing lavish parties in \nLas Vegas. The Government Accountability Office has identified $400 \nbillion--maybe we could pay the $34 billion out of this $400 billion--\nbeing spent every year, each year, on waste, inefficiency, and \nduplication. That is the official Government Accountability Office.\n  Far worse, the Senate's Democratic majority has failed to produce a \nbudget plan in calendar year 2010, 2011, and now 2012. This Sunday, in \nfact, marks exactly 3 years since the last time the Senate passed a \nbudget.\n  A budget means responsible behavior. It requires and forces Congress \nto make tough choices.\n  Now we say the Postal Service needs more money, and we will just \nborrow it. This is not responsible behavior.\n  The White House warns that Republicans want to cut too much spending. \nBut the American people know the truth, and the truth is we have never \nspent more money than we are spending today and spent it more \nrecklessly and with less accountability.\n  This is in many ways a decisive moment. I deeply respect my \ncolleagues who have worked on this legislation. It is very complex; it \nis very important; it is a very difficult issue. But this country has \nto rationally confront the difficulties in the Postal Service. The \nworld is changing. E-mail continues to erode the market for traditional \nmail. The Postal Service has to adapt to keep up with the times. We \ncannot just keep throwing money at it.\n\n  I deeply respect the people who worked on this, but I do believe it \nis a crucial vote. Even if one supports every dollar of spending in the \nbill, do you support violating the Budget Control Act? I ask my \ncolleagues to vote to sustain the budget point of order. Let's stand up \nfor fiscal responsibility.\n  In effect, we would send the bill back to our good committee, and say \nto them: Look at it. If they can spend less, please do so. But if they \nfeel they have to spend more money to sustain the Postal Service, \npropose how it should be offset. It would meet the requirements and \npromises we made to the American people.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to share these remarks. It is \ngoing to be difficult to fix, but certainly not impossible. If this \nbill is sent back--I know my colleagues will figure out a way to pay \nfor it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lieberman). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, but I \nwill be responding.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me start by responding to the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee by saying that I could not agree with \nhim\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\nmore that it is absolutely unacceptable that we have not had a budget \npassed in the Senate for more than 1,000 days. That is totally \nunacceptable. It is one of the reasons we are in such a financial \ncrisis in this country. So I completely agree with Senator Sessions \nthat we should be doing a budget resolution on the Senate floor, and I \nwholeheartedly agree with his comments that it is absolutely \nirresponsible for us to be proceeding without a budget resolution. And \nas a member of the Appropriations Committee, I would say to my \ncolleagues that it makes it very difficult for us to carry out our \nwork. Due to the cooperation of the chairman and ranking member of that \ncommittee, we are operating under allocations for each subcommittee, \nbut it would be far preferable if there were a budget resolution that \npassed, and it should have passed last year, the year before, and it \nshould be passed this year. So we are in complete agreement on that \npoint, and I know that has been a great source of frustration for the \nSenator from Alabama as the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  Having said that, let me explain a few facts. First of all, there are \nno tax dollars being authorized by this reform bill. There is no \ntransfer of taxpayer money to the Postal Service. What we have here is \na very strange and unusual budget situation. And the score CBO has is \nincredibly misleading because the Postal Service, oddly enough, is part \nof the unified budget of the United States even though most of its \naccounts are off-budget, but it participates in Federal employee \nretirement systems and the health benefits systems and the workers' \ncompensation systems, where postal dollars that come from postal \nemployees and from postal ratepayers are commingled, if you will, with \ntax dollars that come from other Federal agencies into the retirement \nsystem, the workers' comp system, and the health benefits system. And \nthat creates this odd situation, which makes it very difficult for CBO \nto score this bill correctly.\n  The inspector general of the Postal Service puts it far more bluntly. \nIn a February 22 report from this year called ``Budget Enforcement \nProcedures and the Postal Service,'' the inspector general said:\n\n     . . . the Postal Service's off-budget status . . . expose[s] \n     the Postal Service to an inappropriate and illogical \n     application of the scoring process that threatens its ability \n     to reform and heal its financial condition. Scoring and \n     budget enforcement were created for a good purpose, but they \n     are undermined when the scoring process assumes that unlikely \n     or inappropriate inflows to the Treasury must occur.\n\n  Let me give you a couple of examples because it is incredibly \nimportant that we walk through the score so that our colleagues can \nunderstand the unique on-budget/off-budget status of the Postal \nService, particularly in the area of reducing payments to retiree \nhealth benefits or recovering overpayments to the FERS system and how \nthe CBO scoring method obscures the true savings achieved by refunding \nthe FERS payments.\n  Again, let me repeat that since 1971 the Postal Service has received \nno Federal subsidy to operate other than some very minor appropriated \ndollars for functions that the Postal Service is legislatively mandated \nto do, such as mail for the blind and overseas ballots for our troops. \nThat is it. Prior to 1971 there was a taxpayer subsidy year after year \nto the Postal Service, but that ended with the Postal Reform Act in \nthat year. So from the sale of stamps, the cost of shipping packages, \nand the rates mailers and magazine publishers and newspaper publishers \npay to get the print versions delivered comes the revenue for the \nPostal Service. And even the money the Postal Service uses for retiree \nbenefits comes from a combination of the contributions the postal \nworkers make and the money the Postal Service invests.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there is a significant overpayment into the \nFederal Employees Retirement System, and we, along with the \nadministration, the GAO, the independent actuaries, and the Postal \nService inspector general, have all proposed that overpayment be \nreturned to the Postal Service, and it would be used in part to finance \nthese buyouts and retirement incentives to reduce the size of the \npostal workforce.\n  Let's look at how CBO scores this particular part of the bill.\n  First of all, CBO gives this bill no credit whatsoever for the \nbuyouts, and here is why: CBO argues that the Postal Service already \nhas buyout authority, but as the Presiding Officer knows better than \nanybody in this Chamber, our bill changes the status quo in two \ncritical ways. First of all, the Postal Service has no cash right now \nto do these buyouts. That is one of the reasons we are so eager to get \nthe money from the overpayment of FERS refunded to the Postal Service. \nSecond, in our substitute bill, we specifically direct the Postmaster \nGeneral to use a portion of this money to entice 18 percent of the \ncurrent postal workers to accept this offer. That is a big difference. \nSo there is a mandatory direction to the Postmaster General to reduce \nthe workforce by about 18 percent and there is the cash that will allow \nhim to offer buyouts to do that. Why CBO doesn't score that as a \nsavings to the Postal Service is beyond me.\n  There is another way to reduce the workforce and, again, the funds \nfor this would come from the FERS refund. Our bill provides new \nauthority to the Postal Service to offer 1 or 2 years of credited \nservice toward a pension annuity so that for a worker who is just \nlacking a year or two to reach the number of years necessary for \nretirement could be credited with that extra year or two of service, \ndepending on which retirement system the worker is in. Unfortunately, \nthe CBO makes an assumption that only several thousand employees would \ntake advantage of that offer and credits the bill with savings of only \n$643 million over 10 years. Since these kinds of service credits have \nnever been offered before, it is not clear how the CBO came up with \nthis assumption. There is no precedent for it. There is no data for the \nCBO to use. Again, our original bill did not include the hard \nrequirement for the 18-percent reduction, but our substitute does. Yet \nCBO does not recognize that change.\n  The Postal Service has told us, as the Presiding Officer would \nattest, these requirements and this new authority and the funds for the \nbuyouts and the service credit would allow them to reduce their \nworkforce in the neighborhood of 100,000 employees and save some $8 \nbillion a year. That is not reflected in the estimate. I use that \nexample because it shows how strange the scoring is. This is a quirk of \nthe budget-scoring rules because when there is a transfer of Postal \nService money--not taxpayer money, Postal Service money--from one \naccount in the Treasury, such as the retirement account, into an off-\nbudget postal operations account, the CBO makes this assumption that \nsavings are not going to occur. So when we transfer the $11 billion \noverpayment--the refund--from the pension account, to which the Postal \nService has been overcharged, into a postal operating account, it gets \ncredited as $5.5 billion instead of $11 billion. That means an on-\nbudget account loses $11 billion, as CBO looks at it, and the off-\nbudget account only gains $5.5 billion. This is very complex because it \nis so obscure and because, frankly, it is so illogical. The result is \nthe net score in the unified budget of $5.5 billion as a cost to the \nTreasury, and that simply is not the reality. Again, these are not \ntaxpayer dollars that went into the overpayment in the first place. So \nhere we have a provision that is being scored as the $5.5 billion cost \nto the Treasury when, in fact, they aren't tax dollars, and it is only \nbecause this is a unified budget, where some of the accounts are on-\nbudget and some of the accounts are off-budget, that we have this \nanomalous result. It doesn't make sense.\n  Let me give my colleagues another example. The CBO acknowledges that \nour reforms of the Federal Workers' Compensation Program would save \n$1.2 billion, but CBO doesn't count this reduction as a savings because \nof the way the Department of Labor charges agencies for participation \nin the workers' compensation program. Again, that doesn't make any \nsense, when the CBO itself acknowledges that these are real reforms \nthat are going to save $1.2 billion. Yet we only get credit for $200 \nmillion of the reforms.\n  There is another issue. The CBO does not account for what would \nhappen if the Postal Service allows service to continue to deteriorate \nbecause the CBO doesn't recognize the reality that all the big mailers \nand small mailers tell us, which is that revenue will be driven out of \nthe system if the service\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\ncuts associated with plant closures and wholesale closures of post \noffices are allowed to proceed. The bottom line is that were it not for \n50-percent discounts being applied over and over to the savings we \nachieve for 5-day delivery, retiree health care, the pension refund, on \nthe basis of these strange behavioral assumptions and reflecting the \nodd combination of off-budget and on-budget accounts being brought \ntogether in a unified budget, the bill would have scored approximately \n$24.6 billion more in off-budget savings, making the bill a net saver \nof $14.8 billion.\n  This is so frustrating because it is so complex, but I think if our \ncolleagues look at the example of the FERS overpayment, it becomes very \nclear because there are no taxpayer dollars involved. Yet it is scored \nas a cost to the Treasury of $5.5 billion. How can a refund of an \noverpayment that involves no tax dollars end up being scored as a cost \nto the Treasury of $5.5 billion? That is how illogical and quirky this \nestimate is, and it is because of the unique status of the Postal \nService and how its various accounts are reflected in the budget.\n  In addition to my absolute conviction that this score is very \nmisleading, let me make another point. If we do not proceed with this \nbill--if this budget point of order brings down this bill--the Postal \nService will not survive as we know it. Again, we are not providing a \ntaxpayer subsidy in this bill. In fact, I would argue we are preventing \na taxpayer bailout in this bill because later this year, if the Postal \nService cannot meet its payroll and thus is unable to deliver mail, I \nthink the pressure for the taxpayer bailout will increase \nsubstantially, and I do not want to see us return to the pre-1971 era, \nwhere the taxpayers were on the hook for the Postal Service. Our bill \nwould avoid that outcome.\n  Thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for \nliberating me from the chair so I may now speak in my capacity as a \nSenator from the State of Connecticut. First, I would like to thank my \nfriend from Maine, Senator Collins, for what I thought was a very \nconvincing, insightful description and really a critique of the CBO \nestimate of the financial impact of this bill.\n  This is tough to follow. The two of us, Senator Collins and I, and \nothers on the committee have been deeply saturated in this for probably \ntoo long. But the fact is, when the CBO estimate of the bill came out \nsaying it was going to cost more than we were saving, I was shocked. As \nI read over it, part of it is because they are not simply considering \nthe Postal Service budget, which we are out to save; that is, to cut a \nlot of money from it so it can be saved, and as Senator Collins said, \nthe Postal Service is off-budget. It does not spend taxpayers' money \nexcept for those two little matters of paying for ballots for military \npersonnel and others overseas, and I think the other is for blind \npeople in this country, but the rest of it is all paid by the \nratepayers. So as you go over, one by one, as Senator Collins did, the \nelements of the ``costs''--and I put quotations around them--they are \njust not real. This is form over substance. This is a kind of ``Alice \nin Wonderland'' accounting that does not relate to the reality of the \nPostal Service's budget or the Federal budget.\n  The so-called FERS repayment that is coming from the Federal \nGovernment, everyone agrees--including Senator Sessions, who stated his \nintention of making a budget point of order on our Postal Service \nbill--the Postal Service did overpay this amount of money, just as if a \ntaxpayer overpaid taxes. Well, if I overpay my taxes, that is my money \nI am asking back from the government. In this case, the Postal Service \nhas overpaid to the Federal retiree pension fund, and it is asking for \nits money back.\n  There is something else to be said here about the reality of \naccounting in the real world. When the approximately $11 billion--or \nmaybe more--is paid back to the Postal Service, that only happens once, \nwhen that total is paid back. But what we have demanded in the bill be \ndone with a part of that money, which is to get involved in this \nincentive for early retirement or retirement when members of the Postal \nService are eligible, mandating that 18 percent--about 100,000 postal \nemployees--retire, that saves $8.1 billion on a recurring basis every \nyear. So you have the one-time--it may come in two or three payments \nbut only one-time--$11 billion repayment to the Postal Service for the \noverpayment it made, and then every year it saves $8.1 billion, \nforever. That is a pretty good deal both for the taxpayers and the \nPostal Service.\n  Secondly--and Senator Collins went on very effectively about this--\nthe prefunding of health benefits. The fact is in the Postal Reform Act \nof 2006--you might call it an excess of caution--the Postal Service was \nrequired to make payments into the retiree health benefits fund that \nare greater than most any other business or government in the country. \nWe have just spread this out to a 4-year payment schedule according to \nthe normal discount rate other Federal programs pay for their retirees' \nbenefits.\n  Senator Collins talked at length about the impact of the way in which \nthe CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, refuses to score--as we say, \ncount--dollar-for-dollar the amount of money saved by early \nretirements, which does not make any sense because that is what will be \nsaved.\n  Now, I want to enter into the Record at this point--and speak to it--\nthe estimate of the U.S. Postal Service about what our substitute \namendment to S. 1789 will save, and it is quite dramatic. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE--PLAN TO PROFITABILITY--DRAFT--4/17  S. 1789 AMENDED (APR 16)--MANAGERS\n                                            SUBSTITUTE, AS OF 4 16 12\n                                                 [in $Billions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                         S 1789\n                                  2011       2012       2013       2014          2015          2016     Section\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBase Case:\n    Revenue..................     $65.7       64.0       63.4       62.7              62.0      61.6\n    Total Operating Expenses.     .67.9       69.5       69.9       72.0              74.5      77.1\n                              ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Operating Income/(Loss)..

All along, our goal has been to get to a point, over 3 \nor 4 years, where we would save as close to $20 billion a year as we \ncould. That is the number Postmaster General Donahoe gave to our \ncommittee as to what he needed, the Postal Service needed to get back \nin balance.\n  On the current course, in fiscal year 2016 the U.S. Postal Service--I \nam reading now from the statement I have entered into the Record that \nthe Postal Service has given us--will have a deficit of $21.3 billion. \nIn 2016, under the passage of S. 1789 with our substitute amendment, \nthe loss is reduced to $1.8 billion. That is from $21.3 billion to $1.8 \nbillion. Well, of course, we want to get it to total balance, but we \nare clearly going to hit balance after that on the course we are on. \nThat means, according to the Postal Service, passage of S. 1789 with \nour substitute amendment will save the Postal Service over $19 billion \na year by 2016. That is exactly what the Postal Service needs to stay \nalive.\n  We do it without compelling layoffs. We do it with incentives for \nretirement. We do it without mandating--as some of the amendments would \nthat we will vote on tomorrow--the mass closure of mail-processing \nfacilities or our post offices around the country, which, as Senator \nCollins said, would be a kind of shock therapy. It would so jolt the \nsystem that people would turn away from the post offices in increasing \nnumbers. In fact, it would accelerate the loss of revenue. We do it \nwithout an immediate move from 6 days of delivery to 5 days because \nthat is a tough one for a lot of people. We have given the Postal \nService 2 years to essentially prove it can get back in balance without \nthat move from 6 days to 5 days of delivery.\n  We have added new sources of revenue. We have created a process here, \nwhich is not scored by the Postal Service, that we think can add more \nmoney because it will develop a new business model, a new way to use \nthe assets the Postal Service has to make more money.\n  The fact is--I want to emphasize this again--this saving of $19 \nbillion, which will result by 2016 if this substitute to S. 1789 is \npassed, does not take any taxpayer funds. In fact, it properly returns \ncertain overpayments to the Postal Service.\n  The CBO score for S. 1789 is simply misleading--profoundly \nmisleading--because of the kinds of accounting rules that do not relate \nto the reality of the budget for the Postal Service.\n  I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish. It took a lot of \nwork. As Senator Collins has said, if this point of order Senator \nSessions intends to make at some point in the debate--hopefully after \nthe amendments are voted on--is sustained, it will end this bill. \nInstead of, therefore, having passed a bill which, if it goes all the \nway to enactment, would save $19 billion for the Postal Service every \nyear by 2016, the Postal Service's deficit and debt spiral would \ncontinue downward. I would predict there would be massive cutbacks in \nservices and a loss of employment by people in the Postal Service but \nparticularly among the 8 million people who are in jobs that depend on \nthe Postal Service in the private sector for their livelihoods. So with \nall respect, I will vigorously oppose the point of order my friend from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, will make.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia. Does he wish to speak?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the chairman \nand Senator Collins for their work on this bill. I know it has caused a \ngreat deal of interest and consternation, but the numbers are \noverwhelming that without this kind of legislation, the fate of our \nPostal Service would be in great jeopardy. I commend both the chairman \nand ranking member for their very good work. I intend to support the \nlegislation. I know they have had to make some hard choices, but I \nthink they are putting the Postal Service back on the path to \nsustainability, and I commend their leadership.\n  I also thank them both for an amendment they have been kind enough to \ninclude in, I believe, a revised bill, a managers' package, that takes \non a related issue that affects not only Postal Service employees but \nall Federal employees; that is, the absolutely dreadful performance--\nwhich is starting to be corrected, but the absolutely dreadful \nperformance that OPM and agencies of the government, including the \nPostal Service, have done in terms of making sure our Federal employees \nreceive their retirement benefits in a timely manner.\n  The Presiding Officer and I, both from the Commonwealth of Virginia, \nhave 130,000 Federal employees in Virginia. There are 140,000 Federal \nemployees across the river in Maryland. I am happy Senator Mikulski has \ncosponsored the amendment I am going to talk about in a few moments.\n  I want to explain the problem we are facing and why I am asking the \nSenate to adopt this amendment during the consideration of this bill to \nreform the postal system.\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\n  Over the past year, I and other Members in both parties have received \nhundreds of requests for assistance from Federal retirees who have \nexperienced significant delays in obtaining their full retirement \nbenefits--delays that oftentimes exceed 12 months, sometimes as much as \n18 months and more. In the meantime, these Federal retirees--and no one \nquestions that they deserve and should receive these benefits, but \nsince there is slow processing and antiquated technology, they are not \ngetting these earned retirement benefits. These retirees face \ninordinate hardships trying to pay their bills and survive on partial \npayments made while their retirement paperwork moves through the \nsystem.\n  Remarkably, in 2012, our whole retirement system is still a paper-\nbased system. OPM also relies upon every other Federal agency, such as \nthe post office and others where a Federal employee works, to assemble \nand submit the retiree's paperwork in a timely and efficient manner. \nBut as we have seen with the occasional snapshots that have been taken, \nsome agencies literally have a 30- to 50-percent error rate in \nsubmitting the background material for the retiree so OPM can \nappropriately process the paperwork.\n  Part of the goal of this postal reform, I know, is going to be to \nencourage some of the voluntary retirements in the postal system--again \nwhy this amendment is so timely. Meanwhile, the retirees wait and wait \nfor benefits; benefits they have earned, and, unfortunately, benefits \nthey cannot get access to. We continue to hear from recent Federal \nretirees who literally spend 8 or 10 hours a day trying to get through \non the customer service line to find out where their benefits are.\n  I would like to share a few examples of what we are hearing. We \nrecently heard from a retired colonel from Williamsburg, VA, who wrote, \n``I retired in March 2011 and at the time of this writing OPM has still \nnot figured out my full retirement pay . . . my savings are getting \nlow.''\n  From here in Northern Virginia, in Dumfries, VA, we heard from a \nretiree who said:\n\n       I have been subjected to a severe financial hardship \n     because of not getting my full benefits. I was recently told \n     that the bank is repossessing my auto because I cannot afford \n     to make the payments.\n\n  He cannot make the payments because this retiree was not getting her \nbenefits. She was existing on partial benefits until OPM could deal \nwith the processing.\n  From Warrenton:\n\n       I am seeking assistance with obtaining my husband's health \n     insurance which was canceled unexpectedly. He worked for DOD. \n     I notified OPM with the appropriate forms and a copy of his \n     death certificate, all of which was apparently lost by OPM. I \n     tried to obtain new forms but was told it would take up to 6 \n     weeks. I am 80 years old and need my health insurance now. My \n     husband and I were married for 60 years.\n\n  This is unacceptable. This is not the way we ought to be running this \nimportant part of our Federal Government. In January of 2012, OPM's \nretirement backlog exceeded 62,000 cases--62,000 Federal employees, \nretirees--who were waiting to get their benefits. Again, let me point \nout, many of these retirees were waiting for more than 1 year.\n  We saw huge backlogs in disability claims, death benefits, and \nquarterly benefits. By OPM's own account, it takes almost 700 days, \nnearly 2 years, to process some death benefits. Recently, after my \nmeetings with OPM and other members of the delegation, OPM has made \nsome limited progress in reversing the tide of retirement claims. The \nretirement backlog is now 52,000 claims. OPM has hired new staff and is \nstarting to modernize its outdated processing, but it is clear more \nneeds to be done.\n  I wish to also compliment Senator Akaka, who was kind enough to let \nme join an oversight hearing on this matter back in February of this \nyear. What I heard there worried me. So I sent my staff to OPM's \nretirement processing facility last month to see the problem up close. \nUnfortunately, my staff's reports confirmed my worst fears. The current \nprocess is largely manual, cumbersome, and contributes to significant \ndelays and potential errors. We have been told the newest OPM \ntechnology is 12 years old. That is pretty remarkable. It is simply no \nlonger feasible to expect that manual data entry for retirement and \nbenefits claims make sense when we have technology that can \ndramatically lower processing time and increase accuracy.\n  OPM needs to modernize its technology in the long run. But in 2012, \nthey need to at least start taking some short-term steps. It is \nunacceptable that they rely upon paper processing in 2012. OPM, as I \nmentioned, has made some progress. But ultimately they still want to \nremain committed to a paper processing system. That does not make any \nsense. The kicker is this problem is not new. As indicated by this \npress story, Federal agencies routinely point the finger of blame at \nOPM for causing these delays, while OPM points the finger back at the \nindividual agencies for not getting the information to OPM in a timely \nmanner.\n  One might think this story was written in the last few weeks. There \nhave actually been stories written in the Post in the last few weeks \nabout this subject. But the day I am quoting from on this story is \nactually May 9, 1988. That is 24 years ago. Ronald Reagan was President \nwhen this was written, and we have had four Presidents since then. Yet \nOPM continues to offer the same excuses and the same kind of back-and-\nforth finger-pointing between agencies. We have seen this show before. \nIt needs to be taken off the air.\n  What are we going to do with this amendment and how does this affect \ntrying to move the ball forward? My amendment will do three things. \nFirst, it requires OPM to report to Congress, GAO, and the public about \nthe timeliness and accuracy of Postal Service claims, requiring OPM to \ncompare the Postal Service with the performance of all other Federal \nagencies. So we need to figure out, because we do not know at this \npoint--we have a 52,000-claim backlog--whether the backlog is because \nthe agency the employee worked for did not get the information to OPM \nin a timely manner or whether OPM has not processed this.\n  This amendment will require the Postal Service to assess how it is \ndoing, getting this information to OPM, and compare that with the \nperformance of other Federal agencies. This will allow us to see which \nFederal agencies have the best and worst track records in submitting \npaperwork to OPM. The snapshot we saw a little bit earlier this year at \nthe hearing in February showed that a number of agencies had literally \na 30- to 50-percent error rate in submitting their retirement paperwork \nto OPM.\n  With close to 100,000 potential new retirees--actually a much larger \nnumber, but the effect of this bill may urge the voluntary retirement \nof 100,000 postal workers to retirement--OPM is going to get hit by a \ntsunami.\n  Second, the report will also require OPM to provide a claims aging \nreport. We need to know how long retirement applications have been \npending at OPM. By the way, we do not have any of that information \nright now for the 52,000 cases that are currently pending--no basic \naging report.\n  Third, the amendment will require OPM to at least move forward a \nlittle bit in modernizing one piece of their technology, so OPM can at \nleast receive some electronic payroll data from the Postal Service \nsystem.\n\n  Now, 551,000 people work for the Postal Service right now. If this \nlegislation passes, which I hope it will, and we see the voluntary \nretirement of 100,000 postal workers over the coming months and years, \nthat is a new tsunami of retirement benefits claims that are going to \nneed to be processed by OPM.\n  The bottom line is this: OPM, while they are trying to make some \nprogress and I commend Director Berry for some of the actions he has \ntaken, needs to be urged along and we need to get more data about how \nthey do, not only with the Postal Service but with all Federal \nagencies. My amendment will move forward in that direction.\n  The Warner-Mikulski amendment focuses on these key reporting \nrequirements and mandates more transparency so we can untangle the \nchokepoints. I believe we need to honor the dedication and commitment \nof our Federal workforce, including our postal workers, in making sure \nthat when they do retire, they get their Federal retiree benefits in a \ntimely and efficient manner. Again, I wish to thank the chair and the \nranking member for their hard work on this postal reform bill. I look \nforward to supporting it. I also hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this Warner-Mikulski\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\namendment that while tangential to the overall reform of the Postal \nService, making sure these retirees get their benefits in a timely \nmanner is something on which we should all agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia most \nimportantly for focusing our attention--I know Senator Collins and \nSenator Akaka have also been involved in this--on this unacceptable \nsituation, where Federal employees are retiring. Because of a lot of \nfailures here, the failure to implement an effective--it is 2012--\nelectronic system for this purpose, this paper processing, meaning that \npeople have to wait these very long times after they retire, while they \nare waiting, they are getting a significantly reduced benefit which \ncauses real hardship.\n  The Senator from Virginia is absolutely right. We mandate in this \nbill, the underlying bill, that the Postal Service accept the goal of \n18 percent in reduction of workforce. The total number of career \nemployees in the U.S. Postal Service is about 545,000, and 18 percent \ncomes out to around 100,000, which is our goal for reduction. This has \nto happen if the Postal Service is going to get back in balance. \nBecause as Senator Collins said earlier today, 80 percent of the \noperating budget of the Postal Service is personnel costs. Obviously, \nit is a labor-intensive operation. So we are going to have another \n100,000 people. In fact, it keeps going. By 2017, we will have--from \nnow, this year, we will have a total of 138,000 postal employees \neligible to retire. The Postal Service is going to have to work to \nincentivize them to retire so the service overall can stay in balance.\n  I wish to thank Senator Warner because we have worked very well \ntogether on a modification to his amendment, which I think most \nsignificantly will require the Office of Personnel Management to submit \na report to Congress related to the completion of retirement claims for \npostal annuitants, to keep the pressure on them to end this inhumane--\nin many cases, unacceptable--situation.\n  I know when the proper time comes, we intend to support this modified \namendment. It strengthens the bill. It does the right thing. I thank \nthe Senator from Virginia for expressing his intention to support the \noverall bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico.) The Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I too wish to commend the Senator from \nVirginia for offering this amendment in conjunction with the Senator \nfrom Maryland. I wrote to OPM in July of last year about this very \nissue. I was very concerned about reports in my own State and from the \nWashington Post about the tremendous backlog at OPM in processing the \nretirement applications of Federal and postal workers, and this is just \nwrong.\n  As the Senator's statement shows, it has caused some real hardship to \nindividuals. So I was pleased the chairman and I could work with the \nSenator to modify his amendment so it would be germane to this bill. I \nlook forward, at the appropriate time, to working with the chairman to \naccept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to thank the chair and the ranking member for \nworking with me on this amendment to get it appropriately modified. \nThis an area that I think there is broad bipartisan consensus, that we \nneed to make sure--whether postal workers or other workers in the \nFederal system--that when they choose to retire, they can expect those \nretirement benefits in a timely manner.\n  I wish to again commend the chair and the ranking member for the fact \nthat putting in place this very reasonable plan that is going to \nencourage the voluntary retirements of that approximate 18 percent of \nthe workforce--109,000 I believe it amounts to--is going to be a lot \neasier to make that sell if those postal workers can then expect to \nreceive their retirement benefits in a timely manner. I think if they \nare hearing the current scuttlebutt that they may have to wait 12 to 18 \nmonths to get their retirement benefits, it becomes a much harder \neffort for the Postmaster and the management of the Postal System to \nmake--even if they got the right incentives in place--to kind of get \nover that hump if they have to wait a long time.\n  So I very much thank again the chair and ranking member, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins, for their support, and I think trying to \nshine a light, not only on the Postal System but vis-a-vis how other \nFederal agencies are doing will be important. I look forward to working \nwith them. I know they both focused on this issue in the past. I hope \nto lend my assistance to make sure we get this fixed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, thanks to the Senator from Virginia. He \nmakes a very important point: Of the $19 billion in savings that the \nPostal Service itself believes will result annually as of 2016, $8.1 \nbillion will come from the reduction in salaries paid because of \nretirements that are incentivized under this bill.\n  It is common sense that if a worker is thinking about retiring and \nhears there is such a backlog that they are only going to get half of \nwhat they deserve for their pension until the paperwork has cleared, \nthey are probably not going to rush to retire, and, therefore, we are \ngoing to save less money.\n  We are approaching the hour of 2. According to the unanimous consent \nthat governs our activities today in the Senate, we are going to go to \nanother matter, the NLRB rule. I wish to thank particularly Senator \nSessions and Senator Warner who came to the floor to discuss their \namendments. Senator Collins and I will return at 4. We will be here \nuntil 5, when we go to the discussion of a judicial nomination. Then, \nwe will be here after the vote tonight as late as anybody is here to \ndiscuss and debate amendments before we go to the vote tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Maine.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2568-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2568-S2579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE \n NLRB RELATING TO REPRESENTATION ELECTION PROCEDURES--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I make a motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 36.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 36, a joint resolution \n     providing for congressional disapproval, under chapter 8 of \n     title V, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the \n     National Labor Relations Board relating to representation \n     election procedures.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided and controlled between the two leaders \nor their designees.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to ask for disapproval to stop \nthe National Labor Relations Board's ambush election rule. This rule I \nhave been objecting to was put into place by an NLRB that is bound and \ndetermined to stack the odds against American employees and to put \nemployers and employees in an unfair situation. Despite the fact that \nunemployment has remained above 8 percent for the past 3 years, and \nsmall business growth is the most important factor in reversing the \nlackluster trend, the National Labor Relations Board has chosen to \nimpose new rules to aid big labor at the expense of employers, and \nparticularly small business employers and the jobs they would create.\n  If the Senate does not act now to stop this rule by passing my \nresolution, it will go into effect on Monday, April 30, 10 months after \nit was first proposed. The changes that are being made are going to be \na big surprise for the employers and employees who get\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\ncaught in this net, particularly, as I mentioned, the small employers \nwho do not have the human resource departments or in-house counsel. I \nwould expect that we elected representatives of the people are going to \nface a lot of questions about what we did to stop this blatant effort \nto stack the odds in big labor's favor--and we will be asked. This rule \nwill shift the law significantly in favor of big labor.\n  Let me take a moment to explain. Under current practice, there is a \n25-day waiting period between the setting of an election by a hearing \nofficer and the actual secret ballot election. Employers could use this \ntime to familiarize themselves with the requirements and restrictions \nof the law. This is very important because there are many ways that an \nunknowledgeable employer with the best intentions could make a misstep \nthat would be heavily penalized by the NLRB. Employers also use the \ntime to communicate with their employees about the decision they are \nmaking and correct misstatements and falsehoods that they may be \nhearing from union organizers.\n  Parties also use this time to seek review of a decision made by a \nhearing officer or an NLRB regional director. Under the new regulation, \nthe 25-day waiting period is abolished and employers may face an \nelection in as few as 10 days.\n  Is it fair to the employees to only have 10 days to learn how this \nwill affect his or her life, and how much of his or her money this will \ncost?\n  Under current law, both parties are able to raise issues about the \nelection at a preelection hearing, covering such issues as which \nemployees should be included in the bargaining unit and whether \nparticular employees are actually supervisors. Under the new \nregulation, parties will be barred from raising these questions until \nafter the election. Employees will be forced to vote without knowing \nwhich other employees will actually be in the bargaining unit with \nthem. This is important information that weighs heavily in most \nemployees' vote.\n  Additionally, because of the NLRB's decision to allow micro-unions, \nsuch as specialty health care, unions will essentially be granted any \nbargaining unit they design and employers will have a very limited time \nto weigh in.\n  Under current law, when either party raises preelection issues, they \nare allowed to submit evidence and testimony and file posthearing \nbriefs for the hearing officer to consider, and have 14 days in which \nto appeal decisions made with respect to that election.\n  Under the new regulation, the hearing officer is given the broad \ndiscretion to bar all evidence and testimony unrelated to the question \nof representation and all postelection briefs, and no appeals or \nrequests for stays are allowed. This can be quite a disadvantage for \nemployees as well.\n  What this all adds up to is an extremely small window of time from \nfiling a petition to the actual election, little opportunity for \nemployers to learn their rights or communicate with employees their \nrights, and less opportunity for employees to research the union and \nthe ramifications of forming a union. The NLRB is ensuring that the \nodds are stacked against employees and businesses. This vote is an \nopportunity to tell the NLRB to reverse course.\n  If we pass this resolution, as I hope we will, the Senate will not be \nthe only branch of government telling the NLRB it is off track. Last \nmonth, a District of Columbia Federal court told the NLRB that several \nprovisions of its notice-posting regulation were well exceeding their \nauthority and struck them down. This was a judge appointed by President \nObama. Two weeks ago, another Federal court--this time in South \nCarolina--also ruled against the NLRB. It found that the entire notice-\nposting regulation violated congressional intent. Following up on these \ntwo rulings, the DC Court of Appeals stayed the entire rule until \nappeals are completed. The court in that case was frustrated that the \nNLRB did not postpone the rule itself, given the multiple negative \ntreatments in the courts.\n  Unfortunately, that reckless sense of blind mission is consistent \nwith this administration's NLRB. It is kind of like ``Thelma and \nLouise'' driving off a cliff. I, for one, don't want to see the NLRB \ndrive our economy off a cliff. I hope this resolution will pull them \nback and encourage them to focus on their statutory mission.\n  The NLRB enforces the National Labor Relations Act, which is the \ncarefully balanced law that protects the rights of employees to join or \nnot join a union, and also protects the rights of employers to free \nspeech and unrestricted flow of commerce. Since it was enacted in 1935, \nchanges to this statute have been rare. When they have occurred, it has \nbeen the result of careful negotiations with stakeholders. This change \nis one-sided and super quick--an ambush to set up ambush elections.\n\n  The National Labor Relations Board is not an agency that typically \nissues regulations. Listen to this: In fact, in over 75 years the \nNational Labor Relations Board has finalized only three regulations \nthrough formal rulemaking, two of which occurred last year. Let me \nrepeat that. In over 75 years, the National Labor Relations Board has \nfinalized three regulations through informal rulemaking, and two of \nthem occurred just last year--under this current National Labor \nRelations Board. As I mentioned, one of those was already struck down \nby one court and stayed by another.\n  Most of the questions that come up under the law are handled through \ndecisions of the board. Board decisions often do change the enforcement \nof the law significantly, but they are issued in response to an actual \ndispute and question of law. In contrast, the ambush election is not a \nresponse to a real problem because the current election process for \ncertifying whether employees want to form a union is not broken. This \nrule was not carefully negotiated by stakeholders. Instead, it was \nfinalized in just over 6 months despite the fact it drew over 65,000 \ncomments in the 2-month period after it was first proposed.\n  Labor law history provides an interesting contrast to this rushed \nregulatory approach. In the late 1950s, Congress became concerned about \nundemocratic practices, labor racketeering, and mob influence in \ncertain labor unions. To address this the Senate created a special \ncommittee--the Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or \nManagement Field. That operated for 3 years and heard more than 1,500 \nwitnesses over 270 days of hearings.\n  Based upon their investigations, the Senate negotiated and passed \nlegislation to protect the rights of rank-and-file union members and \nemployers. The legislation is known as the Landrum Griffin Act.\n  The issue of how long a period of time there should be between the \nrequest for an election and the actual election came up during those \nnegotiations. My colleagues may be surprised to learn it was Senator \nJohn F. Kennedy who argued vigorously for a 30-day waiting period prior \nto the election. As he said:\n\n       There should be at least a 30 day interval between the \n     request for an election and the holding of an election . . . \n     in which both parties can present their viewpoints. . . . . \n     The 30 day waiting period is an additional safeguard against \n     rushing employees into an election where they are unfamiliar \n     with the issues.\n\n  Again, that was a quote by Senator John F. Kennedy. Fairness to the \nemployees--that is what Senator John F. Kennedy was talking about. The \n30-day waiting period provision he supported did not ultimately become \npart of the law, and, obviously, it is not a law today. Instead, the \nNLRB adopted a practice of a 25-day waiting period in almost every \ncase. But this caution about the need for employees to have a chance to \nbecome familiar with the issues is just as true today.\n  Employees who are not aware of the organizing activity at their \nworksite, and even those who are, need to have an opportunity to learn \nabout the union they may join. They will want to research the union to \nensure it has no signs of corruption. They will want to know how other \nwork sites have fared with this union and whether they can believe the \npromises the union organizers may be extending. Employees should have \nevery chance to understand the impact of unionization.\n  For example, they will no longer be able to negotiate a raise \nindividually with their employer. Doing their jobs better than a fellow \nemployee may no longer bring any benefit whatsoever. Union rules may \neven hinder sales.\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\n  I once had an opportunity to visit a shoe factory. I was in the \nretail shoe business, and we visited a shoe factory. As we went through \nit, I saw some boxes of some of the shoes we normally carry and was \nkind of interested in what the new fashion looked like. So I went over \nand opened a box, and the roof caved in. Not actually, but it seemed as \nif the roof caved in because it had to be somebody who had union \nauthority to open that box. It couldn't be the supervisor. So I \nactually shut down the factory for about 30 minutes just by picking up \na box to look at the shoes that were probably going to be coming to my \nstore at one point in time.\n  Grievances cannot be brought straight to the employer but will, \ninstead, have to go through the filter of union management. Once the \nunion is certified, the National Labor Relations Board has instituted \nsignificant restrictions for when it may be decertified; in other \nwords, when the employees can fire a union as their representative. \nEmployees are barred from petitioning for decertification for a full \nyear after the election and barred as well throughout the term of the \ncollective bargaining agreement. So there is a very small window in \nwhich employees have any opportunity to get rid of a union they do not \nsupport. They are going to be rushed into judgment, and then they are \nstuck with it.\n  Four decades ago Senators recognized employees deserved the \nopportunity to gather this and all other relevant information before \ncasting their votes. Unfortunately, the NLRB is choosing to ignore this \ncaution, and rank-and-file employees will suffer. Fairness to the \nemployee?\n  This situation is exactly what the Congressional Review Act was \nintended for. When an agency takes regulatory action that is not \nsupported by the people and their representatives, the Congressional \nReview Act gives Congress the chance to repeal that regulation.\n  In this case those advocating for the rule are doing so because they \ncannot pass the bill they really want, which is card check. Card check \nis where you have people go in and stand over employees' shoulders \nwhile they check a box that says they want to be in a union. Then, with \nenough signatures or enough boxes checked, there is no secret ballot \nelection. So many have referred to this as ``back-door card check''--\nthis particular NLRB regulation--and for good reason. Both proposals \nseek to restrict all communication with employees prior to a union \nelection for union organizers only. Under both scenarios, employees are \nlikely to hear only one side of the story, and employers can be cut out \nof the process altogether.\n  But the other side could not pass card check because once the \nAmerican public found out about what they were trying to do, they \nobjected. It took a little while because the card check legislation was \ndeceptively named ``The Employee Free Choice Act.'' In reality it would \nhave forced employees into the exact opposite of free choice. Any \nSenator who opposed this card check legislation should also be voting \nfor this resolution to stop ambush elections.\n  Another reason the Congressional Review Act was designed for just \nthis situation is there is simply no other way we would be allowed to \nhave a vote on this issue in this Senate. Back in December, the House \nof Representatives passed Chairman Kline's legislation that would have \neffectively killed the ambush election regulation and codified a 35-day \nwaiting period before an election. The Workforce Democracy and Fairness \nAct was passed with bipartisan support, but it has no chance of being \ncalled up for a vote in the Senate. So this vote is the one chance \nSenators will have to stand up for employees and small businesses that \nwant fairness.\n  By any measure, the current law and certification system provides \nthat fairness. The National Labor Relations Board keeps data on \nelections timing and sets up annual targets to process elections and \ndecide complaints swiftly. Last year, they exceeded two of those \ntargets and came within three-tenths of a percentage point of meeting \nthe third. There is simply no justification for this regulation.\n  Last year, initial elections and union representation elections were \nconducted in a median of 38 days after the filing of the petition. \nAlmost 92 percent of all initial elections were conducted within 56 \ndays of the filing of the petition. Not only are the vast majority of \nelections occurring in a timely fashion, but unions are winning more \nthan ever. Unions win more than 71 percent of elections--their highest \nwin rate on record. The current system does not disadvantage labor \nunions at all, but it does ensure employees--whose right it is to make \nthe decision of whether or not to form a union--have a full opportunity \nto hear from both sides about the ramifications of that decision.\n  This resolution will preserve the fairness and swift resolution of \nclaims which occur under current law. It will not disadvantage unions \nor roll back any rights. Let me repeat that: This resolution will not \ndisadvantage unions or roll back any rights. What it will do is prevent \nthe small business employers in America from being ambushed and \nemployees from being misled with insufficient information into union \ncontracts they cannot get out of.\n  Under a successful Congressional Review Act disapproval, the agency \nin question is prohibited from issuing any substantially similar \nregulation. That means the National Labor Relations Board could not \njust reissue this regulation and could not finalize many of the other \nbad ideas they initially proposed. I will be speaking about some of \nthose later on in this debate.\n  Let's not wait for the courts to strike down this rule, as they have \nthe NLRB's other regulatory effort--which would make two out of three \nin the last 75 years. With the President's appointment of the National \nLabor Relations Board members when we were not in a Senate recess \nperiod, the Senate did not confirm the people pushing this effort--\nthough, mostly, this was done by previous board members. But with the \nPresident's recess appointments in place, the National Labor Relations \nBoard is poised to push forward other bad ideas aimed at helping union \nbosses, not employees, and not job creators. It is time to stop this \nagency and level the odds.\n  I am pleased to have 44 fellow Senators cosponsoring this resolution. \nI will now yield time to other Members who would like to speak in favor \nof it, first allowing the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the \ncommittee, an opportunity to speak, probably, against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I also want to clear up one parliamentary \nquestion. The occupant of the chair stated we had 2 hours evenly \ndivided. I believe that is today. But on the agreement for the entire \ndebate on the Congressional Review Act, if I am not mistaken, it is 4 \nhours evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this Congressional Review Act challenge is the latest \nchapter in an unprecedented Republican assault on unions. The amount of \ntime this Congress has wasted scrutinizing and bullying the National \nLabor Relations Board over the last 2 years is simply astonishing. This \ntime the debate is about whether the NLRB acted appropriately when it \nstreamlined its procedures for setting up a union election and \neliminated unnecessary bureaucracy to make the agency more efficient.\n  This seems like a commonsense and logical step that if taken by any \nother agency my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would be \napplauding as a step forward for good government and efficiency. But \nbecause these reforms were put forward by the NLRB--an agency my \nRepublican colleagues seem to do anything to undermine--we are all \nstanding here today debating the merits of this eminently sensible \naction. It is a real shame.\n  At a time when we should be working together to rebuild our economy \nand addressing the real challenges facing working families across this \nNation, instead Republicans are distracting this body with partisan \nattacks on the National Labor Relations Board and on unions.\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\n  I would welcome the opportunity to spend this time on the Senate \nfloor debating how to make life better for middle-class families. I \nwould even welcome the opportunity to have a real debate about unions \nand the important role they play in our country. What I deeply regret \nis that we are instead going to spend time discussing the wild \nmisinformation that has been spread about National Labor Relations \nBoard rules that were properly undertaken, well within the agency's \nauthority and completely sensible. So let me take a moment to try to \nset the record straight.\n  In December, after receiving public input, the NLRB announced that \nsome internal agency procedures governing union elections would be \nchanged. These are modest changes that not only make the procedures \nmore rational and efficient but also ensure that workers and employers \nalike will have an opportunity to make their voices heard in an \nenvironment free of intimidation. These changes, while modest, are \ndesperately needed. They will address the rare but deeply troubling \nsituation where an unscrupulous employer uses delay and frivolous \nlitigation to try to keep workers from getting a fair election. Let me \nbriefly explain how the process works and how the new rules will help.\n  Ever since the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, \nworkers have had a Federally protected right to choose whether to form \na union, and our national policy, as stated in that act, has been to \nencourage collective bargaining. Workers who are interested in forming \na union can request an election if at least 30 percent of the workers \nin that workplace sign a petition and present that to the National \nLabor Relations Board. About 90 percent of the time, the employer and \nthe union reach an agreement covering when the election will be held, \nthe timing of it, and who is in the bargaining unit.\n  That is the ideal situation. That is what happens the majority of the \ntime. Although we would never know it from the rhetoric surrounding \nthese rules, the new procedures address only the roughly 10 percent of \nsituations where these preelection issues are in dispute and the rules \nsay nothing about 90 percent of the elections, where the two parties \nreach a voluntary agreement on election terms.\n  This chart shows us only a tiny fraction of election petitions will \nbe affected by these rules. As I said, 90 percent of the time the \nproposed union and the employers reach an agreement when the election \nis going to be held, how it is going to be held and other procedures. \nThey voluntarily agree on that. Only 10 percent of the time do we have \nemployers, some that are highly unscrupulous that will do anything to \nprevent their workers from having any kind of a voice in the running of \nthe facility, that go to extreme lengths to frustrate the will of those \nwho want to form a union. Again, the rules we are talking about don't \neven affect 90 percent of the businesses.\n  This 10 percent of the time when the parties can't reach an \nagreement, the NLRB then holds a hearing to decide who should be in the \nbargaining unit. The NLRB's proposed rules deal with the mechanics of \nthat hearing and they attempt to cut back on the frivolous litigation \nthat has plagued the hearing process. That is the proposed rule. They \ndeal with the mechanics of that and cut back on this frivolous \nlitigation. Under the old rules, management could litigate every single \nissue they could imagine at the preelection hearing. They could file \nposthearing briefs over any issue no matter how minor, and they could \nappeal any decision to the NLRB here in Washington. In many cases, the \nelection would be put on hold while the Board reviewed the case. The \nworkers then had to wait for the resolution of this litigation before \nthey could even vote.\n  When the management side took advantage of every opportunity for \ndelay, the average time before workers could vote was 198 days. Again, \nwe are talking about this 10 percent. When management took advantage of \nevery opportunity, the average time before workers could even vote was \n198 days. We have some cases where it has been as long as 13 years \nbefore employees were able to vote in a union election. While the \nelection process drags on, workers are often subjected to harassment, \nthreats, and, yes, firing.\n  A study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that, \namong workers who openly advocate for a union during an election \ncampaign, one in five is fired. We know what kind of signal that sends \nto the rest of the workers. A Cornell University study found that \nworkers were required to attend an average of ten anti-union meetings \nduring worktime before the election. By law, workers have the right to \norganize. As I said, our official policy, as stated in the National \nLabor Relations Act, is to encourage collective bargaining, but in \npractice we allow delay and intimidation to make that right \nmeaningless.\n  The current NLRB election reforms do not solve this problem entirely, \nbut nevertheless they are an important step forward. They help clear \nthe bureaucratic redtape that has wasted government resources and \ndenied workers the right to a free choice. Under the new rules, \nemployers and unions can still raise their concerns about the petition \nat a preelection hearing, but they can't play games to stall the \nelection. For example, under the new rules, employers can't waste time \nbefore the election arguing over whether an individual worker is \neligible to vote. That worker then can vote a provisional ballot, and \nthe two sides can debate the issue after the election if it matters to \nthe outcome. What we have had in the past is, let's say we had a \nproposed bargaining unit that was 200 people. Let's say they got 100 of \nthem to sign a petition. They usually try to get about 50 percent. They \npresent it to the NLRB. Management then says: Person A shouldn't be in \nthat bargaining unit because they are a supervisor, and person B over \nhere shouldn't be in here because that person is a clerk and not a \nhandler--or whatever it might be that wouldn't correspond to the \nbargaining unit.\n  Let's say they raise that issue on five people. Under the present \nsituation, they could then take this to the NLRB, have hearings on each \none of those. If they didn't like the outcome, they could then take it \nto Washington, DC and drag it out.\n  Under the new rules, what they would say is: OK. If management is \nchallenging those five people, we will set their ballots aside, and we \nwill have an election. If the election was 150 to 20 that they form a \nunion, then those 5 wouldn't make any difference one way or the other. \nBut if the election were close and those five would, then the NLRB \nwould step in and say: Wait a minute. The certification would be put on \nhold until they decided whether those people were rightfully in the \nbargaining unit to vote. Again, these are some of the games that have \nbeen going on.\n  Another example is appeals. All parties still have the right to \nappeal any decision they disagree with. But now, all appeals would be \nconsolidated after the election, which allows the Board to conserve its \nresources and keep the election process moving forward.\n  These commonsense changes remove unnecessary delays from the process, \nthey cut down on frivolous legal challenges, and give workers the right \nto a fair up-or-down vote in a reasonable period of time. The new rules \ndon't encourage unionization and they don't discourage it. They just \ngive workers the ability to say yes or no, without having to wait \nseveral months or even years to do so.\n  There is rampant misinformation about this rule. To be clear, the \nrule does not allow a so-called ambush election, where an employer is \ntaken by surprise and has no ability or opportunity to communicate with \nworkers about the pros and cons of a union. As anyone who has ever been \naround a workplace that is part of an organizing drive would know, \nemployers always know what is going on, and they have ample opportunity \nto express their views. They can require their workers to listen to an \nanti-union message all day long every day, and that is perfectly legal, \nwhile the union isn't even allowed into the facility to talk to other \nworkers.\n  This rule also does not change the content of what an employer can or \ncannot say to its workers. It doesn't restrict an employer's free \nspeech rights in any way.\n  Finally--I wish to make this clear--the rule does not mandate that \nelections be held within any particular\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\ntimeframe. For anyone who has actually read the new rules, it is clear \nit does nothing of the sort.\n  What these rules do accomplish is to help ensure that employers and \nemployees have a level playing field, where corporate executives and \nrank-and-file workers alike have an equal chance to make their case for \nor against a union. Some workplaces will choose a union, some will not. \nBut protecting the right of workers to make that choice brings some \nbalance and fairness to the system. Indeed, many employers have \nrecognized that the new rules are fair and balanced. Catholic Health \nCare West, a health care company with 31,000 employees, filed comments \nstating:\n\n       Reforms proposed by the NLRB are not pro-union or pro-\n     business. They are pro-modernization.\n\n  Further, Catholic Health Care West said they will:\n\n       Modernize the representation election process by improving \n     the Board's current representation election procedures that \n     result in unnecessary delays, allow unnecessary litigation, \n     and fail to take advantage of modern communication \n     technologies.\n\n  Mr. Willie West, founder and owner of West Sheet Metal Company in \nSterling, VA, wrote an article in the Hill newspaper stating that:\n\n     [t]hese seemingly minor changes certainly do not create \n     uncertainty for me and they will not affect my ability to \n     create jobs. In fact, if the NLRB standardizes the election \n     process, it seems to me this will reduce uncertainty and \n     turmoil in the workplace--especially for small businesses.\n\n  Mr. West is exactly right. The rules are an improvement for small \nbusinesses and for those who want a cooperative relationship with their \nemployees. Again, keep in mind, 90 percent of the time they have no \nproblems. We are only talking about this 10 percent of the time. That \nis what these rules are aimed at.\n  The new rules promote consistency among NLRB field offices. They \nsimplify procedures for all parties, making it easier for businesses to \nplan. The old rules gave an advantage to the businesses with the most \nmoney and those most willing to manipulate the system to frustrate \ntheir employees' right to vote. Some of these businesses in that 10 \npercent could afford expensive lawyers to exploit the system and delay \nelections. The old rules worked well for anti-union law firms--I will \ngrant you that--but not for small businesses on a budget.\n  By creating a fair, more transparent process, the NLRB is leveling \nthe playing field for small businesses.\n  Most important, the rules also take a small step to level the playing \nfield for ordinary Americans. The people who do the work in this \ncountry deserve a voice in the decisions that affect their families and \ntheir futures. Polls show that 53 percent of workers want \nrepresentation in the workplace, but fewer than 7 percent of private \nsector workers are represented and one of the reasons is the broken \nNLRB election system. Even though more workers than ever are expressing \nan interest in having a voice on the job, the number of union \nrepresentation elections conducted by the NLRB declined by an \nastounding 60 percent between 1997 and 2009.\n  When workers do file for NLRB elections, 35 percent give up in the \nface of extreme employer intimidation and withdraw from the election \nbefore a vote is even held. Let me repeat that. Workers have gone \naround, they have gotten signatures, they have gotten the requisite 30 \npercent. They usually get a lot more than that, 40 to 50 percent. They \nfile with the NLRB. One out of every three of those give up in the face \nof extreme employer intimidation. Why? Because one out of every five is \nbeing fired because there is no real penalty against the employer for \nfiring someone for union organizing. It is against the law to fire an \nemployee because they were exercising their right to form a union, to \nbe in union organizing. But it happens all the time. Why do employers \nnot worry about it? Because there are no penalties. The penalty is \nbackpay minus any offsets.\n  I had a young man in Iowa I remember very well up in Mason City. He \nhad been involved in organizing a union at his workplace. He got fired. \nHe filed with the NLRB saying he was wrongly dismissed because of his \nunion-organizing activities.\n  They had a hearing. It dragged on for 3 years before the NLRB could \nreach a decision, and the decision was, yes, he was fired because of \nhis union-organizing activities.\n  What was the penalty on the employer? They had to pay him 3 years' \nbackpay minus whatever he earned in the meantime as a worker.\n  How many people can go through years without working? Of course, he \nhad to work. He had to go to work, and he had to show how much money he \nmade in the meantime that had to be deducted from what his employer had \nto pay him. Therefore, they had to pay practically nothing. Yet using \nthat as an example, they were able to frustrate the organizing of a \nunion. One-third give up in the face of extreme employer intimidation. \nThese are the problems that need to be addressed.\n  It is not just a problem for unions either, but for our entire middle \nclass and for the future of our economy. If we take a look at what is \nhappening to the middle class in America, it is being decimated. The \nAmerican people are insisting--even though we are not doing much of it \nin Washington, I can assure you the American people are insisting that \nwe have a national dialog about the growing division between the haves \nand have-nots in this country, about the detrimental impact this is \nhaving on the standard of living of American middle-class families. \nThis has led to important discussions about tax loopholes for \ncorporations and millionaires. But as we learned from battles from \nWisconsin to Ohio and beyond, it is very much a conversation about \nworkers' rights.\n  Unions have always been the backbone of the American middle class \nsince we started having a middle class. Since 1973, private sector \nunionization rates have declined from 34 percent of the labor force to \n7 percent; from 1 out of every 3 workers in America belonging to a \nunion to now only 7 percent, 1 in about 15. While unionization rates \ndeclined, so did the middle-class share of national income.\n  During some hearings we had last year--we had a number of hearings in \nour committee about this. When we track union membership--this, the \nblue line, from 1973 to today--and track the percent of workers covered \nby collective bargaining agreements, and then track the middle-class \nshare of national income, look how they all go down the same. As \nunionization declined the number of workers in collective bargaining \ndeclined, and so did their share of the national income. That is what \nhas happened to the middle class in America. Simply, the fate of \nAmerica's unions parallels the fate of America's middle class.\n  Unions are not a relic of a bygone era, they are a vital element of a \nfair and successful 21st-century economy. If we want to strengthen our \neconomy and rebuild the middle class, we should try to figure out how \nto make unions stronger, how to get more people in collective \nbargaining, not attack collective bargaining rights across the country. \nWe should be fighting to ensure that every hard-working American has a \nright to be treated with dignity and respect on the job--and, yes, to \nhave a voice on that job. The current NLRB election reforms may fall \nshort of that lofty goal, but, as I said, they are an important step \nforward, and they deserve support.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this Congressional Review Act \nchallenge to NLRB's rules. Now that these rules are to go into effect--\nand I am confident they will go into effect--it is time for this body \nto stop wasting time, using the NLRB as an election year political \nfootball.\n  I think these attacks on this modest rule go right after the \nintelligence of working Americans. These attacks urge this body to help \nprevent unions from being organized. But ordinary Americans and the \nmiddle class want us to stop this political posturing and move forward \non building economic opportunity for the middle class--and, yes, to \nsupport the right of people who want to form a union, to get rid of all \nthese delays, and to make sure we have rules in place which basically \nreflect 90 percent of the employers in this country.\n  Ninety percent of the employers reach agreements with their employees \non having an election. It is that 10 percent that gets to be \nfrustrating. This is the purpose of this rule, to make everybody sort \nof falls in the 90 percent, so\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\nwe have a fair and expeditious election process, one that is \nunderstandable, one that does not lead to all this frivolous litigation \nand delay.\n  We have another couple or 3 hours of debate on this matter. After \nthis is over, I hope we can start focusing on ways to genuinely help \nthe middle class in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, most of the small businesspeople I know \nconsider themselves to be part of the middle class. I appreciate the \nstatistics the chairman provided about 90 percent of the elections \narriving at agreement prior to the election. What this rule is going to \ndo is change it so that only 10 percent make agreements beforehand \nbecause there is no incentive for the union to participate at all. They \nhave the right to just take it over.\n  There are some statistics about unions and the middle class, and kind \nof a myth, that the current election procedures discourage unionization \nand are the main cause of private sector union decline. In the 1950s \nprivate sector union membership reached its height of 35 percent of the \nunionized workforce. Today it is less than 7 percent of the private \nsector workforce that is unionized, and the decline of unionization in \nthe private sector can be attributed to several social, political, and \neconomic factors, including present-day workplace laws at both the \nState and Federal level that have greatly improved working conditions; \na decline in the manufacturing base; the new nature of employment, \nwhere people are more transient in their careers; and the desire for \ncontemporary employees to have a more cooperative relationship with \ntheir employers, and vice versa. It is kind of a teamwork factor that \nmost businesses operate on today.\n  I think it was also said that employers have unfair access to \nemployees and regularly bombard employees with anti-union propaganda. I \nthink it was said it could happen 24 hours a day. The fact is \nemployers' speech regarding unionization is closely monitored and \nregulated. For example, employers are restricted from visiting \nemployees at their homes, inviting employees into certain areas of the \nworkforce to discuss unionization, and making promises or statements \nthat could be construed as threatening, intimidating, or coercive. That \nis the current law. Employers are required to provide unions with a \nlist of employee names and home addresses for representation election \npurposes.\n\n  I think it was also said changes are needed because current \nprocedures discourage employees from forming unions. The fact is all \nemployees have the guaranteed right to discuss their support of \nunionization and to persuade coworkers to do likewise at work. The only \nrestriction is that they not neglect their own work or interfere with \nthe work of others when doing so. Employees as well as unions have the \nunlimited right to campaign in favor of unionization away from the \nworkplace.\n  The National Labor Relations Board election rule will postpone these \nlegitimate questions after the representation election is held and \ncould result in more post-election litigation. So there are a lot of \nfactors that were mentioned. I am not going to go into all of them.\n  As I have stated throughout the debate, the National Labor Relations \nBoard's ambush election rule is an attempt to stack the odds against \nAmerican employers, particularly small businesses that do not have a \nspecialist in that area or in-house counsel. Most small businesses \ntoday cannot afford either of those. They can be put into this \nsituation of having to figure it all out in less than 10 days. That is \njust to figure out the rules so they do not get some heavy fines from \nthe National Labor Relations Board.\n  Coupled with two other changes the administration is forcing, some \nemployers will be caught in a perfect storm. Taken together, ambush \nelections, the National Labor Relations Board's micro-union decision, \nand the Department of Labor's proposed rule on persuader activity \ncreate a major shift in favor of organized labor.\n  The Supreme Court has expressly stated that an employer's free speech \nrights to communicate his views to his employees is firmly established \nand cannot be infringed by a union or the board under the National \nLabor Relations Act. Yet the overarching goal of the National Labor \nRelations Board and the Labor Department's efforts is to put up \nbarriers that can have the effect of limiting employer free speech.\n  Under the specialty health care decision permitting micro-unions, \nunions can now gerrymander a bargaining unit so it is made up of a \nmajority of employees who support the union. In this decision, the \nstandard for whether a union's petition for a bargaining unit is \nappropriate was changed to make it very difficult for employers to \nprove it is not appropriate. The decision will lead to smaller units \nwhich will be easier to organize and cause fragmentation and discord in \nthe workplace. Allowing micro-unions will increase the number of \nbargaining units in the workplace. The result means an employer could \nface multiple simultaneous organizing campaigns, all with shortened \nelection periods, thanks to this ambush rule. Those two combined can be \npretty dangerous.\n  Under the Department of Labor's proposed regulation to require \nincreased reporting of persuader activity, an employer, especially a \nsmall employer, will rethink obtaining advice from lawyers or \nconsultants on what to do when faced with a union organizing campaign. \nTaking away the ability to consult outside parties, combined with a \nshortened election period, makes it nearly impossible for an employer \nto not only educate his employees, but also to ensure his actions are \nwithin the law.\n  For over 50 years the Department of Labor has been exempted from \nreporting requirements advice provided to employers. The proposed rule \nwill significantly affect that definition. The complexities of the \nNational Labor Relations Act almost require an employer to seek advice \non what he is permitted to do or say to employees during a union \nelection, especially if the election period is as short as 10 days.\n  The proposed rule on persuader activity will chill employer speech to \nthe point that employers will not seek, and attorneys will not provide, \nadvice on any labor-related issue. So unions have turned to these \nregulatory initiatives after losing the public and political battle \nover the Employee Free Choice Act, otherwise known as card check. \nOrganized labor's end game remains the same, making it easier to \norganize by taking away the employer's free speech right and the \nemployee's right to fair information.\n  Supporters of organized labor have acknowledged the winning strategy \nis to gain voluntary recognition of the union from employers instead of \nallowing employees to vote in a secret ballot election, despite a 71-\npercent win rate. Ambush elections, increased reporting on persuader \nactivity, and the decision to allow micro-unions will set the bar for \nan employer winning elections impossibly high, essentially coercing \nthem into voluntarily recognizing the union.\n  I do thank the Senator for mentioning that in 90 percent of the \nelections there is an agreement before the election done in a \nrelatively short period of time that takes care of all the disputes. I \ndon't know if the purpose of Congress is to make sure 100 percent of \nsituations never occur or 90 percent or 99 percent, but everything \ncannot be solved by doing a new rush to action regulation, particularly \nby an organization that doesn't do those regulations normally.\n  In 75 years there have only been three regulations. Two of them were \ndone by the Labor Relations Board in the last year, and one of those \nhas already been set aside by the courts. So this is a rush-to-action \nsituation, and I hope my colleagues will join me in this resolution of \ndisapproval of the Congressional Review Act.\n  It is a very difficult bar to reach because the Senate will have to \npass the resolution of disapproval twice with a majority of votes. That \ngives the other side the opportunity to see who might support it the \nfirst time and see if they can talk them out of it the second time. But \nafter that, it has to go through the House, and then this is the \nsurprising part to me--if it passes both bodies where both bodies have \nsaid they do not think the agency correctly interpreted what we put in \nlaw, meaning Congress, who are the only ones with the right to pass a \nlaw--what we\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\nput into law, they are trying to change, and that third step is that it \nrequires the signature of the President in order for the Congressional \nReview Act to become effective. We are an equal branch of government to \nthe administration. The administration writes the rule. We disapprove \nof the rule because we say it doesn't follow the laws we have already \npassed, and then the administration which wrote the law gets to say \nwhether the votes of the people in the House and in the Senate had any \neffect at all.\n\n  The Congressional Review Act has a definite place, but it should have \nbeen done using the authority of Congress itself, not the authority of \nthe Congress and the administration combined. We are at a point where \nthere is a heavy hand in the administration, and that will have a \ndrastic effect on business in this country. And if business fails, \nthere will be less employees, not more.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do have I remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 36 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are going to have a lot of time to \nflush out some of these arguments again tomorrow when the vote gets \nnear, but I thought I might pick up on a couple of things here that my \ngood friend from Wyoming said. We do a lot of work together, and he is \na great Senator and a good friend of mine. He just happens to be wrong \non this issue, but other than that, he is a good friend of mine. This \nis a good, healthy debate on policy.\n  There is a lot of talk about these ambush elections. Now we are going \nto have ambush elections. Well, that is not so. The current median time \nfrom when a petition is filed and when the election occurs is about 37 \nto 38 days. Again, I heard from my friend saying this could be ambush \nelections, and all that kind of stuff. Even one of the Nation's largest \nmanagement-side law firm disagrees. One of the attorneys from Jackson \nLewis told the Wall Street Journal that he thinks the time would be \nshaved between 19 and 23 days under the proposal.\n  Mr. Trauger, vice president of the National Association of \nManufacturers, said the elections would be held in 20 to 25 days under \nthe new rule. So that is not an ambush election at all. All this rule \ndoes is remove these extra legal hurdles that can cause excessive \ndelays.\n  We keep hearing about rulemaking, and saying: Well, this board has \nonly issued three of these rules in the past 75 years, two of these \nrules in the last couple of years. It makes it sound as though the NLRB \nhas ridden off the range here in terms of reasonableness. But the fact \nis that when the board promulgated rules in the past, they did it \nthrough the adjudicative process, not through rulemaking.\n  The Supreme Court and the U.S. Courts of Appeal have criticized the \nboard in the past for underutilizing its rulemaking authority. Courts \nhave said the rulemaking process is more transparent and more \ninclusive. So through rulemaking this board has solicited broader \npublic input in its decisions.\n  What the NLRB has done in the last couple of years is opened up the \nprocess for comment periods and rulemaking through the Administrative \nProcedures Act, something the courts have been asking and advising the \nNLRB that they should have been doing all along rather than relying on \nthe adjudicative process.\n  So, yes, my friend may be right about two of the three last couple of \nyears, but actually that is a move in the right direction. That is a \nmove for transparency and openness and letting all different sides have \ntheir comments before they issue a final rule rather than doing it \nthrough adjudication.\n  There was this quote about John Kennedy about a 30-day waiting \nperiod. Well, I don't know, I have not looked at then-Senator Kennedy's \nentire record. I suppose there are some things I might agree with him \non and some things I probably would not agree with him on. I don't know \nwhat his thought processes were. All I can tell you is that no matter \nwhat he said at that time as a Senator, the final bill did not have a \nwaiting period. The Senate put it in, the House did not, and when it \nwent to conference, they dropped it. So I think the rejection of that \nproposed amendment could be more reasonably understood as an indication \nthat Congress did not believe a minimum time between petition and \nelection is necessary.\n  Sure, you can quote Kennedy, and I guess I can quote President Dwight \nD. Eisenhower, and here is what he said:\n\n       Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of \n     the right to join a union of their choice.\n\n  Well, we better not try to prevent them from joining a union of their \nchoice.\n  I have also heard this charge that somehow these rules tilt this more \nin favor of the unions than management. No, they don't. Again, we have \nmostly been talking here about the certification process. When union \norganizers get the signatures, they file with NLRB and we have an NLRB \nprocess. Basically that is what we are talking about here. But I would \npoint out to my friend on the other side of the aisle that these \nprocedures we are talking about also apply to decertification elections \nas well. So since the same rules will apply to decertification \nelections, the proposed rule will ensure that employees who have union \nrepresentation will be able to have a timely up-or-down vote to also \nget rid of the union. So, to me, it is both. It is both on the \ncertification and the decertification side. It makes for things to be \nmuch more expeditious, much clearer, and more understandable. That is \nwhy I think many management firms and businesses see this as a \nreasonable rule because when they would try to decertify, they don't \nhave to go through all of this frivolous litigation on the other side. \nIt applies to both certification and decertification, so it doesn't \ntilt the playing field one way or the other.\n  Again, I applaud the National Labor Relations Board for moving in the \ndirection of more rulemaking, making it more open, making it more \ntransparent than what they have done in the past. But you know what it \nboils down to? As long as I have been here, since 1985 in this body, we \nhave had ups and downs on the National Labor Relations Board. Let's \nface it, what happens is the National Labor Relations Board has three \nmembers from the President's political party and two from the other \nside. So when you have a Democratic President in, then NLRB gets \nattacked by Republicans. When a Republican President is in, it gets \nattacked by Democrats, and it becomes kind of a political football. I \nunderstand that, and we should all understand that is what this is too. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  I was just notified that a Statement of Administration Policy, SAP, \nfrom the administration just came through. It said even if this vote \nwere held and the other side won--if it was voted to overrule the \nNLRB--the President would veto it. And, surely, no one thinks there is \na two-thirds vote here to override the President's veto on this issue. \nWe are kind of wasting our time here. It is sort of another political \nshot when there are so many important things we should be talking about \nin terms of jobs, job creation, the economy, fair taxation, keeping our \njobs from going overseas, education, job retraining, and yet we are \nspending our time talking about this. Well, be that as it may, the \nfacts are on the side that this rule is eminently reasonable, fair, and \nI think will lead to a more predictable and less litigious and less \nconflicting process when people want to form a union in this country.\n  As I said, 90 percent of the time we don't have these problems. But \nfor those 10 percent, it can be devastating, and it can thwart \nindividual workers who want to form a union. So I am hopeful we can \nhave a little bit more debate on this. I hope the vote tomorrow will be \nconclusive and that we will turn this down and move ahead with more \nimportant business confronting this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we are having an interesting duel of \nstatistics here, because to take care of the 10 percent that the \nSenator from Iowa says has a problem, we will turn the other 90 percent \non their head. It also doesn't surprise me that the President has put \nout a Statement of Administration Policy, a SAP. I always thought those \nwere pretty aptly named, but not surprised my resolution would be \nopposed.\n  As I explained, this is a regulation written by the administration so \nI\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\nwould expect the administration would not like and would veto it. There \nhas been only been one Congressional review action that has succeeded \nand that was regarding the rule on ergonomics. And what happened was \nthe Department of Labor rushed through a 50-day regulation, and then we \nhad a change of Presidents and the new President didn't like it, so he \nwas willing to sign the Congressional Review Act resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  This is not a waste of time. This is an important action. It is to \nwarn agencies and boards that the ones that make the laws are Congress, \nand we delegate that rulemaking authority, and it was delegated to the \nadministration of the National Labor Relations Board, and they are \nabusing their authority.\n  What has changed? Well, there is the pre-election hearing. In the new \nrule it says: ``A pre-election hearing is solely to determine whether a \nquestion of representation exists.'' The important question, such as \nwhich employee should be included in the bargaining unit or the \neligibility of an employee, won't be heard prior to an election.\n\n       A hearing officer may unilaterally bar testimony or \n     evidence he or she deems not relevant to a question raised at \n     a pre-election hearing--under this new regulation.\n\n  The effect?\n\n       A hearing officer will have wide latitude to prohibit \n     certain evidence introduced at a pre-election hearing, even \n     if such evidence is undisputed or stipulated, essentially \n     leading to the conclusion that an election is proper.\n\n  Under the new rule:\n\n       Parties are prohibited from seeking a review of a regional \n     director's decision and direction of an election by the \n     Board. All issues to review would be heard after an election. \n     Parties could seek a pre-election appeal if the issue would \n     otherwise escape Board review.\n\n  The effect?\n\n       Parties with a legitimate legal bar to an election will be \n     forced to run an unnecessary election. An unintended \n     consequence is that an employer would have to commit an \n     unfair labor practice in order to have their issues reviewed \n     by the full Board.\n\n  If you ask me, that is a pretty high bar they are putting in there. \nThe new rule says:\n\n       The 25-day waiting period between the direction of the \n     election and election date is eliminated.\n\n  The impact?\n\n       The 25 days allowed parties to digest and understand the \n     parameters of the regional director's decision to direct an \n     election, and for the Board to rule on the parties' requests \n     for the review of the decision.\n       Although not included in the Final Rule, the Board \n     originally proposed that a pre-election hearing will occur 7 \n     days after the filing of a petition absent special \n     circumstances.\n\n  The effect? It forces employers to scramble to retain counsel. Again, \nwe are talking about small businessmen here. There is no limit on how \nsmall of a business you can organize in this. It forces employers to \nscramble to retain counsel, develop a strategy, prepare for a hearing, \nand develop evidence. Many employers, especially small ones, will be \nunable to provide a reasonable response so quickly, leading them to \nagree to a stipulated election. There is not anything in this provision \nthat gives any protection for the person in the middle class running a \nsmall business and trying to keep his business afloat. There used to be \nsome protections, but this new regulation--and, again, agencies do \nwrite a lot of rules, but they don't write ones of this significance--\nis only the third time it has been done by the National Labor Relations \nBoard. It was done in a hurry-up situation. Two out of the three were \ndone by this administration. One of those has already been set aside by \nthe courts. That is not a very good record. Now we are trying to do \nthis one on a hurry-up basis. I think there ought to be more \nconsideration for it.\n\n  Part of the role of Congress is to take a look at what the \nadministration is doing with their regulations, which we ultimately \ngive them the authority to do, to see if they are being done properly. \nSo this is just a major part of the need for oversight. Thankfully, \nthere is a process whereby we can get the right to debate this \noversight. That is what we are doing at this point.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Barrasso for such time as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise in support of my colleague from \nWyoming and the excellent work he is doing and continues to do, as well \nas the leadership he continues to provide for all the Senate and \ncertainly for the people of Wyoming. He is the captain of our team. I \nagree with him and wish to associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from Wyoming and express my concerns about the new ambush \nelection rule issued by the National Labor Relations Board.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is the Federal agency charged with \nconducting labor elections and investigating unfair labor practice \ncharges. The appointed members of this board are meant to help \nfacilitate a level playing field in the private sector workplace. \nUnfortunately, recent actions have demonstrated that the board is much \nmore interested, in my opinion, in pursuing regulatory changes that \nfavor unions. They should be focused on ensuring that workers are able \nto make informed decisions about their place of employment, not on \nshowing favoritism.\n  Let's take a look at the ambush election rule. On December 22 of last \nyear, the National Labor Relations Board issued a new rule. The new \nrule greatly shortens the time period between the filing of a petition \nfor union representation and when that election is held. Under the \ncurrent rules, most union elections take place within about 38 days. \nUnder the new rules, the time could be cut almost in half. The ambush \nelection rule also narrows the scope of preelection hearings while \nlimiting the rights of a party to preelection appeals.\n  I believe this misguided rule undermines the basic fairness in the \nrepresentation election process. It limits the amount of information \nreceived by employees regarding the impact of unionization on their \nworkplace. The rule also significantly restricts the ability of \nemployers to educate their employees and to share their perspective.\n  I believe this causes harm to workers. The decision on whether to \njoin or form a union is a very important decision for workers. \nEmployment decisions directly affect an individual's ability to support \ntheir family, to pay their bills, and to sustain their livelihood. \nWorkers deserve to have all the information needed to make a well-\ninformed decision.\n  In order to seriously consider their options, employees must have the \nopportunity to hear from both sides on the implications of \nunionization. The ambush election rule, in my opinion, attempts to \nquickly rush employees through the union election process, without \ngiving those employees the full picture and a clear understanding of \nthe issues.\n  I have great concerns about what I believe is a disregarding of \nemployer input. The ambush election rule disregards the rights of small \nbusinesses and employers across this country. The new rule is \nattempting to silence employers from discussing vital information with \ntheir employees about unionization and the impact on their lives and on \ntheir jobs. Under the new rule, employers would have a very limited \namount of time to share their views, to provide counterarguments, and \nto explain what unionization would mean in the workplace. Employers \nshould be allowed time to fully explain the information to their \nemployees. Ultimately, I believe the purpose of the recently released \nrule is to leave employers unable to effectively communicate with \nworkers about important workplace issues. The Board is infringing upon \nthe free speech rights of the employers.\n  I believe this new rule prevents employers from getting counsel. In \nthis tough economic environment, small business owners are facing an \nincredible amount of pressure and responsibility. Job creators are \nworking hard to ensure their products and services are competitive. \nThey are working to find available markets for their goods and \nservices. They are trying to deal with the financial health of their \nbusinesses.\n  Many small business owners are unaware of the complicated Federal \nlaws they must adhere to during the union election process. Due to the \nvariety of competing priorities and limited resources, small businesses \nall across this country often don't employ inhouse legal counsel or \nhuman resource professionals familiar with unionization laws. Under the \nnew rule,\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\nhowever, the time constraints will make it even more difficult for them \nto find appropriate counsel, to consult on the issues, and to prepare \nfor the election process. Employers will be scrambling to find a labor \nattorney or a human resource professional to help explain their rights \nand to ensure that their actions are permissible under current law. As \na result, many employers will be left at risk for unintentionally \nviolating certain Federal labor laws or silenced.\n  The National Labor Relations Board should not be forcing employers to \npreemptively analyze Federal labor laws and figure out how best to \ncommunicate their views of unionization in case a union petition \nhappens to pop up. Job creators should be focusing their scarce time \nand resources on managing and growing their businesses, on trying to \nput Americans back to work at a time of over 8 percent unemployment.\n  I view this whole new rule as unnecessary. There is no reason for the \nnew rule. The median timeframe for union elections has been 38 days \nfrom the filing of the petition. About 91 percent of all the elections \nheld in 2011 occurred within 56 days. These numbers indicate the \npetitions and elections are handled, and have been handled, in a timely \nmanner. Furthermore, the current election procedures are not impeding \nthe ability of unions to win the representation elections. According to \nthe National Labor Relations Board's own statistics, unions won about \n71 percent of elections held in 2011.\n  When I take a look at what is happening with the National Labor \nRelations Board, what comes to mind are the recent recess appointments \nmade by the President. This new rule we are facing and discussing is \nnot the first time the Obama administration has attempted to use the \nNLRB to pursue the union's agenda. The administration continues to take \nactions and push through policies that are unwise and even, in my \nopinion, unconstitutional, in order to do the bidding of unions.\n  In an action that was both unprecedented and unconstitutional, \nPresident Obama recess appointed three new members to the National \nLabor Relations Board during a pro forma session of this Senate. \nPresident Obama appointed three individuals. The nominations of two of \nthem, Sharon Block and Richard Griffin, were sent to the Senate only a \nfew days before the pro forma session began. As a result, the Senate \nhad no opportunity--none at all--to hold hearings or debate the \nnominees. President Obama completely disregarded the constitutional \nrequirement of advice and consent for executive nominees. The \nappointments were a heavy-handed effort by this administration to curry \nfavor, in my opinion, with the unions.\n\n  I come to the floor as someone who has talked at great length about \nthe impact of regulations and how they make it harder and more \nexpensive for our small businesses to hire people around the country. \nBusinesses are already having trouble keeping track of all the changing \nrules and trying to abide by all the new requirements they face on \nalmost a daily basis. The only certainty being offered to the job \ncreators in the United States is that the Obama administration is going \nto continue to change the rules of the game on businesses to meet its \nown agenda. The ambush election rule is the exact type of regulatory \nchange that makes employers nervous and reluctant to expand their \nbusinesses, to create new jobs, to hire and put people back to work. \nThis Federal Government should be focused on giving employers \nstability, predictability, and opportunities for growth instead of \nstacking the deck, as we see it, in favor of labor unions.\n  I come to the floor, as I know my colleagues will as well, in a call \nto action to employ the Congressional Review Act. Under the \nCongressional Review Act, Congress is able to overturn the ambush \nelection rule by passing a resolution of disapproval. I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor of S.J. Res. 36, introduced by Senator Enzi. The \nresolution of disapproval rescinds the new union election rule issued \nby the National Labor Relations Board. Unless Congress takes action, \nthe new rule is scheduled to take effect on April 30 of this year--just \nthe end of this month. I call upon the Senate to pass S.J. Res. 36 and \nprevent this dangerous rule from silencing employers and hindering the \nability of American workers to make informed decisions.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have several \nletters of support printed in the Record, along with a list of 18 \norganizations that support the resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Congressional Review Act (S.J.

Res. 36, a \n     resolution of disapproval that would repeal recent revisions \n     the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) made to \n     regulations governing union representation elections.\n       These regulations replace a process that, in the vast \n     majority of cases, worked fairly and efficiently. In fiscal \n     year 2010, the average time for union representation \n     elections was just 38 days, with more than 95 percent of all \n     elections occurring within 56 days. However, rather than look \n     at targeted solutions for the small percentage of cases that \n     take too long, the Board made sweeping changes that will \n     apply to all elections.\n       While the substantive regulations adopted by the NLRB are \n     detailed and complex, the end result is that election time \n     will likely decrease significantly at the expense of \n     important due process and free speech rights. The simple fact \n     is that employees deserve a fair campaign period to hear from \n     all sides and employers deserve an opportunity to have \n     critical election-related questions settled before an \n     election occurs. Organized labor has long sought to radically \n     reduce or\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\n     even eliminate this campaign period, which was precisely the \n     goal of the ``card check'' provisions of the deceptively \n     named ``Employee Free Choice Act'' (EFCA). Congress was right \n     to reject EFCA and it should likewise reject the NLRB's new \n     election regulations.\n       Due to the critical importance of this issue to the \n     business community, the Chamber strongly urges you to support \n     and co-sponsor S.J. Res. 36.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 16, 2012.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of millions of job creators \n     concerned with mounting threats to the basic tenets of free \n     enterprise, the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace urges \n     you to support S. J. Res. 36, which provides for \n     congressional disapproval and nullification of the National \n     Labor Relations Board's (NLRB or Board) rule related to \n     representation election procedures. This ``ambush'' election \n     rule is nothing more than the Board's attempt to placate \n     organized labor by effectively denying employees' access to \n     critical information about unions and stripping employers of \n     free speech and due process rights. The rule poses a threat \n     to both employees and employers. Please vote in favor of S. \n     J. Res. 36 when it comes to the Senate floor next week.\n       The Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, a group of more \n     than 600 organizations, has been united in its opposition to \n     the so-called ``Employee Free Choice Act'' (EFCA) and EFCA \n     alternatives that pose a similar threat to workers, \n     businesses and the U.S. economy. Thanks to the bipartisan \n     group of elected officials who stood firm against this \n     damaging legislation, the threat of EFCA is less immediate \n     this Congress. Politically powerful labor unions, other EFCA \n     supporters and their allies in government are not backing \n     down, however. Having failed to achieve their goals through \n     legislation, they are now coordinating with the Board and the \n     Department of Labor (DOL) in what appears to be an all-out \n     attack on job-creators and employees in an effort to enact \n     EFCA through administrative rulings and regulations.\n       On June 21, 2011, the Board proposed its ambush election \n     rule, which was designed to significantly speed up the \n     existing union election process and limit employer \n     participation in elections. At the time, Board Member Hayes \n     warned that ``the proposed rules will (1) shorten the time \n     between filing of the petition and the election date, and (2) \n     substantially limit the opportunity for full evidentiary \n     hearing or Board review on contested issues involving, among \n     other things, appropriate unit, voter eligibility, and \n     election misconduct.'' Hayes noted the effect would be to \n     ``stifle debate on matters that demand it.'' The Board \n     published a final rule on December 22, 2011, with an April \n     30, 2012 effective date. While it somewhat modified the \n     original proposal, the final rule is identical in purpose and \n     similar in effect.\n       The NLRB's own statistics reveal the average time from \n     petition to election was 31 days, with over 90% of elections \n     occurring within 56 days. There is no indication that \n     Congress intended a shorter election time frame, and indeed, \n     based on the legislative history of the 1959 amendments to \n     the National Labor Relations Act, it is clear Congress \n     believed that an election period of at least 30 days was \n     necessary to adequately assure employees the ``fullest \n     freedom'' in exercising their right to choose whether they \n     wish to be represented by a union. As then Senator John F. \n     Kennedy Jr. explained, a 30 day period before any election \n     was a necessary ``safeguard against rushing employees into an \n     election where they are unfamiliar with the issues.'' Senator \n     Kennedy stated ``there should be at least a 30-day interval \n     between the request for an election and the holding of the \n     election'' and he opposed an amendment that failed to provide \n     ``at least 30 days in which both parties can present their \n     viewpoints.''\n       The current election time frames are not only reasonable, \n     but permit employees time to hear from both the union and the \n     employer and make an informed decision, which would not be \n     possible under the ambush election rule. In fact, in other \n     situations involving ``group'' employee issues, Congress \n     requires that employees be given at least 45 days to review \n     relevant information in order to make a ``knowing and \n     voluntary'' decision (this is required under the Older \n     Workers Benefit Protection Act when employees evaluate \n     whether to sign an age discrimination release in the context \n     of a program offered to a group or class of employees). Under \n     the rule's time frames, employers, particularly small ones, \n     will not have enough time to secure legal counsel, let alone \n     an opportunity to speak with employees about union \n     representation or respond to promises made by union \n     organizers, even though many of those promises may be \n     completely unrealistic. Given that union organizers typically \n     lobby employees for months outside the workplace without an \n     employer's knowledge, these ``ambush'' elections would often \n     result in employees' receiving only half the story. They \n     would hear promises of raises and benefits that unions have \n     no way of guaranteeing, without an opportunity for the \n     employer to explain its position and the possible \n     inaccuracies put forward by the union.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to support S.J. Res. 36 and \n     Congress to pass this much needed resolution. If left \n     unchecked, the actions of the NLRB will fuel economic \n     uncertainty and have serious negative ramifications for \n     millions of employers, U.S. workers they have hired or would \n     like to hire, and consumers.\n       The Coalition for a Democratic Workplace and National \n     Organization (119): 60 Plus Association, Aeronautical Repair \n     Station Association,

Michael Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on Health, Education, \n         Labor and Pensions (HELP), Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Enzi: On behalf of the National \n     Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's \n     leading small business advocacy organization, I am writing in \n     support of S.J. Res. 36, a resolution of disapproval in \n     response to the National Labor Relation Board's (NLRB) rule \n     related to ``ambush'' elections. The ambush election rule \n     significantly alters the pre-election labor union process in \n     ways that would particularly harm small businesses, and we \n     appreciate your resolution of disapproval to nullify this \n     rule.\n       Despite Congress refusing to pass card check legislation, \n     it seems clear that the NLRB is intent on implementing card \n     check by regulation. The Board's rule on ``ambush'' elections \n     will significantly undermine an employer's opportunity to \n     learn of and respond to union organization by reducing the \n     so-called ``critical period'' from petition-filing to \n     election, from the current average time of 31 days to as few \n     as 10 21 days. NFIB believes that employee informed choice \n     will be compromised because the shortened time frame will \n     have business owners scrambling to obtain legal counsel, and \n     they will have hardly any time to talk to their employees. \n     This shortened time frame will hit small businesses \n     particularly hard, since small employers usually lack labor \n     relations expertise and in-house legal departments.\n       With the proposed ``ambush'' election rule, the NLRB has \n     demonstrated that it has little understanding or concern for \n     the unique demands that these actions would place on small \n     business. It is always a challenge for small business owners \n     to stay updated with new regulations and labor laws, \n     especially in the current economic environment. NFIB's \n     monthly economic surveys indicate that the small business \n     economy is still at recession levels, and nearly 20 percent \n     of small business owners surveyed indicate that economic and \n     political uncertainty is their number one concern. \n     Unfortunately, the pro-union actions of the NLRB will only \n     create more uncertainty for small business owners at a time \n     when the country needs them to be creating more jobs.\n       Thank you for introducing this legislation to help \n     America's small businesses. I look forward to working with \n     you to protect small business as the 112th Congress moves \n     forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Eckerly,\n                             Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article by Phil Kerpen in the Daily Caller entitled ``Will any \nSenate Democrat stand up to Obama's NLRB?''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Daily Caller, Apr. 19, 2012]\n\n           Will Any Senate Democrat Stand Up to Obama's NLRB?\n\n                            (By Phil Kerpen)\n\n       With the spectacle of Senate Budget Chairman Kent Conrad \n     being forced to back down on actually offering a budget, it's \n     clearer than ever that Senate Democrats are pursuing a \n     deliberate strategy of doing nothing, blocking House-passed \n     bills and giving President Obama a free hand to use \n     regulators and bureaucrats to push his agenda forward. The \n     Senate has already failed to stand up to the EPA's back-door \n     cap-and-trade energy taxes and the FCC's self-created legally \n     dubious power to regulate the Internet. Next week we'll find \n     out if there are any Senate Democrats willing to stand up to \n     the NLRB bureaucrats who are imposing the failed card-check \n     legislation in bite-size pieces via bureaucratic decree.\n       The NLRB is giving the EPA a run for our money in the race \n     to see which agency can cause the most damage to our free-\n     market economy. Not only did the NLRB infamously sue Boeing \n     for opening a new plant in a right-to-work state, it is now \n     suing the state of Arizona to overturn the state's \n     constitutional guarantee of secret ballot protections in \n     union organizing elections. It has also pursued a dizzying \n     array of regulations and decisions designed to force workers \n     into unions against their will.\n       The NLRB suffered a setback this week when a district court \n     struck down its rule forcing employers to display posters in \n     the workplace touting the benefits of unionization. Next week \n     it could be dealt an even bigger blow if just a handful of \n     Senate Democrats stand up for the economic interests of their \n     constituents and the basic constitutional principle that the \n     people's elected representatives should make the laws in this \n     country.\n       The vote is on Senator Mike Enzi's (R WY) Congressional \n     Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval, S.J. Res 36, \n     which would simply overturn the NLRB's ambush elections rule, \n     which allows union organizers to spring elections on \n     employers and workers. Because of the CRA's special \n     procedures, the resolution cannot be filibustered and \n     therefore needs just 51 votes to pass. All but two \n     Republicans--Lisa Murkowski (R AK) and Scott Brown (R MA)--\n     are cosponsors, but not a single Democrat has signed onto the \n     resolution.\n       The ambush rule at issue was forced through the NLRB on a 2 \n     to 1 party-line vote late last year, just before infamous \n     union lawyer Craig Becker's recess appointment to the board \n     expired. It could be the last action of the NLRB that will \n     have legal force for some time, because after Becker expired \n     at the end of the year, the board lacked the quorum necessary \n     to make decisions and issue rules. (Obama tried to re-\n     establish a quorum by non-recess-appointing another radical \n     union lawyer, Richard Griffin, among others, but those \n     appointments should be found invalid in court.)\n       The ambush rule is a prime example of the NLRB advancing an \n     element of legislation already rejected by Congress and \n     putting the interests of labor bosses above those of workers. \n     After the first version of card check that eliminated private \n     ballot elections entirely crashed into a wall of public \n     opposition, a revamped version of the legislation retained \n     elections but allowed union organizers to catch workers and \n     employers by surprise with ambush elections. That version \n     also failed in Congress, but the NLRB is pretending it passed \n     and moving forward just the same.\n       The current average period before an election after a union \n     files a petition is 38 days. This gives both the union and \n     management an opportunity to explain the facts and ensure \n     workers understand the high stakes in a representation \n     election. The new rule will shorten it to as little as 10 \n     days and eliminate procedural safeguards employers currently \n     have to make sure union elections are duly authorized and \n     eligible workers are properly defined before an election \n     takes place.\n       NLRB Chairman Mark Pearce has indicated that if the rule \n     stands he intends to go much further. ``We keep our eye on \n     the prize,'' Pearce said in January, promising to force \n     employers to make confidential employee information, \n     including phone numbers and email addresses, available to \n     union organizers. That would potentially expose workers to \n     harassment, intimidation or even violence.\n       The vote on S.J. Res 36 will give the Senate an opportunity \n     to exercise its constitutional duty under Article I, Section \n     1 and stop the usurpation of legislative power by \n     unaccountable federal bureaucrats at the NLRB. Unfortunately, \n     it appears likely that once again Democratic senators will \n     find it more convenient to obstruct and allow the Obama \n     administration a free hand to govern by regulation.\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\n       Voters should watch next week's vote with this question in \n     mind: If my senator will not do the job of legislating, \n     shouldn't I elect someone who will?\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of Senate \nJoint Resolution 36, which would reject the National Labor Relations \nBoard's, NLRB, rule on representation procedures, the so-called \n``ambush election'' rule. I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of \nthis important legislation, introduced by Senator Enzi with 44 \ncosponsors.\n  On December 22, 2011, the NLRB finalized new regulations, which will \nbecome effective on April 30, 2012, significantly limiting the time for \nholding union representation elections. This change would result in \nemployees making the critical decision about whether or not to form a \nunion in as little as 10 days.\n  Back in 1959, then-Senator John F. Kennedy explained that ``the 30-\nday waiting period [before a union election] is an additional safeguard \nagainst rushing employees into an election where they are unfamiliar \nwith the issues . . . there should be at least a 30-day interval \nbetween the request for an election and the holding of the election'' \nto provide ``at least 30 days in which both parties can present their \nviewpoints.'' I agree with our former President and Senator. An \nexpedited timeframe would limit the opportunity of employers to express \ntheir views, and leave employees with insufficient information to make \nan informed decision.\n  According to the NLRB, in 2011 union representation elections were \nheld on average within 38 days. That is already below the NLRB's stated \ntarget of 42 days. Therefore, this begs the question of why yet another \nregulation is even necessary.\n  Businesses, our nation's job creators and the engine of any lasting \neconomic growth, have been saying for some time that the lack of jobs \nis largely due to a climate of uncertainty, most notably the \nuncertainty and cost created by new federal regulations.\n  This ambush election rule will particularly negatively affect small \nbusinesses. Small business owners often lack the resources and legal \nexpertise to navigate and understand complex labor processes within \nsuch a short time frame. In our current economy, it is critical that we \ndo everything possible to advance policies that promote U.S. economic \ngrowth and jobs.\n  The Joint Resolution of Disapproval will not change current law. It \nsimply will protect employers and employees by allowing them to conduct \nrepresentation elections in the same manner that has been done for \ndecades.\n  The NLRB's goal should be to ensure fair elections and a level \nplaying field for all.\n  Mr. ENZI. Unless there is further debate, I yield back the balance of \nour time for today.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this side yields back the balance of our \ntime for today as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2579-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2579-S2585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2011--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tragedy at L'Ambiance Plaza\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, on this day, almost exactly at this \nhour, 25 years ago in Bridgeport, CT, the L'Ambiance Plaza became a \nscene of devastation and destruction and death. Almost every year in \nthese 25 years we have commemorated that destruction and tragedy with a \nceremony. We did the same this morning in Bridgeport. We went first to \nthe site and then to city hall and then to lay a wreath at the memorial \nfor the 28 workers who were killed on this day 25 years ago. L'Ambiance \nis ground zero for worker safety.\n  I rise today to talk about all who have been injured or lost their \nlives because of unsafe work conditions.\n  L'Ambiance Plaza was a tragedy, but it was not the result of human \nerror, it was the result of an employer cutting corners to put profits \nabove safety. It was an avoidable and preventable catastrophe.\n  One of the tasks we have as public officials is to ensure basic \nsafety for our citizens, particularly for workers who leave their homes \nin the morning hoping for nothing more than to come home at night to \ntheir families, put food on the table and a roof over the heads of \ntheir children. Those 28 workers who perished on this day 25 years ago \nwanted nothing more than those simple opportunities that should be \nguaranteed in the United States of America, the greatest Nation in the \nhistory of the world.\n  In protecting workplace safety, we have an agency called the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, known as OSHA. It is \ncharged by this Congress and every Congress since its creation with \nsetting standards and providing for enforcement of those standards so \nas to ensure basic safety for workers when they leave home every day \nand go to their jobs.\n  In Bridgeport, at L'Ambiance, a technique of construction known as \nlift slab was in use. It was under review by OSHA. It had been under \nreview for 5 years before the L'Ambiance collapse. In 1994, years after \nL'Ambiance, it was prohibited unless certain conditions were met. If \nthat standard had been in effect on this day 25 years ago, 28 lives \nwould have been saved.\n  This morning I was in Bridgeport for that ceremony with many of the \nfamilies who must live with the tragedies of their loved ones having \nperished needlessly and tragically on this date. There were speeches. \nThere was a bell-ringing ceremony. There were tributes not only to the \nworkers and their families but also to their brothers and sisters who \nsearched with a ferocity and determination in the hours and days for \ntheir remains after it became clear they could not be rescued. But none \nof today's ceremonies or any of the other ceremonies in the past 25 \nyears can bring back those workers who perished because lift-slab \nconstruction was used on that site. And when the upper story fell \nfirst, all of the bottom stories collapsed as well, meaning that those \nwho worked under that top story could not be saved.\n  Eventually, when OSHA adopted the standard to be applied to lift-slab \nconstruction, it said no one could work under that top story when it \nwas put in place. OSHA, in short, recognized the hazards of lift-slab \nconstruction well before L'Ambiance collapsed, and its inaction over \nthe process of adopting those regulations--the 8.7 years it took to \nadopt the standard--contributed significantly to the collapse that \noccurred 25 years ago to this day.\n  I wish I could say OSHA has learned from this horrific incident at \nL'Ambiance. I wish I could say the standard setting that is so \nnecessary to be achieved promptly and effectively now is done \nroutinely. Unfortunately, the contrary seems to be true.\n  I wish to thank Senator Harkin, the chairman of the Senate Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, for a hearing last week that \nilluminated so dramatically how much work there is still to be done.\n  The GAO has done a study showing that average length of time to \ncomplete these standards is more than 7 years. That figure takes into \naccount the standards set since 1981 to the year 2000. The final number \nof regulations published by OSHA has declined every decade since the \n1980s. While 24 final standards were published in the 1980s, only 10 \nfinal standards were published between 2000 and 2010.\n  Workers are still at risk because regulations are delayed for years. \nOne example is that the dangerous health effects resulting from the \ninhalation of silica dust, found in common sand, have been widely known \nfor many years. Silica dust has been classified as a carcinogen to \nhumans by the U.S. National Toxicology Program. It is a known cause of \nlung cancer and silicosis, an often fatal disease. Yet, despite the \nscientific evidence and the\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\nhazards associated with silica dust, its use on worksites across the \ncountry is ineffectively regulated by inadequate OSHA standards, and \nthose standards have been on the books since 1972.\n  Preventing the dangers of silica is simple and easy. Employers simply \nmust ensure that when cutting materials, the blade must be wet to \nensure the silica dust is not airborne--simple and easy solutions that \ncan be achieved by standards OSHA has a responsibility to set.\n  According to OSHA agency officials, they began work on updating the \neffective silica standards back in 1997, more than 14 years ago. The \nmost recent proposal for a new silica standard was submitted to OMB in \nFebruary 2011. OMB has been processing that draft for over a year. In \nthe meantime, workers are put in danger, workers contract disease, and \nworkers are put at risk of fatal disease. These lengthy delays are \nsimply unacceptable. As the L'Ambiance tragedy demonstrates, standards \ndelayed is safety denied. Workers and their families suffer real-life \nconsequences when the Federal Government fails to implement effective \nstandards to protect people in their workplaces. OSHA itself estimates \nthat up to 60 worker deaths per year could be prevented by \nstrengthening the silica regulation and other regulations from 1972. \nYet the new rule continues to be delayed by procedural and political \nroadblocks.\n  There is still work to be done, and I hope we will make progress, \nunder Senator Harkin's leadership, on an OSHA rule making standards \nmore effective and more easily adopted.\n  There are a number of simple and easy steps that can be adopted. \nExpediting approval of safety standards is one of them. Despite a \ngeneral consensus within industries on permissible exposure limits--\nthat is, PELs--to dangerous chemicals, OSHA rules for hundreds of those \nchemicals haven't been updated for nearly four decades. OSHA should \ndirect and Congress should direct OSHA to update obsolete PELs to \nreflect consensus among industries, experts, and reputable national and \ninternational organizations.\n  Easier court approval also must be enabled. The current standards for \njudicial review are a major factor in effecting the timeline of OSHA's \nstandard-setting process. The existing ``substantial evidence'' \nstandard requiring that OSHA research all industrial processes \nassociated with the issue being regulated is disproportionately \nburdensome when compared to the requirements placed upon other Federal \nagencies, and the standards should be reevaluated.\n  Finally, deadlines for timelines for standard setting should be \nadopted, directed by the Congress, to minimize the time it takes OSHA \nto issue occupational safety and health standards. Experts and agency \nofficials agree that statutory timelines for issuing standards should \nbe imposed by Congress and enforced by the courts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these measures and \nothers, and I hope the memory of those 28 workers who were killed 25 \nyears ago on this day will inspire and move us to take action as \nquickly and effectively as possible. But each year others are added to \nthat list in other sites in Connecticut--49 last year alone--and around \nthe country, hundreds in the States of my colleagues in this body. Let \ntheir memories also inspire us to redouble our efforts to protect \npeople in the workplaces around Connecticut and the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my \namendment to strike section 208 from the postal reform bill. Section \n208 would authorize the U.S. Postal Service to move to 5-day delivery \nservice within 2 years.\n  The U.S. Postal Service faces significant financial problems. Changes \nmust be made for the Postal Service to adjust to a digital world. The \nbudgetary concerns are very real--we all know this--but an imminent \nreduction in service to 5 days a week is not the answer. No. 1, a shift \nto 5-day service could result in the loss of up to 80,000 jobs \nnationally. Is this the time to be proposing 80,000 layoffs? No. 2, 5-\nday service would undercut a market advantage the U.S. Postal Service \ncurrently has over its competitors. No. 3, especially in rural America, \nmany of our businesses and most vulnerable citizens depend on 6-day \npostal delivery. Newspapers, advertisers, pharmacy delivery services, \nand senior citizens all could be hurt by the loss of Saturday service.\n  Last week I met with the community of Mule Creek in New Mexico. Mule \nCreek is small and rural. Folks there told me that they have no cell \nphone service, no high-speed Internet. They depend on their post \noffice. It is the lifeline, the center of their community--and not just \n5 days a week. For many working people, Saturday is the only day they \ncan sign for packages, including for delivery of prescription drugs.\n  I know some of my colleagues believe moving to 5-day service is \nnecessary because of the Postal Service's financial problems, but we \nneed to give the changes we are making in the bill a chance to take \neffect. Two years simply isn't enough time before we make such a \ndrastic and far-reaching change. We should not rush prematurely to 5-\nday service.\n  I urge support for my amendment to protect jobs, to strengthen the \ncompetitiveness of the Postal Service, and to protect the millions of \nAmericans who depend on that service.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, how much time do I have? I understand it \nmight be 10, 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not controlled.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about amendment No. \n2083, which I am offering to the bill that is before us.\n  I think all of us know the U.S. Postal Service is absolutely not \nsustainable in its current form. Mail volume has greatly declined over \nthe past decade and will continue to do so over the next decade. The \nU.S. Postal Service has known this for a long time. They knew that mail \nvolume was declining and that the market for their products was \nchanging. But the economic crisis made things far worse than they could \nimagine.\n  Now the Postal Service is on the edge of financial ruin. But we \ndidn't get here only because of the economic crisis; it is because the \nU.S. Postal Service's business model is fundamentally broken. The USPS \nlost $5.1 billion in this last fiscal year and $3.3 billion in the \nfirst quarter of the current year. I know some have tried to blame the \nrequirement that the USPS prefund their retirement health benefits for \nthe USPS's financial losses. But the fact is that these recent losses \nare not due to the prefunding requirement because Congress has allowed \nthe USPS to delay this last year's payment. The U.S. Postal Service has \nalso nearly reached its statutory borrowing limit.\n  Faced with this situation, it is abundantly clear that the USPS must \nmake radical changes in its existing infrastructure and business model. \nAgain, USPS should have, could have, and indeed has wanted to begin \nmaking these changes to its outdated, excessive infrastructure, but \nCongress--all of us here or at least some of us here have blocked these \nattempts. We should give the USPS the flexibility to meet these \nchallenges and make business decisions on how to deal with the paradigm \nshift in their primary market rather than further limiting their \nability to adapt.\n  My amendment to S. 1789 gives the U.S. Postal Service greater \nflexibility in three primary areas: facilities and service, pricing, \nand labor.\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\n  On facilities and service, it allows the U.S. Postal Service to \ncontinue closing post offices using the existing procedures for post \noffice closures--they already exist--instead of creating further \nbarriers to closure, which this bill does. These procedures are well \nthought out and give ample opportunities for public comment and appeal.\n  It also allows the Postal Service to proceed with its proposed change \nin delivery service standards--something it has proposed--which is a \nkey component of its 5-year plan of profitability.\n  This amendment also allows the Postal Service to immediately \nimplement 5-day delivery, if it chooses--a move the U.S. Postal Service \nbelieves may save nearly $2 billion a year. The underlying bill, on the \nother hand, requires a 2-year delay and further study of this issue, \nwhich the Postal Service already knows needs to happen. Mr. President, \nwe don't need a study to tell us what we already know. The Postal \nService needs flexibility in its delivery schedule.\n\n  A number of interested parties, including the Postal Service and the \nPresident of the United States--the President--support moving to a 5-\nday delivery. Furthermore, my amendment allows the Postal Service to \nclose processing and distribution centers, something the Postal Service \nhas identified as needed action for nearly a decade.\n  On pricing, my amendment removes the arbitrary CPI-based cap put in \nplace by the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. Put \nsimply, this gives the Postal Service more flexibility to adjust their \nprices as markets change.\n  Current law and S. 1789 actually mandate the Postal Service provide \nsome services at a loss. It is unbelievable the calls we have been \nreceiving in our office that basically point to the tremendous \ncorporate welfare that is in existence--people calling me not wanting \nthese changes because it affects their business. A congressional \nmandate that the U.S. Postal Service provide certain services without \ncovering their costs makes very little sense.\n  Please note, this would not allow the Postal Service to arbitrarily \nraise rates at will. They would still be subject to Postal Regulatory \nCommission--the PRC--regulation.\n  Finally, on labor, my amendment gives the Postal Service greater \nflexibility to reduce its workforce as needed and negotiate contracts \nthat make sense for its financial situation. Since labor costs make up \napproximately 80 percent of the Postal Service's cost structure, it is \nclear that any good-faith postal reform proposal must include labor \nreform.\n  First, it prohibits the inclusion of a no-layoff clause--and let me \nunderline this--in future collective bargaining agreements. It does not \nalter CBAs currently in place that contain these clauses. This is only \nfor future clauses. As mail volume continues to decline, the Postal \nService must have the flexibility to change the size and makeup of its \nworkforce as needed.\n  Second, this amendment eliminates a provision in existing law that \nrequires fringe benefits for Postal Service employees be at least as \ngood as those that existed in 1971. These benefits represent a huge \nportion of fixed labor costs which currently place a major burden on \nPostal Service operations. Eliminating this provision will give the \nPostal Service more options in contract negotiation rather than \nhamstringing them.\n  My amendment is a balanced approach that strives to give the U.S. \nPostal Service maximum flexibility in multiple areas as they work \ntoward financial stability. Here is the best part. According to CBO--\nwhich just contacted us today--this bill saves $21 billion for the \nPostal Service over the next decade. Let me say that one more time. CBO \nhas just contacted us. The Postal Service is now in tremendous \nfinancial straits, and we have a bill before us that hamstrings them \nand keeps them from doing the things we all know if this were a real \nbusiness we would allow to happen. My amendment gives them the \nflexibility to do the things the Postal Service needs to do and that \nmost every American understands they need to do and the amendment saves \n$21 billion over the next 10 years.\n  It is my understanding, by the way, there is no attempt to offset the \ncost of this bill over the next 10 years.\n  In conclusion, it is clear the Postal Service must make drastic \nchanges, and I applaud those portions of S. 1789 that allow the USPS \ngreater flexibility. But there are far too many provisions in the \nunderlying bill that would put more restrictions on the U.S. Postal \nService, not fewer, and limit the organization's ability to adapt to \nchanging times and so I urge support of my amendment.\n  I thank the Chair for his time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it pains me greatly to disagree with my \nfriend and colleague from Tennessee, with whom I have a great \nfriendship and great respect, but what he is essentially offering comes \npretty close to a complete substitute for the provisions in our bill, \nand I wish to go through the provisions to make sure our colleagues \nunderstand fully what the choices are that are presented by Senator \nCorker's amendment.\n  First, let me say I do strongly oppose his amendment because of the \nimpact I believe it would have on postal customers, whether they are in \nrural America, whether they are a big mailer, a small mailer, a \nresidence or a business, and what the impact ultimately will be on \npostal revenue. Let us first discuss the issue of 6-day delivery.\n  There are a lot of different views on this issue. Senator Corker has \npresented one, as has Senator McCain, of moving immediately to 5-day \ndelivery. On the other hand, there are Members who have filed \namendments who want to prevent the Postal Service from ever moving to \n5-day delivery. Here is what is in our bill.\n  Our bill recognizes the Postal Service should, if possible, avoid \ndeep cuts in its service. Certainly, eliminating 1 day a week of \ndelivery is a deep cut in the service it is providing. It recognizes, \nhowever, that if the Postal Service cannot wring out the excessive cost \nthat is in its current system, it may have no choice but to eliminate \nSaturday delivery in order to become solvent.\n  What we do is allow a 2-year period during which time the Postal \nService would implement the many cost-saving provisions in our bill, \nincluding a workforce reduction of 18 percent--which is about 100,000 \nemployees--through compassionate means, such as buyouts and retirement \nincentives, and then have the GAO and the PRC--the Postal Regulatory \nCommission--certify that despite undertaking all these cost-saving \nmoves, it is not possible for the Postal Service to return to solvency \nwithout this deep service cut. But to move immediately to eliminating \nSaturday delivery would come at a real cost and it may not be \nnecessary. It may not be necessary at all.\n  I would also point out the experts in this area are the members of \nthe Postal Regulatory Commission. The experts are not at CBO. The \nexperts are the regulators of the Postal Service--the PRC. When the PRC \nexamined the issue of eliminating Saturday delivery, here is what it \nfound. First of all, it found the potential savings were far less than \nthe Postal Service estimated. In fact, they were half as much as the \nPostal Service estimated.\n\n  Second, they found that eliminating Saturday delivery put rural \nAmerica, in particular, at a disadvantage because rural America often \ndoes not have access to broadband, to Internet services, and to \nalternative delivery systems. So the PRC, which looked at this issue \nvery carefully and issued a report, found the savings were less by half \nand the consequences were far more severe for rural America.\n  Saturday delivery also gives the Postal Service itself a competitive \nadvantage over nonpostal alternatives. If we are here trying to save \nthe Postal Service, why would we jeopardize an asset the Postal Service \nhas that its competitors do not? That is why we came up with this \ncarefully crafted compromise on this issue.\n  I believe cutting Saturday delivery should be the last resort, not \nthe first\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\noption, because it will inevitably drive away customers. That is one \nreason the American Newspaper Association is so opposed to doing away \nwith Saturday delivery. It is one reason many of the mail order \npharmaceutical companies are so opposed, because many seniors depend on \nreceiving their vital medications through the mail.\n  Again, we have said if there are no other alternatives, this measure \ncould proceed. But I can't imagine any large business operating this \nway--cutting service first. My colleagues often talk about how \nimportant it is to let the Postal Service act like a ``real business.'' \nBut this is the last thing a real business would do. Real businesses \nknow their most valuable asset is their customer base. Businesses do \nliterally everything else before slashing service and raising prices or \nanything else that might alienate or drive away their remaining \ncustomers, and they do not do this out of the goodness of their hearts \nbut because they understand what drives their bottom line.\n  The fact is, if more customers leave the Postal Service, the revenue \nwill plummet. Again, reducing service--eliminating Saturday delivery--\nshould be the last resort, not the first option. That is exactly what \nour bill does.\n  The Senator's amendment would also repeal the CPI link to postal \nrates. I am at a loss as to why the Senator would propose that. \nEliminating that protection, that orderly system, would be devastating \nfor many mailers. Again, mailers need predictable, steady, stable \nrates.\n  Think of a catalog company that prints its catalogs so many months in \nadvance. It now can count on what the postal rates are going to be. \nUnder the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee that stability, that \npredictability would be gone.\n  The reason in 2006 that we rewrote the rate-setting system was that \nit had been an extremely litigious, time-consuming system. Both the \nmailers and the Postal Service hated the system that we had prior to \n2006. Both agreed at the time that it was important to have stability \nand predictability in rates and to have a system that didn't involve \nthis very expensive, litigious rate-setting system. So we went to the \nCPI link system so we could have stable, predictable, and transparent \npricing increases.\n  This amendment repeals the section of the current law on rate setting \nthat mailers have repeatedly testified is the heart of the 2006 reforms \nand something they need if they are to continue to use the Postal \nService. That is why the mailers, the largest customers of the Postal \nService, are such strong supporters of the predictable system that we \nput in place in 2006.\n  Let me turn to another issue. There is so much I could say on all of \nthese, but I can see a lot of Members have come to the floor.\n  The Senator's amendment would also eliminate the standards we put \ninto the bill to protect overnight delivery within certain delivery \nareas. We have recently learned that the Postal Service's own \npreliminary analysis, submitted confidentially in secret to its \nregulators at the PRC, reveals that its service reduction plan to slow \nmail delivery and shut down postal plants will lead to more than a 9-\npercent decrease in first-class mail and a 7.7-percent reduction in all \nclasses of mail.\n  In this preliminary estimate the Postal Service said the first-year \nlosses alone would be $5.2 billion; that the Postal Service would lose \nif we proceed with this plan. Now that those numbers have become \npublic, the Postal Service is backpeddling and criticizing its own \nestimates. But those are the estimates that are in its own survey that \nwas filed with the PRC.\n  They don't surprise me because they are consistent with what I am \nhearing from major postal customers, and once those customers turn to \nother communications options and leave the mail system they will not be \ncoming back, revenue will plummet, and the Postal Service will be \nsucked further into a death spiral.\n  There are many other comments I could make about the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Tennessee. I think his amendment \nessentially constitutes a substitute to the bill that is before us in \nthat it makes so many fundamental changes. I believe it would be \ndevastating for the Postal Service; that it would cause large and small \nmailers to leave the Postal Service, setting off the death spiral from \nwhich the Postal Service might never recover.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, just 20 seconds, not to rebut anything \nthat has been said.\n  I think the Senator from Maine and I have a very different view about \nthe ways to solve the post office issues. But I just want to thank her \nfor her tone. I want to thank the Senator from Connecticut, too, for \nthe way they continue to work together to try to produce legislation in \nthis body. So I thank them both for being the way they are. They are \ntwo of the Senators I admire most here. I thank them.\n  I have a very different point of view on this issue, but I thank them \nfor the way they continually work together to try to solve problems. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with them on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I just want to say briefly, thanks to \nmy friend from Tennessee not just for his kind words, which mean a lot \nto me, but for coming to the floor to discuss his amendment.\n  There are different points of view about this issue. I think, as I \nsaid very simplistically at the beginning of the debate, some think our \nbipartisan committee bill does too little. Some think it does too much. \nI think we have hit the right common-ground spot. And I repeat what I \nsaid earlier in the day: There is some due process in this. We don't \nallow for what might be called shock therapy for the Postal Service \nbecause we don't think it will work, and we think it would have the net \neffect of diminishing the revenues of the Postal Service by cutting \nbusiness.\n  But here is the report we received today from the U.S. Postal Service \nitself, just to indicate to my friend from Tennessee and others who may \nbe following the debate.\n  This substitute bill of ours, S. 1789, is not just fluff. The Postal \nService itself estimates that over the coming 3 years; that is, by 2016 \nfiscal year, our bill, if enacted, will enable the Postal Service to \nsave $19 billion annually. They were hoping for $20 billion, but $19 \nbillion is pretty close. I think we have done it without the \ndislocation to the millions of people in our society who depend on the \nmail and depend on mailing industries for their jobs, as well as the \nhundreds of thousands of people who work for the Postal Service, 18 \npercent of whom we hope will receive incentives that will be adequate \nfor them to think about retirement.\n  But this is a bill that creates a transition that will keep the \nPostal Service alive--and we think even healthier--without the kind of \nsudden jolts the amendment offered by my friend from Tennessee would \nimpose.\n  So I would respectfully oppose the Corker amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, before I discuss my pending amendment to \nthe Postal Service reform bill, I would like to take a moment to honor \nfour brave soldiers based out of Schofield Barracks from Hawaii who \ndied in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on Thursday. They made the \nultimate sacrifice in service to our country, and we will never forget \nthem.\n  My thoughts and prayers, and I know the thoughts and prayers of many \nothers in Hawaii and others across the United States, are with their \nfamilies tonight. We honor and thank them and are so sorry for their \nloss.\n  Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment No. 2034 regarding \nFederal workers' compensation, which is cosponsored by nine Senators, \nincluding Senators Inouye, Harkin, Murray, Franken, Leahy, Shaheen, \nKerry, Lautenberg, and Brown of Ohio.\n  I have serious concerns with the provisions of the postal reform bill \nthat would make changes to the Federal workers' compensation program, \nknown as FECA, not just within the Postal Service but across the entire \ngovernment.\n  These provisions would cut benefits to elderly disabled employees and \neliminate a supplement for dependents. Many who are already injured \nwould\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\nhave their benefits cut retroactively. This is particularly unfair \nbecause most employees affected by these far-reaching cuts are not even \nPostal Service employees. Many are Defense and State Department \nemployees injured supporting missions overseas, Federal law enforcement \nofficers, and firefighters injured saving lives or prison guards \nattacked by inmates.\n  Sponsors of this bill argue that changes to workers compensation must \nbe included in this legislation to place the Postal Service on a sound \nfinancial footing. However, the fact is that the changes would have \nvery little effect on the Postal Service's deficit. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, these changes would actually cost the \nPostal Service an additional $21 million in the first 3 years.\n\n  Any changes to benefits for those injured in service to their country \nshould be done in a careful, comprehensive manner. There are complex \nissues that deserve more analysis before we simply cut benefits people \nhave planned for and depend on.\n  At a hearing I held last July witnesses raised serious concerns with \nreducing FECA benefits, especially at the retirement age. They \ntestified that disabled employees may not be able to save enough in \ntime for a reduction in income because they missed out on wage growth, \nSocial Security, and the Thrift Savings Plan. Because of this \ndisadvantage, the Federal Government, like most States, provides \nbenefits that last as long as the injury, even if that is past the \nnormal retirement age.\n  At the request of a bipartisan group of members from the House \nCommittee on Education and Workforce, the Government Accountability \nOffice is currently reviewing both pre- and postretirement-age FECA \nbenefits to determine fair benefit amounts. Acting on this proposal now \nwithout waiting for GAO's analysis is irresponsible. As a result, we \nmay set benefit levels too low, seriously harming disabled employees, \nor too high, taking funding away from other priorities.\n  We must be extremely cautious not to make arbitrary cuts to benefits \nthat could have serious detrimental effects on elderly disabled \nemployees.\n  Last November, the House passed a Republican-led bipartisan FECA \nreform bill, H.R. 2465, by voice vote. The bipartisan sponsors of this \nbill chose not to make any changes to benefits without more information \non appropriate benefit levels. I believe their actions were correct, \nand the Senate should enact similar legislation by passing my \namendment.\n  My amendment would strike the government-wide FECA provisions in this \nbill and replace them with the House-passed FECA reform bill, which \nmakes a number of commonsense reforms that will improve program \nefficiency and integrity without reducing benefits.\n  Among other things, my amendment contains program integrity measures \nrecommended by the inspector general at the Department of Labor, the \nAccountability Office, and the administration that will save taxpayers \nmoney.\n  My amendment would also update benefit levels for funeral costs and \ndisfigurement that have not been increased since 1949, and it would \nprotect civilian employees serving in dangerous areas, such as Iraq and \nAfghanistan, by giving them more time to file a claim and making sure \ninjuries from terrorism are covered even if the employee is off duty.\n  Everyone understands the Postal Service is in the midst of a serious \nfinancial crisis that must be addressed. Chairman Lieberman and Ranking \nMember Collins have done a great job in bringing this on. However, \nbreaking our promises to injured Federal employees to save the Postal \nService just a tiny fraction of its deficit I believe is wrong. I urge \nmy colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the \nSenator from Hawaii. I know he cares deeply about this issue. But it is \nsimply time for us to reform the Federal workers' compensation program \nfor postal workers and for other Federal workers. For this reason, I \noppose his amendment because it does not begin to solve the problems \nthat have been repeatedly documented in the program by the inspectors \ngeneral at the Postal Service, at the Department of Labor, by GAO, and \nby the Obama administration, which has called for many of the reforms \nwe have incorporated into this bill. Senator Akaka's amendment takes on \nonly very minor reforms which are already included in the bill. It does \nnot even attempt to constrain the rapidly growing costs of the program, \nand it truly does nothing to effectively combat the fraud in the \nprogram.\n  Let me start with some background to show the growing, the escalating \ncost of the Federal workers' compensation system. From 1997 to 2009, \nthe program's costs grew by an astonishing $1 billion, as this chart \nshows. That was a 52-percent increase in program expenditures. It is \none of the reasons why President Obama's administration has submitted \nchanges to this program over and over. Our bill, according to the CBO, \nwould reduce the program's outlays for workers' comp by $1.2 billion \nover the next 10 years.\n  I note the Obama administration supports across-the-board reforms, \njust as we have put in our bill. It makes no sense to have one system \nfor postal workers and one system for Federal employees when they all \nparticipate in the same program now. The Postal Service, however, makes \nup more than 40 percent of all workers' comp cases for the Government, \nand the number of postal employees on the long-term rolls has increased \nby 62 percent since 2009. Paying more than $1 billion a year in \nworkers' comp payments, the Postal Service is the largest program \nparticipant, providing over one-third of the program's budget. These \nchanges are supported by the leaders at the Postal Service. The \namendment would block desperately needed reforms to a program that has \nnot been updated in over 35 years.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the structure of benefits in the \nprogram and why there is a problem. Under the current program, a worker \nwho has dependents and is out on workers' comp receives a payment at \nthe rate of 75 percent of his preinjury salary, and these benefits are \ntax free. Currently, more than 70 percent of beneficiaries are \nreceiving compensation at that level.\n  In addition to that, it is important to understand that 75-percent \ntax-free benefit rate is higher than that paid by any comparable State \nworkers' compensation system and, given our current Tax Code, 75 \npercent of salary tax free is equivalent, for most people, to a full \nsalary after taxes.\n  We do want to make sure we have a workers' comp program that takes \ncare of our injured workers that is compassionate, that helps them \nrecover and return to work. But the current program of the Federal \nGovernment does not accomplish those roles.\n  First of all, it does not encourage injured workers to get the help \nthey need to recover and to return to work, as these statistics will \ndemonstrate. Right now, the program, across the board, Federal and \npostal workers, has 10,000 beneficiaries age 70 or older, 2,000 of whom \nare postal employees. They are receiving higher payments on workers' \ncomp than they would under the standard retirement program. That is \nalmost one-quarter of all beneficiaries in the program who are over age \n70. Of the beneficiaries, 430 of them are over age 90, and 6 of the \nworkers' comp beneficiaries are age 100 or older. These employees are \nnot going back to work. If they were still working, it would be a \nmiracle. They would be retired. It is not fair to postal and Federal \nemployees who work their entire lives, retire at age 60 or 65, and \nreceive a retirement benefit that is 26 percent lower than the median \nbenefit received by workers' compensation recipients. That is unfair. \nThat means people who remain on workers' comp make more money than if \nthey had continued working and much more than they would make in the \nretirement systems for Federal and postal workers.\n  I wish to make sure that as we reform the system, we are fair. One of \nthe major reforms is to move people at age 65 from workers' comp to the \nnormal retirement system, but we have exempted from these reforms those \nwho are least able to prepare for it, those who are totally disabled \nand unable to return to work, and those who are age 65 and over. I \nthink that is a very fair approach.\n  Another protection we have included for those current claimants who \nwould\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\nbe affected by the reforms in the bill is a 3-year waiting period. If a \nclaimant is not already grandfathered and therefore is not disabled and \nunable to return to work, then that individual would experience no \nreduction in benefits for 3 years, regardless of that individual's age. \nAgain, the reforms we have included in our bill closely track the \nreforms proposed by President Obama's administration.\n  Finally, let me just say this program has proven to be highly \nvulnerable to fraud. GAO reported as recently as November that the \nvulnerabilities in the program increase the risk of claimants receiving \nbenefits they are not entitled to. There are many reasons for that. I \nwill go into that further at another time. But the Department of Labor \ninspector general reported that the removal of a single fraudulent \nclaim saves, on average, between $300,000 and $500,000. What is more, \nthese vulnerabilities are not new and they are not rare. When the IG \nlooked at 10,000 claimant files one decade ago, there were \nirregularities in almost 75 percent of them, and it resulted in \nbenefits being reduced or ended for more than 50 claimants.\n  This is a troubled program. It needs to be reformed. It needs to be \nmade more fair. It needs to be more fair to individual workers. There \nneeds to be more of a focus on return to work, and it needs to be more \nfair to workers who spend their entire careers working for the Postal \nService or the Federal Government and then retire and receive a far \nlower benefit than an elderly individual who remains on workers' comp.\n  I urge the defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to address a number of \nstatements my good friend Senator Collins has made about the FECA \nprovisions in this bill.\n  First, it has been argued these changes are necessary to save the \nPostal Service money. However, since most employees affected by these \ncuts are not postal employees, the savings expected from these changes \nwould have very little effect on the Postal Service's deficit. In fact, \naccording to CBO, these changes would actually cost the Postal Service \nan additional $21 million in the first 3 years.\n  In addition, it has been said on the floor that the FECA recipients \nover retirement age get 26 percent more income than similar employees \nwho work their entire career and retire under the normal retirement \nsystems. This statistic comes from a recent GAO report that looked at \nonly a small sample of nonpostal workers, eligible for CSCS retirement.\n  In fact, according to GAO, their recent report only examines 8 \npercent of the active Federal workforce and does not even look at the \nPostal Service workers. Cuts should not be made to FECA benefits until \nGAO completes a more comprehensive study, now underway, which examines \nthe impact of benefit reductions on FERS participants. The Senate has \nnot considered FECA legislation since 2006, and the only hearing was \nthe one I held last year.\n  The Federal workers' comp program, similar to most State programs, \nallows injured workers to continue receiving compensation as long as \nthe injury lasts, even if that is past normal retirement age. This is \nnecessary because disabled workers on FECA do not earn Social Security \ncredit and cannot participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, and they miss \nout on normal wage growth. We must make them whole for their injuries \nby making up for lost wages and their inability to save for \nretirement. It is simply not the case that workers of retirement age \nwho still receive FECA benefits are somehow scamming the system.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is notified the Senate is under a \nprevious order to move to executive session at 5 p.m.\n  Does the Senator seek more time to conclude his remarks?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I will wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. In fact, in 1974, Congress repealed an earlier statute to \nallow a reduction at age 70. Congress cited concerns about the hardship \nthe reductions caused on senior citizens as well as concerns about age \ndiscrimination when repealing the past less severe version of this \nlegislation. No matter a person's age, they have every right to that \nbenefit.\n  I agree that we should be taking a closer look at ways to prevent \nfraud and abuse in this program, but reducing benefits for people at \nretirement age has nothing to do with reducing fraud. My amendment \nallows the Department of Labor to obtain wage data from the Social \nSecurity Administration--this will help prevent fraud.\n  It has been argued that these cuts bring the FECA program more in \nline with the state programs. However, most state programs have no \nbenefit reductions for recipients at retirement age. In fact, 33 state \nprograms do not reduce benefits at any age. At our subcommittee hearing \nlast July, the minority requested witness stated that these states seem \nto have no interest in cutting benefits for senior citizens.\n  Finally, proponents of these cuts have emphasized repeatedly that \nthese provisions are very similar to an Obama administration proposal. \nThis was actually a Bush administration proposal that the Obama \nadministration simply kept in place. More importantly, this bill cuts \nbenefits more deeply than that proposal, and most concerning--unlike \nthe administration proposal--this bill would apply reductions \nretroactively to many employees who already have been injured.\n  Moreover, the Department of Labor has admitted that the changes to \nbenefit amounts in the their proposal were round numbers based on rough \ncalculations--I believe that is hardly the basis to determine what \nelderly disabled people will have to live on for the rest of their \nlives.\n  We simply do not have the information we need to decide on fair \nbenefit levels and should wait for the more extensive GAO study now \nunderway. Breaking our promises to injured federal employees to save \nthe Postal Service a tiny fraction of its deficit is not the solution. \nMy amendment 2034 offers a reasonable alternative by replacing the FECA \nprovisions in this bill with the bipartisan FECA reform bill that \npassed the House by voice vote last year. The House chose not to make \nbenefit cuts without the additional information they sought from GAO, \nand we should follow their lead.\n  This amendment would make commonsense reforms that will improve \nprogram efficiency and integrity without reducing benefits and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I wish to say the chairman of our committee, Joe Lieberman, and the \nranking member have worked hard at this, and my whole effort is to deal \nwith many of the workers of the Federal Government who are not in the \nPostal Service as well. I ask that my amendment be considered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for just three \nmoments to speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Akaka for \ncoming to the floor and speaking on behalf of his amendment. He is one \nof the most hard-working, constructive members of our committee, the \ncommittee from which the underlying bill has come. He is one of the \nfinest people I have ever met. I have the greatest admiration and \naffection for him.\n  So unlike Senator Collins, it is with some reluctance that I must say \nI oppose this amendment. I will speak very briefly since Senator \nCollins has spoken well on it.\n  I think the current system goes beyond taking care of those who need \nworkers' compensation, and it has come to a point where it is unfair \nnot just to those who are paying for the system but to others who are \nworking in the Postal Service today.\n  I thank Senator Collins. She has worked very hard and very \nthoughtfully. The proposal she made turned out to be so balanced and \nconstructive that folks in the Obama administration who had been \nworking on a similar proposal for all Federal employees asked that we \nextend the workers' compensation reforms in the Postal Service bill to \nall Federal employees. Dare I call this a Collins-Obama proposal? I \ndon't know. I just raised that prospect.\n  In any case, I support the underlying bill in this regard and very \nrespectfully\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nand affectionately oppose the Akaka amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2585-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2585-S2587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF BRIAN C. WIMES TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n               EASTERN AND WESTERN DISTRICTS OF MISSOURI\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Brian C. Wimes, of \nMissouri, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern and \nWestern Districts of Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri on the floor, Mr. Blunt. I know he has a Republican leadership \nmeeting he needs to get to. I yield such time as he needs on the \nRepublican reserved time, with the understanding that when he finishes, \nit will go back to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank my good friend for yielding and for \ntaking consideration of my schedule.\n  I rise to support Judge Brian Wimes as the nominee for the Eastern \nand Western Districts of Missouri. He spent his entire career working \nin the public sector. He has been involved in many groups and \norganizations dedicated to serving disadvantaged individuals.\n  He was born in Kansas City, MO. He earned his bachelor's degree in \npolitical science from the University of Kansas. We don't hold that \nagainst him. He got his law degree from the Thurgood Marshall School of \nLaw at Texas Southern University in 1994.\n  When he graduated, he became the attorney advisor for the litigation \nbranch of the Federal Bureau of Prisons at the Department of Justice \nhere in Washington. Judge Wimes represented the Bureau in civil actions \nby inmates throughout the country.\n  In 1995, he left the Bureau and became an assistant prosecuting \nattorney for the Jackson County prosecutor's office in Kansas City.\n  Beginning in 2001, Judge Wimes served as the Jackson County drug \ncourt commissioner for more than 5 years. The drug courts in our State, \nand in other places, have served a good and integral role in combating \ndrug abuse. The drug court is a program that offers nonviolent first-\ntime offenders a chance to participate in an outpatient-based treatment \nprogram rather than to face prosecution. More than 1,200 people have \ngraduated from the Jackson County drug court. More than 96 percent of \nthose people were conviction free 5 years after their graduation.\n  As a prosecutor, Judge Wimes received national honors, including \nbeing named Rookie Prosecutor of the Year during his first year in the \nJackson County prosecutor's office.\n  In 2002, he was honored as a member of Ingram magazine's 40 under \nForty. In 2009, the Call Newspaper recognized him as one of the 25 most \ninfluential African Americans in Kansas City.\n  He has been deeply involved in Big Brothers and Big Sisters and Hope \nHouse Domestic Violence Shelter. He is a member of St. Monica's \nCatholic Church.\n  In 2007, Judge Wimes was appointed by my son Governor Matt Blunt to \nserve on the 16th Judicial Circuit Court of Jackson County, MO. If Matt \nBlunt made any mistakes as Governor, this was not one of them. Judge \nWimes has continued not only to serve on the court but to serve on \nboards in Kansas City for the Kansas City Youth Court, which is \naffiliated with the UMKC School of Law as well as the Criminal Justice \nAdvisory Board of the Penn Valley Community College in Kansas City, the \nMental Health Association of the Heartland.\n  I believe his experience makes him a highly qualified judicial \nnominee, and he will serve the American people well in this job. I am \nsupportive of him.\n  Mr. President, I have a statement on another matter that I also \nmentioned to my friend from Vermont that I will make while I am here, \nand I ask that it appear separately in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Blunt are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, regaining my time on this side, I \nappreciate the Senator from Missouri speaking about Brian Wimes. Today, \nthe Senate will finally vote on the nomination of Brian Wimes to fill a \njudicial vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the Western and Eastern \nDistricts of Missouri. This nomination has had the support of both his \nhome state Senators, Senator McCaskill and Senator Blunt. The Judiciary \nCommittee voted to report the nomination favorably over four months \nago. There is no justification for this unnecessary delay.\n  The Senate is still so far this year only considering judicial \nnominations that could and should have been confirmed last year. We \nwill conclude the first four months of this year having only considered \njudicial nominees who should have been confirmed before recessing last \nDecember. We have yet to get to any of the nominees we should be \nconsidering this year because of Republican objections to proceeding \nmore promptly.\n  With nearly one in 10 judgeships across the Nation vacant, the \njudicial vacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was at this point in \nthe first term of President George W. Bush when we lowered vacancy \nrates more than twice as quickly. The Senate is 33 confirmations of \ncircuit and district court judges behind the number at this point in \nPresident Bush's fourth year in office. We are also 66 confirmations \nfrom the total of 205 that we reached by the end of President Bush's \nfourth year.\n  As I noted earlier this month, the Federal judiciary has been forced \nto operate with the heavy burden of 80 or more judicial vacancies for \nnearly three years now. There are 22 judicial nominees on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar ready for final consideration and a vote, not just \nthis one. Action on those 22 nominees would go a long way toward easing \nthe burden on the Federal courts and ensuring that all Americans have \nFederal judges available so that they can have the quality of justice \nthat they deserve.\n  Some Senate Republicans seek to divert attention by suggesting that \nthese longstanding vacancies are the President's fault for not sending \nus nominees. The fact is that there are 22 outstanding judicial \nnominees that can be confirmed right now, but who are being stalled. \nLet us act on them. Let us vote them up or down. When my grandchildren \nsay they want more food before they finish what is on their plate, my \nanswer is to urge them to finish the food already on their plate before \nasking for seconds or dessert. To those Republicans that contend it is \nthe White House's fault that they are not agreeing to proceed to \nconsider the judicial nominees we do have more quickly, I say let us \ncomplete Senate action on these 22 judicial nominees ready for final \naction. There are more working their way through Committee, and the \nSenate can act responsibly to help fill some of the most pressing \nvacancies plaguing some of our busiest courts if we proceed to these \nnominations now.\n  For instance, the Ninth Circuit is by far the busiest circuit in the \ncountry. The Senate has yet to vote on the long-delayed nomination of \nJudge Jacqueline Nguyen of California to fill one of the judicial \nemergency vacancies plaguing the Ninth Circuit. Hers was one of the \nnominations ready to be confirmed last year that will be delayed five \nmonths before her confirmation to fill that judicial emergency vacancy. \nRepublicans have insisted that her vote be delayed until next month. \nThere are two additional Ninth Circuit nominees to fill judicial \nemergency vacancies who are ready for final votes but for which Senate \nRepublicans have not agreed to schedule votes. Paul Watford of \nCalifornia and Justice Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona were both voted \nfavorably from the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year.\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\nThere is no good reason for delay. The 61 million people served by the \nNinth Circuit are not served by this delay. The Circuit is being forced \nto handle double the caseload of any other without its full complement \nof judges. The Senate should be expediting consideration of the \nnominations of Judge Jacqueline Nguyen, Paul Watford, and Justice \nAndrew Hurwitz, not delaying them.\n  The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan \nappointee, along with the members of the Judicial Council of the Ninth \nCircuit, have written to the Senate emphasizing the Ninth Circuit's \n``desperate need for judges,'' urging the Senate to ``act on judicial \nnominees without delay,'' and concluding ``we fear that the public will \nsuffer unless our vacancies are filled very promptly.'' The judicial \nemergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit are harming litigants by \ncreating unnecessary and costly delays. The Administrative Office of \nU.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly five months longer for the \nNinth Circuit to issue an opinion after an appeal is filed, compared to \nall other circuits. The Ninth Circuit's backlog of pending cases far \nexceeds other Federal courts. As of September 2011, the Ninth Circuit \nhad 14,041 cases pending before it, more than three times that of the \nnext busiest circuit.\n  If caseloads were really a concern of Republican Senators, as they \ncontended last year when they filibustered the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit, they would not be delaying the \nnominations to fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Ninth Circuit. \nIf caseloads were really a concern, Senate Republicans would consent to \nmove forward with all three of these Ninth Circuit nominees to allow \nfor up or down votes by the Senate without these months of unnecessary \ndelays.\n  Delay is harmful for everyone, but mostly to the American public. \nRight now, 150 million Americans live in districts and circuits with \nvacancies that could be filled if Senate Republicans would simply vote \non the 22 judicial nominations ready for final Senate action.\n  I also note that of the current vacancies without a nomination, 28 \ninvolve Republican home state Senators. This is a President who has \ntried to work with home state Senators from both parties on his \nnominations. There are also an additional seven nominations on which \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee cannot proceed because Republican \nSenators are withholding support.\n  I congratulate Senator McCaskill for her success in getting this vote \non the nomination of Judge Wimes. He is currently a judge on the 16th \nJudicial Circuit Court of Missouri. He previously served as the Jackson \nCounty Drug Court Commissioner and as an assistant prosecuting attorney \nin the Jackson County Prosecutor's Office. Judge Wimes has the strong \nsupport of Senator Claire McCaskill and is also supported by Senator \nBlunt. He and his family have been waiting for this day since the \nJudiciary Committee in an overwhelming, bipartisan manner voted to send \nhis name to the Senate on December 15th of last year.\n  Today's vote is pursuant to the agreement reached by the Majority \nLeader and the Republican leader last month. To make real progress, \nhowever, the Senate needs go beyond the nominations included in that \nlimited agreement to include the other 16 judicial nominations \ncurrently before the Senate for a final vote and the three judicial \nnominees who should be reported by the Judiciary Committee this week. \nLet us work in a bipartisan fashion to confirm these qualified judicial \nnominees so that we can help alleviate the judicial vacancy crisis and \nso they can serve the American people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this afternoon we are considering the \nnomination of Brian C. Wimes, of Missouri, to be United States District \nJudge for the Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri. Again, we are \nmoving forward under the regular order and procedures of the Senate. \nWith today's nomination we will have confirmed 78 judicial nominees \nduring this Congress. With the confirmations today, the Senate will \nhave confirmed more than 75 percent of President Obama's judicial \nnominations. I would note that in 3 years of President Obama's term, we \nwill have confirmed four nominees as a District Judge in Missouri. This \nis the same number President Bush had confirmed in his 8 years.\n  Judge Wimes is a 1990 graduate of the University of Kansas. He \nreceived his law degree in 1994 from Thurgood Marshall School of Law, \nTexas Southern University. Upon graduation from law school, Judge Wimes \nbecame an attorney advisor in the litigation branch of Federal Bureau \nof Prisons in Washington, DC. He represented the Bureau in civil \nactions by inmates throughout the country. In 1995, the nominee left \nthe Bureau and became an assistant prosecuting attorney for the Jackson \nCounty Prosecutor's Office in Kansas City, MO until 2001. During his \ntime there, he served as coordinator for the drug abatement response \nteam; was the East Patrol community prosecutor, acting as office \nliaison to the community; and, in 1999, became the senior trial \nattorney for the drug unit. In this position he prosecuted cases \ninvolving major crimes with an emphasis on drug-related homicides.\n  In 2001, Judge Wimes became the drug court commissioner for the court \nfor Jackson County, MO. He was appointed for two, 4-year terms. He \npresided over 400 assigned cases to drug court, with a caseload of 120 \nto 150 docketed cases per week.\n  After serving as the drug court commissioner for Jackson, Judge Wimes \nwas appointed by then-Governor Matt Blunt to serve as the circuit court \njudge for the 16th Judicial District, Jackson County, MO. He was \nappointed in 2007, and retained in the 2008 election cycle.\n  As a circuit court judge, Judge Wimes has presided over approximately \n29 criminal trials and 25 civil trials that have gone to judgment. From \n2008 to 2009, Judge Wimes was assigned to the family court division and \nheard over 500 domestic cases to judgment as well.\n  A substantial majority of the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him a unanimous rating of qualified.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Brian C. Wimes, of Missouri, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, I rise to discuss the importance of \naddressing the financial challenges now facing the U.S. Postal Service \nand our critical need to ensure that it remains a strong and reliable \nresource for the people of our country.\n  The American Postal Service was created over two centuries ago as a \nfunction of the Federal Government, acknowledged in the U.S. \nConstitution. In those last 220 years, the way we send mail and \nexchange correspondence has changed dramatically. We no longer need a \nstamp or an envelope; we can just shoot an e-mail or sign onto \nFacebook.\n  But even with all these changes, the fact remains that no matter who \nyou are or where you live, odds are that the post office plays a vital \nrole in your daily life. Seniors rely on the Postal Service to receive \ntheir medications, businesses rely on it to ship and receive goods, and \ncountless jobs hinge on its services, both directly and indirectly.\n  No matter how far we have come with technology in this digital age, \nthere are some things that simply cannot be sent by e-mail. That is why \nreliable timely mail service is something all Americans should be able \nto count on.\n  I have heard from numerous people in my State about the negative \nimpact the closure of certain post offices or mail processing \nfacilities would have on their communities. I have heard from State and \nlocal leaders about the impact of closing the mail processing \nfacilities in Duluth and Bemidji. I have heard from farmers who \nactually get their goods and ship their products through those mail \nprocessing centers.\n  That is why I have worked with Senator Sanders and roughly 25 of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, including Senator Durbin--one-fourth of the \nentire Senate--to negotiate changes to this original bill. I thank \nChairman Lieberman and Senators Collins and Carper for their great \nleadership. I am glad about some of the changes they have made.\n  The substitute amendment would, in fact, keep at a minimum 100 mail \nprocessing plants that are currently scheduled to close, and they would \nremain open for at least 3 years. Overnight delivery standards in \nregional areas will be protected. A large number of rural post offices \nthat are being studied for closure will remain open.\n  I am a cosponsor of the amendment to the legislation that would \nprovide important safeguards before closing mail processing facilities, \nand I have also cosponsored the McCaskill-Merkley amendment that would \nestablish a 2-year moratorium on closing rural post offices and \nrecognize the concerns of rural residents.\n  There is no doubt that changes need to be made to the Postal Service \nto make it more competitive in the digital world. I think a lot of \nthose changes are contained in the substitute amendment. We can even \nmake it stronger. I strongly believe we can reach a balance that makes \nnecessary reforms, while maintaining the quick service on which \nAmericans have come to rely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                               NLRB Rules\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor this evening \nto express my strong opposition to the resolution of disapproval filed \nby Senate Republicans that seeks to overturn critical new NLRB rules \nthat will protect workers across America. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto oppose it. Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nfrequently complain about how we spend our time on the Senate floor. \nToday, I have to say I am disappointed that we are being forced to \nspend valuable time on this issue.\n  Middle-class families across America are continuing to struggle in \nthis very tough economy, and it is hard to understand why Senate \nRepublicans want to spend time attacking an agency's mission to protect \nworkers and employers and is critical to protecting access to the \nmiddle class for workers and families.\n  Thankfully, as we all know, our economy seems to be stepping back \nfrom the precipice. But for so many workers today paychecks still have \nnot caught up, benefits continue to slip away, hours are getting cut, \nand job security is eroding. That is why I was very glad that at the \nend of last year, the NLRB voted to adopt modest commonsense rules that \nwould make it easier for workers to fight for fair treatment in the \nworkplace and help bring NLRB into the 21st century.\n  These new rules aren't going to solve every problem, but they are a \nstep in the right direction and will help workers and families across \nthe country. The new NLRB rules will strengthen and streamline the \nvoting process by reducing unnecessary litigation and intentional \ndelays. It will streamline pre- and postelection procedures, and it \nwill facilitate the use of electronic communications and document \nfiling. Those are all commonsense steps that should not be \ncontroversial.\n  I am extremely disappointed that Senate Republicans want to now \neliminate these rules and roll back the clock on worker protections. \nThe resolution we are going to vote on would eliminate steps to \nstandardize and add transparency to the employee election process. It \nwould eliminate steps that reduce frivolous litigation and create a \nmore cohesive and productive workplace for workers and businesses. It \nwill fundamentally weaken NLRB processes and procedures that workers \nand businesses rely on when they are trying to settle disputes.\n  It is bad for business, bad for working families, and it should not \npass. Workers across this country deserve a fair process in the \nworkplace. The NLRB rule this resolution would eliminate removes some \nof the unfair and unnecessary roadblocks so many workers face every \nday. I have to say that while we are discussing this issue, I want to \nexpress my disappointment and anger at the recent report from the \ninspector general about improper and politicized activities by a \ncurrent Republican member of the NLRB board, an individual who \npreviously worked for another board member who is a former staffer for \na Republican Member of the Senate. That report details multiple \ninstances of ethics misconduct, including the sharing of confidential \ninformation with outside parties. I am hopeful that issue will be fully \ninvestigated. I am deeply worried about the actions some people will \ntake to undermine an agency with a mission to protect the rights of \nworkers and employers. And honestly, I find it to be a sad statement \nabout the nature of our politics today, because the NLRB is doing a lot \nof good work for workers in America and it shouldn't be tarnished with \nthis sort of ethics issue.\n\n  This agency has borne the brunt of political attacks over the last \nyear from special interest groups and elected officials trying to score \npolitical points at the expense of workers and families. Many of these \nattacks have been inaccurate; many have been unfair. Some have used the \ncase involving Boeing and workers in my home State\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\nof Washington to weaken the agency, even while the NLRB work is what \nallowed the two sides to come together and find a solution to that \nchallenge. So I think this is wrong and these attacks should end.\n  The NLRB election rules are modest, they are commonsense steps toward \na fairer system for workers and businesses and will help us move toward \na system that works for everyone, and they will help make sure our \nworkers can simply exercise their rights to bargain for fair wages, for \nbenefits and equitable treatment under the law. That is what our \nworkers expect, it is what they deserve, and it is what the NLRB is \nworking to deliver.\n  Once again, I urge our colleagues to vote against that resolution of \ndisapproval. It is the wrong way to go for workers. It is the wrong way \nto go for businesses and for the middle class.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me join in the remarks by the \nSenator from Washington. This National Labor Relations Board rule which \nwill be voted on by the Senate tomorrow is one that was needed. The \nrule change was needed and the attempt on the floor, of course, is to \nundo this decision by the National Labor Relations Board.\n  If they say justice is denied, look at the current situation when it \ncomes to a vote by workers on collective bargaining. If delayed at \nevery potential opportunity, and sometimes it happens, workers have to \nwait, on average--average--198 days--that is 6\\1/2\\ months--to have a \nsimple vote deciding if they would be represented by the union. In some \nextreme cases they have been forced to wait 13 years for the right to \nvote on collective bargaining.\n  One in five workers who openly advocate for unions during an election \ncampaign is fired. As a result of these tactics, 35 percent of workers \ngive up and withdraw from the election before a vote is held. The \nproposed NLRB rule changes will remove unnecessary delays to the \nprocess, cut down on unnecessary litigation, and provide workers a \nmeaningful vote in a reasonable period of time. The proposed rules will \napply the same way to workers attempting to decertify a union as they \ndo to workers trying to form a union. So from the business side, if \nthey think workers no longer wish to belong to a union, there will be a \ntimely vote on that as well. It applies the same way to unions and \nemployers.\n  This rule is fundamentally fair, and that is why I encourage my \ncolleagues to join with me and Senator Murray and many others in voting \nagainst this effort by Senator Enzi to overturn the proposed National \nLabor Relations Board rule.\n  As I said earlier, Madam President, the rule applies the same way to \nunions and employers. But it does not require that elections be held \nwithin a specific time period and it does not deny companies the \nopportunity to express their opinion about union representation. The \nonly real impact of the rule changes will be to better protect workers' \nright to make a determination for themselves through a reasonable fair \ntimely election.\n  The NLRB rules create a uniform process for resolving pre- and post-\nelection disputes to provide consistency and remove unnecessary \nobstacles to workers' right to vote.\n  NLRB hearing officers will be empowered to dismiss claims that would \nnot impact the election. At the pre-election hearing, employers and \nunions can raise their concerns about the petition, but they can't play \ngames to stall the election.\n  The rules consolidates the pre-election and post-election appeals \ninto a single postelection procedure, which saves the parties from \nhaving to file and brief appeals that may be costly and useless based \non the outcome of the election.\n  The new rules make Board review of the regional directors' decisions \ndiscretionary. This change will require parties to identify compelling \nreason for Board review, allowing the Board to devote its limited time \nto cases where its review is warranted.\n  The new rules apply to both elections seeking to certify a union and \nelections seeking to decertify a union. Further, the new rules do not \nalter in any way an employer's ability to communicate with workers \nduring the election period and do not require that elections be held \nwithin a certain period of time.\n  In the view of organized labor, these rules, even in their scaled \nback form, are one of few positive actions taken by Congress or the \nadministration in the last year. Unions argue that the old rules are \nsubject to manipulation, causing significant pre-election delay and \nleading to petitions being withdrawn prior to an election or avoidance \nof Board processes altogether. If an employer takes advantage of every \nopportunity for delay, the average time before workers vote is 198 \ndays.\n  Business groups are opposed to the new NLRB rules arguing it will \nlimit their ability to present their side in an election. Most of their \npoints against the rule relate to provisions of the proposed rule that \nwere not included in the final rule. Their position also stems from \ngeneral opposition to the NLRB for the now settled Boeing issue, new \nworker rights posting requirements, the President's NLRB recess \nappointments, and other NLRB decisions.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this Wednesday the Supreme Court will \nhear a challenge to Arizona's controversial immigration law. I thought \nabout this law over the weekend in Springfield, IL. There is an annual \nevent where a special award is given to those sons and daughters of \nIllinois who have given great service to our State and Nation. Admiral \nRon Thunman, one of my neighbors in Springfield, was a graduate of \nSpringfield High School and enlisted in the Navy. He worked his way up \nto the rank of vice admiral in the U.S. Navy and at one point commanded \nour submarine fleet. To think of this young man from the middle of the \nMidwest ending up in charge of our submarine fleet is a great testament \nto his ability and to the opportunity the Navy gave him to serve his \ncountry.\n  When Admiral Thunman got up to receive his award--this Lincoln \nAward--he said: I stand here humbled by the memory of my father who was \nan illegal immigrant to this country from Norway, who came here jumping \noff a ship as a sailor and lived in the United States illegally until \nthe time he was prepared to volunteer to serve our Nation in World War \nII.\n  Admiral Thunman tells that story over and over. What a reminder it is \nthat the sons and daughters of immigrants to this country, as well as \nthose immigrants themselves, literally made America what it is today.\n  One hundred one years ago, my mother arrived on a boat from \nLithuania. Her boat came to Baltimore, MD, and my grandmother took \nherself, her sister, and brother, to East St. Louis, IL, where I grew \nup many years later. That is my story. It is an American story that is \nrepeated over and over. Immigrants are part of America. It is the \ndiversity of America that gives us our strength.\n  Those who hate and loathe immigrants have always been here. Probably \nas soon as the Mayflower landed, they looked over their shoulder and \nsaid, We hope nobody else is coming. But the fact is people have been \ncoming from all over the world, and they still would rather come to \nthis country than leave it, which is quite a testament to this Nation. \nSenator Lieberman made that point on the floor the other day.\n  This week, the Supreme Court is going to take up an important \nquestion on immigration--the Arizona law. Under the Arizona law, any \nundocumented immigrant can be arrested and charged with a State crime--\nan Arizona crime--solely on the basis of their immigration status. It \nis a crime for an illegal immigrant in Arizona to fail to carry \ndocuments proving their legal status under this law. Under our \nConstitution, States don't have the right to pass their own laws \npreempting Federal laws on immigration. That is why the Justice \nDepartment filed the case the Supreme Court will hear this week.\n  Let us be clear. It is wrong to criminalize people because of their \nimmigration status. That is not the way we treat immigrants in America. \nIt is not right to make criminals of people who go to work every day, \ncook our food, clean our hotel rooms, care for our aging parents in \nnursing homes, and care for our children as well. It is not right to \nmake criminals of those who worship with us in our churches, \nsynagogues, and mosques, and people who\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\nsend their children to the same schools as our children.\n  Here is the reality. This approach that Arizona law suggests will not \nhelp combat illegal immigration. Law enforcement doesn't have the time \nor resources to prosecute and incarcerate millions of people. Making \nundocumented immigrants into criminals will simply drive them farther \ninto the shadows. The Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police took a \nlook at the new Arizona law and came out in opposition to it. They said \nit makes it more difficult for them to maintain order and enforce law \nin Arizona. Immigrants, because of this law, the chiefs of police have \nsaid, will be much less likely to cooperate, and they need their \ncooperation to continue to fight crime.\n  There is another troubling aspect of the Arizona immigration law. \nAccording to experts, the law encourages racial profiling. I chair the \nSenate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil \nRights, and Human Rights. Last week, at a hearing on racial profiling, \nwe had the first hearing on the subject since 9/11/2001. One of the \nsubjects we examined at the hearing is the state of Federal, State, and \nlocal measures in recent years under the guise of combating illegal \nimmigration that have subjected Hispanic Americans to an increase in \nracial profiling. The Arizona immigration law is a prime example, and \nlet me explain why.\n  Arizona's law requires police officers to check the immigration \nstatus of any individual if they have ``reasonable suspicion'' the \nperson is undocumented. What is the basis for reasonable suspicion? \nArizona's guidance on the law tells police officers to consider factors \nsuch as how someone is dressed and their ability to communicate in \nEnglish.\n  Two former Arizona attorneys general, joined by 42 other former State \nattorneys general, filed a brief in the Arizona case and they said \n``application of the law requires racial profiling.''\n  One of the witnesses in our hearing was Ron Davis, chief of police at \nEast Palo Alto, CA. Chief Davis, along with 16 other current and former \nchief law enforcement officers, the Major Cities Chiefs of Police \nAssociation, and the Police Executive Research Forum, filed a brief in \nthe Arizona case. Here is what the brief filed by the chiefs of police \nin the Arizona case before the Supreme Court said:\n\n       The statutory standard of ``reasonable suspicion'' of \n     unlawful presence in the United States will as a practical \n     matter produce a focus on minorities, and specifically \n     Latinos.\n\n  Let me be clear: I believe--and I think most Americans share this \nbelief--the vast majority of law enforcement officers in America \nperform their jobs admirably and courageously. When they wake up in the \nmorning and put that badge on, they literally put their lives on the \nline for you, for me, and for all of us in America. Unfortunately, the \ninappropriate actions of a few, who engage in racial profiling, create \nmistrust and suspicion, and that hurts all police officers. The \nevidence clearly demonstrates that racial profiling doesn't solve \ncrimes, it doesn't work, and that is what Chief of Police Ron Davis \ntold us as well. That is why so many law enforcement leaders strongly \noppose racial profiling and the Arizona immigration law.\n  Instead of measures that harm law enforcement and promote racial \nprofiling, such as the Arizona immigration law, we need to support \npractical solutions to fix America's broken immigration system. And if \nI could say one word in defense of Arizona, it is the fact that our \nfailure--Congress's failure, Washington's failure--to deal with \nimmigration has brought on this effort by many States and localities. \nWe have our own responsibility.\n  Let me tell you where I think we should start. We should start our \nreform on immigration with the DREAM Act. Eleven years ago, I \nintroduced this bill, legislation that allows a select group of \nimmigrant students with great potential to contribute to America. The \nDREAM Act would give these students a chance to earn legal status, and \nultimately citizenship, if they came to the United States as children \nor have been long-term U.S. residents with good moral character, have \ngraduated from high school and have completed 2 years of college or \nmilitary service in good standing.\n  Russell Pearce, the author of the Arizona immigration law, had this \nto say about the DREAM Act, and I quote:\n\n       The DREAM Act is one of the greatest legislative threats to \n     America's sovereignty, national security and economic future.\n\n  Well, I see it differently, and so do people such as GEN Colin Powell \nand former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. They support the DREAM Act \nbecause it would make America a stronger Nation, giving these talented \nimmigrants a chance to serve our military and to improve and contribute \nto our economy. Tens of thousands of highly qualified, well-educated \nyoung people would enlist in the armed services if the DREAM Act \nbecomes law. Studies have found DREAM Act participants would contribute \nliterally trillions of dollars to the U.S. economy during their working \nlives.\n  The best way to understand the need for the DREAM Act is to meet the \nDreamers. Today I want to introduce you to a Dreamer from Arizona. Here \nshe is. Her name is Dulce Matuz. She was brought to the United States \nby her parents from Mexico as a young child. At Carl Hayden High School \nin Phoenix, AZ, Dulce became a dedicated member of the school's \nrobotics club where she found her true love--engineering.\n  She went on to graduate from Arizona State University, and we see her \nstanding here with the mascot. She earned a bachelor's degree in \nelectrical engineering. As a senior, Dulce received an internship to \nwork on the NASA space station. But after she graduated, reality set \nin. Because Dulce is undocumented--one of the Dreamers--she can't work \nas an engineer in America. She can't become licensed in any State. She \nhas no country.\n  In 2008, Dulce cofounded the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition, an \norganization of more than 200 DREAM Act students in predicaments like \nhers. She continues to volunteer at the high school she attended. \nToday, Dulce is 27 years old. Last week, this amazing young woman was \nnamed one of the hundred most influential people in the world by Time \nmagazine.\n  Time published a profile of Dulce written by the actress Eva \nLongoria. Here is what the profile said:\n\n       Dulce represents the finest of her generation, an \n     undocumented Latina confronted with legal barriers to \n     pursuing her engineering dream. She chose to fight for the \n     right to contribute to the country she has called home since \n     she was very young. Dulce takes on powerful opponents with \n     grace and conviction, saying, ``We are Americans, and \n     Americans don't give up.''\n\n  Dulce is right. Americans don't give up. We have been fighting for \nthe DREAM Act now for 11 years. We are not going to give up until it is \nsigned into law by a President of the United States. I am honored that \nthis President, President Barack Obama, when he was a Senator was a \ncosponsor of my legislation. I know where his heart is when it comes to \nthe DREAM Act.\n  Unlike the Arizona immigration law, the DREAM Act is a practical \nsolution to a serious problem with our broken immigration system. I \nhope the Supreme Court will strike down the Arizona immigration law, \nand I again beg my colleagues to support the DREAM Act. It is the right \nthing to do, and it will make America a stronger nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nas if in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       GI Bill Consumer Awareness\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, late last month I brought to \nWashington 55 or so college presidents from Ohio--presidents of 2-year \nand 4-year private and public colleges and universities--to discuss a \nwhole host of issues. One subject that always comes up when you talk \nabout young people, when you talk about college, when you talk about \nuniversities, is access to higher education, that far too many of our \nyoung people simply can't afford to go to college.\n  My wife, a graduate of Kent State some 30 years ago, was privileged \nin those days even though nobody in her family had ever gone to \ncollege. Her dad carried a union card, was a utility worker in \nAshtabula, OH, working as a\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\nmaintenance worker in a local powerplant. She was able to go to school \nbecause in those days college was more accessible--Pell grants, some \nloans, tuition was significantly lower--and she was able to be the \nfirst in her family to go to college, and she went to Kent State \nUniversity. Today it is much harder. Tuition is far too high. Pell \ngrants haven't kept up with the cost of education the way they might \nhave 30 years ago.\n  One of the options we have, the subsidized Stafford loan, which is \navailable to students based on need and is often the main pathway to \ncollege for a number of them, is under stress, if you will. If we do \nnothing, if Congress doesn't do anything, the interest on these \ncritical loans will double for borrowers beginning July 1, 2012. So the \ninterest rates will actually double on those students if Congress does \nnothing. The interest rate right now is 3.4 percent. That is why they \nare called subsidized Stafford loans.\n  We know that investing in our young people this way, giving them an \nopportunity to go to college, which they couldn't otherwise, could make \nsuch a difference in their lives. A number of people don't want to go \nto college. That is fine. Those who want to go should have that \nopportunity.\n  Student debt in this country has reached about $870 billion, \nexceeding credit cards and auto loans. As more and more students \ncontinue to enroll in higher education, balances are expected to \ncontinue climbing. This means fewer of our young adults will be able to \nbuy a home, start a business, or continue on to graduate school. \nAlready, students graduate from 4-year colleges and universities in \nOhio with, on average, about $27,000 in student loan debt. If the \ninterest rates double, it will add another $2,000 in debt for the \naverage borrower and as much as an additional $5,000 for the neediest \nborrower on subsidized Stafford student loans. A number in this \ninstitution in the Senate on the Democratic side are trying to convince \nour colleagues how important it is that we stop this interest rate from \ndoubling. We must act before July 1.\n  Just as we have an obligation to keep college affordable for middle-\nclass Americans and working-class Americans, we have as great an \nobligation to keep college accessible to American veterans. This year \nmore than 500,000 servicemembers and veterans are expected to take \nadvantage of the post-9/11 GI bill, a bill we passed out of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee to ensure that all veterans could afford \nthe rising cost of college. The VA is expected to spend some $11 \nbillion in education benefits and other GI bill benefits this year \nalone.\n  We know in the 1940s and 1950s what the first GI bill did--signed \nnear the end of World War II--how it created a whole generation of \nprosperity and a strong middle class. We know that the GI Bill of \nRights, which the House and Senate passed I believe 3 years ago, has \nbegun to help large numbers of veterans again. Unfortunately, \nservicemembers and veterans are often aggressively recruited by some \neducational institutions that use misleading information. For instance, \nif you visit the Web site gibill.com, it directs a veteran to enter his \nor her personal and contact information to obtain information about the \nGI bill's educational benefits. It looks just like a government Web \nsite, but it is not. It turns around and sells that veteran's \ninformation, often to for-profit colleges.\n  Earlier today, I was welcomed at a VFW post in Cleveland by Jason \nPlezko, the commander of that post. I met with Brad Sonenstein, a U.S. \nAir Force veteran now studying at Kent State, and Joshua Rider, the \nassistant director of the Center for Adult and Veteran Services at Kent \nState University. Brad explained how he was inundated with offers and \nletters when he was exploring how to utilize his well-earned GI \nbenefits. Those offers overwhelmingly came from for-profit colleges. He \nsaid they were more interested in their own bottom line than helping \nthose who served in the front lines. That is simply not right.\n  No one is in a better position to make a decision as to what is best \nfor them as a veteran than the veteran herself or the veteran himself. \nWe can play a role in assisting them. The GI Bill Consumer Awareness \nAct provides veterans with more and better information about their \nbenefits, calls for improved education counseling, and gives colleges \nnew resources to hire people such as Joshua Rider to help returning \nveterans. It requires all institutions of higher education to disclose \ncritical information, such as the average student loan debt, the \ntransferability of credits, and accurate job-placement data. We do that \nat our State universities. We do that at most of our not-for-profit \nprivate schools. We do that at our 2-year community colleges.\n  Those using the GI bill tend to be older than the average student \npopulation. They choose to serve our Nation, often right out of high \nschool rather than going straight to college. Because of this many have \nfamilies and careers and other challenges their classmates don't have. \nGiving our veterans the tools to make the best possible decisions \nbenefits all of them. That is the importance of the GI Bill Consumer \nAwareness Act.\n  I particularly thank Senator Murray, chair of the Veterans' \nCommittee, for her work on this legislation. This body should pass it \nimmediately.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I would like to first express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Ohio for his work on these education \nissues, particularly the importance of the Stafford loan and avoiding \nthe interest rate jump that is scheduled to take place. And I would \npoint out that had we passed the so-called Buffett rule bill so that \nAmericans who earn well over $1 million a year would actually all pay a \nfair share of taxes, that would have created somewhere between $47 \nbillion and $163 billion in revenues, and that would readily pay for \nkeeping the student loan rate down. So I hope we can find another way \nto do it, but that would have been one good way.\n  The reason I am on the floor this evening is because I was at \nWickford Junction in Rhode Island earlier today, where a new commuter \nrail station has been built, largely through the energy and effort of \nmy senior Senator, Jack Reed, over many years. Secretary LaHood, the \nU.S. Secretary of Transportation, came to be present at that event, and \nthat reminded me, of course, of the highway bill, which is probably the \nbiggest jobs bill we could pass here in Congress.\n  We tend to talk a good game on jobs. Recently, we even referred to a \nbill as a JOBS bill. It had kind of a trick: It was actually called \nJumpstart Our Business Startups, J-O-B-S. They made an acronym so that \nit sounded like a jobs bill when what it really did was to allow people \nto market stocks without the usual safeguards that protect investors \nand consumers.\n  So we do a lot to try to convince people we are working on jobs here \nin Congress, but the one bill that indisputably is really going to be \nhelpful to the American economy to provide jobs would be the highway \nbill that the Senate passed--2.9 billion jobs protected or created. In \nmy State of Rhode Island, it is 9,000 jobs, and I promise you we could \nuse those 9,000 jobs in Rhode Island right now. The bill passed the \nSenate with flying colors, with every kind of credit you could \nassociate with a piece of legislation. It passed 74 to 22. A 75th \nSenator indicated that he would have supported it but he was called out \nof town for a funeral. And obviously, with a 74-to-22 lopsided vote, \nhis vote was not necessary. But, in effect, 75 Senators are on record \nsupporting that bill, which in this Senate, as everybody knows, is a \nconsiderable landslide of a majority.\n  Now, 2.9 million jobs is a serious thing in this economy, with 9,000 \nin Rhode Island that we desperately need. And the bill left not only \nwith the support of a unanimous Environment and Public Works committee, \nwhere it came from originally--and I commend both Senator Boxer and \nSenator Inhofe, the chair and the ranking member, for pulling that \ntogether. As people who watch the Senate know, Senator Boxer and \nSenator Inhofe come from rather different political persuasions, and \nyet they were able to agree on this and bring a bill out of committee \nunanimously.\n  It then came to the floor and went forward. We had 5 weeks of floor \ndebate. We added 40 amendments either\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\nby vote or agreement. It was very bipartisan, it was very transparent, \nand we ended up with that 75-to-22 expression of support by the Senate \nfor that bill.\n  There was a rather different story on the House side. They knew the \nMarch 31 deadline was approaching--it had been a matter of law for a \nlong time--and they blew the deadline. They had no bill going into it. \nThey tried several times to come up with something, and they couldn't \ndo a thing. They had no bill at all.\n  So without a bill, one would hope they could have passed the Senate \nbill. They certainly had the votes. All they had to do was call it up \nand pass it. Democrats and Republicans would have voted for it, and we \nwould be getting those jobs out there right now. Instead, they had no \nbill, and they chose to pass an extension. The extension is actually \npretty harmful. They actually passed two, and they are both harmful.\n  The first short-term extension--I spoke to my DOT director in Rhode \nIsland. He was at Wickford Junction as well, and we have done a couple \nof other events in the past week or so to try to bring attention to \nthis. He has a list of roughly 95 or 96 projects they want to get done \nin Rhode Island in the summer building season, the highway construction \nseason. He estimates that probably 40 of those jobs are going to fall \noff the list because they don't know what their long-term funding is, \nand they can't commit to those jobs until this gets settled. So these \nshort-term extensions are very harmful. They cost jobs. They are job \nkillers. Yet the House has passed two of them.\n  To make it even more complicated, they threw on the last one--a \nrequirement that the Keystone Pipeline be bulldozed through all the \nregulatory and environmental reviews that are necessary. Say what you \nwant about the Keystone Pipeline, it is a completely contentious, \ncontroversial issue here in Congress. They did not make an effort to \nresolve it on the House side. This was not something where they brought \npeople together, came to a resolution on the Keystone Pipeline, and \nthen added it to the bill. No. They just took their Republican version \nof it without any effort to be bipartisan and stuffed it into the \nhighway extension.\n  So they have missed the chance to pass really good bipartisan \nlegislation out of the Senate, they have passed a job-killing extension \nthat is very harmful to folks doing highway work around the country, \nand they have complicated it further by throwing a controversial issue \non top.\n  If you are serious about jobs--and I know we talk a lot about it in \nthe Senate--if you are serious about jobs, we should stop that nonsense \nand take up the Senate bill and pass it in the House and get everybody \nto work. In the absence of that, we need to make sure that we move to \nconference very quickly, that we appoint conferees, and that we get \ngoing.\n  This is important to Rhode Island. As I said, we desperately need \nthese highway jobs. So I am going to continue, along with many of my \ncolleagues, coming to the Senate floor to put the pressure on to do \nsomething that is very simple: pass a highway bill. This is not \ncomplicated. We have been doing it since Eisenhower was President, and \nthe fact that we can't do it now says a lot about the capacity for \ngovernance of the House of Representatives under this Speaker.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, after our work on this important bill \nto reform the Postal Service is complete, we will be turning to another \nimportant bill, one that has a long history of bipartisan support. That \nbill, the Violence Against Women Act, is a law that has literally \nchanged the way we think about violence against women in the United \nStates.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is one of the great legislative \nsuccess stories of this generation. Since it was first passed in 1994--\nand I will tell you that then-Senator Biden was involved in drafting \nthat legislation and led that effort, he and someone we miss very \ndearly in Minnesota, Paul Wellstone. He and his wife Sheila were also \ninvolved in getting this important bill passed. Since that time, annual \ndomestic violence rates have fallen by 50 percent as communities \nnationwide have stopped looking at these issues as family issues and \nstarted treating domestic violence and sexual assault as the serious \ncrimes they are.\n  Before I came to the Senate I spent 8 years as chief prosecutor for \nMinnesota's largest county, Hennepin County. During that time, both \nprevention and the prosecution of domestic violence were one of my top \npriorities. We were very proud of the Domestic Violence Service Center, \nwhich was cutting edge in the Nation, a one-stop shop where people \ncould go when they were victims of domestic violence, a place for their \nkids; shelters, prosecutors would be able to charge out complaints, \npolice would be there for protective orders. It was a way to help \npeople who were at the point where they thought no one was there for \nthem, for women to be able to come in and find one place that was safe \nfor them.\n  As we all know, there is still a lot of work to be done. According to \na recent survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, 24 people per minute are victims of rape, physical \nviolence, or stalking. Approximately one in four women has experienced \nsevere physical violence by an intimate partner at some point in their \nlifetime, and 45 percent of the women killed in the United States every \nyear are killed by an intimate partner. Every year close to 17,000 \npeople lose their lives to domestic violence.\n  These statistics mean domestic violence and sexual assault and \nstalking are still problems in America. As far as we have come, we can \nstill do better. That is why it is such a good thing that we passed the \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization out of our Judiciary \nCommittee and the bill now has the support of 61 Senators, including 8 \nRepublicans. I am hopeful we will be able to pass this bill quickly \nafter we take it up later this week. It has taken too long.\n  Combating domestic violence and sexual assault is an issue on which \nwe should all be able to agree. Many of the provisions in the \nreauthorization bill make important changes to the current law. The \nbill consolidates duplicative programs and streamlines others. It \nprovides greater flexibility in the use of grant money by adding more \n``purpose areas'' to the list of allowable uses. It has new training \nrequirements for people providing legal assistance to victims, and it \ntakes important steps to address the disproportionately high domestic \nviolence rates in the Native American communities.\n  The bill also fills some gaps in the system. I am pleased to say it \nincludes legislation I introduced with Senator Hutchison to address \nhigh-tech stalking, cases where the stalker uses technology such as the \nInternet, video surveillance, and bugging to stalk their victims. \nSadly, we are seeing more of this. This bill will give law enforcement \nbetter tools for cracking down on stalkers.\n  Just as with physical stalking, high-tech stalking may foreshadow \nmore serious behavior down the road. It is an issue to take seriously, \nand we in law enforcement must be as sophisticated as those who are \nbreaking the law. That is why we need to update this law.\n  We also should not lose sight of the fact that the VAWA \nreauthorization has strong support from law enforcement. The Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, and the International Association of \nChiefs of Police support this bill.\n  Recent events in my State have shown me and the entire population of \nMinnesota in the worst possible way just how closely domestic violence \nis linked with the safety of our law enforcement officers. I don't \nthink people always think about that. They realize when police officers \nare out driving on the road, drunk drivers are out driving on the \nroad--that it is risky. Because the police are constantly on the road. \nWhat they don't realize is one of the leading causes of death of \nofficers is domestic violence-related incidents.\n  A couple of months ago I attended the funeral of Shawn Schneider, a \nyoung police officer from Lake City, MN. Officer Schneider died \nresponding to a domestic violence call--a 17-year-old girl who was \nbeing abused by her boyfriend. When Officer Schneider arrived at the \nscene, he was shot in the\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\nhead. The girl survived, but Officer Schneider literally gave his life \nto save another. I attended that funeral, and I will never forget the \nheartbreaking scene of his two young sons walking down the church aisle \nwith the little girl, his daughter, in a blue dress covered with stars. \nI think it reminds all of us that domestic violence just doesn't hurt \nthe immediate victim, it hurts entire families, entire communities.\n  This has never been a partisan bill. It is crucial to pass this bill. \nWe have made a lot of progress over the years, and we have been able to \nwork across the aisle to build on VAWA's success. That is something \nthat means a lot to me, and it certainly means a lot to the millions of \npeople who are victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault every \nsingle year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to bring this bill to the \nfloor quickly. We can pass it this week. We can provide desperately \nneeded help to victims of domestic assault, domestic violence, and \nother such crimes.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of S. 1789 but no earlier than Wednesday, April 25, the \nSenate adopt the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 312, S. 1925.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2592-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2592-S2594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to a period of morning business with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today marks the beginning of the 31st \nannual National Crime Victims' Rights Week. It is a time to recognize \nthe losses faced by victims of crimes and their families and to \nacknowledge the efforts being made to help them recover and rebuild \ntheir lives in the wake of tragedy. It is a time to reflect on all we \nhave accomplished and focus on what we have to yet do to help victims.\n  Of course, one of the best tools for delivering that help is the \nCrime Victims Fund. Unfortunately, in recent months, some have sought \nto violate the Victims of Crime Act. They want to take money out of the \ntrust fund for purposes and programs not authorized by the Victims of \nCrime Act. I have worked with Senators from both sides of the aisle. We \nhave been able to stop this raid on crime victims' funding. I wish to \ncommend Senators Mikulski and Hutchison, the chair and ranking member \nof the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science of the Committee on \nAppropriations for their important efforts in this regard in the \nappropriations bill we reported to the Senate last week.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, has reported a \nbill that preserves the Crime Victims Fund, and we succeeded in \nincreasing the funding next year for victims' compensation and \nassistance to $775 million. To be able to increase Federal assistance \nby $70 million from last year's cap is extraordinary in these economic \ntimes, and it is an indication here in the Senate of our commitment to \ncrime victims. This is a matter on which I have worked with Senator \nCrapo as well as Senator Mikulski over the years. I appreciate their \nleadership in this effort.\n  The Crime Victims Fund is not taxpayers' money. It comes from \npenalties and fines. It comes from wrongdoers. We designed it to help \nvictims of crime. We created it as a trust fund for crime victims' \nneeds and services. I have tried to respect the trust fund and to \nprotect it, to ensure that it is used and available for crime victims \nand their families who depend on its support in times of need. We all \nknow the States are being forced to tighten their belts, and when they \ndo, victims' services are being cut all over the country. Without the \nFederal assistance from this trust fund, victims' compensation programs \nand victims' assistance programs and services will be unavailable to \nmany.\n  Another important law that strengthens crime victims' rights and \nimproves crime victims' services is currently pending before the \nJudiciary Committee. The Justice For All Reauthorization Act \nstrengthens the rights guaranteed to crime victims in the criminal \njustice process and ensures that basic services, like the rapid testing \nof rape kits, help victims receive the justice, safety, and closure \nthey deserve. I look forward to working with Senators from both sides \nof the aisle to move that legislation forward as well.\n  Currently pending before the Senate is the majority leader's motion \nto proceed against the Violence Against Women's Act, S. 1925. I \nintroduced this legislation with Senator Crapo last year. We have 61 \nbipartisan cosponsors from both parties. When we enacted the Violence \nAgainst Women Act nearly 18 years ago, it sent a powerful message that \nwe will not tolerate crime against women and forever altered the way \nour Nation combats domestic and sexual violence. Our legislation offers \nsupport to the victims of these terrible crimes and helps them find \nsafety and rebuild their lives. The bill we will debate this week is \nbased on the recommendations of victims and the tireless professionals \nwho work with them every day.\n  April is also Sexual Assault Awareness Month and our bill takes the \nimportant step of focusing increased attention on sexual assaults, \nincluding those against the most vulnerable among us.\n  As I listened to Senator Murray, Senator Feinstein, Senator Shaheen, \nand Senator Gillibrand--and, as a matter of fact, I spoke with Senator \nHagan last week about the pending motion to proceed to the VAWA \nreauthorization legislation--I thought how fortunate we all are to \nserve with them and with Senators Mikulski, Boxer, Snowe, Landrieu, \nCollins, Stabenow, Cantwell, Murkowski, McCaskill, Klobuchar, and \nAyotte. In fact, 16 women senators are cosponsors of our Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act, and their input has strengthened \nthis critical legislation. I appreciate their strong bipartisan support \nfor this measure and their willingness to speak out time and again on \nthe need to pass this bill without delay.\n  We recently honored the senior Senator from Maryland for her services \nas the longest-serving woman Senator and as the woman who has also \nserved the longest in Congress. I can remember back before 1993, when \nSenator Carol Mosely Braun became the first woman to serve as a member \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. We are fortunate now to have both \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Klobuchar as active members of our \nCommittee.\n  I remember when nine women Senators joined together to contribute to \nthe book ``Nine and Counting'' about their paths to the U.S. Senate. \nThese women have served as role models for many other young women and \nyoung girls. Even as Senator Clinton has gone on to become our \nSecretary of State, there have been other changes. Six of the nine \nSenators who were subjects of the book in 2001 still serve in this \ninstitution today. They have been joined by nine additional women \nSenators from around the country. This book, ``Nine and Counting,'' was \na title for looking to the future. Today, 17 women serve in the U.S. \nSenate. That is a great step forward. They have farther to go, of \ncourse, but it is a lot better than when I came to the Senate when we \nhad no women serving. Sixteen of them have joined from both sides of \nthe aisle to bring their leadership and their strong support, but also \ntheir experience, to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\n  Our bill includes a number of provisions they have championed and \nsuggested. To will give one example, our bill includes the provisions \nthat Senator Klobuchar and Senator Hutchison suggested and introduced \nas the Stalkers Act of 2011. That provision is new to VAWA. It would \nnot have been included if we had simply introduced a one-sentence \nreauthorization of VAWA rather than a comprehensive bill. I thought it \nwas a good provision, intended to update the Federal antistalking \nstatute to capture the\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\nmore modern forms of communication that perpetrators use to stalk their \nvictims.\n  In the spirit of National Crime Victims' Rights Week, our \nreauthorization bill takes steps to recognize victims' needs that are \nnot being served and find ways to help them. That approach is not \nradical or extreme. The fact that the bill reaches more victims should \nnot be a basis for partisan division; it is something we ought to \ncelebrate. I have said on the floor before, a victim is a victim is a \nvictim.\n  In my earlier career I would go to a crime scene at 3 o'clock in the \nmorning with the police, as the chief law enforcement officer of our \ncounty. We might have a badly battered woman--if she survived; \nsometimes the victim did not survive--but I never heard the police say, \n``Well, if we are going to do something on this, we have to figure out \nwhether this victim is a Democrat or a Republican, or we have to figure \nout whether this victim is gay or straight, or we have to figure \nout''-- no. They said, ``For this victim, let us find out who did this \nand let's get them and let's see what we can do,'' or if the victim is \nstill alive, what we could do to protect the victim. That is what the \nViolence Against Women Act has always done and what I have tried to do \nfor crime victims for many years.\n\n  As we have done on every VAWA reauthorization bill, we have learned \nfrom past experience how to make it better and now we make it better by \ntaking responsible and moderate steps, in this case to protect \nimmigrant and native women, and ensuring services to victims regardless \nof sexual orientation or gender identity, again under the mantra ``a \nvictim is a victim is a victim.''\n  At the same time, we recognize the difficult economic times and the \nneed to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly. That \nis why the bill consolidates 13 programs into 4 in an effort to reduce \nduplication and bureaucratic barriers. It cuts the authorization level \nfor VAWA by more than $135 million a year, a decrease of nearly 20 \npercent from the last reauthorization. We will still provide sufficient \nauthority to fund VAWA programs at over $400 million a year, which is \nconsistent with the funding level provided in the appropriations bill \nfor the coming year. Our legislation also includes significant \naccountability provisions, including audit requirements, enforcement \nmechanisms, and restrictions on grantees and costs.\n  Since its introduction last November, more than 700 State and \nnational organizations have written to endorse the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act. They are 200 national organizations, \nincluding 500 State and local organizations--the National Task Force to \nEnd Sexual and Domestic Violence, the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral, the National District Attorneys' Association, the National \nSheriffs' Association, the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and 25 \nnational religious organizations. Last week, the mayors of three of the \nNation's largest cities--New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles--wrote to \nthe Senate urging us to pass the VAWA reauthorization. We have heard \nfrom 47 State attorneys general, Republican and Democratic alike, \nurging Senate passage of this legislation. That is because they \nrecognize this Federal law is meaningful and that this reauthorization \naddresses the ongoing, unmet needs of victims in their States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks these \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. In fact, today I was advised by Bruce Cohen in my office \nthat we have received the statement of administrative position. It is a \nvery strong statement from the White House, and it is a strong \nstatement in support of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am glad we are finally moving to this.\n  The last two reauthorizations, each one an improvement on the one \nbefore, passed this body unanimously. We should do the same. It is not \na partisan issue. I ask other Senators, if they haven't spoken with \nvictims of abuse, to speak to those who are; talk to the police chiefs; \ntalk to the people who have to deal with this; talk to the people who \nhave survived some of these horrendous attacks. Ask them if they think \nthis is needed. Ask those who have been protected from further abuse \nbecause of the steps we have taken in the Violence Against Women Act--\nask them if we need it.\n  The Presiding Officer and the other 98 Senators come in this building \nand we are protected by one of the finest police forces that exists, \nthe Capitol Hill Police force. We don't have to worry; nobody is going \nto attack us. In the Presiding Officer's State and my State and all of \nthe other States, unfortunately, thousands of people cannot rest easily \nthat way. They know their attacker and often they know their attacker \nis waiting to do it again. We can easily stand up and say here in the \nSenate: No, we won't stand for this violence against women. Let's take \nthe steps that we can take, the men and women in this body. Let's take \nthe steps we can take to stop the violence.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   April 19, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: As \n     mayors who collectively represent over seven and a half \n     million women, we believe it is imperative that the Senate \n     pass S. 1925, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act \n     of 2011. Despite considerable progress over the past two \n     decades in addressing the epidemic of violence against women, \n     we recognize that much more needs to be done and that this \n     legislation will strengthen our national commitment to \n     tackling the challenges that remain.\n       Since 1994, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) has \n     provided a comprehensive, coordinated, and community-based \n     approach toward reducing domestic violence, sexual assault, \n     stalking, and other forms of violence. Over the past two \n     decades, its programs and services have provided lifesaving \n     assistance to hundreds of thousands of victims. Through \n     victim support programs, local and state funding assistance, \n     and the U Visa program, VAWA has strengthened the ability of \n     the criminal justice system to investigate and prosecute \n     crimes and hold violent perpetrators accountable. These \n     efforts have contributed to dramatic reductions in the \n     incidence and impact of violence against women, including an \n     over 50 percent decline in the annual rate of domestic \n     violence. As we seek to make further progress, we believe it \n     is essential that we provide services to victims regardless \n     of their gender, race, language, Immigration status, or \n     sexual orientation.\n       As mayors, we have seen the tremendous positive impact of \n     the Violence Against Women Act in our communities. In New \n     York, VAWA funding has helped open three Family Justice \n     Centers, which are one-stop domestic violence centers with \n     staff from government agencies and nonprofit organizations to \n     assist victims of domestic violence. In Los Angeles, VAWA \n     funding has also helped expand its Domestic Abuse Response \n     Team--a collaborative effort between law enforcement officers \n     and victim advocates to respond to domestic violence calls at \n     the scene of the crime and provide crisis intervention. The \n     Chicago Police Department uses its funding to train staff to \n     assist victims of domestic abuse in an effort to provide the \n     best resources to these victims. These are just a few \n     examples of the vital services and assistance that this \n     landmark law has enabled communities all over the country to \n     provide to combat this terrible problem.\n       Despite the progress that has been made, much more needs to \n     be done. Still today, nearly one in five women have been \n     sexually assaulted or raped in their lifetime, and 45 percent \n     of the women killed in the United States die at the hands of \n     an intimate partner. This level of violence is simply \n     unacceptable. We believe that S. 1925--like the 2000 and 2005 \n     reauthorizations that preceded it--will help us better \n     address continuing problems and remaining unmet needs. This \n     legislation will expand services to immigrant and lesbian, \n     gay, and transgendered communities, who not only experience \n     the highest rates of violence but often have the most \n     difficulty in accessing services. in recognition of the \n     persistent problem of sexual violence, S. 1925 also will \n     strengthen the capacity of local, state, and federal law \n     enforcement to investigate and prosecute these crimes. While \n     these tools will be essential in\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\n     achieving justice, they are also a reminder of the wide \n     impact that domestic violence has on the community at large \n     including law enforcement. In each of our cities, police \n     officers have been injured or murdered while responding to \n     domestic violence incidents.\n       For these reasons, we believe that it is critical that the \n     Senate move quickly to take up and pass S. 1925 in order to \n     strengthen our national commitment to all victims of domestic \n     violence.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rahm Emanuel,\n       Mayor, City of Chicago.\n     Antonio R. Villaraigosa,\n       Mayor, City of Los Angeles.\n     Michael R. Bloomberg,\n       Mayor, City of New York.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                         of Attorneys General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2012.\n       Dear Members of Congress, Since its passage in 1994, the \n     Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') has shined a bright \n     light on domestic violence, bringing the issue out of the \n     shadows and into the forefront of our efforts to protect \n     women and families. VAWA transformed the response to domestic \n     violence at the local, state and federal level. Its successes \n     have been dramatic, with the annual incidence of domestic \n     violence falling by more than 50 percent.\n       Even though the advancements made since in 1994 have been \n     significant, a tremendous amount of work remains and we \n     believe it is critical that the Congress reauthorize VAWA. \n     Every day in this country, abusive husbands or partners kill \n     three women, and for every victim killed, there are nine more \n     who narrowly escape that fate. We see this realized in our \n     home states every day. Earlier this year in Delaware, three \n     children--ages 12, 2\\1/2\\ and 1\\1/2\\--watched their mother be \n     beaten to death by her ex-boyfriend on a sidewalk. In Maine \n     last summer, an abusive husband subject to a protective order \n     murdered his wife and two young children before taking his \n     own life.\n       Reauthorizing VAWA will send a clear message that this \n     country does not tolerate violence against women and show \n     Congress' commitment to reducing domestic violence, \n     protecting women from sexual assault and securing justice for \n     victims.\n       VAWA reauthorization will continue critical support for \n     victim services and target three key areas where data shows \n     we must focus our efforts in order to have the greatest \n     impact:\n       Domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault are \n     most prevalent among young women aged 16 24, with studies \n     showing that youth attitudes are still largely tolerant of \n     violence, and that women abused in adolescence are more \n     likely to be abused again as adults. VAWA reauthorization \n     will help us break that cycle by consolidating and \n     strengthening programs aimed at both prevention and \n     intervention, with a particular emphasis on more effectively \n     engaging men and local community-based resources in the \n     process.\n       A woman who has been sexually assaulted can be subjected to \n     further distress when the healthcare, law enforcement, and \n     legal response to her attack is not coordinated and \n     productive. Whether it is a first responder without adequate \n     training, a rape kit that goes unprocessed for lack of \n     funding, or a phone call between a crisis counselor and a \n     prosecutor that never takes place, sexual assault victims \n     deserve better. We must develop and implement best practices, \n     training, and communication tools across disciplines in order \n     to effectively prosecute and punish perpetrators, as well as \n     help victims heal and rebuild their lives.\n       There is a growing consensus among practitioners and \n     researchers that domestic violence homicides are predictable \n     and, therefore, often preventable. We can save the lives of \n     untold numbers of potential homicide victims with better \n     training for advocates, law enforcement, and others who \n     interact with victims to recognize the warning signs and \n     react meaningfully.\n       The fight to protect women from violence is one that never \n     ends. It is not a year-to-year issue, which is why we think \n     it is critical that Congress reauthorize the Violence Against \n     Women Act. We know a great deal more about domestic violence, \n     dating violence, sexual assault and stalking than we did 17 \n     years ago. Reauthorizing VAWA will allow us to build on those \n     lessons and continue to make progress and save lives.\n       VAWA was last reauthorized in 2006 and time is of the \n     essence for reauthorization of this important law. We urge \n     Congress to take on this critical mission and reauthorize \n     VAWA.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n       Joseph R. ``Beau'' Biden III, Delaware Attorney General; \n     Arthur Ripley Jr., American Samoa Attorney General; Dustin \n     McDaniel, Arkansas Attorney General; John W.

Leahy, D VT, and 60 cosponsors, Apr. 23, 2012)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. \n     1925 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, a \n     landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that first passed \n     the Congress in 1994 and has twice been reauthorized. That \n     Act transformed the Nation's response to violence against \n     women and brought critically needed resources to States and \n     local communities to address these crimes.\n       The Administration is pleased that S. 1925 continues that \n     bipartisan progress and targets resources to address today's \n     most pressing issues. Sexual assault remains one of the most \n     underreported violent crimes in the country. The bill \n     provides funding through State grants to improve the criminal \n     justice response to sexual assault and to better connect \n     victims with services. The bill also seeks to reduce domestic \n     violence homicides and address the high rates of violence \n     experienced by teens and young adults. Reaching young people \n     through early intervention can break the cycle of violence.\n       The Administration strongly supports measures in S. 1925 \n     that will bring justice to Native American victims. Rates of \n     domestic violence against Native American women are now among \n     the highest in the United States. The bill builds on the \n     Tribal Law and Order Act--which President Obama signed on \n     July 29, 2010--to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of \n     tribal justice systems and will provide additional tools to \n     tribal and Federal prosecutors to address domestic violence \n     in Indian country. The Administration also supports the \n     important leadership role of the Office on Violence Against \n     Women and believes that all victims should have access to \n     critically needed services and protections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2594-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2594-S2595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLES COLSON\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to talk for a few minutes about \nChuck Colson, who was a friend of mine and the founder of Prison \nFellowship Ministries. He died on Saturday at 80.\n  Before Chuck Colson was 40, he was counselor to the President of the \nUnited States, Richard Nixon. At about that same time, about the time \nhe was 40, he pled guilty to offenses related to the Daniel Ellsberg \nbreak-in. When he did that, I am told, even though his lawyers advised \nhim not to plead guilty at that moment, he said pleading guilty was \n``the price I had to pay to complete the shedding of my old life to be \nfree to live the new life.'' In June of 1974, he began to serve his \nprison sentence.\n  What was the new life? In August of 1973, Chuck Colson's good friend \nTom Phillips had counseled with him, and that was the moment Chuck \nColson said he decided his life would be led as a Christian, that he \nwould surrender his life to the Christian view and the Christian \nbelief. He personally told me at one time that it was T.S. Eliot's \nwriting ``Mere Christianity'' that then later became the intellectual \nbasis for his faith. But initially his faith was needed more than he \nclearly understood he had, and he found that in his faith. It was an \nactive faith.\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\n  I am constantly amazed that an active God can take the bad decisions \npeople make and, while God would not have wanted those to be the \ndecisions people make, can turn them into incredible opportunities. In \nthe life of Chuck Colson, that incredible opportunity became the \nfounding of Prison Fellowship Ministries and the impact it had on so \nmany other Lives.\n  Twenty years ago, I became the first chair of the Missouri Prison \nFellowship. As Chuck Colson was reaching out and trying to see how this \nidea could become an idea that would sustain itself and perhaps in the \nfuture within States. As a House Member, 10 years ago, I hosted a \nspeakers series that was the Chuck Colson speakers series, and I was \nable to spend time with him virtually every week for 2 or 3 months as \nwe had people come in and visit with House Members in a great speaker \nseries.\n  I personally benefited from lots of advice and discussions with him. \nJust to sum up a couple things about him as I reach a conclusion that \ndoesn't begin to express the impact he had on people's lives.\n  He founded Prison Fellowship Ministries in 1976. He founded Justice \nFellowship in 1983. They have both grown to serve literally thousands \nof prisoners in this country and around the world. Prisons around the \nworld saw Chuck Colson walk into them as well to try to help people.\n  In 1993, he won the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion; in \n1994, he was instrumental in drafting the publication and publishing a \ndocument called the ``Evangelicals and Catholics Together.'' In 2008, \nhe was awarded the Presidential Citizen Medal by President George W. \nBush, and he is survived by a family who cared about him and lots of \nfriends.\n  For almost 40 years, starting with the Mike Wallace interview--as I \nsuppose only Mike Wallace could interview someone--there were doubters \nand skeptics who questioned his faith, who questioned the change in his \nlife beginning in 1973, but of course, they questioned it less so every \nyear. I would say, in 2012, that Chuck Colson passed any test about \nwhom he had become. The test is both past, P-A-S-T, and passed, P-A-S-\nS-E-D. He won the race. Lives continue to be changed, and I would just \nsay, I thank God for Chuck Colson, and I thank my good friend from \nVermont for giving me a few moments on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2595-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2595-S2596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY STATE REPRESENTATIVE DANNY FORD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand before you today to call \nattention to the great service of my dear friend, State Representative \nDanny Ford of Mt. Vernon, KY.\n  Danny was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives for the \nfirst time in 1982. He represents the 80th District, which for most of \nhis tenure has included the counties of Pulaski, Lincoln, and \nRockcastle, Danny's native county. However, Representative Ford has \ndecided his time in Frankfort, the State's capital, will end with his \ncurrent term. But based on the outstanding service to constituents he \nis known for, I say with confidence today that if Danny had decided to \nrun again he would have most assuredly won.\n  There are few men finer than Danny, a hard-working, honest family man \nand a devoted student of the State government process. An auctioneer \nand real-estate agent by trade, Danny has worked alongside members of \nhis family in their various Mt. Vernon businesses throughout his life. \nAs the grandson of a former Rockcastle county judge, he is most at home \nwhen he is at home, amongst the citizens of the 80th District whom he \ncares about so deeply.\n  Danny has said that ``the greatest part of my job has been helping my \nconstituents find their way through the mazes of State government.'' \nAnd that is exactly what Danny did. He believes in the philosophy of \nbeing attentive and accessible. No matter what, you could always count \non Danny to be ready and willing to listen to any and all of his \nconstituents' concerns.\n  Danny is truly a one-of-a-kind elected official. He has his own style \nof politicking that sets him apart from all the rest. He was known for \noperating in a low-key style because he felt that if you drew attention \nto yourself, you would become a distraction. Danny tried to stay out of \nthe spotlight, but that is not to say it was because he wasn't getting \nthings done.\n  He was able to push legislation that fixed key issues for the people \nof southeastern Kentucky. He helped to build interstates, repair \ninfrastructure, build the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame in Mt. Vernon, \nand pass legislation that would make police cruisers more safe for the \nofficer by adding cages separating the front and back seat. It is safe \nto say that Danny Ford truly cared about the people of the 80th \nDistrict.\n  During his time in the Kentucky House of Representatives, Danny held \nsuch titles as Republican floor leader from 1995 to 1998, Republican \nminority whip from 1993 to 1994, and now again in 2011. He also was the \nlongest serving Republican in the statehouse since 1900. Danny was \nlooked to as a leader by both sides of the aisle. His opinion was \ngreatly respected by the right and the left. And you can bet that when \nDanny Ford stood up to give a speech, every ear tuned in so as not to \nmiss a single word of his eloquent preacher-style delivery.\n  In one of Danny's final interviews with Kentucky Educational \nTelevision, Danny said that after he retires he would like to return to \nwork as an auctioneer, watch his grandson's basketball games, and spend \nmore time with his family. And it is my understanding that he will be \ncelebrating his 60th birthday on April 25. Happy birthday, Danny; I \ntruly wish you and your family all the best.\n  At this time I would like to ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to \njoin me in commemorating Kentucky State Representative Danny Ford for \nhis contributions to the citizens of the 80th District and the great \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Recently an article was printed in the Central Kentucky News \nhighlighting the distinctive achievements and honorable service of \nRepresentative Danny Ford during his time in public office. I ask \nunanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Central Kentucky News,\n                             Jan. 28, 2012]\n\n      Rep. Danny Ford Calling It Quits After 30 Years in Frankfort\n\n                           (By Todd Kleffman)\n\n       Even before the House had voted to approve the \n     redistricting plan that would reshape Danny Ford's 80th \n     District, the auctioneer from Mount Vernon grew wistful, \n     foreshadowing the end of his 30-year legislative career \n     before he announced his retirement.\n       As he was railing against the Democrats' redistricting plan \n     on the House floor, Ford took time to ``thank the people of \n     Lincoln County for allowing me to serve as their state \n     representative for all these past many years.''\n       After the plan--which basically removed Lincoln from the \n     80th District and replaced it with Casey County and pieces of \n     Madison--was approved, Ford let it be known that this would \n     be his last term, ending his run as the longest-serving \n     Republican in the statehouse since 1900.\n       ``That new district covers 125, 150 miles instead of 50 or \n     60,'' he said. ``It's going to be a lot more difficult to \n     serve.''\n       ``That has been the greatest part of this job, helping my \n     constituents find their way through the mazes of state \n     government,'' he said last week while spending the day with a \n     reporter at the Capitol.\n       Despite his lengthy time in office, Ford never became a \n     household name to folks outside Frankfort. That's due in part \n     to his own low-key style and the fact he toiled for the \n     minority party in the House, which is akin to being \n     invisible, even if you are part of the Republican leadership. \n     Ford currently serves as minority whip, a position he also \n     held in 1993 to 1994, and was his party's floor leader from \n     1995 to 1998. He is the senior member of the House Budget and \n     Appropriations Committee.\n       ``I try not to be out front too much. That's not my \n     style,'' Ford said. ``When you draw attention to yourself, \n     you become a distraction. Sometimes it's gentle persuasion \n     that can make a difference.''\n       Al Cross, the long-time political writer for the Courier-\n     Journal who now heads the Institute for Rural Journalism at \n     the University of Kentucky, has observed Ford in action \n     during all his time in Frankfort.\n       ``He has been like a lot of Republican representatives: \n     he's not that interested in government doing much, so he \n     didn't push a lot of legislation, and, being in the minority, \n     he wasn't interested in jumping through a lot of Democratic \n     hoops,'' Cross said. ``If you're not in the majority, there's \n     not a lot you can do.''\n       ``If you ask people around Frankfort, they'd probably \n     remember Danny most for\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\n     his speeches. He's a pretty good orator. When he gets up to \n     make a forceful speech, he reminds you of a revival preacher. \n     He's pretty eloquent in getting his points across.''\n       Ford's political acumen and communication skills were \n     evident at the beginning of his political career in 1981. He \n     was already established in his native Rockcastle County, \n     where his grandfather had been county judge and his family \n     operated a variety of businesses, including Ford Brothers \n     Inc., an auction and real-estate company that also has an \n     office in Pulaski County, a part of which comprises the 80th \n     District.\n       If he was going to win the seat in his first run for \n     political office, Ford figured he needed to step outside of \n     his comfort zone. He spent little time campaigning in \n     Rockcastle and Pulaski, focusing his effort almost entirely \n     on Lincoln County, where he was virtually unknown.\n       Daly Reed, a soil conservation agent who died in 1989, \n     greased Ford's path in Lincoln County. The two had only met \n     briefly the year before at a Republican function but formed \n     an alliance that Ford credits with launching his political \n     career.\n       ``We just hit it off. We went door-to-door, from 8 in the \n     morning to 8 at night,'' Ford recalled of that first campaign \n     with Daly. ``He knew everybody and their family tree. When \n     he'd introduce me, he'd say, `This is Danny Ford, my adopted \n     son.' ''\n       Ford carried Lincoln County that year and has been nearly \n     unchallenged ever since. Of 30 primary and general elections \n     that have passed since he first took office, Ford has only \n     faced opposition four times and only once failed to win \n     Lincoln. That was in 2002, when Stanford attorney Paul Long \n     won the battle on his home turf but couldn't overcome Ford in \n     Rockcastle and Pulaski.\n       ``I've been very fortunate,'' he said.\n       During the ensuing years in Frankfort, Ford said he took \n     most of his cues on bills to sponsor from people and events \n     in his district. He recalled a devastating crash that claimed \n     two lives in Rockcastle County when a man who had been \n     arrested for a DUI climbed over the backseat and commandeered \n     a state trooper's cruiser and drove it the wrong way on \n     Interstate 75. That led to legislation requiring all law-\n     enforcement vehicles to be equipped with cages, he said.\n       In the current session, Ford is sponsoring a bill to outlaw \n     the sale of so called ``bath salts,'' potent amphetamine \n     powders that people inhale to get high and thus often end up \n     in the hospital. Varieties of the product have been legally \n     sold at D Market in Crab Orchard and other places around \n     the state.\n       ``I've got a number of calls from Lincoln County that a lot \n     of kids are fooling with it,'' he said.\n       Ford is also pushing a bill that will make products \n     containing pseudoephedrine available by prescription only as \n     a way to curtail the state's epidemic methamphetamine abuse. \n     He is dead-set against a ballot measure to amend the \n     constitution to allow gambling.\n       ``I would hate to see our state revenue based on something \n     so volatile,'' he said of the expanded gaming issue. ``I'm \n     very concerned about the kind of influences that will be \n     trying to pass this thing.''\n       Taking a stance against gambling is right up Ford's alley. \n     He doesn't shy away from the socially conservative hot-button \n     battles against gambling, abortion, and gay marriage. His \n     front-and-center role in creating a constitutional amendment \n     to ban gay marriage and civil unions in Kentucky, which was \n     approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2004, was the most \n     intense experience in Frankfort, he said.\n       ``I was at the forefront of that issue; I was really \n     pushing for it. I was called a right-wing radical, a \n     homophobe,'' he recalled. ``But I'm comfortable standing up \n     for what I believe in.''\n       Representative Mike Harmon from the neighboring 54th \n     District that covers Boyle County said Ford's values, \n     experience and ability to work both sides of the aisle will \n     be missed.\n       ``Danny's a great guy, very conservative,'' Harmon said. \n     ``He fought for whatever concerned his district, whether it \n     was roads or water or whatever. He could probably have easily \n     won his new district. He was very well liked. There's always \n     going to be some challenges when you're in the minority, but \n     I think that he was respected by both sides.''\n       Ford said patience and a willingness to compromise are \n     necessary traits to be an effective legislator. It's \n     important not to commit to a position too soon, before \n     understanding both sides, he said, and sometimes it's a long \n     road to seeing a project completed.\n       As an example, Ford said the improvements to U.S. 150 from \n     Stanford to Mount Vernon began during Wallace Wilkinson's \n     administration in the late 1980s. ``They said they were going \n     to start it in Stanford, and I said I didn't care where we \n     started as long as we got it done. And we've just now gotten \n     it finished.''\n       Of all the governors he served under, Ford said he had the \n     most trouble with Wilkinson, the Casey County upstart who \n     surprised a field of better known Democrats in 1987. It was \n     Wilkinson's political strategist, James Carville, who later \n     went on to national fame as the architect behind Bill \n     Clinton's two runs for the presidency, who made Ford uneasy.\n       ``I never established much of a relationship with Governor \n     Wilkinson, but that was probably because I did not like James \n     Carville one bit,'' Ford said. ``He was the most wicked man \n     I've ever been around in my life.''\n       Ford arrived in Frankfort at the end of John Y. Brown's \n     term. Things have changed considerably since then, he said.\n       ``It was much more of a partying institution back then, a \n     lot of drinking and carousing and card playing. The \n     legislature is more sober-minded now, more conscientious \n     about doing its job.''\n       He credited Martha Layne Collins for Toyota, ``an industry \n     that changed this state forever.'' Of Brereton Jones, Ford \n     said, ``He was a straight shooter.'' He described Paul Patton \n     as ``very sincere. Nobody treated me more fair.'' Ernie \n     Fletcher, the only Republican, ``tried to help and got some \n     good things done,'' but was handcuffed by his minority \n     status. Beshear ``has been good to work with,'' Ford said.\n       After finishing this session and a possible special \n     session, Ford, who will be 60 in April, said he is looking \n     forward to working full-time with his son in the real estate \n     and auction business. His 30 years in the legislature have \n     earned him an annual pension of about $40,700, slightly less \n     than his highest salary as a representative--$41,039--which \n     he is being paid this year, according to the Kentucky \n     Legislators Retirement Plan.\n       He has no plans on getting involved in choosing his \n     successor in the 80th District, though he said he will \n     support someone who shares his conservative ideals if such a \n     candidate emerges.\n       When asked what advice for a long political career he might \n     whisper in the ear of the person who takes his place, Ford \n     kept it simple, in keeping with his style.\n       ``Be attentive and be accessible. I came into this with the \n     attitude of making sure I listened to what people had to say, \n     and now that I've been up here and experienced the \n     legislative process all these years, it's made me more that \n     way than ever. Just be accessible and available and listen.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2596-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2596-S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE HIGHLANDS CENTER FOR AUTISM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \ninnovative, beneficial, and truly essential organization in a quest to \nbetter understand and serve fellow Kentuckians diagnosed with autism: \nthe Highlands Center for Autism in Prestonsburg, Kentucky.\n  The Highlands Center for Autism is making great progress in an \nattempt to better comprehend the extent of a condition which many \npeople are unfamiliar with. Autism is a term used to describe complex \ndevelopmental brain disorders that young children are most likely to \nshow symptoms of during their first few years of life. The Centers for \nDisease Control has released a statistic that predicts 1 out of every \n90 children will be diagnosed with autism. Not even 10 years ago, fewer \npeople had ever heard of autism, and if they had, they probably didn't \nunderstand the full extent of it. Now with new cases being diagnosed \neach day, understanding autism is becoming increasingly more important.\n  Therefore, now more than ever, there is a need for contributions from \norganizations like the Highlands Center for Autism. The professional \nteam at the Highlands Center uses the breakthrough Applied Behavior \nAnalysis--ABA--method, which has been proven to dramatically reduce \nsymptoms and improve life quality. Dr. Shelli Deskins of Paintsville, \nKY, has experience working with the ABA method. She previously worked \nwith victims of post-traumatic stress disorder in Hazard, KY. Since her \ntenure began at the Highlands Center in January 2009, she has worked \nfervently to transform it into the successful organization it is today.\n  The truly one-of-a-kind Highlands Center is a private, year-round day \nschool that serves as a beacon of hope and respite for the students \nenrolled and their families. The Center operates on the ideal that all \nchildren deserve the opportunity to laugh and play to become healthy, \nhappy, and productive adults. The staff and volunteers provide an \noptimistic outlook for those enrolled, and provides their families with \nhome visits and frequent reports on each child's daily progress.\n  I am honored to be able to have the opportunity to stand before my \ncolleagues of the United States Senate and honor the tremendous work \nbeing done by the Highlands Center for Autism. It is inspiring to know \nthat an institution involved with making scientific strides such as \nthis is located in the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. I would like to \nthank those involved with the Highlands Center for Autism and \ncongratulate them for their unparalleled dedication and service to this \ncause.\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n  There was recently an article published in an eastern Kentucky \nmagazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, which gave the public a \nglimpse into the groundbreaking work being done by the Highlands Center \nfor Autism. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]\n\n                      Highlands Center for Autism\n\n       Kathy sits almost still at her desk as her teacher writes a \n     word on an erasable pad, shows it to Kathy and says, \n     ``wagon.'' The 8-year-old little girl looks at the word and \n     repeats, ``wagon.'' ``Good saying `wagon!' '' her teacher \n     praises.\n       Five-year-old Jerry sways a bit back and forth, making \n     noises his teacher doesn't understand. ``Use your iPad to \n     tell me what you want,'' she softly tells him. He points to \n     icons on the device's screen and the words I WANT A DRINK OF \n     WATER appear. ``Good making a sentence!'' she compliments.\n       Kathy and Jerry are students at the Highlands Center for \n     Autism, and there is more than one amazing achievement going \n     on here. It is amazing that Kathy is able to sit still and to \n     read; it is amazing that Jerry is able to communicate his \n     needs, and it is truly a miracle that the Center exists at \n     all.\n       Autism is a term used to describe a group of complex \n     developmental brain disorders that typically appear during \n     the first three years of life. Very skilled professionals \n     often can see autism signs as early as six months, but \n     children are often not diagnosed until 12 to 18 months, and \n     many times much later. Symptoms manifest a wide spectrum of \n     behaviors impacting development of social interaction and \n     communication skills. Every individual is affected \n     differently. Many need to be taught what most people consider \n     basic behaviors--nodding yes or no, making eye contact, \n     eating with utensils, playing, potty training.\n       As recently as 10 years ago, the majority of people were \n     completely unaware of the condition. Today, however, public \n     awareness has risen as more children are being diagnosed, \n     dramatically increasing the number of affected families. \n     According to the Centers for Disease Control, one out of \n     every 90 children will be diagnosed with autism. There is no \n     known cause or cure, and children do not ``outgrow'' it, but \n     research has shown that early intervention using Applied \n     Behavior Analysis (ABA) has a dramatic impact on reducing \n     symptoms and improving life quality.\n       A major problem with achieving that crucial early \n     intervention is a lack of facilities providing help, \n     especially in communities outside major metropolitan areas. \n     Even getting into a diagnostic program can take a year or \n     longer. Many families who can afford it move near a treatment \n     center in order to get help for their children.\n       In early 2008, a group of local families approached \n     Highlands Health System with the idea of forming a \n     partnership to establish a local center for ABA treatment for \n     their children who had been diagnosed with autism. They had \n     been primarily on their own, searching first for a diagnosis \n     of what was happening to their children and then, after \n     diagnosis, seeking treatment. They knew that ABA is a proven, \n     evidence-based treatment with decades of solid scientific \n     research supporting its effectiveness.\n       After their meeting with the parents and additional \n     research revealing that a research-based program specifically \n     for children diagnosed with autism did not exist anywhere in \n     or near Kentucky, Highlands was prompted to move toward \n     fulfilling this need. Their research also indicated that the \n     Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Center for Autism offered one of the \n     most prestigious treatment programs in the country. After a \n     visit to the Clinic by a group of representatives, Highlands \n     was ready to work towards establishing the first program of \n     its kind in Kentucky.\n       A community meeting revealed an astonishing amount of \n     support from local families, schools, health departments, \n     social-service agencies and government officials, leading to \n     Highlands entering into a consulting agreement in September \n     of 2008 with the Cleveland Center for Autism to work toward \n     the goal of ``mirroring'' Cleveland's program in \n     Prestonsburg.\n       Highlands owned an apartment building near the hospital \n     which became the Center's facility. Next began the search for \n     a director for the program. Another one of those ``miracles'' \n     happened when they found Dr. Shelli Deskins, a Paintsville \n     native who was working in Hazard treating children with post-\n     traumatic stress disorder and who had an impressive \n     educational background and experience in ABA.\n       Dr. Deskins was approached by the hospital in November of \n     '08. She began at Highlands in January of '09 as the Center's \n     only employee and with her office in a former elevator shaft \n     in the main hospital building! Aided by Karen Sellers, \n     assistant to Highlands's president, Dr. Deskins set about \n     creating the Center for Autism. She did everything from \n     helping with facility renovation, writing and establishing \n     procedures, ordering supplies, interviewing and hiring staff, \n     finding children anything necessary to create an outstanding \n     and one-of-its-kind, facility-based treatment center. Even \n     though she was already trained in ABA and had a doctoral \n     degree, she also spent six weeks at Cleveland's Center to \n     thoroughly absorb their program's procedures.\n       From the beginning, Dr. Deskins and Highlands have insisted \n     that the Center be ``The Best,'' with no shortcuts or cutting \n     corners. The original staff went to the Cleveland Clinic for \n     two weeks to train in the Clinic's methods and learn their \n     procedures, and Cleveland staff members followed them back to \n     Prestonsburg to help open the Center. The Highlands Center \n     staff continues with follow-up training periodically. The \n     children at Highlands receive one-on-one attention from the \n     highly trained and dedicated instructors. Dr. Deskins says \n     staff members know very quickly if working with children \n     diagnosed with autism is something they want to do.\n       The Center for Autism is a private, year-round day school \n     and has seven students enrolled at this time, but expects to \n     be at their capacity of 10 by summer. Currently, the children \n     range in age from 3 to 14, and include students whose \n     families have moved here from Alabama, Virginia, and Texas.\n       The Highlands Center is not a place where you can drop off \n     your child to be ``fixed'' it requires total commitment from \n     the parents. Home visits are made by Dr. Deskins and each \n     child has a data book recording daily progress. Home \n     communication notes are sent home on a daily basis.\n       The Center is guided by the principle that all children \n     deserve the opportunity to laugh and play and to become \n     healthy, happy, and productive adults. The Highlands Center \n     for Autism is well on its way to becoming a regional and \n     national resource for the diagnosis and treatment of children \n     with autism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2597-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2597-S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING STACEY SACHS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at its best, the Senate is an extended \nfamily--we spend an unbelievable amount of time working here, Senator \nto Senator, staff to staff. And in the course of those efforts, we get \nto know each other not as members of a party or as ideological \ncaricatures or cutouts but as people. In particular, we get to know and \nappreciate on a personal level not just our staff but the staffs of our \nState delegations. There are staffers from the Massachusetts delegation \nwho have been here as long as I have. And certainly on my late \ncolleague Ted Kennedy's staff there were professionals I knew as \nfriends and turned to as easily as Teddy himself did for so many years.\n  That is why I know Ted himself would be here this morning doing what \nI am doing in his place, which is acknowledging with sadness the \npassing on Saturday, April 21 of Stacey Sachs--a longtime health care \nstaffer for Ted--whom we lost to complications from a hard-fought \nbattle with cancer. Stacey was just 50 years old.\n  For many of us, Stacey was a steady and unchanging sight in this \never-changing institution. She spent more than a decade on Capitol Hill \nas senior health counsel on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, HELP, Committee. She came to the Hill to play a role in \nmaking universal health care reform a reality; her life's work--as it \nwas for Ted--is a legacy she leaves behind that should be a gift to \nlast.\n  But it is not her only legacy. Over the years, I came to know Stacey, \nand I came to know firsthand so much of what impressed and inspired her \nfriends and her colleagues: her health care expertise, her honesty, and \nher dedication. She devoted her career to making sure Americans had \naccess to health care coverage. It was that simple. For her, that work \nwas personal. It was not statistics or spreadsheets or the arcane \nminutiae of legislation. For Stacey, she cared first and foremost about \nthe effect public policy has on everyday Americans, and she touched the \nlives of countless people who never met her. But every American, in \npart, can thank her for real changes that made their lives better.\n  I am not just talking about legislation, but I could be. Stacey's \noutsized role in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and the \nrecently enacted Affordable Care Act of 2010 were just two examples of \nthe ways she focused and made a real difference on a wide range of \nissues during her time on the HELP Committee. She worked on Medicare \nprescription drugs, Medicare reimbursement, health insurance coverage \nand reimbursement, Medicaid, the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In \neach instance and every effort, Stacey brought to the task at hand not \njust her policy expertise but her compassion and professionalism. The \nsame could be said about an effort that came\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nto be associated with Ted Kennedy and then-Governor Romney but with \nwhich Stacey was unbelievably engaged: the development of the \nMassachusetts health reform law in 2006. That law provided the \nCommonwealth with the highest rates of health care coverage in the \nNation and served as the blueprint for national health reform. While \nthe rate of the uninsured grew by millions in our country, today in \nMassachusetts, 98.1 percent of our residents have health insurance, \nincluding 99.8 percent of our children. And if Ted Kennedy were here \ntoday, I know he would share with all of us that without Stacey, it \nwouldn't have gotten across the finish line.\n  Still, there was more to Stacey than big legislation. She saw \ngovernment and public service not just with a human face but on a human \nscale. Despite the breadth of her legislative portfolio, Stacey became \nmost widely known among fellow staffers, constituents, and friends for \nher ability and willingness to help individual patients identify and \nsecure the personal health care services they desperately needed in \ntimes of crisis. She was the person you turned to when someone could \nnot find the right doctor, reach the right specialist, or make an \ninsurance company do the right thing. And whether that person was from \nMassachusetts or Montana, Stacey fought for them with the same ferocity \nas she would have for Ted Kennedy or for the most landmark piece of \nlegislation because for Stacey Sachs, it was pretty fundamental--if you \nwere in government to solve big problems for the whole country, why \nwouldn't you work equally hard to solve those problems for the average \nperson who came to you looking for help?\n  Mr. President, as so many know, after Senator Kennedy passed away, \nStacey continued her Senate service working for Chairman Harkin on the \nHELP Committee.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 26th Alcohol \nAwareness Month this April, sponsored by the National Council on \nAlcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc., NCADD. Since 1987, NCADD has been \nworking to raise public awareness and understanding of alcoholism, \nspecifically to reduce the stigma associated with alcoholism, which too \noften prevents individuals and families from admitting abuse and \nfinding resources to help.\n  According to NCADD, more than 18 million individuals, or 8.5 percent \nof Americans, suffer from alcohol-use disorders. In addition to those \ndirectly affected by alcohol, there are millions more who feel the \neffects of alcohol abuse by a loved one in their everyday lives--\nspouses, children, other family members, and friends. The prevalence of \nalcohol abuse in this country is astounding, with one out of every four \nU.S. children having been exposed to alcohol-use disorders in their \nfamily.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of alcoholism is that it often has \nsevere effects on those closest to the person addicted and their \ncommunity. It takes an enormous emotional, physical, and financial toll \non the family members of those addicted to alcohol. Statistics show \nthat 75 percent of domestic abuse is committed while one or both \nmembers are intoxicated, and family members utilize health care twice \nas much as families without alcohol problems.\n  This year's theme, ``Healthy Choices, Healthy Communities: Prevent \nUnderage Drinking,'' is meant to draw particular attention to the \nsevere impact that alcohol and alcohol-related problems have on young \npeople, their friends, their families, and as a result, our \ncommunities. Underage drinking is quickly becoming a serious concern in \nmy home State of Hawaii, and across the country.\n  Alcohol is currently the No. 1 drug of choice for America's young \npeople, higher than tobacco, marijuana, or other illicit drugs. Teens \nwho begin drinking before age 15 are four times more likely to develop \nalcoholism than their peers who wait until the age of 21. \nUnfortunately, underage drinking is getting worse with 7,000 kids in \nthe United States under the age of 16 taking their first drink each \nday, which costs the Nation an estimated $62 billion annually.\n  To combat this deepening problem and curb these disturbing trends, \neducation, awareness, and prevention programs, like the events going on \nthis month, are critically important. In addition, parents can help to \nreduce their children's risk of problem drinking by simply educating \ntheir kids and keeping a more watchful eye on them, especially as they \nenter middle schools and high school.\n  As we continue to observe this year's Alcohol Awareness Month, I urge \neveryone to take an active role in reducing the incidence of underage \ndrinking across the country: do not contribute to events where minors \nand alcohol are involved without supervision, be aware of your \ninfluence on the children close to you, and encourage minors to stay \nalcohol free. Together, we can all help to reverse recent trends in the \nUnited States and keep our children from the harmful, lasting effects \nof alcohol abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2598-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2598-S2599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DR. RELLA P. CHRISTENSEN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I am honored today to be able to pay \ntribute to a truly remarkable woman, and world-renowned dental \nconsultant--Dr. Rella P. Christensen. Appropriately, at its 35th \nAnniversary Celebration in Las Vegas, on May 18, 2012, the Board of \nDirectors of the CR Foundation will honor the life's work of Dr. \nChristensen.\n  Born on September 27, 1938, Rella received a Bachelor of Science in \nDental Hygiene from the University of Southern California in 1960, and \npracticed dental hygiene for more than 25 years. She established and \nbecame the Director of the Bachelor's Degree in Dental Hygiene at the \nUniversity of Colorado in 1970. Later, in 1986, she earned a PhD in \nphysiology, with an emphasis on microbiology, from Brigham Young \nUniversity and completed a post-graduate course in anaerobic \nmicrobiology at Virginia Polytechnic State University.\n  Rella co-founded Clinical Research Associates, now known as the CR \nFoundation, in 1976 with her husband Gordon, a world renowned and \nrespected dentist and educator. For 27 years Rella directed this \ninfluential dental products testing institute as a full time volunteer. \nHer additional responsibilities included being the lead researcher and \nEditor-in-Chief of the CRA Newsletter which was published in 10 \nlanguages under her leadership with a worldwide circulation in 92 \ncountries.\n  She went on to serve as Chairman of CR's Board of Directors for 2 \nyears. Currently she volunteers as the team leader of Technologies in \nRestoratives and Caries Research section of CR.\n  Rella has been a steady, humble, but significant influence in the \nprofession of dentistry, worldwide, for over a third of a century. \nHelping others in dentistry to find tools and concepts that really work \nis a passion for Rella. She has presented over one thousand dental \ncontinuing education programs, totaling over 5,200 hours, at national \nand international locations. Guided by her research discoveries, \nlectures, and writings, dentists are better able to secure their own \nprofessional development and understanding of materials, methods, \ndental products, and their own dental missions.\n  Dr. Rella Christensen has received numerous honors for her commitment \nto her field. In 2001 she was selected as the Distinguished Alumnus of \nBrigham Young University's School of Life Sciences, and now serves on \nits National Advisory Board.\n  In 2002 Rella received an Honorary Doctorate from Utah Valley State \nUniversity. In 2011, Rella was named one of the Dental Products Report \n``Top 25 Women in Dentistry'' and one of the\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\n``30 Leaders in Dentistry'' by Takacs Learning Center. In 2012, she was \nnamed ``Most Influential Researcher'' by Dr Bicuspid.com, an online \nprofessional publication.\n  As one of dentistry's great leaders, it is with great respect, \ngratitude, admiration, and affection that I pay tribute to Dr. Rella P. \nChristensen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2599-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN CROWLEY MEUB\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to Carolyn Meub, Executive Director of Pure Water for the \nWorld, a Vermont-based nonprofit organization that brings clean water \nto thousands of families in Honduras and Haiti.\n  Last week, the White House honored Carolyn as one of 10 Rotary Club \nmembers from across the country who are improving the lives of others \nthrough volunteer work. Carolyn has transformed Pure Water for the \nWorld from a small Rotary club project into an effective international \nNGO. Under her leadership, the organization is implementing a \nsustainable model for clean water programs by building clean water \nfiltration systems, providing hygiene education, and installing \nlatrines to improve sanitation. Twenty-thousand Honduran families now \nhave access to clean drinking water, and 1,200 schools in Haiti have \nclean water systems and hygiene education curriculums, because of Pure \nWater for the World. That is no small feat.\n  As Carolyn points out, clean water is a tap away for most Americans, \nbut for more than three-quarters of a billion of the world's people \naccessing safe water is a daily struggle. The United Nations reports \nthat 3.5 million people die each year from diseases related to drinking \ncontaminated water.\n  In February, my wife Marcelle visited Port-au-Prince as part of a \ndelegation I led with five other Members of Congress, where she saw \nfirsthand the simple, inexpensive household water filtration systems \nbeing built and donated by Pure Water for the World. Each unit, the \nsize of an office water cooler and made of concrete or plastic, is \nfilled with layers of sand and gravel that trap microorganisms as the \nwater passes through. This process of slow sand filtration is \ninexpensive and produced from local materials, making it ideally suited \nfor developing countries.\n  Pure Water for the World is doing important and inspiring work, \nproviding sustainable sources of safe drinking water and promoting \nhabits to improve health and sanitation in poor communities in Honduras \nand Haiti. I am very proud that Carolyn received this well-deserved \nrecognition at the White House on behalf of her organization. We all \nappreciate the work they are doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Rutland Herald article entitled \n``Hope flows: Vt. nonprofit pours `Pure Water for the World' '' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Mar. 18, 2012]\n\n      Hope Flows: Vt. Nonprofit Pours ``Pure Water for the World''\n\n                          (By Kevin O'Connor)\n\n       Rutland resident Carolyn Crowley Meub didn't fret when her \n     hometown turned on its faucets two weeks ago to find, due to \n     a water main break, the usually clean stream down to a dirty \n     trickle. She was flying off to the Caribbean--specifically, \n     to Haiti, where the situation is even worse.\n       Meub is one of several prominent Vermonters who've recently \n     witnessed the problems of the earthquake ravaged island--and \n     the solutions of the Green Mountains-based nonprofit Pure \n     Water for the World, which is aiming to pour hope across \n     hemispheres to mark United Nations World Water Day on \n     Thursday.\n       For most Americans, clean water is a tap away. But 1 \n     billion people worldwide drink from contaminated springs and \n     streams, the United Nations reports, while 3.5 million people \n     die each year from related diseases.\n       State Rep. Margaret Cheney, D Norwich, joined her husband, \n     U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, D Vt., in a February tour of the \n     Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, where, between a \n     congressional delegation's visits with the country's \n     president and actor Sean Penn's relief organization, she saw \n     the water challenge firsthand.\n       ``It's the poorest, most chaotic scene in the world,'' \n     Cheney says of crowded slums equipped with little more than \n     rain barrels. ``The water can be the unknown bearer of \n     terrible diseases. Catch them and you can't work, you can't \n     go to school, you can't really function.''\n       Organizations like the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development are working to help densely populated areas of \n     the globe that report 75 percent of the problem. But that \n     leaves more than 250 million people without potable water in \n     remote rural settings. Enter Vermont's Pure Water, which is \n     installing simple, inexpensive household filters in \n     developing countries in the Caribbean and Central America.\n       Dr. Noelle Thabault, a Burlington native, graduated from \n     the University of Vermont College of Medicine before \n     practicing in Rutland. After a magnitude 7.0 earthquake \n     decimated Haiti in 2010, she flew to Port-au-Prince as a Pure \n     Water volunteer and now serves as its deputy regional \n     director.\n       ``I recognized the role that lack of clean water plays in \n     illness,'' Thabault recalls of her knowledge before arriving, \n     ``but I had no understanding of the scope of the problem.''\n       Two years in the trenches, Thabault recently hosted Cheney \n     and Marcelle Leahy, wife of U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D Vt. \n     The doctor told them that more than 40 percent of Haitians \n     live without clean water, leading to diseases that are the \n     country's second leading cause of death and fill more than \n     half of all hospital beds with patients suffering from \n     bacteria or parasites.\n       ``Clean water is so necessary,'' says Marcelle Leahy, \n     herself a nurse. ``But Haiti unfortunately was lacking a lot \n     of the necessities of everyday life even prior to the \n     earthquake.''\n       Most U.S. municipalities filter water at central reservoirs \n     and then distribute it through pipes. But that doesn't work \n     in Caribbean and Central American villages with more poverty \n     than plumbing. Cheney and Leahy visited a Pure Water plant \n     that manufactures the kind of ``slow sand'' household filters \n     used in New England for its first 150 years.\n       Pure Water taps the sand system because it costs as little \n     as $150 to produce, install and monitor; requires no moving \n     parts or electricity; and can be built with locally available \n     materials. Each unit, shaped of concrete or plastic and sized \n     like an office water cooler, is filled with several layers of \n     sand and gravel. Pour in water, and the mixture traps \n     microorganisms that, in turn, decompose other organic \n     material.\n       Water that passes through the filter is clear in color, \n     taste and smell. More importantly, it's rid of up to 90 \n     percent of toxins, 97 percent of fecal coliform bacteria and \n     100 percent of worms and parasites.\n       ``It's such a clever, simple concept, and it works,'' Leahy \n     says. ``You're employing people, they're earning a living and \n     improving their health.''\n       Cheney, for her part, was equally impressed by Pure Water \n     posters written in Creole that explain the importance of \n     proper hand-washing, hygiene and waste disposal.\n       ``They're providing really simple tools and educational \n     efforts--the common-sense Vermont way--to help make this \n     sustainable,'' Cheney says. ``They have a great banner that \n     says, `Clean water is medicine.' We take it so for granted, \n     but that's the basic key to recovery.''\n       Pure Water bubbled up two decades ago after Brattleboro \n     dentist Peter Abell traveled to El Salvador and saw people \n     drinking dirty water that caused diarrhea, cholera and \n     dysentery. Abell's local Rotary club went on to raise money \n     to provide clean water in El Salvador and later Honduras, \n     then incorporated its volunteer efforts into the Pure Water \n     nonprofit, which Meub has headed from Rutland for the past 10 \n     years.\n       Pure Water so far has spent at least $5 million on projects \n     to provide safe drinking water--a comparatively small sum \n     compared with the $20 billion a year the United Nations \n     estimates it would cost to provide clean water to everyone on \n     the planet. But as Meub notes, helping one family, one \n     school, one community at a time, ``many drops of water \n     eventually fill a bucket.''\n       Americans, for their part, annually spend billions on \n     store-bought bottled water. Consider what Rutlanders were \n     willing to pay after the city's recent main break. As Meub \n     was packing for her trip, husband William Meub fielded calls \n     from fellow residents wondering how many hours they'd lack \n     water. He recalled his own travels to Haiti after the \n     earthquake.\n       ``They let me take a shower with a yogurt container full of \n     water,'' the lawyer says. ``It's a whole different experience \n     than anyone here has any familiarity with.\n       That's why Pure Water is streaming its message (the latest: \n     Gov. Peter Shumlin will promote World Water Day this week \n     with a proclamation) through Facebook, Twitter and the \n     website purewaterfortheworld.org.\n       Says Carolyn Meub: ``Safe drinking water should be a basic \n     human right.''\n       And Thabault: ``All other interventions--the rebuilding of \n     roads and schools and hospitals and communities--will not \n     result in a long-term sustainable improvement if people don't \n     have clean water. People need to support organizations that \n     are bringing clean water, hygiene education and sanitation to \n     homes and schools. That's how they can help.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/23/senate-section/article/S2599-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2599-S2600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   WISCONSIN COMMUNITY SERVICES, INC.\n\n Mr. KOHL.

I am proud to honor its \nservice and recognize that the many ways this organization has \ncontributed to the State of Wisconsin.\n  WCS is the State's oldest and largest nonprofit criminal justice \nsystem organization. Founded in 1912 as the Wisconsin Society of the \nFriendless, WCS has never faltered in its mission to provide innovative \nopportunities for individuals to overcome adversity. For 100 years, \nthis organization has provided individuals involved in or at risk of \nbecoming involved in the criminal justice system with the tools they \nneed to stay out of trouble and become productive members of their \ncommunities.\n  This organization provides more than 40 programs for Wisconsinites in \nneed. Through its outpatient clinic, for example, WCS provides mental \nhealth treatment and ancillary support such as housing assistance to \nmentally ill individuals who are at risk of entering or have already \nbeen incarcerated. Through its policy and workforce development \nprogram, WSC provides vocational training to individuals with criminal \nrecords and helps them secure jobs. With mental health treatment, \nhousing, and employment, these individuals can live crime-free lives \nand contribute to society.\n  With nearly 300 employees and serving more than 15,000 individuals in \n2011 alone, WSC continues to change the lives of individuals in need. \nWSC's longstanding efforts have helped lower recidivism rates and saved \ntaxpayer dollars, while giving Wisconsinites the tools and resources to \novercome challenges such as mental illness and substance abuse.
