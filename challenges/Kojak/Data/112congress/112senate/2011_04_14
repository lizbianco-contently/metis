Mr. President, yesterday, President Obama outlined \nwhat he is describing as a ``responsible'' approach to our Nation's \nfiscal problems. And my initial response to that characterization is \nthat, with all due respect,\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nthe American people are not inclined to take advice on fiscal \nresponsibility from an administration whose unprecedented borrowing and \nspending has done so much to create the mess we are in.\n  After 2 years of adding trillions to the debt and ignoring our \nNation's looming fiscal nightmare, the President may be right in \nthinking that the politically expedient thing to do is point the finger \nat others. But the truly responsible thing would be to admit that his \nown 2-year experiment in big government has been a disaster for the \neconomy and itself a major driver of our debt; and that his inaction on \nthe latter is the primary reason others have been forced to step \nforward and offer meaningful solutions of their own.\n  That is what most people already believe anyway. So the President's \nattempt to stake out the high ground in this debate was, I suspect, \nhard for many Americans to swallow.\n  Despite the President's imaginative account of how we arrived at the \nsituation we are in, the American people are well past the point of \nbelieving that Washington will be able to make good on all its promises \nif only we let the President and Democrats in Congress raise taxes.\n  Americans know that we face a fiscal crisis not because we tax too \nlittle but because we spend too much. They do not support the reckless \nWashington spending that has left us with record deficits and debt, and \nthey will not support raising taxes to preserve an unsustainable status \nquo. Besides, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have already \nrejected the kind of tax hike on small business that President Obama \nendorsed again yesterday. So it was counterproductive of him to revive \nit.\n  As for entitlements, the President rightly acknowledged that before \nwe know it, the government will spend every dime it takes in just to \ncover the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the interest \non our debt. What he did not say is that the health care bill he signed \nlast year takes more than half a trillion dollars out of Medicare to \npay for an entirely new entitlement that could be just as unsustainable \nas Medicare itself; and which forces nearly 20 million more Americans \ninto a Medicaid Program which, as currently arranged, is bankrupting \nour States.\n  So the President can claim to be a great defender of the social \nsafety net. He may claim to stand for a nobler vision of America than \nthose who disagree with him. But the facts speak for themselves. And \nwhen it comes to preserving the social safety net, the President's \nproposals simply do not address the things that have caused our most \ncherished entitlement programs to be unsustainable in the first place.\n  Instead, the President would simply tinker around the edges and leave \nthe hard work for others, passing the buck to future Presidents. And \nthat just won't cut it anymore.\n  Americans are paying attention. They know the fiscal problems we face \nwill not be solved by continuing the job-destroying policies that got \nus here. What is more, the centerpiece of the President's proposal, tax \nhike on top earners, may sound appealing to those whose primary goal in \nthis debate is to protect big government. But looking at the most \nrecent data, the Wall Street Journal points out this morning that even \nif we were to lay claim to every taxable dollar of every single \nAmerican who earns more than $100,000 a year, we still wouldn't raise \nenough to cover the $1.6 trillion deficit the President's budget gives \nus this year.\n  The best way to bring down the debt and to create the climate that \nwill lead to good private-sector jobs and prosperity is not to repeat \nthe policies of the past but to change them. And that means cutting \nWashington spending, not squeezing family budgets even more.\n  Throughout the day today, Senators will have an opportunity to debate \na down payment on those cuts for the rest of the current fiscal year. \nSo I invite them to come to the floor to discuss that proposal. After \nthat, we will move onto an even more far-reaching debate not about \nbillions but about trillions. That is the debate that will show \nAmericans exactly where their elected representatives stand on facing \nup to the fiscal challenges we face. Republicans look forward to that \ndebate.\n  That brings me to a final point.\n  Yesterday, the President said that the debate we have been having in \nWashington about the size and scope of government is not about numbers \non a page. It is about the kind of country we believe in. But he left \nout an important point. And that is, that there are a great many people \nin Washington and beyond who agree with him, but who also believe in \ntheir core that the approach he has taken over the past 2 years \nrepresents the greatest single threat to the very future he envisions. \nAmerica will not continue to be the great Nation it is unless we are \nable to keep our promises to the current and future generations, and \nstop spending money we do not have. But the greatest obstacle to that \nfuture is not the everyday American who wants Washington to balance its \ncheckbook, or those who look at where the President's policies have \ngotten us and map out a different path to the future than he would. The \ngreatest obstacle we face is the crushing burden of our debt, as the \nPresident now admits.\n  Unfortunately, the plan he outlined yesterday does not seriously \naddress it. Americans know the stakes in this debate. They know the \nreason we are in this situation. It is time the President and Democrats \nin Congress acknowledge it as well. The debate has shifted. And while \nthe President does not seem to see that yet, we will not solve our \nproblems until he stops campaigning and joins us in a serious, \nbipartisan effort to change not only his tone but his direction. That \nis how we will ensure that the future that he--and we--envision and \nwant actually comes about. That is the only chance we have.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a little later today we are going to \nreceive from the House of Representatives a spending bill which, if \npassed, will fund the government for the remainer of this fiscal year, \nwhich ends on September 30. Included in that vote today are two other \nvotes, separate votes, which were insisted on by the House Republicans. \nOne of the votes will defund Planned Parenthood across the United \nStates.\n  Under title X, a law which was proposed by President Nixon and passed \nby Congress--and supported for over 40 years since--we have provided \nmoney across America to clinics that take care of women, children, and \nfamilies who otherwise would have no place to turn.\n  One of the recipients of those funds is Planned Parenthood. They do \nnot receive all the funds or even a majority of the funds. But they do \nreceive support through title X. In my State of Illinois, Planned \nParenthood has clinics in many down-State communities, as well as in \nthe Chicagoland area. In my hometown of Springfield, there is a Planned \nParenthood clinic. It provides valuable services for many women in my \ncommunity and State--services which otherwise they could not find or \nafford: basic examinations by doctors who can screen for forms of \ncancer, for infectious disease. These are things which many women rely \non, and they are valuable services. Yet the House Republicans are \ndetermined to take the funding away from Planned Parenthood.\n  The amendment on the floor addresses that issue. I will vote against \nthat amendment, and I will vote against it because I understand closing \ndown Planned Parenthood as one of the recipients of title X funds will \nmean that literally 69,000 women in the State of Illinois who rely on \nPlanned Parenthood clinics will then have to struggle to find another \nsource of medical care, and it is not always easy to do it. Many of \nthese women--most of them--are uninsured and very few of them have the \neconomic wherewithal to pay for these services.\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\n  For over 90 years, Planned Parenthood has provided comprehensive \npreventive and primary health care to people, primarily the low-income, \nuninsured, and Medicaid recipients. Last year, 3 million people across \nAmerica--that is 1 percent of our population--relied on Planned \nParenthood's 800 health centers for cancer screenings, family planning, \nand annual exams.\n  Now the House Republicans are arguing we have to stop funding Planned \nParenthood because that is a way to prevent abortion. Well, let me say, \nwe have to understand that the law for over 30 years in America has \nmade it clear--an amendment offered by a Congressman from Illinois, \nHenry Hyde, made it clear--that no Federal funds can be used for \nabortion services except in the most extreme and restricted cases: \nrape, incest, or where the mother's life is at stake. That has been the \nlaw. It has not been changed. It was not changed under this President \nor previous Presidents. That has been, since the time of Henry Hyde, \nthe guiding policy of this land and there is no one to suggest that it \nbe changed. Every dollar received by Planned Parenthood from the \nFederal Government is carefully restricted so that it cannot be used \nfor abortion services.\n\n  Planned Parenthood does provide abortion counseling but only for 3 \npercent of their activities. Ninety-seven percent of their activities \nhave nothing to do with it, and not a penny of the abortion counseling \nservices can come from Federal funds except in the most restricted \ncircumstances under the Hyde amendment. Ninety percent of Planned \nParenthood's activities are basically preventive.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, if we don't allow women of limited means \nand with no insurance access to family planning counseling and \nservices, it means there will be more unintended pregnancies and, \nsadly, more abortions. It is estimated that if we did not have title X \nfunding in Illinois, if we didn't provide this kind of assistance for \nwomen in lower income categories, we would have 24 percent more \nabortions because of unintended pregnancies. So if what the House \nRepublicans are seeking to do is to reduce the number of abortions, \nthey are doing it exactly the wrong way. Providing information and \ncounseling to women so they can plan their families and not end up with \nunintended pregnancies is a good way to reduce the number of abortions. \nThat, to me, is as clear as possible. Yet they seem to be tied in knots \nwhen it comes to this and don't understand this basic causal \nconnection.\n  Last year, with the help of Federal dollars, Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers performed 1 million cervical exams, 800,000 breast \nexams, and 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted \ninfections such as HIV. If Planned Parenthood is prohibited from \nreceiving Federal funding, which is the issue that will be on the \nfloor, most of their health centers would be forced to close. Then what \nhappens to the millions of women and others across America who rely on \ntheir services?\n  Let me tell my colleagues one story that I think demonstrates why \nthis is a critical vote. It comes from a Planned Parenthood clinic in \nAurora, IL. A woman in her early forties was uninsured because she lost \nher job. Her daughter suggested she go to Planned Parenthood for her \nannual checkup. During the woman's routine breast exam, a 4 centimeter \nby 4 centimeter lump was found in her breast. That is a sizable lump. \nThe providers at Planned Parenthood helped the woman get a mammogram \nand connected her with an oncologist. Thankfully, the cancerous lump \nwas removed, and the woman recovered completely. That woman went back \nto the Aurora Planned Parenthood to thank them and to let them know \nthat without that care, she could have died. So when it gets down to \nthis vote, it literally is a matter of life and death.\n  I hope those who feel strongly about one issue or the other will also \nfeel strongly about the right of every person to have access to quality \ncare whether they are rich or poor. Planned Parenthood provides that \ncare in my State and across the Nation.\n  The other amendment is also going to relate to health care. I find it \nhard to believe that at this moment in time the Republicans are \nsuggesting we should repeal health care reform. This morning, we had a \ntown meeting, and in our town meeting was a group of young people who \ncame from Illinois and who are recovering or in treatment for cancer. \nThese are brave young children and young adults who are battling this \ndisease. I asked them, when someone suggested repealing health care \nreform, what they would think about a provision in health care reform, \nwhich we insisted on, which said that no health insurance company can \ndiscriminate against an American under the age of 18 for a preexisting \ncondition. Well, they all cheered because they know, having had cancer \nin their lives, if they go out on the open market, the cost of their \nhealth care and health insurance, if they can buy it, would be \nprohibitively expensive.\n  The health care reform we passed here prohibits health insurance \ncompanies from discriminating against those children under the age of \n18 for preexisting conditions. Those who want to repeal it basically \nwant to take away that protection.\n  We also know many families raising children of college age get \nworried because the kids may not have health insurance while they are \nlooking for jobs. We extend the family coverage of people up to the age \nof 27 so they can stay under their family policy when they get out of \ncollege. That gives peace of mind to a lot of families that as their \nyoung son or daughter is out taking a part-time job or internship or a \ntrip around the world, they are going to have health insurance until \nthe age of 27. Repealing the law, which is what we will vote on here on \nthe floor, will remove that protection.\n  Also, when it comes to Medicare, the prescription drug program has a \ngap in it called the doughnut hole. A lot of seniors with the need for \nexpensive prescription drugs find, after a few months, no coverage from \nthe government. They have to turn around and reach in their savings \naccount and pay out thousands of dollars before that protection \ncoverage resumes. That doughnut hole--the gap--is being closed by this \nbill. Those who want to repeal health care reform will repeal our \nefforts to make sure people have this access to the kind of health care \nand prescription drugs they need to survive and be strong and \nindependent.\n  I think it is a very clear vote. I have said before that I am open to \nrevisiting health care reform, reforming health care reform, making \nsure it works the way we intended it to work. As I have said before, \nthe only perfect law I am aware of was written on stone tablets and \ncarried down a mountain by Senator Moses. Every other effort since has \nbeen a human effort full of frailties and flaws, and we should always \ntry to make it better. But the notion of wiping the slate clean and \nrepealing health care reform would be a step backward for America. It \nwould acknowledge that the 60 million uninsured Americans will have \ntheir ranks swell from others who can't afford to pay for health \ninsurance and certainly can't buy good-quality health insurance today.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote no on this amendment to repeal \nhealth care reform. We don't need to leave so many American families \nvulnerable, but we do need to have protections against health insurance \ncompanies which too often discriminate against those who need \nprotection the most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2461-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2461-S2462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am a firm believer in the view that an \nindividual can make a difference. I am a firm believer that what \nhappens in Washington, DC, is important in our Nation's history and \nwhat goes on in our country, but the reality is we change the world one \nperson at a time. That individual is how we make life better.\n  Earlier this week, on Tuesday morning, I was on the National Mall \nnear the World War II Memorial, and I was there for the dedication of a \nplaque honoring an individual who made a tremendous difference in the \nlives of many and made a tremendous difference in the life of our \nNation. It was the moment in which a plaque was unveiled recognizing \nSenator Bob Dole for his contribution--in fact, his efforts and \nleadership--in seeing that the World War II Memorial was built. Clear\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nfrom those who spoke and from what I know of the subject, the World War \nII Memorial would not be available for us as a nation today in the \nabsence of that individual, Bob Dole, who led the efforts.\n  There is much in Bob Dole's career here in Washington, DC, as a \nMember of this body, of the U.S. Senate, that we can heap accolades \nupon him for, but certainly one of them I know he is most proud of and \ncertainly one of them I and the American people are most grateful for \nis his efforts to recognize the 16 million Americans who served their \ncountry in World War II. There are only about 2.5 million Americans who \nserved in World War II now living, and we lose hundreds of them every \nday.\n  Last week, I was at the World War II Memorial with Kansas World War \nII veterans welcoming an honor flight and thanking World War II \nveterans from my home State for their service to our country. The World \nWar II Memorial is a magnificent tribute to the sacrifice many have \nmade before us.\n\n  I saw the World War II Memorial. It serves its purpose. I saw the \nWorld War II Memorial before it was ever dedicated. I put my walking \nshoes on and walked down to the World War II Memorial a few days before \nthe official ceremony back in 2004, and I saw the place that says \n``Kansas,'' and I thought about Kansans.\n  I thought of my own dad, who is a World War II veteran who served in \nnorthern Africa and up the boothill of Italy. I tell this story because \nthe World War II Memorial served its purpose. I walked away from the \nmemorial and used my cell phone to call my dad back home in Plainville, \nKS. Unfortunately, I got the answering machine at my parents' home, but \nfrom a son's point of view, I conveyed the message to my dad: Dad, I am \nat the World War II Memorial. I respect you, I thank you for your \nservice, and I love you. It is something that sons don't often say to \ntheir parents, but it is something that we as Americans--something that \nthe World War II Memorial brings out in us not just to our parents but \nto all World War II veterans: We respect you, we thank you for your \nservice, and we love you.\n  We had the opportunity on Tuesday to pay tribute to a special World \nWar II veteran, Bob Dole. One of the aspects of Bob Dole's service to \nhis country certainly in the military as well as here in the Senate, \nhere as an American, was to take care of those who served with him, and \nnot only in World War II. He has been the caring and compassionate \nguide for all of us as we try to make certain that no military service \ngoes unrewarded and that no commitment that was made to those who serve \nour country is forgotten.\n  So I am here today to pay tribute really to all World War II \nveterans, to all our military men and women now serving, and to those \nveterans of other wars, but to especially pay tribute to Bob Dole, who \nrecognized and continues to recognize throughout his life the value of \nservice to country and the value of service to other veterans. That \nplaque is a special reminder that Bob Dole made it possible for all of \nus as Americans to pay tribute to that generation and is a loving \nreminder for those who served that we are a grateful nation. It is \nimportant that we never forget those who gave us the opportunities to \nlive the lives we live today.\n  While there are, again, much for which we could congratulate him and \nexpress our gratitude to him, I hold him in the highest esteem for his \nmilitary service.\n  Sixty-six years ago today, April 14, 1945, young Bob Dole was wounded \nin northern Italy. He lay on the field in blood and mud for 9 hours. He \nwas rescued. He was returned to home. The people of his hometown raised \nmoney. I still remember the photograph of a cigar box in the drugstore \ninto which people back in those difficult times put their dollars and \ntheir quarters and their pennies to raise money for Bob Dole's \nrehabilitation. He was able to access the services in Battle Creek, MI, \nof a VA hospital.\n  Amazingly to me, three future Senators who served in World War II \nended up in that hospital at the same time. Our own colleague Senator \nInouye, our previous colleague Senator Hart, and our previous colleague \nBob Dole were all at the hospital at the same time recovering from \ntheir wounds in service to their country.\n  So it is today that I recognize an aspect of Bob Dole's life--most \nimportant, his willingness to sacrifice his life and his service to his \ncountry as a member of the 10th Mountain Division; his courage and \ndedication to his ability to reteach himself, to relearn to write, to \nbathe, to eat, to become a productive member of our society, and to \nlead our country in so many ways. I was honored to be present on \nTuesday, 2 days ago, in which a grateful nation said: We thank you for \nyour efforts in recognizing other veterans, in the creation and \ndevelopment of the efforts to see that the World War II Memorial, so \nlong in waiting, is now on the National Mall.\n  Tom Brokaw, the author of the book ``The Greatest Generation,'' was \nthe master of ceremonies on Tuesday, and he concluded his remarks on \nTuesday morning by telling the story of Bob Dole raising money for the \nWorld War II Memorial. There are no public funds, no Treasury funds in \nthe building of that memorial. Senator Dole and others raised the \ndollars from private sources to build the memorial. He tells the story \nof Bob Dole going to California and meeting with a wealthy Hollywood \nmogul asking for money to build the World War II Memorial. According to \nTom Brokaw, the mogul said, ``I am not interested. I have other \npriorities.'' Bob Dole's response to the mogul, to the noncontributor, \nwas, ``When I was 22, I had other priorities too. I went to war.'' Bob \nDole went to war and served his country every day thereafter.\n  Senator Dole in his remarks concluded by saying, ``I am the most \noptimistic man in America today.'' We ought to be optimistic because we \nhave individuals such as Bob Dole who have served our country. Today we \nrecognize that service, 66 years ago, April 14, 1945, in northern \nItaly.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise, once again, to continue the \ntradition started in the last Congress by my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Delaware, Senator Kaufman, to recognize another great \nFederal employee.\n  I think this particular recognition is critically important, since \nlast week this Congress came to the brink, unfortunately, of shutting \ndown the Federal Government, which would have had a dramatic effect \nupon literally 800,000 Federal employees, many of whom toil tirelessly, \noftentimes in the proverbial vineyards, trying to serve the American \npeople. It is my hope that later today the House, and we in the Senate, \nwill pass what perhaps is an imperfect compromise--and every compromise \nis a bit imperfect--that will continue the operations of this Federal \nGovernment through the balance of the fiscal year. It is appropriate \nthat today we continue this tradition, where we single out for \nrecognition on the floor of this Senate one of the Federal employees \nwho continues to provide service to Americans.\n  The exemplary Federal worker I am referring to this week is Keith \nPrewitt, the Deputy Director and 27-year veteran of the U.S. Secret \nService. Mr. Prewitt is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day \noperations of the Secret Service, including its 6,700 employees, with a \nbudget of about $1.5 billion.\n  Mr. Prewitt also oversees protection of the President and the Vice \nPresident of the United States, as well as visiting heads of State. He \nhas an impressive resume that includes handling security during three \nPresidential campaigns, two White House details, and overseeing trips \nprotecting American officials in more than 110 countries.\n  Mr. Prewitt was first drawn to a life of public service when he was \nin high school in the 1960s in Memphis, TN. He met a local Memphis \npolice officer who had encouraged him to obey the city curfew, stay \nsafe and out of trouble. Mr. Prewitt said this police officer inspired \nhim to enter public service. Coincidentally, he went on to become a\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\nMemphis police officer following his graduation from college.\n  In 1983, the Secret Service recruited Mr. Prewitt to serve as a \nspecial agent in the Memphis field office. Over the years, he rose \nthrough the ranks of the Service. He has served both on the frontlines \nand in supervisory positions, which have led him to his leadership role \ntoday.\n  Mr. Prewitt is regarded by his peers as one of the best in the field. \nHe has been described as a man of high value and honor who views each \nday as a training day and is extremely dedicated to his work and loyal \nto the people who work with him.\n  One of his peers at the National Association of Black Law Enforcement \nOfficers stated that Mr. Prewitt ``identifies challenges for the \norganization and seeks to change the status quo to make things \nbetter.'' His tireless efforts to improve the performance of the Secret \nService have made him a true asset to the agency, the President, the \nVice President, and to our country.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Keith Prewitt, a truly \ngreat civil servant, and all those in the U.S. Secret Service for their \nhard work and dedication to our Nation.\n  It is also my hope that we can conclude the budget for the balance of \nthis fiscal year so we can give Mr. Prewitt, countless other Federal \nemployees, and literally millions of Americans who depend upon the \nongoing workings of the Federal Government, the confidence and respect \nthey need by passing the balance of the continuing resolution for this \nyear before we break for the Passover-Easter recess.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2463-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2463-S2468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I am voting no \non the budget deal later this afternoon.\n  First and foremost, I am voting no because I do not think this is a \nmeaningful, substantial start to getting our hands around what is the \nbiggest threat and potential crisis we face as a nation--out-of-control \nspending and debt. I suppose $38 billion is more of a cut than we have \never done. But if we put it in any other context, it is very modest \nindeed.\n  Take a look at the 8 days leading up to the announcement of this deal \nand those 8 days alone--barely more than a week. We as a nation racked \nup $54 billion of brandnew debt, way more than the $38 billion of cuts \nin just 8 days. That gives some perspective on exactly how modest and \nhow limited in meaning this is.\n  When you dig a little deeper to look at the details of the cuts, I am \nafraid the picture gets even worse. A lot of these cuts are paper cuts \nonly--only cuts on paper that do not have a meaningful impact in the \nreal world. There has been significant reporting about this. The \nJustice Department fund and other examples--that probably accounts for \n$12 billion or $13 billion of the cuts.\n  In addition, yesterday the CBO issued a report that said only 1 \npercent of those cuts--$350 million or so--would have an impact this \nfiscal year. All the rest is pushed off well into the future. Because \nof that, I am voting no. I think we need a much stronger start to \ngetting our fiscal house in order.\n  In addition, I am very concerned about what this budget deal \ncontinues to fund in terms of policy, in terms of impact on Americans' \nlives. The clearest example of that for me is the continuing funding of \nPlanned Parenthood. I believe it is morally wrong to end an innocent \nhuman life. I also believe it is morally reprehensible to take tax \ndollars of millions of pro-life Americans in order to fund \norganizations that do just that. Americans should not be forced to \nsubsidize abortions, much less fund our Nation's largest abortion \nprovider. That is what Planned Parenthood is, pure and simple.\n  Opponents of defunding Planned Parenthood have argued in the news and \neven on the Senate floor that the organization provides many other \nhealth care services other than abortions, such as mammograms. We have \nseen recently that is a big fiction. Planned Parenthood's CEO repeated \nthis assertion recently on news shows. She claimed:\n\n       If this bill ever becomes law--\n\n  Meaning the defunding of Planned Parenthood--\n\n     millions of women in this country are going to lose their \n     healthcare access--not to abortion services--to basic family \n     planning, you know, mammograms.\n\n  As I said, in recent days, this has been shown to be a huge fiction. \nLive Action, which is a pro-life group, recorded calls in the last \nseveral days to 30 Planned Parenthood clinics in 27 States. In each \nconversation, a woman calls in and asks if she can schedule an \nappointment for a mammogram. And in each conversation, without \nexception, the Planned Parenthood representative tells her they do not \nprovide mammograms. Period. One staffer admits:\n\n       We do not provide those services whatsoever.\n\n  Another explains:\n\n       We actually don't have a mammogram machine at our clinics.\n\n  The staffer at Planned Parenthood in DC was perhaps clearest. She \nsaid:\n\n       We do not provide mammograms . . . we don't deal with the \n     health side of it so much. We're mostly a surgical facility.\n\n  By the way, surgery means one thing: abortion.\n  This Planned Parenthood staffer is exactly right: 98 percent of their \nservices to pregnant women constitute abortions--98 percent.\n  This chart lays this out very clearly. This pie chart represents 2009 \nPlanned Parenthood services to pregnant women. The universe of services \nto pregnant women, abortions is in dark red, 98 percent. Adoption \nreferrals is in blue. I apologize if you cannot see that. The sliver is \nthat tiny. You have to be up close. And all other prenatal care is in \ngreen. That is the reality of Planned Parenthood.\n  We have also seen a recent onslaught of ads that claim Planned \nParenthood is simply a leading provider of women health services, but \nabortion accounts for roughly one-third of the $1 billion generated by \nits clinics. In fact, Planned Parenthood's annual report acknowledges \nit provides primary care to 19,700 of its 3 million clients. Number of \nclients: 3 million; those to whom it provided primary health care: \n19,700.\n  The provision to cut title X funding for health services, such as \nbreast cancer screenings, HIV testing, counseling, and other valuable \nfamily planning services, would not block funding for those services at \nnonabortion providers. It would simply block funds from subsidizing \nAmerica's largest abortion provider, and abortion is almost everything \nPlanned Parenthood does.\n  Furthermore, Medicaid spends $1.4 billion on family planning each \nyear. Not $1 of those funds would be affected by this resolution and \nthis proposal. The question we face today is not if family planning and \nwomen's health services will be provided but, instead, if we are going \nto use that as an excuse to fund the biggest abortion provider in the \ncountry which does little else.\n  Although I personally believe abortion is not a right guaranteed by \nthe Constitution, I recognize the sad reality that abortion on demand \nis legal in this country. Again, this debate is not about that. It is \nnot about whether Planned Parenthood has the right to perform \nabortions, and it is not about funding true health care services. The \nquestion before us is whether millions of pro-life taxpayers have to \nfund this entity.\n  Every year since 2000, the government has increased its funding of \nPlanned Parenthood on average $22.2 million per year. As a direct \nreflection of that, the number of abortions they perform has \ndramatically increased, even though the overall abortion rate, thank \nGod, in the United States has declined until 2008.\n  This chart lays out the situation clearly. What is in green \nrepresents government grants and contracts to Planned Parenthood. It \nhas consistently gone up and up, a significant increase virtually every \nyear. What is in red represents abortions by Planned Parenthood. Very \ninteresting. There is\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nvirtually the same slope of an increase, while at the same time for \nthis entire period until 2008 abortions nationwide were actually going \ndown.\n  I do not understand how anyone can look at this and say there is not \na connection, say we are not using taxpayer dollars to promote and fund \nabortion. This notion that it is not used directly for abortion \nservices is a convenient fiction because it is a shell game, because \nit, in fact, funds Planned Parenthood, and 98 percent of what they do \nis about abortion.\n  According to their latest annual report, Planned Parenthood boasted \nmore than $363 million in taxpayer funding, the same year it performed \nan unprecedented 324,000 abortions.\n  Planned Parenthood's abortion rate massively outpaces its adoption \nreferrals in particular. In 2008, a woman entering a Planned Parenthood \nclinic was 134 times more likely to have an abortion than to be \nreferred for an adoption.\n  In fact, this final chart shows that as Planned Parenthood's abortion \nrate steadily increased to that staggering number of 332,000 in 2009, \nits adoption referrals actually decreased to 977 that same year. So \nagain, abortions are in deep red, adoption referrals are in blue, and \nall other prenatal care is in green. What is the reality, what is the \nhistory, what are the facts? Abortions go up dramatically in Planned \nParenthood, prenatal services go down, and adoption services go down as \nabortions go up.\n  Planned Parenthood has made a profit every year since 1987, including \na $63.4 million return in 2009. There is no justification for \nsubsidizing Planned Parenthood's profitable venture with taxpayer \ndollars, particularly when roughly half or more of those taxpayers \ndeeply disagree with abortion. The sanctity of human life is a \nprinciple Congress should proclaim at every opportunity, and the time \nhas come to respect the wishes of so many millions of Americans who \nhave adamantly opposed using taxpayer dollars for abortions by denying \nall Federal funding to this abortion machine.\n  This is a social issue, of course. It is also a fiscal issue. Our \nFederal budget is out of control. We are facing unsustainable debt. So \ngiven that, in particular, isn't it time to stop funding an \norganization that millions of Americans have fundamental problems with? \nIf our Federal Government has any hope of regaining fiscal restraint, \nwe have to make significant cuts--more significant than are being \nproposed in the deal before us today.\n  I refuse to believe that Planned Parenthood is the one sacred cow \nthat should stand untouched and be untouchable. The time has come to \nchange this situation and to respect the wishes of the huge majority of \nAmericans who, whether they are pro-life or prochoice, think taxpayer \ndollars should not subsidize abortion. And that is clearly what is \ngoing on with Planned Parenthood.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so amazed that the lies that have \nbeen stated about Planned Parenthood on this floor have been repeated \nagain and again. You know, it gets pretty bad when you are so \noutrageous that Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart start to look at what \nyou are saying on the Senate floor. That is a rarity.\n  This all started when Senator Kyl took to the floor and said that 90 \npercent of what Planned Parenthood does is abortions. Well, that was a \nlittle bit wrong. Ninety percent of what Planned Parenthood does is \nhealth care--no abortions. As a matter of fact, it is 97 percent. And \nevery dollar of Federal funds that goes to health care may not, since \nthe 1970s--not one slim dime--go toward abortion.\n  Senator Vitter upped that just now and says that 98 percent of what \nPlanned Parenthood does is abortion. I don't know what he is thinking. \nBut let me reiterate, Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit organization. \nHe says they make a profit. You could say anything, but that doesn't \nmake it true.\n  I think it is interesting that in the 1960s and 1970s Planned \nParenthood, which has become the prime target of the rightwing of \nRepublicans, drew the support of prominent members of the GOP. Richard \nNixon signed family planning legislation that authorized Federal \nfunding for groups such as Planned Parenthood. Former Senator Barry \nGoldwater's wife Peggy was a founding member of Planned Parenthood in \nArizona, and former President George Herbert Walker Bush, as a \nRepublican Congressman from Houston, spoke frequently on the House \nfloor about the issue. So it is astounding how the rightwing of the \nRepublican Party has walked so far away from their most revered \nleaders. That is their choice. But it is also our choice as to whether \nwe are going to stand here and take it or come here and rebut what they \nare saying.\n  So count me in and count the Democratic women and many men on this \nside of the aisle who have stood sentry on this and told the truth \nabout this. And the truth is we are in a budget debate. Everything the \nRepublicans have said is that we have to close the deficit gap, we have \nto cut spending, cut spending, cut spending. And we said: Okay, we will \njoin you, but where were you during George Bush's day? You never said a \nword. But putting that aside, we will meet you. When we had the \nmajority and Bill Clinton was the President, we were the only ones who \ndid get a balanced budget and 23 million jobs. So we know how to do it, \nand of course we are going to work with our colleagues. We met them \nover 70 percent of the way on spending cuts. But guess what. They are \nso ideological and so extreme that what we heard from Senator Vitter \ntoday is not a discussion about the budget deficit and the fact that we \nhave to get on top of it and get that budget balanced, as we did under \nthe Clinton administration. We heard about abortion, abortion, \nabortion, which has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Because, as I \nsaid, not one slim dime of Federal money has been able to be used for \nabortion since the 1970s, and 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood \ndoes is health care, not abortion.\n  We know the real priority of these Republicans in Congress. We know \nthe real priority. We know what it is. It is an ideological agenda \nthat, frankly, puts women's health and women's lives at risk. Here we \nhad this huge debate over the budget--tough, getting down where we were \nall sweating it out to within an hour of the moment the government \nwould shut down--and the two things the Republicans insisted on voting \non, on a budget bill, have nothing to do with the budget.\n  For every dollar that Planned Parenthood gets to help them do cancer \nscreenings for women, Pap smears, breast cancer screenings, STDs--and \nthey do for men as well--HIV testing, blood pressure checks, diabetes \nchecks, they charge a sliding scale. You walk in there, you have no \ninsurance, you have no money, you get the services for free. If you \nhave some, you pay some.\n  The bottom line is, this is what they are holding up this agreement \nover, and they are forcing us to vote on Planned Parenthood and \nrepealing health care reform. I say that is extraordinary, because we \nmet them on the numbers. But in order to appease their rightwing \nagenda, they are forcing these votes. If these bills were to pass, who \ngets hurt? Women and their families.\n  I have some letters I have received from Californians, because \n750,000 women are served by Planned Parenthood clinics in California--\n750,000 women. That is actually more than some States have. I am going \nto share a letter. I have shared a few of them, but I got this one \ntoday.\n\n       Dear Senator Boxer, I don't write to you often because you \n     already stand up and fight for everything I believe in. I \n     heard you on NPR this morning talking about women's health \n     and the cuts the Republicans want to make to Planned \n     Parenthood.\n       I'm a 42 year old married professional. My husband and I \n     aren't in the highest bracket, but our combined income puts \n     us in the $170,000 year range. Frankly, we're happy, more \n     than happy to pay our fair share of taxes for the things that \n     will help our society as a whole.\n       We are appalled by the budget discussions. If you really \n     want to cut spending, do so where it is really outrageous . . \n     . defense and military. There's 60 percent right there. \n     However, what has me outraged right now is . . .\n\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\n\n  The Republican Party is.\n\n       . . . willing to shut down the government over a few \n     dollars for Planned Parenthood.\n       If you really cared about limiting abortion funding, family \n     planning is the first step. When I was 20 years old, I was \n     working my way through school. I was a sophomore in college \n     with limited income, no parental support, no health \n     insurance. The one thing I did have access to medically was \n     Planned Parenthood. The services were on a sliding scale, so \n     at my income of $850 a month, a gynecological exam was $10. \n     This meant that I went.\n       . . . I also got birth control pills there . . . However, \n     probably the most significant cross road in my life came \n     about because of Planned Parenthood. My family has a history \n     of female cancers. I had a Pap smear come back abnormal when \n     I was 21.\n       1). Had it not been for Planned Parenthood, I would not \n     have been able to afford the annual Pap smear.\n       2). Planned Parenthood did a biopsy on the ``abnormality.'' \n     Again, it was a sliding scale and while I can't recall \n     exactly how much this was, it was something I could manage . \n     . .\n       3). Biopsy showed that it was a potentially very dangerous \n     pre-cancerous growth that needed to be removed.\n       4). I did eat beans and rice for the next 2 months to pay \n     my share to Planned Parenthood for removing this growth.\n       5). I had to have Paps 2 times a year for the next several \n     years . . . Again, all I could afford was Planned Parenthood.\n       Frankly, if it wasn't for Planned Parenthood, there's a \n     pretty good chance I wouldn't be here today. It's not about \n     abortion, it's about women's health.\n\n  I have to say, these are the letters I have been getting day after \nday after day, and I am very proud of the people who have stood up and \ntold the truth to counter the lies I have heard, frankly from Members \nof Congress. This woman's name is Heather Jones from Costa Mesa.\n  The bottom line is, if you turn and look at the two votes we are \ngoing to have today, they both hurt women disproportionately. This \nisn't about the budget. If it were about a budget, they would give more \nmoney to the Title X program because for every dollar we invest, we \nsave $4 on the other side. What would have happened if Heather hadn't \nfound out she had a dangerous precancerous growth? That would have gone \nforward, she would have gotten cancer, and Lord knows what it would \nhave cost. She didn't make any money at that time, so she would have \nhad to have help from her county. It would have cost taxpayers. She \nwould have been ill and gone through hell and back fighting this, and \nwho knows if she would have made it.\n  The second vote we are having has to do with rolling back health care \nreform--another attack on women. It is an attack on everyone, but I \nwant to look at what it does to women. I know the Presiding Officer \nknows this, because he has been a leader on this issue, but before we \npassed our health reform law, being a woman was a preexisting \ncondition.\n  If you were the victim of domestic violence and you were a woman, \nthey wouldn't insure you. They would say: You have a preexisting \ncondition. What is that? Well, your husband beat you. And guess what. \nHe could do it again, so you are a high risk. Goodbye. We said no. No, \nthat can't happen. If you had a cesarean section and you tried to get \ninsurance, they would say: No, no. Since you had a cesarean section, \nyou could have another one. It is too expensive. Bye.\n  We said, no; you can't do that. You can't turn away people simply \nbecause they were the victim of domestic violence or had a Caesarean. \nYou cannot turn away a person because she is a woman. In 2014, \ninsurance companies will not be able to deny anyone coverage because of \na preexisting condition.\n  Another issue my colleague fought hard on, along with all of us, is \ngender rating. Insurance companies charge women in California nearly 40 \npercent more than men for similar coverage. Can you imagine? So when \nthey say let's repeal health reform, who are they hurting? \nDisproportionately women. When they say no more funding for Planned \nParenthood to continue their great work on basic health care, who are \nthey hurting disproportionately? Women.\n  Preventive care was a key in that health reform. I thank the \nPresiding Officer. He served on the appropriate committee that made \nthat decision. I will tell you, right now women delay or avoid getting \npreventive care, but once health reform goes into place we know there \nwill be preventive health care services such as mammograms without a \ncopay or a deductible. So when you repeal the health reform and \neverything we did for the people, who do you hurt? Women. Who is going \nto get sick more than any other group? Women.\n  Maternity care is not covered by many insurance companies. We changed \nall that. By 2014 insurance will be required to cover maternity care \nservices.\n  Let's look at Medicare. We made many reforms in health care dealing \nwith Medicare. More than half of the people who depend on Medicare are \nwomen; 56 percent of Medicare recipients are women. When you end \nMedicare, as Mr. Ryan does in his so-called Ryan budget where he ends \nMedicare--let's call it what it is--you are throwing women under the \nbus. This time it is elderly women. How proud are you of that, Mr. \nRyan? I am not proud that kind of proposal would come out, and it is \nstarting here today, when we vote to repeal health care reform.\n  Health care reform extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by 12 \nyears, to 2037. Why on Earth would the Republicans want to repeal a law \nthat strengthens Medicare and makes it viable until 2037?\n  Let me tell you what else would be repealed if they have their way \ntoday. Every senior on Medicare is going to get a free annual wellness \nexam. Let me repeat that. Every person on Medicare is going to get a \nfree annual wellness exam. It will get them access to preventive health \nservices such as vaccinations and cancer screenings with no copay and \nno deductible. Why did we do that? First and foremost, we did it \nbecause it is the right thing to do, but it saves money at the end of \nthe day when we invest up front in prevention.\n  That is why the Congressional Budget Office said our bill saves \nbillions of dollars over time. Investing in prevention--just like \nPlanned Parenthood did with my constituent, Heather, where a cancer was \ndiscovered early--means that an individual will get the care early, \nwill get on top of this and will not have to spend a lot of money on it \nand will be spared the pain and suffering and all the rest that goes \nwith cancer.\n  There is one more thing that they repeal. I didn't see this one. If \nthey get their way today, seniors are not going to see that infamous \ndoughnut hole that they fall into on their prescription drugs closed. \nThey are not going to see that closed. Right now it happens after they \npay a certain amount of money for their prescription drugs, a couple of \nthousand dollars. Then they say Medicare prescription drug coverage is \nnot going to cover them. So they fall into that doughnut hole. We close \nthat forever by 2020. They want to cancel that so seniors are going to \nhave to pay more for their prescription drugs.\n  We live in the greatest country in the world, and we have access to \nso many wonderful health advances--be they medical devices, be they \nprescription drugs. But what good does it do if we cannot get those \nthings?\n  By repealing health care reform--which our Republican friends want to \ndo, and today we have a vote to do it--seniors, women, and their \nfamilies will lose access to lifesaving drugs. They will lose access to \npreventive care. They will lose access to fair insurance coverage. \nAgain, disproportionately it impacts women. That is just the way the \ndemographics are because 56 percent of Medicare recipients are women.\n  Let's be very clear. Let's send a strong message tonight, or whatever \ntime it is that we vote on these two amendments, that we are standing \nstrong--if we vote them down--we are standing strong for women, we are \nstanding strong for their families, we are standing strong for \nAmericans. Anyone who would take these important reforms away, anyone \nwho would say we do not care about the 3 million people who get their \nhealth care from Planned Parenthood, are saying they do not care much \nabout those people.\n  By the way, there was some news program that said: What do you need \nPlanned Parenthood for? You can go to Walgreens and get all those \nservices? Somebody said. I never heard of getting a Pap smear at \nWalgreens or a breast cancer screening, that doesn't come to mind. So \nWalgreens actually had to put out a press release stating they do not \ndo those things.\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\n  Let's start talking the truth on the floor of the Senate. The truth \nis, there is an ideological agenda around this place, and it is \ncrystallizing. My Republican friends have gone a bridge too far. People \nare catching on because now it is starting to affect them. They are \nRepublicans, they are Independents, they are Democrats. This is not \nabout party. I can assure you, the people who are writing me who go to \nPlanned Parenthood to get their health care, their preventive care, \ntheir blood pressure checked, their diabetes checked, they come from \nevery political party.\n  The Title X program, in the beginning, and when it was formed, had \nthe strongest support from Republicans. That is how it was. But these \nRepublicans today have walked so far away from their own party that \nthey are looking at a bill signed by Richard Nixon, voted for by George \nHerbert Walker Bush, and saying: No, we are not interested in family \nplanning. They are distorting the debate.\n  If people want fewer abortions there is one place we can all walk \ntogether; that is, prevention of unwanted pregnancies, birth control, \ncontraception. They do not even want that. They do not even want that. \nThey have just overreached.\n  I am a person who says I respect you know matter what your views are. \nI would stand in front of a truck to protect your right to state your \nviews, whatever they are. I do not tell people what to think about \nissues. I think they should be respected for what they decide. But big \ngovernment should not be telling people what to think about the most \npersonal decisions. That is not what America is about.\n  We have, over the years, crafted some good compromises in the area of \nreproductive health care. We have said people have a right to choose in \nthe early stages of a pregnancy. That is what the Supreme Court has \nsaid. It has been upheld since the 1970s. In the beginning of a \npregnancy, a woman and her family and her doctor and her God, that is \nwho will be consulted. It is up to her to make that decision, early in \nthe pregnancy.\n  As the pregnancy moves on, the State has an interest in the decision \non this issue. As the pregnancy moves on--but always her life and \nhealth must be protected. That is the law. Not one penny of Federal \nfunds can be used for abortion except in the case of rape, incest, life \nof the mother.\n  I happen to be the one who carried that amendment on rape and incest \nbecause before that, we did not have that amendment. That was over on \nthe House side many years ago. We have a compromise. I would say to my \nfriends, if you do not like that compromise then come on the Senate \nfloor and make a woman a criminal and make a doctor a criminal--\nintroduce your legislation. We will fight it out and the people will \nweigh in. What the people will say is: Compromise. Compromise is fair. \nIt is not perfect, but it is fair. But, no, that is not what they will \ndo because they know if they say a woman is a criminal, it is a bridge \ntoo far.\n  So what they try to do is vilify an organization that has been in \nplace for 95 years, Planned Parenthood. They will vilify an \norganization when 97 percent of their work goes to basic health care \nand family planning. It is really sad. It is wrong. I am here to say \nevery time it comes up--the women Democrats, we have been on the Senate \nfloor already. We are going to continue this battle with our male \nfriends because nobody can tell me they care about women when they are \nabout to vote to deny women basic health care. No one can tell me they \ncare about families when they are about to deny families basic health \ncare. No one can tell me they care about families when they want to \nrepeal a law that outlaws gender discrimination, that outlaws the \nability of an insurance company to turn you away if you were the victim \nof domestic violence or had a Cesarean section.\n  Nobody can tell me you care about seniors when you embrace the Ryan \nbudget that ends Medicare. No one can tell me you care about seniors \nwhen, today, you are going to have a vote to repeal health care reform \nthat gives them more funding for their prescription drugs, that gives \nthem free wellness checks without a copay or deductible.\n  We always say around here: Whose side are you on? Are you on the side \nof the people, or are you on the side of the insurance companies? Are \nyou on the side of the people, or are you more interested in scoring \npolitical, ideological points with the extreme wing of your party? \nThose are the questions. I think the answer is going to come back \ntonight. I think we are going to defeat these two radical amendments. I \nhope it will send a message to our House friends who are going to have \na radical budget that the experts tell us is going to lose hundreds of \nthousands of jobs--I correct myself, the experts tell us the Ryan \nbudget would lead to the loss of 2.2 million jobs. Can you imagine?\n  The only beneficiary of that budget is billionaires and \nmultimillionaires. I am happy to be in the Senate at this moment in \nhistory because, to me, these are the issues. I have to say, these are \nthe issues I had in my campaign, and they were very direct.\n  I thank the people of California for sending me back here. We have 38 \nmillion people, the largest State in the Union. Every time you take \naway something from a Planned Parenthood or another health care center, \nyou hurt more of my people than anybody else because we are such a \nlarge State. Today we start the votes, and I am grateful I could stand \nup and speak out against both of these radical amendments--one to \ndefund an organization that is helping 3 million people a year in \nAmerica, and, second, repeal of health care reform that does so much \ngood. I think we are going to win those votes, and I certainly hope so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we as a country are in a very serious \nfinancial situation. We all know we have to reduce spending. This year \nwe will spend $3.7 trillion but take in only $2.2 trillion--40 cents of \nevery $1 is borrowed.\n  The President has acknowledged a stunning revelation, that under his \nbudget he submitted 2 months ago, something I repeatedly have talked \nabout--in the 10th year, the amount of interest on our debt will be \nalmost $1 trillion. This is fact.\n  We are on an unsustainable course. As every witness to come before \nthe Budget Committee has told us: You have to do better. You cannot \ncontinue in this fashion any longer. The President's debt commission \nChairmen, Mr. Erskine Bowles and former Senator Alan Simpson, told us \nwe are facing the most predictable debt crisis in our history if we do \nnot change.\n  They did not say it could happen to our children and grandchildren, \nthey said it could happen in 2 years. Mr. Bowles said maybe earlier \nthan 2 years, maybe some time after that. Senator Simpson said, I think \nwe can have a debt crisis in 1 year. Hopefully, this will not happen.\n  But we have to get spending under control. There are two ways to do \nit. One is to work hard, do what we are paid to do as legislators and \nidentify the less-productive, less-defensible spending programs and \neliminate them and try to protect as much as we can the programs that \nare more productive and doing good for America.\n  Another way to do it is reduce everything across the board and just \ncut it all by a certain percentage, and reduce spending that way. You \ncould do either. I think most people would say, we should eliminate the \nprograms that are least defensible first, before we have to reduce \nspending in programs that are more justified.\n  So, regardless, how do we make the decision?\n  I have heard the debate about Planned Parenthood and the money they \nget. I have not been particularly knowledgeable about it until \nrecently. I serve as ranking member of the Budget Committee, so I know \nsomething about the debt crisis we are in. So the question is, Is \nPlanned Parenthood a program that is less defensible and ought to have \nits funding eliminated or reduced significantly so other programs that \nare more defensible do not have to be cut?\n  Looking at the facts, I find that Planned Parenthood has far more \ndifficulty defending its legitimacy as a Federal recipient of millions \nof dollars than other institutions. This is a private group that sets \nabout to do all kinds of things. One of the largest things it does is \nprovide abortions. They have a very strong ideological agenda that a \nlot of the American people do not agree with. Why should we\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\nfund it? There are many other organizations out there, all over \nAmerica, that do what they think to be good things and are not funded \nby the U.S. Government.\n  So let's just look at it a little bit. I was sort of surprised \nactually. In 2009, the last year we have gotten a report, Planned \nParenthood reported providing 332,278 abortions in the United States. I \ndidn't know that--332,000. This is the highest total ever recorded, and \nthe 15th consecutive year that the number of abortions they have \nprovided has increased.\n  Overall, though, abortions in the United States are going down. You \nsee that sonogram and you see that unborn child and the American people \nare getting a lot more uneasy about this idea taking an unborn life.\n  Overall, abortions have decreased by almost 25 percent in the past \ntwo decades nationwide, voluntarily reduced by individual decisions by \nAmericans. Yet during that same time, Planned Parenthood abortions have \ndoubled.\n  Planned Parenthood consistently claims that abortions account for \nonly 3 percent of their services; 97 percent is spent on other \nprojects, they say. But yet in that same fact sheet on which they make \nthat assertion, they state that 12 percent--that is more than in 1 in \n10--of their health care patients receive an abortion.\n  That is a surprise to me. Think about that. They state that 12 \npercent--that is more than the 1 in 10--of their health care patients \nwho come in to Planned Parenthood receive an abortion. So what about \nthe other solutions? Are there not other solutions to pregnancies other \nthan abortion?\n  In 2009, their report indicates that Planned Parenthood made 1 \nadoption referral for every 340 abortions performed. They made a scant \n977 adoption referrals compared to over 330,000 abortions. That is a \ndecline of almost 60 percent from 2008. In 2008, they did 60 percent \nmore referrals when it made 2,400 adoption referrals. So this is a \nmajor change in what is going on at Planned Parenthood.\n  It appears this is an advocacy organization that is committed to one \nsolution for people struggling with pregnancies. I tell you, I have a \nletter here, I will not quote it, but I have a letter from a woman in \nAlabama who had an abortion who still feels pain about that and wrote \nme saying not to fund this. I just say that because my colleague \nsuggested only men would favor reducing this funding.\n  I tell you another thing that I did not know and was very surprised \nabout: the amount of Federal money that they receive. No wonder there \nis a big brouhaha here, because this is a lot of money. Congress is \nproviding $363 million a year to Planned Parenthood. That is a lot. \nOver 10 years--as we have been scoring everything here over a 10-year \nbudget--that is $4 billion--quite a lot of money.\n  Many people in the country feel strongly that, OK, they say the \nSupreme Court has ruled on this. They have said that under the \nConstitution abortions under some circumstances cannot be prohibited. \nBut they are saying the Federal Government does not have to pay for it, \ndoes not have to fund it, and should not use taxpayer money to do so.\n  So my colleagues say: Well, we agree with that principle and Planned \nParenthood money does not directly fund abortions. We are giving the \nmoney to Planned Parenthood, but they are not able to use it for \nabortions. But if 12 percent of their patients are obtaining abortions, \nand they are getting $363 million per year, I think it is a fact that \nthe Federal funding furthers their ability to grow and expand their \nlead as the No. 1 abortion provider in the country.\n  I think, all in all, we do not have enough money to do a lot of good \nthings. We have, some people forget, rural health clinics and urban \nhealth clinics that are funded and organized by the government to meet \nhealth needs of the poor. We do not have to use money to help fund this \nprivate entity that has an agenda. I do not believe it is radical to \nsay this is one place we could save money. I do not think it is \nextreme.\n  My best judgment tells me that if we do not have enough money, and 40 \npercent of what we spend is borrowed, we shouldn't borrow $363 million \nthis year to fund a program like Planned Parenthood. This is one \nprogram that we could legitimately say does not have to have taxpayers' \nmoney and should have its funding terminated.\n  I also would support the resolution concerning the health care bill. \nIt is clearly a piece of legislation that costs the taxpayers large \nsums of money. It is not a piece of legislation that adds money to the \nTreasury, as has been suggested. The Congressional Budget Office has \nwritten a letter to me that stated explicitly that the administration \nis double-counting money to claim savings. If they were not double-\ncounting the money they took from Medicare to fund this new program, \nthen the health care bill would score to be a clear drain on the \nTreasury.\n  They have to use a gimmick of double accounting to justify that. It \nis not the right way to do it and is the reason the country is going \nbroke.\n  So, while today's vote may largely be symbolic, it is a crucial step \nin showing the necessity of eliminating this intrusive and costly \nhealthcare law and replacing it with reforms that will provide \nAmericans with access to quality, affordable health care, reduce \nskyrocketing health care costs and put our Nation on a more sustainable \nfiscal path.\n  The Democrats' health legislation was sold as a package that would \nreduce insurance premiums by $2,500 per family, trim the Federal \ndeficit, and immediately create 400,000 new jobs. Sadly, none of these \npromises have been met.\n  Instead, the new health care law will cause health care spending to \nsurge over the next decade, and Americans will see dramatic increases \nin their premiums, and many of them already have. Half of those \nrecently polled in a Kaiser Family Foundation poll claim that their \npremiums have gone up recently. The Federal deficit will increase by an \nadditional $700 billion, and the law's expensive mandates, penalties, \nand tax hikes will lead to job losses and persistent economic \nuncertainty, as many small business owners have told me.\n  As our Nation's reckless fiscal policy brings us ever closer to a \ntipping point, respected economists across the country have stressed \nthe need for Congress to reduce Federal spending and contain our \nmounting health costs.\n\n  Rather than tackle these problems that threaten the long-term \nstability of our Nation, the new health care law exacerbates our fiscal \ncrisis by creating an open-ended entitlement and introducing $2.6 \ntrillion in new Federal spending.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new health care law \nwill cause insurance premiums in the individual market to soar by 10 to \n13 percent for American families, translating to a $2,100 increase for \nfamilies purchasing their own health care coverage by 2016.\n  Total health care spending in the U.S. already consumes 17.3 percent \nof GDP, the largest of any industrialized nation. Under the new law, \nnational health care spending will approach 20 percent of GDP by the \nend of the decade.\n  Sadly, many supporters of the health care law continue to perpetuate \nthe myth that it will not increase the deficit. A thorough examination \nof the law pulls back the curtain to expose the deceptive budget \ngimmicks and reveal its true cost.\n  When the bill was first introduced, the Democrats sold the plan to \nAmericans by double-counting $398 billion in Medicare cuts and taxes, \n$29 billion in Social Security taxes, and $70 billion in new long-term \ncare premiums to pay for the new health care spending. This is \naccording to a CBO report I requested. This double accounting was \nstunning and existed to justify the claim that the law will reduce \ncosts.\n  Additionally, since CBO reports evaluate legislative proposals over a \n10-year budget window, the new law was written to delay most of the new \nspending until 2014, while immediately implementing the program cuts \nand tax increases to allow 10 years of offsets to pay for only 6 years \nof spending. In order to convince Americans of the plan's merits, which \nthey failed to do, they had to use accounting gimmicks that hide the \ntrue long-term costs of this monstrous law.\n  Only in Washington will people claim that spending $2.6 trillion and \ndramatically expanding the size and scope of the Federal Government is \ngood for our Nation's fiscal health.\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\n  Former Director of the Congressional Budget Office Douglas Holz-\nEakin, an economist who understands the budget gimmicks used in \nWashington, cowrote an article in the Wall Street Journal in January \nthat eliminates any confusion about the law's impact. This article \ntitled ``Health Care Repeal Won't Add to the Deficit'' clearly refutes \nthe law's supporters:\n\n       Repeal is the logical first step toward restoring fiscal \n     sanity. . . . How, then, does the Affordable Care Act \n     magically convert $1 trillion in new spending into painless \n     deficit reduction? It's all about budget gimmicks, deceptive \n     accounting, and implausible assumptions used to create the \n     false impression of fiscal discipline . . . Repeal isn't a \n     budget buster; keeping the Affordable Care Act is.\n\n  A poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University \nconducted around the same time that this article was written revealed \nthat the American people are seeing through these ploys: 60 percent of \nthe country believes the health care law will increase the deficit over \nthe next 10 years, while only 11 percent thinks it will lower the \ndeficit.\n  Once again, the America people prove that they are wiser than \nWashington. The final point I wish to make about the health care law is \nits debilitating impact on jobs and our economic recovery. In meeting \nwith many small businesses, they are passionate on this point.\n  The expensive mandates and penalties included in the health care law \ncoupled with the rising costs of insurance facing families and \nbusinesses have enveloped our economy in a cloud of uncertainty. \nAlready, over 6,000 pages of new health care regulations have been \nwritten by the Obama administration, burdening employers of all sizes \nas they make strategic decisions about business expansion, hiring \nadditional employees, and long-term investments, three keys to the \nprivate sector recovery essential to getting Americans back to work.\n  Economic estimates indicate that repealing the health care law that \nthreatens our economic recovery would save 700,000 American jobs.\n  It is imperative that Congress repeal this law that is burdening \nemployers and stifling economic growth, and replace it with solutions \nthat will lower health costs and avert the mounting fiscal crisis \nfacing our Republic.\n  During the recent election, the American public rebelled against the \nunchecked spending and unprecedented government expansion that threaten \nour children's future. Their message to Congress was clear: adopt \npolicies to change our unsustainable trajectory and rein in the cost \nand size of the government. Congressman Paul Ryan has submitted a \nbudget for 2012 that is responsible, honest, and straightforward in the \nway that it deals with the debt problem facing our children and \ngrandchildren. Repealing this flawed and fiscally unsustainable health \ncare law, which is an important part of his plan, would be another step \nin the right direction and would help to change the devastating \ntrajectory that we are on.\n  I urge my colleagues to heed the public's call and repeal this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2468-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2468-S2470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SBIR/STTR\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to talk about another topic. Senator \nKirk and 36 other Members of the Senate are cosponsoring an amendment \nwe would hope to add to the small business bill if we ever get back to \nit.\n  This is an amendment we offered independently as a bill 1 month ago, \nthe Gas Accessibility and Sustainability Act. What this bill does is \ntake further an effort that was put into law in 2005, right before \nHurricane Katrina, that allowed the President to suspend the unique \nboutique fuel standards in the country if there was a natural disaster.\n  That happened immediately--within a couple weeks, as I recall--after \nthe bill became law. The President used that authority. In the 6 months \nfollowing Katrina, even though the gulf was obviously disrupted and a \ncouple of refineries were very disrupted, gas prices did not go up \nbecause, for the first time since the passage of the Clean Air Act, \ngasoline was a commodity again.\n  What this bill would do, as we now see gasoline prices at $4.37 in \nHawaii, at $3.88 in St. Louis, and particularly prices that are high in \ncommunities that have a unique blend of fuel that is only available in \nthat community, is allow the President to have that authority, if there \nis any kind of disruption, if the Suez Canal was shut down for some \nperiod of time, if a refinery went down, if there was a pipeline \ndisruption that truly made it very difficult for communities to get \ntheir unique blend of fuel but was much easier for them to get fuel \nthat met the standard of being ``fuel'' at the gas pump.\n  Senator Kirk and I introduced this together. He was a great advocate \nof this bill when it passed the House. I would like to turn to him for \na moment and see what he has to say today about this bill that allows \nus to look at the gas prices that are creating real problems in the \ncountry today.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I note that under the Blunt legislation, we \nwould correct a growing problem in the United States with gas prices. \nRight now, for example, in the Chicagoland area, gas prices total about \n$4.14 a gallon. I am sure in Missouri it is probably quite high.\n  Mr. BLUNT. It is $3.88 in St. Louis, which would be the area that we \nhave that uses specialty fuel.\n  Mr. KIRK. This map shows that by Federal regulation the Federal \nGovernment has divided the national gasoline market into 17 separate \nsubmarkets. These 17 submarkets all have their unique recipe of \ngasoline. By Federal regulation, one cannot use gasoline that was sold \nin Chicagoland, which under this chart is the Chicago and Milwaukee RFG \nethanol standard, in the St. Louis area, the SRFG standard with \nethanol. By creating small, tiny monopolies, we create higher prices \nfor the American people. I think that is why the Blunt legislation is \nnecessary.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator for those comments. Using his chart, \nin Missouri you can buy one blend of gas in St. Louis, another blend of \nfuel in the Kansas City area, and a third blend yet in between. So, \nclearly, these areas are not even unique in the fuel that is used \nthere. If you buy fuel driving from one city to the other and use the \nother half of the tank while you are driving around in St. Louis, you \nare using fuel that is available generally anyhow.\n  This does a couple of things. One, it allows, in a time where it is \nhard to get fuel for any reason, the President to waive those \nstandards. The other thing it does is, it caps these fuels so if the \nEPA decides under the Clean Air Act that you have a clean air \nattainment problem in your city, you have to go and look at the \nexisting fuel blends and choose from one of them rather than what had \nhappened in the country up until 2005, which was every city somehow \nbecame convinced there was a unique fuel blend for them that only would \nwork there that never would quite work anywhere else. That doesn't make \nsense. We have headed in the other direction. This legislation heads us \na little further and a little faster in a direction to where we don't \nhave these unique blends. We have fuel as fuel again. Whether it is the \nrestaurateurs whom some of us may have seen today or various \nbusinesses, if fuel is $4 a gallon, something has to give, and it goes \nthroughout the entire economy. This helps solve that problem.\n  Hopefully, we can be talking about an energy bill before too long. \nBut, clearly, whether it is a small business bill or any other bill, \nthe cost of fuel makes a real difference in the country today. This \namendment that we hope to offer eventually to the small business bill \nis one of the things that will help solve the problem.\n  Mr. KIRK. The unhighlighted areas are where regular gasoline is sold. \nThe highlighted areas are where these little gasoline monopolies, by \nFederal regulation, have been created. What happens if another \nhurricane hits the gulf? If this area was lacking its specific kind of \ngasoline under current regulations, it could not borrow gasoline from \nMissouri or Chicagoland or anywhere else. So we have created an \nincredible price rigidity in the system. Long term, I think we should \nmove the country to one clean burning fuel. But the one thing we should \nnot do is have 17 different submarkets, all now with the ability to \ncharge the American driving public much higher prices than would \notherwise be the case.\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\n  I commend the Senator. This is exactly why we need the Blunt \nlegislation. The Blunt amendment should pass to address this problem, \none of the reasons gasoline costs too much in the United States.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend from Illinois, a long-term proponent of \nthis concept. We will continue to work for solutions that make gasoline \nand the fuel system work better and make more sense for people all over \nAmerica.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two amendments to \nthe SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011, S. 493, which would improve \nour oversight of the critical Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, \nand Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, programs.\n  First, I would note that S. 493, which I introduced in March with \nSenate Small Business Committee Chair Mary Landrieu, has broad, \nbipartisan support, and has the backed of divergent stakeholders who \nhave long been at odds on how to proceed in reauthorizing these \nsuccessful programs.\n  Our legislation includes a provision requiring the National Academy \nof Sciences, NAS, to continue its evaluation of the SBIR program. The \nNAS has produced a series of informative and groundbreaking reports on \nthe SBIR program which helped inform Chair Landrieu and I as we sought \nto reauthorize this crucial initiative.\n  That said, the STTR program lacks any significant analysis or \nevaluation since its inception in 1992. While we can point to annual \ndata provided by the Small Business Administration to demonstrate its \neffectiveness, it is critical that independent, outside experts explore \nthe STTR program and make recommendations for how to improve it when we \nnext consider reauthorization of these initiatives.\n  My first amendment would require that the NAS also evaluate the STTR \nprogram. Instead of a separate report, the NAS would be required to \nconsider STTR in its ongoing evaluation of the SBIR program, which \nwould be completed four years following enactment of the legislation. \nThis would avoid expending additional resources necessary to produce an \nindependent report on STTR during these difficult economic times.\n  Additionally, S. 493 incorporates a recommendation from the NAS \nlandmark study to allow agencies to use three percent of their SBIR \nbudgets for administrative, oversight, and contract processing costs. I \nam concerned, however, that Congress will not have adequate knowledge \nabout how the agencies are utilizing this funding.\n  As such, my second amendment requires these agencies to submit a \nreport each year to the relevant congressional committees detailing in \na specific manner how they are using these administrative funds. These \nreports will allow us, in our responsibility of oversight, to ensure \nthese taxpayer dollars are being used wisely, and to examine these \nagencies' spending choices for any waste or abuse. Additionally, it \nwill help inform us of the need, or lack thereof, to continue this \npilot initiative in future reauthorizations.\n  My amendments are simple, straightforward, good government \ninitiatives that allow us to examine the effectiveness of these \ncritical job creation programs, and to keep a watchful eye on how \nFederal agencies are utilizing taxpayer dollars. I would urge my \ncolleagues to support them.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, our Nation continues to struggle out of \nthe economic downturn that swept across the country a few years ago, \nand today, I am pleased that the Senate is considering S. 493, the \nreauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, and \nSmall Business Technology Transfer, STTR, programs. The Congress has \nworked toward improving the economic conditions for small businesses to \nsurvive these challenging times. It is important for us to sustain this \nincubator for high-tech innovation, research and development, and the \ndriving force of our economic engine, our entrepreneurs. Today's global \neconomy is only getting more and more competitive, and in order to \nmaintain the United States' edge in science, technology, and \nengineering, opportunities to encourage small businesses through \nprograms like the SBIR/STTR will benefit all of us.\n  I wish to highlight some of the successes in my home State, Hawaii, \nthat were assisted by the SBIR/STTR program. Since the program began in \n1983, the State of Hawaii has received 313 SBIR grants, for a total of \n$94.4 million. One of these companies is Referentia Systems \nIncorporated, an applied research and development company dedicated to \nproviding relevant and innovative cyber security and network enterprise \nsolutions to meet the critical needs of our national security and \nFederal Government. Referentia was started in 1996 with a staff of 30, \nand now employs 94 people at military bases throughout the Nation and \noverseas, with offices in Honolulu, HI; San Diego, CA; Albuquerque, NM; \nand Sterling, VA. In its earliest years, the fledgling small \ndisadvantaged business secured its first SBIR Phase I award in 2004. \nSince then, Referentia was awarded 13 more SBIR Phase I and 7 SBIR \nPhase II grants. Three of Referentia's core building blocks were \ndeveloped with SBIR grants. These include: LiveAction, for cyber \nsecurity and network enterprises; Sprocket, for cross-boundary data \nconditioning and cross-enclave data transfer; and Time Series Rapid \nExploration, or T-REX, for data storage and analysis. The result of the \nopportunities created for Referentia helped to position them in the \ngrowing and important cyber security market. These SBIR/STTR grants \ngenerated deliverable products that Referentia is working to transition \ninto long-term programs of record with the Navy, Army, Marine Corps, \nand Joint Operations programs.\n  The discovery, energy, and motivation of our entrepreneurs also power \nthe inquisitiveness we find in the fields of science, engineering, and \nhigh-technology development. Through the SBIR/STTR programs, the \nsustainability of small companies that benefited from the relationships \nthey have formed doing SBIR/STTR work have encouraged partnering with \nlarge systems integrators and the government in an effort to seek \nsolutions that address the evolving challenges we face. Another Hawaii \nsmall business that participated in the SBIR program is TeraSys \nTechnologies, LLC. TeraSys Technologies secured a Phase I SBIR from \nNaval Sea Systems for the development of an interoperable solution for \ncounter remote controlled improvised explosive devices and blue force \ncommunications. As a result of TeraSys Technologies' work on the SBIR \nPhase I, a Phase II award was made from the Joint Tactical Radio System \noffice. I am pleased to report that TeraSys Technologies secured a \nPhase III award to support a high-priority requirement for our \nmilitary's current engagement in the Middle East. The ultimate goal for \nTeraSys Technologies, and all companies that participate in the SBIR/\nSTTR program, is to use their Phase III award toward securing a large \nproduction order of their product following the rigorous testing it has \nundergone, and will undergo in ``real-life'' conditions during the SBIR \nPhase III. Should TeraSys Technologies be successful in their efforts, \nit would be a boost to Hawaii's economy, and include final product \nintegration in the State.\n  A few of the words describing any small business owner include \nenergetic, creative, and highly motivated. Most of us believe that \ngreat strides or discoveries are made due to the research and \ndevelopment investments that large science, engineering, and technology \ncompanies make within various sectors. The understanding that small \nbusinesses drive our Nation's vibrant economy, and that high-tech \nbusinesses with less than 500 employees are extremely innovative \nspurred the SBIR/STTR programs' creation. The drive to grow their \nenterprises and bring their ideas to the marketplace may not always \nwork out quite as they plan. On occasion, an entrepreneur is awarded an \nSBIR/STTR grant to solve one particular problem, and it leads to an \nunexpected opportunity. For example, in Hawaii, Navatek, Ltd., a \ncompany founded in 1979, and based in Honolulu, HI, has been producing \ninnovation through research by developing, building, and testing at sea \nadvanced ship hull designs and associated technologies. Navatek, a \nbeneficiary of SBIR Phase I and II awards, originally presented its \ntechnology at the Navy Opportunity Forum 2010 for ``Dynamic \nCompensation for Towed Bodies.'' This particular project's intent was \nto help the Navy solve the problem of conventional small surface craft \nunable to\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\ntow AQS-20 and AQS-24 mine hunting submersible sonar bodies. As it \nturned out, the SBIR Phase II indirectly advanced Navatek's aft lifting \nbody invention, and led to an opportunity with the U.S. Special Warfare \nCommand. Navatek continues to work toward securing a Phase III award, \nand highlights some of the unreported benefits that come from the SBIR/\nSTTR programs.\n  I have provided the experiences of three small businesses in my home \nState. They, and other companies, are examples of the direct and \nindirect impact the SBIR/STTR programs' mission to foster and encourage \ninnovation and entrepreneurship in the research and development \nactivities of major Federal agencies. We can calculate how much \nprograms cost the U.S. taxpayer, and the companies and jobs that \nresulted from the competitive nature of the SBIR/STTR programs. What we \ncannot quantify is the value of ensuring involvement by science, \nengineering, and technology entrepreneurs in research and development. \nThe people of Hawaii, and all Americans, hope to provide a brighter \nfuture for their children. I firmly believe the future success of our \nchildren will depend on maintaining our competitive edge in the world. \nWe must continue to uphold and reaffirm our commitment to the \ninnovators and entrepreneurs in this country by completing our work on \nthe SBIR/STTR reauthorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2470-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2470-S2471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we are today making a small \ndownpayment toward getting runaway Federal spending under control. The \nspending bill we will vote on today represents a $78 billion spending \ncut from that proposed by President Obama for this year. It will be $38 \nbillion from what the Federal Government spent last year. We must \naddress the spending binge our country has been on for the last 2, 4, 6 \nyears.\n  Spending cuts have been actually ignored. We have increased spending \nin the name of stimulus. The problem is, that kind of spending didn't \nstimulate the economy in the private sector where the jobs are \npermanent.\n  At the beginning of this year, the President proposed a budget that \nwould spend $3.7 trillion next year, with a $1.6 trillion deficit. The \nnational debt is now $14.29 trillion. Under President Obama's budget \nplan, the national debt would double since he took office and triple by \n2020. We then embarked on a vigorous negotiation on this year's budget. \nRepublicans insisted on cuts beginning now, which is the middle of a \nfiscal year, which makes it very difficult because the spending levels \nare already in place for half a year. But we said: No, we need to start \nright now, even if it is hard, even if it is in the middle of the \nfiscal year.\n  There was a hard negotiation. We know that because we had a series of \n\n1-, 2-, and 3-week continuing resolutions that allowed the government \nto go forward but did not make the final decisions on finishing the \nfiscal year, September 30, with cuts that were necessary.\n  Part of the negotiation was to avoid a government shutdown. I did not \nwant a government shutdown. In the end, that costs more. It costs more \nto do all the changes that are necessary to shut down the government \nand then to make the changes necessary to come back and put it back \nonline. We did the right thing by making those cuts, by taking that \nfirst step, and by not shutting down government so that so many people \nwould have been left in the lurch: Federal employees--most certainly we \nwere going to take care of our military, but they should not have had \nto worry about it--all of the people who had vacations planned, who had \nbought airline tickets and who wanted to go to national museums and \nparks. All people would have experienced some kind of disruption. It \nwasn't necessary if we did the amount of cutting, and we did.\n  We cannot rest because the real battle is going to be for cutting \ntrillions, not billions. It is the trillions that are going to start \ngetting the deficits down and bring our debt back into line.\n  To do as the President suggested earlier this year and freeze \nspending at this year's levels would have been like someone who was on \na diet saying: I am just going to eat what I eat now and no more. But \nthat doesn't mean that person would lose weight. We all know that.\n  Today the Federal Government is spending $4 billion every day that we \ndon't act. We add $4 billion every day that we don't have, that is debt \nborrowed from somewhere else. We are borrowing 42 cents on every dollar \nwe spend. Much of that is from the Chinese. And what are we doing? We \nare giving a bill to our children that is unsupportable. That is not \njust a problem for our grandchildren in the future; it is a problem for \ntoday.\n  This year our interest payments on this mountain of debt have already \ncost us $190 billion. By 2020, if we go at this rate, annual interest \npayments on the national debt will more than double to approximately \n$778 billion a year. Now we are going to $\\3/4\\ trillion just for \ninterest payments. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  The President made a speech yesterday. It was a call for action. \nUnfortunately, I believe the President called for the wrong action. The \nPresident said we have to have taxes go up and we have to have spending \nthat goes down together. He proposed raising $1 trillion in tax \nincreases. That is $1 trillion in higher taxes for small business, $1 \ntrillion in higher taxes for family farmers. That is not going to help \nthe economy come out of the doldrums. Who is going to be able to hire \npeople if they are going to have a tax burden and a regulatory burden \nthat is going to keep them from being able to expand their operations?\n  Washington has a spending problem, not a taxing problem.\n  We wasted $1 trillion in failed stimulus spending in the first 2 \nyears of the Obama Presidency. Now he is raising taxes by $1 trillion \nin the second half of his Presidency to pay for a stimulus package that \ndidn't work? That does not make sense.\n  The President also believes that a stronger Federal Government, a \nmore powerful Federal Government is the answer to our problems. He \nproposed yesterday to address Medicare and Medicaid costs by expanding \nupon the health care reform bill that was pushed through on a \ncompletely partisan vote and that already is going to increase \ngovernment. It is going to increase costs, and cuts to Medicare are \ngoing to pay for part of that increase. The President would give more \npower to the unelected bureaucrats on his new independent payment \nadvisory board that is there to cut Medicare payments and \nreimbursements to doctors. We do not need a bigger, more powerful \nFederal Government to address the issues of this mounting debt.\n  We are going to have a vigorous debate on what is the right answer: \nmore powerful Federal Government and more taxes versus a smaller, more \nrestrained Federal Government that promotes growth in the private \nsector to make our economy go. We are approaching the limit on the \nFederal debt ceiling. That is where we must take a stand. That is where \nwe have to draw the line in the sand and say: No more. We cannot raise \nthe limit on the Federal debt without reforms taking place that will \nshow that over the next 10 years we have a plan, and the plan is to cut \nback on the deficit every year.\n  I think a total of around $6 trillion in cuts over a 10-year period \nis a responsible approach. We will debate some of the things in the \nproposals that have been put forward: what are the priorities in \nspending, what will promote growth, what will promote jobs. But we must \nhave a plan before we raise the debt ceiling.\n  Republicans and Democrats can agree on one thing: We do need a \ncombination of spending cuts with revenue increases to get to the \ntrillions that are needed to cut this debt. But the way we define \nrevenue is the answer. The Democrats say revenue means tax increases. \nThe tax increases are on people who would do the hiring to grow the \njobs. So we are putting a damper on the ability to reinvigorate the \neconomy.\n  Republicans are going to argue that the revenue comes from creating \njobs, from having more people employed, so they can help with our \neconomy and try to help bring revenue in by being employed in the \nprivate sector.\n  Republicans believe the way to create revenue is by building a \nvigorous\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\neconomy, to have people working so they are contributing to the \neconomy, not having people who are forced to take benefits because they \ncannot find a job in this stagnant economy that we all have \nacknowledged is here.\n  Today, I hope all of us will agree to take the first steps on the \nresponsible spending cuts that will get us through the end of this \nfiscal year. I hope we will come together on next year's budget. The \n2012 budget is what we are having hearings on. I had a hearing this \nmorning with the Secretary of Commerce--the FBI Director earlier this \nweek--to assure that we are spending for 2012 in a limited, responsible \nway and covering the needs of our country and also making the \ninvestments that will spur growth in our economy.\n  But the big debate we are going to have is on increasing the debt \nlimit. At $14.29 trillion, we must do it with reforms that show the \nworld that is buying our debt that we are going to have a responsible \nway to pay them back. I do not want the Chinese to raise the interest \nrates because they are worried about whether we have the political will \nto pay them back.\n  We will have the political will to do it if we cut spending, if we \nincrease revenue through job growth, not taxes. We will show the world \nthe debt is good and that interest rates should stay low and that we \nshould work to have good trade agreements so we can build up our jobs \nand buy things from outside, and those economies will flourish so they \ncan buy our products. That is what would be a win for everyone, and \nthat is what we will be promoting in the next few months in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2471-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2471-S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INTERCHANGE FEES\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise, once again, on behalf of rural \nAmerica. Many folks do not understand rural America. They often get \npainted in broad brush strokes in a way that does not reflect the \nreality we face. The Montanans who elected me sent me to bring common \nsense to the debate over issues that impact rural America.\n  One issue where there is not a lot of common sense is the issue of \ndebit interchange. There is also a lot of misinformation out there \nabout this issue.\n  I have been concerned about the unintended consequences of this \nproposed rule since the Senate voted on the provision last year. That \nis why I voted against the amendment when it came to the floor for a \nvote. Over the past few months, I have been attacked by the big box \nretailers and called just about every name in the book.\n  My legislation to study the impact of the Fed's proposed rule has \nbeen called a bailout. That is pretty interesting, since I was the only \nDemocrat in the Senate to vote against both bailouts. Only in \nWashington do people say you are killing a bill by making sure it does \nwhat we want it to do.\n  I certainly do not think the goal of the interchange amendment was to \nengage in price fixing. I do not think folks were trying to hurt \nconsumers or small community banks and credit unions. But now we know \nthe impact of this provision is far different than the information we \nhad when we passed the amendment.\n  Now we know that the regulators tasked with implementing this rule \nthink it may not work at all. When we passed the amendment, we were \ntold small banks and credit unions would receive an exemption from the \nswipe fee rule. Since there has been a lot of misinformation on this \nissue, let me share these comments directly with my colleagues.\n  In a Banking Committee hearing in February, Chairman Bernanke \nreferred to the exemption for community banks and credit unions, and he \nsaid:\n\n       We are not certain how effective that exemption will be. \n     There is some risk that the exemption will not be effective \n     and that the interchange fees available through smaller \n     institutions will be reduced to the same extent that we would \n     see for larger banks.\n\n  That means the Chairman of the Federal Reserve--the guy in charge of \nimplementing the interchange rule--does not think it will work for \ncredit unions or for small mom-and-pop community banks.\n  This is common sense. When you set a price cap, big box retailers \nwill use their market share to force the little guys to meet the lower \nfee.\n  At the same hearing, FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair confirmed this, \nsaying:\n\n       It remains to be seen whether they--\n\n  These are credit unions and community banks--\n\n     can be protected with this. I think they're going to have to \n     make that up somewhere, probably by raising the fees that \n     they have on transaction accounts.\n\n  That means our credit unions and small community banks will be \ncutting back--cutting back on things such as free checking or ending it \naltogether, charging more for loans, cutting back on services to low- \nand moderate-income folks in rural America.\n  Despite being tasked with the job of implementing the small bank \nexemption, the Fed cannot guarantee that the exemption will work in \npractice. Because despite what some may say, the Federal Reserve cannot \ncontrol markets. It cannot ensure that this provision will work since \nmarket forces will drive rates down for the community banks and credit \nunions.\n  No one doubts that rural America's small businesses will be \nsignificantly affected by regulating debit card interchange fees. Yet \nthe true and full effects of this regulation on small businesses are \nnot being fully discussed or fairly portrayed.\n  This amendment was an attempt to address a problem. But when you \ncontrol prices, as this amendment does, you also invite unintended \nconsequences.\n  At first, it might make sense that if you reduce debit card swipe \nfees, then small businesses will benefit. But once you take a closer \nlook, you find a host of potential problems for small businesses and no \nguarantees that consumers will benefit one lick.\n  For instance, a recent study says that only 10 percent of small \nbusinesses are in retail and in a position to accept debit cards. But \nthat same study also says most small businesses have checking accounts \nand use debit cards to pay for things they need to run their \nbusinesses. These businesses will end up paying more for basic services \nsuch as checking accounts and they will see more fees and consumers \nwill be no better off. In short, this limit is bad for small \nbusinesses, and it is bad for consumers. Which banking services are \nlikely to be more expensive--or disappear entirely--as community banks \nand credit unions seek to make up lost revenue? Well, free checking, \nfor one. Millions of Americans have had checking accounts and debit \ncards because they are free. If banks and credit unions are forced to \ncharge for these services, many business owners and consumers would \nsuffer the consequences.\n  Because the Fed's rules do not allow banks to cover the costs of \ndebit transactions, banks of all sizes are considering limits on credit \ncard purchases. Moms using their debit cards at the grocery store may \nhave to limit their grocery purchases to $50 or $100.\n  So what is the alternative? Well, put it on a credit card. But that \nis a tough option for struggling families. Low- and moderate-income \nfamilies may not have access to credit or may have already maxed out \ntheir credit card. Pushing consumers toward credit is not good for \nsmall businesses either because the interchange fees on credit card \npurchases are higher than those on debit cards.\n  In a recent survey, three-quarters of community banks reported \nconsidering imposing annual or monthly debit card fees. Three-fifths of \nthem would consider imposing monthly fees on checking account \ncustomers. If they start charging folks for just having an account, you \ncan bet these folks will not be customers for long. In the long run, \nthat will devastate rural America.\n  What does that mean for small businesses that rely on those community \nbanks and credit unions? Without a doubt, the small businesses and \ncommunities across Montana rely on community banks and credit unions to \nkeep their doors open, to grow their businesses, and to create jobs. \nThese Main Street institutions are the backbone of this Nation's small \nbusinesses.\n  In fact, according to a recent National Federation of Independent \nBusiness report, most small businesses do their banking with smaller \ninstitutions. Community banks provide the bulk of small business \nlending in rural\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\ncommunities and small business owners receive better treatment from \ncommunity banks. That is because in rural America a community bank is \npart of that community. A handshake still matters, and the folks on \nboth sides of the table can look each other in the eye and be \naccountable to one another. We are not going to find that on Wall \nStreet.\n  Community banks do the lion's share of lending with the youngest and \nsmallest of small businesses--those best positioned to create new jobs \nas we merge from this recession.\n  Make no mistake about it. The price caps called for by this Durbin \namendment will lead to fewer debit cards offered by community banks and \ncredit unions. It will limit the size of debit card transactions, and \nit will end free checking for small businesses, as they rely on these \ninstitutions.\n  These changes will limit the ability of small businesses to conduct \ndaily business. They will increase banking costs and could limit the \nlending capability of smaller institutions. These changes come at a \ntime when many small businesses are already fully leveraged and have \nfew other options available.\n  So what does this mean for small business in Montana?\n  For a contractor in Kalispell, it means he will not be able to use \nhis debit card to buy lumber. It will mean the end of free checking. I \nknow of too many businesses that do not have the option of increasing \ntheir lines of credit with their bank or that have maxed out a credit \ncard weathering this recession. Those are the circumstances folks are \nforced into, and those are the circumstances that limit our economy.\n  What will this mean for community banks and credit unions that are \ncompeting for the business of these small businesses?\n  Community banks and credit unions play an instrumental role in our \neconomic recovery by providing loans to small businesses so these \nbusinesses can grow and hire new employees.\n  Smaller banks treat small businesses better. But smaller banks do not \nhave the means to make up for the lost revenue from this Federal \nmandate, and they do not have the volume to make up this revenue \nelsewhere such as bigger banks do.\n  One of the more troubling findings from the NFIB report I referenced \nearlier is the fact that community banks have been losing market share \nnationwide. The report found that the percentage of small businesses \nserved by local banks fell from 31 percent to 25 percent between 2009 \nand 2010. My concern is that this proposed rule will further harm this \nloss of market share by community banks. It will lead to further \nconsolidation in the banking industry.\n  Community banks and credit unions simply cannot compete against Wall \nStreet unless they provide products such as debit cards. They simply \ncannot make up this revenue elsewhere, and they cannot compete unless \nthey provide these services.\n  This notion that some have raised that these proposed rules are a \nslam-dunk for small businesses--it is simply false. Unfortunately, this \nis one of the many misconceptions that have been put out there.\n  For example, based on statements I have heard, some would have you \nbelieve we have been working and analyzing the debit interchange issue \nfor years, talking about all the hearings we have had on this topic.\n  The truth is, however, quite different. There has been just one \nSenate hearing on this issue since 2006, and it was regarding the \ninterchange fees paid by the Federal Government. The Judiciary \nCommittee has looked at antitrust issues, but they have never addressed \nthe ramifications of this amendment--never. No one has been able to \nexplain to me why studying the impact of this rule is a bad idea.\n  Am I suggesting the debit interchange system is without fault? \nAbsolutely not. But we should not move forward with a rule that will \ncreate a whole new set of problems and will hurt community banks and \ncredit unions until we have fully studied the impact. If we do not \nmeasure twice and cut once, we are bound to create a whole new set of \nproblems that will hurt small businesses and consumers.\n  I sure would not have stepped into the middle of this fight if I did \nnot think it was critical to the survival of rural America, and to the \njobs and livelihoods of the people who live there. I am in this job not \nbecause I am known as a guy who stands for big banks or Wall Street--\nfar from it. I am the guy in my party who voted against TARP and \nagainst the automaker bailout.\n  I am in this job because rural America needs a voice at the table. \nRural America needs someone on their side, to make sure rural \ncommunities and Main Street businesses do not get stuck with the short \nend of the stick when the Senate makes policies such as this one.\n  We need to stop. We need to study. We need to make sure we are doing \nthe right thing. Therefore, I ask my colleagues for their bipartisan \nsupport on a responsible bipartisan bill to delay this rule so we can \nhave time to study the consequences of this rule--both intended and \nunintended. Our economy cannot afford to let this go into effect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor as someone who has \npracticed medicine in Wyoming, taking care of families all across the \nCowboy State for almost one-quarter of a century. I come as a doctor \ngiving a second opinion, as I have done week after week about this \nbroken health care law that people all around the country are now very \nconcerned about and the impact it is going to have on their own \npersonal lives.\n  We started the whole discussion and debate about health care that the \nAmerican people knew what they wanted: They wanted the care they need, \nfrom a doctor they want, at a cost they can afford. What we have gotten \nis something that does not provide that at all.\n  I saw today in the Washington Post, under the headline ``Budget \nShowdown,'' comments about the President's speech yesterday to the \nNation. He did talk about Medicare and did talk about Medicaid. I \nbelieve that speech was very short, inadequate on the details.\n  It was interesting to see what the Washington Post said about \nMedicaid. It said:\n\n       . . . a senior administration official, speaking to \n     reporters on the condition of anonymity, said that . . . \n     ``the details have not been worked out.''\n\n  So we have an anonymous source, working in the White House, talking \nto reporters, admitting that the details have not been worked out.\n  Yesterday, people heard the President's speech on spending, but it \nseemed to be higher on political attacks than it was on substantive \nspeech--the things we need to be seriously discussing and debating in \nthis country about a huge debt problem with which we are living. The \nPresident did mention one bit of substance, though, that should concern \nthe American people. He said:\n\n       We will slow the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening \n     an independent commission of doctors, nurses, medical \n     experts, and consumers who will look at all the evidence and \n     recommend the best ways to reduce unnecessary spending while \n     protecting access to the services seniors need.\n\n  What this is is a Washington commission--a commission created in the \nhealth law that many know as IPAB. It may sound harmless. It stands for \nthe Independent Payment Advisory Board. Americans, I believe, need to \nknow more about the details as to how this will actually work.\n  Many Americans may not remember that the health care law created this \nunelectable, unaccountable board of Washington bureaucrats who will be \nappointed by the President, and the sole purpose is to cut Medicare \nspending based on arbitrary budget targets. These are cuts above and \nbeyond the $500 billion that was taken from a nearly bankrupt Medicare \nProgram, not to save Medicare for our seniors but to create a whole new \ngovernment entitlement program for someone else. This board empowers 15 \nunelected Washington bureaucrats to make these Medicare cuts, all \nwithout full transparency and accountability to America's seniors and \nto elected officials.\n  So, once again, this board proves that the President and the \nDemocrats in Congress who voted for the health\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\ncare law simply didn't have the political courage to make the tough \nspending decisions themselves. Instead, they took the easy road. They \npulled the classic Washington maneuver--to create a board and punt the \ndecisions to them.\n  Congress gave this board its authority to manage Medicare spending. I \ndidn't vote for it. Members of my side of the aisle didn't vote for it. \nBut this is part of the health care law that was crammed down the \nthroats of the American people. Congress abdicated its responsibility \nto explain to the American people specific payment changes necessary to \nkeep Medicare solvent.\n  Let's take a look at what happens when this board actually makes a \nrecommendation. The recommendation becomes law. The recommendation \nbecomes law. How can we prevent that from becoming law? The \nrecommendation will become law unless the House and the Senate each \nadopt--not by simple majority--each adopt by a three-fifths majority a \nresolution to block them. That is not enough. First, three-fifths of \nthe House, then three-fifths of the Senate, resolutions to block what \nthis board is recommending. Then the House and Senate have to pass \nlegislation to achieve equivalent savings of what this board claims to \nbe saving by the care they deny.\n  This is an incredible concentration of power that should belong in \nCongress to a board of unelected--unelected--individuals who are \nappointed by the President.\n  Is there concern about this? In the House of Representatives, there \nis. There has been a repeal provision created that would repeal this \nboard, and I will tell my colleagues it is a bipartisanly cosponsored \nattempt to repeal this provision.\n  So that is what we are looking at now. Why? Because the President and \nthe Democrats refused to take a leadership role and chose to punt this \ndown the road. They simply threw up their hands and said let someone \nelse do it. This is not health reform that is good for patients, for \nthe providers, the doctors and nurses who take care of those patients, \nor for the taxpayers.\n  Fortunately, Senator Cornyn of Texas has introduced the Health Care \nBureaucrats Elimination Act. This bill would repeal this board in order \nto ensure that the doctor-patient relationship that is important to \nquality health care for all Americans is maintained. I am happy to \ncosponsor that with Senator Cornyn. We will continue to fight to repeal \nand replace this very broken health care law.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, shortly we are going to be having three \nvotes. One vote will be on the budget for our current fiscal year that \nbegan on October 1 and ends on September 30 of this year. I think we \nhave talked about that vote at some length. I took the floor yesterday \nand explained how the negotiated budget for this year is far better \nthan the Republican-passed budget in the House of Representatives, the \noriginal H.R. 1. I pointed out how a budget represents the vision for \nour future, that it is a policy document. I far prefer the agreement \nthat was reached that preserves America's ability to have a competitive \nworkforce.\n  I pointed out yesterday, and I will repeat again today, that the \nbudget we will vote on will maintain most of the funding for NIH basic \nresearch, which is critically important for innovation in America. That \nis the basic research that is used by our high-tech companies so \nAmerica can outinnovate our competitors, whereas the House-passed \nbudget would have cut $1.4 billion from NIH research, or how the \nagreed-to budget will provide for job training and Job Corps pretty \nmuch at the current rates, whereas the Republican-passed House budget \nwould have eliminated most of the funds for job training and 40 percent \nof the funds for the Job Corps; or, for our students and Pell grants, \nmaintaining the funding so students can continue to receive $5,550 \nmaximum under Pell grants. As I pointed out, college education tuition \nis going up. The House-passed budget would have cut 15 percent off of \nthat program.\n  I think perhaps the one that really points to the major difference \nbetween where the Republicans were on the budget and what we finally \nended up with is the Head Start Program. The Head Start Program has \nworked very effectively in all of our States. Children who participate \nin Head Start do much better in life. We know that. The House-passed \nbudget would have cut the number of children in Head Start by 218,000, \neliminating 55,000 teachers and assistants from the Head Start Program. \nI am pleased the agreement reached will maintain all services at Head \nStart so all of our children can continue in that program.\n  The list goes on and on about the compromises that were reached. I \nwish to make clear this was a true compromise. It is not what the \nDemocrats wanted or what the Republicans wanted. It is going to be \npainful. There is a lot I would like to have seen done differently.\n  I wish to point out that the GSA budget is going to be reduced by $1 \nbillion. At the White Oak facility in Maryland for the FDA, we are \ndoing some critically important construction work to bring together the \ndifferent participants for the safety of Americans. That program is \ngoing to be severely slowed as a result of the cut to the GSA budget.\n  I pointed out yesterday that on the environmental front regarding the \nEndangered Species Act, there is a provision that delists the great \nwolf. That shouldn't be targeted for congressional action. That is a \ndangerous precedent for us to set.\n  I pointed out that the Community Development Block Grants are cut. \nEven though the EPA budget which would have been cut by 30 percent with \nthe House-passed budget--we bring that down by 50 percent, so it is \nonly a 15-percent cut, but a 15-percent cut is too large of a cut for \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. The good news is we were able to \nremove those policy riders that would have prevented the Environmental \nProtection Agency from protecting the environment, protecting our \npublic health. Those were eliminated.\n\n  I wish to speak for the next few minutes about the other two votes \nthat will be taking place on the floor in a few moments. They are votes \non what are called correcting resolutions. Let me explain this, because \nI think it might surprise some of the people to learn we are not \ntalking about the amount of dollars that is going to be appropriated in \nthis current year's budget. These are restrictions as to how money can \nbe spent, so it deals with a philosophical agenda, not a budget agenda. \nThis is not about reducing the deficit; this is about trying to impose \na philosophical position on the budget for this year. Let me talk about \nthe two correcting resolutions which I am going to urge my colleagues \nto vote against. One would restrict funds going to Planned Parenthood--\nwomen's health care issues--which I call the war on women. This deals \nwith title X funding.\n  Title X funding is used for preventive health services such as \ncervical cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, immunizations, \ndiabetes and hypertension testing, sexually transmitted disease testing \nand treatment, HIV testing and referrals. Not one dime of Federal money \ncan be used for abortions. That is the current law, the current \nprohibition.\n  Currently, there are approximately 5 million people who benefit from \ntitle X funding with over 4,500 clinics across the Nation. Ninety-one \npercent of the people who take advantage of these clinics have no \nhealth insurance. Less than 25 percent of title X funds go to Planned \nParenthood. Planned Parenthood spends approximately 3 percent of its \ntotal budget on abortion services, not one dime of which is Federal \nfunds--not one dime of which is Federal funds. So this is not about \nabortion; this is about whether we are going to be able to provide \npreventive care to our most vulnerable in America. It is an attack on \nwomen, because women are the basic beneficiaries of title X funds. It \nis going to cost us more money for the use of emergency room services. \nIt makes no sense at all. It is certainly counter to what we all say we \nwant, and that is gender equity in health care in America.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on that correcting resolution.\n  The second correcting resolution is an attempt to repeal the \naffordable\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\ncare act that we celebrated the anniversary of a few weeks ago. If you \nare a senior, you should be concerned about this vote, because now you \nhave a wellness exam annually under Medicare that is reimbursed, so you \ncan take care of your own health care needs. That would be put in \njeopardy.\n  If you are one of the 3.2 million Americans who fall within the so-\ncalled doughnut hole, or the coverage gap for prescription drug \ncoverage, you should be concerned about the repeal. If you got $250 \nlast year, you are going to get 50 percent of the cost of your \nbrandname prescription drugs covered and, by 2020, we are going to \nclose the doughnut hole altogether. That would be eliminated if this \ncorrecting resolution were passed. Seniors should be pleased that at \nleast we were able to extend the solvency of the Medicare Program by 10 \nyears.\n  Frankly, you should be worried about whatever efforts are being made \nhere to privatize the Medicare system, making seniors pay more for \ntheir health care. It starts with this vote later today where we can \nreject the efforts to turn back the clock on Medicare where seniors \nwould have to pay more.\n  If you are a small business owner, you should be pleased by the tax \ncredits that are now available and which this correcting resolution \nwould take away, making it more expensive for employers to provide \nhealth care for their employees.\n  If you are a consumer and are now able to cover your child up to age \n26--1.2 million Americans--the correcting resolution would turn the \nclock back on the progress we have made on fighting the abusive \npractices of private insurance companies in dealing with preexisting \nconditions. If you have a child with asthma, now you can get full \ncoverage. If we turn the clock back by approving that correcting \nresolution, you will be at the mercy of private insurance companies to \nprovide coverage, which is very unlikely to happen.\n  I can talk about emergency room visits where some insurance companies \nrequire preauthorization. I don't know how you get preauthorization \nwhen you need to go to an emergency room. We corrected that in the \naffordable care act. Once again, the correcting resolution we are being \nasked to vote on will turn the clock back on that, putting people at \nthe mercy of private insurance companies as to whether they will cover \nemergency room visits.\n  If you are a taxpayer, which is what we are talking about today with \nthe budget, you should be very much concerned about this correcting \nresolution because by turning back the clock on the affordable care \nact, it will cost the taxpayers over $1.5 trillion over the next 20 \nyears. So it is tailored to your need. If you have pride, as I do, that \nAmerica has at long last said that health care is a right, not a \nprivilege, and recognize that we need to do more to improve our health \ncare system, you want us to move forward and talk about the health care \nissues and try to improve our health care system; you don't want us to \nturn the clock back.\n\n  The large number of people who have no health insurance or have \nrestricted coverage because of the abusive practices of private \ninsurance companies or the inability to cover children after they \ngraduate from college--that has now been corrected. We certainly don't \nbelieve a correcting resolution would take that away from us.\n  We are going to have three votes. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst both of these correcting resolutions. They are attacks on \nwomen's health care issues and attacks on quality health care for all \nAmericans. We need to pass the budget, and these correcting resolutions \nshould be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2474-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2474-S2476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WHISTLEBLOWERS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Since January, I have been investigating allegations \nfrom whistleblowers at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. \nThe allegations I have received are shocking, but sadly they appear to \nbe true. Praise the Lord for the whistleblowers in this government \nbecause we don't know where the skeletons are buried, and they help us \nto do our constitutional role of oversight and the checks and balances \nof government.\n  The ATF, which is supposed to stop criminals from trafficking guns to \nMexican drug cartels, was actually making that trafficking of arms \neasier for them. That would be bad enough if it happened because of \nincompetence or turf battles, but it looks as if the agency was doing \nthis on purpose. The government actually encouraged gun dealers to sell \nmultiple firearms to known and suspected traffickers.\n  Two of those guns ended up at the scene of a murder of a U.S. Border \nPatrol agent in Arizona. His name was Brian Terry. His family deserves \nanswers from their very own government. I have been fighting for those \nanswers. I have written eight letters to the Justice Department. I have \nasked for documents. I have asked that specific questions be answered.\n  At first, the Justice Department simply denied the charges. Then one \nof the whistleblowers went on television. He risked his career to tell \nthe truth on ``CBS Evening News.'' He had a sense of duty to Agent \nTerry's family and, in turn, to the entire population of this great \ncountry. He could not believe his own government refused to come clean \nand tell the truth when questioned by this U.S. Senator. He went public \nto set the record straight.\n  Other whistleblowers have confirmed what this whistleblower said. In \nfact, I received internal government documents that confirmed what he \nsaid. Anonymous patriots tried to ensure that the truth would come out. \nYou know, that is about the only crime whistleblowers commit--\ncommitting truth. Isn't that sad?\n  I forwarded many of those documents that I received clandestinely to \nAttorney General Holder and Acting Director Melson. I asked them how to \nsquare the denials from that Department with the evidence I have \nreceived both orally and on paper.\n  At Attorney General Holder's confirmation hearing--now 2 years ago--I \ntold him:\n\n       I expect that you will be responsive to my oversight work \n     and that my questions and document requests will be taken \n     seriously. . . . I hope that I have your assurance that if \n     you are confirmed, you will assist me with oversight \n     activities, be responsive to my requests, and help me make \n     the Justice Department accountable.\n\n  Now, the Attorney General, who was the nominee at that time, \nresponded:\n\n       I will try to do all that I can to make sure that we \n     respond fully and in a timely fashion to the very legitimate \n     questions that I know you have propounded to the Department.\n\n  But now, ironically, I have provided more internal documents to the \nJustice Department in this investigation than the Justice Department \nhas provided to me. Now, instead of issuing denials, do you know what \nhappened? It happens all the time when you are doing oversight work, \nwith almost any agency. But in this case, the Justice Department has \ncircled the wagon. They have clammed up.\n  The President of the United States admitted on Spanish language \ntelevision that ``certain mistakes'' may have been made here in the \ninstance of this investigation. He and Attorney General Holder say they \ndidn't authorize a policy change that allowed criminals to walk away \nwith guns. But there was a change in policy that went tragically wrong. \nThe prophecy of a lot of whistleblowers turned out to be fact, sadly. \nSo Congress needs to find out what did the highest senior officials \nknow and when did they know it.\n  The purpose of the policy change was to go after leaders high up in \nthe chain of command and bring down a drug cartel. Nobody can find \nfault with that. But prosecutors didn't want to just go after criminals \nwho just lie on Federal forms to buy guns for trafficking; they wanted \nto go after the really big fish. The problem is this: They let so many \nlittle fish keep operating that between 1,300 and 1,700 guns got away. \nThat is just in this one case in Arizona that I can document. Hundreds \nof these guns have, in turn, turned up in crimes on both sides of the \nborder--some in Mexico and some in the United States.\n  Federal agents often have to walk a fine line in trying to catch the \nbad guys. They sometimes have to allow a crime to progress to make sure \neveryone involved in the conspiracy gets caught. I understand that. \nThat can be\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\nlegitimate, but you have to look at it this way. It is very serious \nbusiness. It is quite a gamble, you might say. There have to be careful \ncontrols in an operation like I just described. Law enforcement should \nnot cross the line into actually assisting criminals just for the \nsimple process of gathering information. Operations should be carefully \nfocused on stopping crime without risking public safety. Seizing \ncontraband and making arrests are the most important goals. Big, \nheadline-grabbing cases to advance some prosecutor's career should take \na backseat in any of these gambles.\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter to Attorney General Holder with some more \ndocuments. So I am sending the Department documents I would like to \nhave them send me. These are documents that maybe the Attorney General \nhimself didn't know about.\n  There are e-mails between a federally licensed firearms dealer and \nthe supervisor in this Arizona case known as ``fast and furious.'' In \none e-mail, the dealer raises, for a third time now, his concerns about \nhow the case is being handled. This time, he was prompted by a story on \nFOX News about the growing firearms problem on our border with Mexico. \nThe dealer wrote--and this is a long quote which I will start now:\n\n       The segment is disturbing to me. I shared my concerns with \n     you guys that I wanted to make sure that none of the firearms \n     that were sold per our conversation with you and various ATF \n     agents could, or would ever, end up south of the border and \n     in the hands of the bad guys. I want to help ATF with its \n     investigation, but not at the risk of agents' safety, because \n     I have some very close friends that are U.S. Border Patrol \n     agents in southern Arizona.\n\n  Now, maybe one of those friends, for all I know, was Agent Terry, and \nhe got murdered--or at least we think he did--with one of these guns. \nThese guns were at the scene, at least. That e-mail I quoted was sent \nto the supervisor of the case 6 months before guns from that case were \nfound at the scene of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry's murder.\n  The government put these firearms dealers in a completely unfair \nposition. Let me explain that. On the one hand, these gun dealers rely \nupon the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms for their license to \neven be able to be in business. So of course these dealers want to \ncooperate with the government when they have this big club hanging over \ntheir head: Will you be licensed or not? On the other hand, the \ngovernment asks these gun dealers to keep selling to the bad guys even \nafter the dealers warned it might end in tragedy.\n  I am going to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. The \nHouse Oversight Committee has joined in my effort and issued a subpoena \nfor documents because it might duplicate the process in the House.\n  I have not sought any subpoenas or hearings in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee yet. I have not exercised my right to object to any unanimous \nconsent request on nominations because of this issue yet. However, I \nwant my colleagues and officials at the Justice Department to hear this \nloud and clear: If that is what it takes, then I will take those \nactions. I hope it doesn't have to come to that. I hope the Justice \nDepartment will decide to cooperate and provide the information we \nneed, doing our constitutional responsibility of oversight, to make \nsure the checks and balances of the system of government under our \nConstitution is working. It has been nearly 3 months since I first \nraised this issue. It is past time for the Justice Department to come \nclean.\n  I ask unanimous consent to printed in the Record a copy of this \nletter to Attorney General Holder.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2011.\n     Hon. Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Pennsylvania \n         Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Holder: At approximately 1:30 p.m. \n     yesterday, my staff learned that the Justice Department was \n     making four documents available at 2:00 p.m. for Chairman \n     Darrell Issa's staff to review regarding the controversy over \n     ATF's Project Gunrunner, Operation Fast and Furious, and the \n     death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. These documents are \n     among those I requested in February of this year. Yet, the \n     Justice Department refused to make them available for my \n     staff to review. In fact, the Justice Department has produced \n     not one single page of documents in response to my inquiries.\n       Thus far, I have not requested that Chairman Leahy join in \n     any document requests, consider any subpoenas, or schedule \n     any hearings into this matter in the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. Any such request would be unnecessary and \n     duplicative of the process on the House side, so long as any \n     documents provided there are also provided to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee at the same time.\n       The Department's failure to cooperate with my requests is \n     especially troubling in light of the February 4, 2011, reply \n     to my initial letter. In that reply, the Justice Department \n     took the position that those allegations were ``false'' and \n     specifically denied ``that ATF `sanctioned' or otherwise \n     knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons'' to straw \n     purchasers. The letter further claimed that ``ATF makes every \n     effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased \n     illegally and prevent their transportation to Mexico.''\n       I already provided evidence contradicting that denial in my \n     February 9 and March 3 letters. In addition, attached you \n     will find further documentation undermining the Department's \n     assertion. Specifically, the documents are emails between ATF \n     officials and a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) in Arizona. \n     These emails demonstrate that ATF instructed gun dealers to \n     engage in suspicious sales despite the dealers' concerns. The \n     emails refer to meetings between the FFL and the U.S. \n     Attorney's office to address the concerns being raised by the \n     FFL. ATF supervisor David Voth wrote on April 13, 2010:\n       I understand that the frequency with which some individuals \n     under investigation by our office have been purchasing \n     firearms from your business has caused concerns for you. . . \n     . However, if it helps put you at ease we (ATF) are \n     continually monitoring these suspects using a variety of \n     investigative techniques which I cannot go into [in] detail.\n       In response, the gun dealer expresses concern about \n     potential future liability and sought something in writing to \n     address the issue explicitly:\n       For us, we were hoping to put together something like a \n     letter of understanding to alleviate concerns of some type of \n     recourse against us down the road for selling these items. We \n     just want to make sure we are cooperating with ATF and that \n     we are not viewed as selling to bad guys.\n       Following this email, the ATF arranged a meeting between \n     the FFL and the U.S. Attorney's office. According to the FFL, \n     the U.S. Attorney's office scheduled a follow-up meeting with \n     the FFL, but asked that the FFL's attorney not be present.\n       At the meeting on May 13, 2010, the U.S. Attorney's office \n     declined to provide anything in writing but assured the gun \n     dealer in even stronger terms that there were safeguards in \n     place to prevent further distribution of the weapons after \n     being purchased from his business. As we now know, those \n     assurances proved to be untrue. On June 17, 2010, the gun \n     dealer wrote to the ATF to again express concerns after \n     seeing a report on Fox News about firearms and the border:\n       The segment, if the information was correct, is disturbing \n     to me. When you, [the Assistant U.S. Attorney], and I met on \n     May 13th, I shared my concerns with you guys that I wanted to \n     make sure that none of the firearms that were sold per our \n     conversation with you and various ATF agents could or would \n     ever end up south of the border or in the hands of the bad \n     guys. . . . I want to help ATF with its investigation but not \n     at the risk of agents' safety because I have some very close \n     friends that are U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern AZ[.]\n       Incredibly, the FFL sent this email six months before guns \n     from the same ATF operation were found at the scene of Border \n     Patrol Agent Brian Terry's murder. So, not only were the ATF \n     agents who later blew the whistle predicting that this \n     operation would end in tragedy, so were the gun dealers--even \n     as ATF urged them to make the sales.\n       Furthermore, according to the FFL, there were ``one or \n     two'' occasions on which his employees actually witnessed and \n     recorded with surveillance cameras an exchange of money \n     between the straw purchaser and another individual on the \n     premises. Despite this actual knowledge of a straw purchase, \n     the dealer said ATF officials wanted him to proceed with the \n     transaction. However, his employees refused to process the \n     sale.\n       In light of this new evidence, the Justice Department's \n     claim that the ATF never knowingly sanctioned or allowed the \n     sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers is simply not \n     credible. As you know, I have multiple document and \n     information requests pending with various components of the \n     Justice Department. Unfortunately, however, it appears that \n     senior Department officials are not allowing the components \n     to respond fully and directly.\n       Please provide written answers to the following questions \n     by no later than April 20, 2011:\n       1. Do you stand by the assertion in the Department's reply \n     that the ATF whistleblower allegations are ``false'' and \n     specifically that ATF did not sanction or otherwise knowingly \n     allow the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers? If so, \n     please explain why in light of the mounting evidence to the \n     contrary.\n       2. Will you commit to providing the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee with documents, or access to documents, \n     simultaneously with the\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n     House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform? If not, \n     please explain why not.\n       If you have any questions regarding this request, please \n     have your staff contact Jason Foster at (202) 224-5225. Thank \n     you for your prompt attention these important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I want to talk about immigration and a part of the \nimmigration issue that concerns me, and, by golly, it has something to \ndo with government oversight as well.\n  Last August, some lawyers at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nService drafted internal memos outlining ways that the administration \ncould get around Congress and grant undocumented aliens in the United \nStates legal status. These amnesty memos outline ways that the \nexecutive branch could use discretionary authority to make sure \nthousands--who knows, maybe millions--of people here illegally could \nstay here without a vote of Congress.\n  A number of Republicans sent a letter to President Obama urging him \nto abandon any such plan. We sent several letters to Homeland Security \nSecretary Napolitano asking for statistics and a briefing on these \nmemos. We asked for assurances that such plans to bypass Congress--I \nemphasize ``plans to bypass Congress''--not be implemented. What did we \nget? All we got was radio silence.\n  I raise this issue again today because I am bothered by reports that \nthere is another push for this administration to grant amnesty through \nExecutive order, which only should be done by the law of this Congress, \nto certain groups of undocumented populations. Surprisingly, the push \nfor this is coming from our friends on the other side of the aisle. \nYesterday, 22 Democrats sent a letter to President Obama asking him to \nturn a blind eye to the law. These 22 Senators said they were OK with \nhaving an executive branch go ahead and go around Congress and grant \namnesty to those who would be eligible under the so-called DREAM Act. \nThese Senators said they didn't have the votes to get the bill through \nthe Senate last year.\n  Their approach is in a nonconstitutional fashion to ask the President \nto have his administration use what is referred to legally as \nprosecutorial discretion to keep these undocumented individuals here. \nThey claim doing so would be ``consistent with our strong interest in \nthe rule of law.'' They say doing so would ``help to conserve limited \nenforcement resources.''\n  I am appalled, and I hope a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle are appalled, that Members of this body think that an Executive \norder to grant amnesty behind our backs is not an assault on the \ndemocratic process. Congress has the power to change immigration laws \nand only Congress has the power to change immigration laws. The \nPresident has limited authority to grant relief in limited and \nemergency circumstances. I support the President's power to do that, \nbut it was not meant to be used in a blanket fashion. The request by 22 \nMembers of this body is an affront to our country's longstanding belief \nin the rule of law, and it is an attack on this body's duty to \nlegislate on behalf of the American people, a power to legislate that \nthe President does not have.\n  I happen to agree that our immigration policies have to be reformed. \nI will commit to moving legislation that expands upon or improves the \nlegal avenue we currently have in place. Once again, we have not seen \nleadership by this President to work on a bill this Congress can \nsupport. Until that time comes, it would be foolish and disappointing \nif this President circumvented the democratic process and did what 22 \nMembers of this body asked him to do in the letter to which I referred.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise near the end of this very \nimportant and profoundly significant budget debate to make some points \nnot only about the dollars and cents in our health care system, but \nalso to speak about a growing and persistent threat--the threat of \nirresponsible cutbacks to vital health care services for our Nation's \nmost vulnerable--in the name of an ideological war on women's health \ncare.\n  Our Nation is in the midst of a fiscal crisis. We need to recognize \nthat there is a very immediate and important imperative to cut the \ncosts of health care in this country. The costs of health care are \nspiraling out of control at a rate five times the rate of inflation.\n  The President, commendably, is talking about the need for serious \nmeasures and sensible conversation about what can be done to control \nand reduce the costs of health care. Just this week, the administration \ninitiated Partnership for Patients, which is another step in the \nPresident's continuing efforts, and I believe this body's continuing \nefforts, to prevent and reduce needless costs to our health care \nsystem. For example, reducing the incidence of re-admissions to \nhospitals and providing for better outpatient treatment after people \nare out of the hospital; reducing the incidence of hospital inquired \ninfections; to reducing the incidence of overprescription--or \nmisprescribed drugs--these kinds of costs are preventable. We have an \nobligation to reduce those costs in health care when they are \npreventable.\n  Higher quality at lower cost has to be our objective. And, lowering \ncosts also means preventive care for women when they cannot afford it. \nThat is what Planned Parenthood does. The threat of H. Con. Res. 36 is \nto that profoundly important goal--higher quality health care at lower \ncost--that we can achieve as a nation if we invest in preventive care.\n  The threat of H. Con. Res. 36 is, therefore, not only to the 1.4 \nmillion Medicaid patients across the country who would be deprived of \nthat preventive care, and not only to the more than 60,000 women in \nConnecticut who are at risk, but to all of us, to our families, and to \nour fiscal health. We know Planned Parenthood saves $4 for every $1 \ninvested. Smart investments that go to provide the Pap smears, breast \nexams, and other kinds of preventive health care that not only save our \nhealth care system money, but that are an absolutely critical part of \nhigh quality health care in the United States.\n  But this debate is about more than costs. It is about human beings. \nIt is about those women who need that preventive care for their future \nand their family's futures and eventually for their children's futures. \nEvery woman across our Nation, including 1.4 million Medicaid patients \nwho consider Planned Parenthood their primary source for preventive \nhealth, deserves to visit a health care provider she trusts--a health \ncare provider that many of us have in this body whether we are men or \nwomen.\n  I am talking about women such as Rebecca in Meriden, CT. Rebecca's \nparents' health coverage did not extend to her, and she made too much \nmoney to qualify for Connecticut's Husky Program--too much money \nmeaning $10 an hour and working part time, a total of $10,000--too much \nmoney to qualify for Husky. She depended on Planned Parenthood for \nregular health screenings and contraceptive care. As she said in her \nown words:\n\n       Planned Parenthood was my saving grace for my reproductive \n     health.\n\n  Women such as Maya, a 23-year-old uninsured young woman, a waitress, \npart time, doing an unpaid internship for a nonprofit organization. She \nwent to Planned Parenthood for her routine Pap smear, and the results \nshowed abnormal cells that required a biopsy and an operation to have \nthe precancerous cells removed. That procedure could have been \nlifesaving for Maya; as are all of the routine screenings that Planned \nParenthood provides for countless women across the country and in \nConnecticut. All of these procedures take place day in and day out \naround Connecticut, for a price they can afford. These stories from \nRebecca and Maya are heard around our Nation, at least 60,000 strong in \nConnecticut alone.\n  As Martin Masselli, Community Health Center advocate and the \npresident of Community Health Care, Inc. in Middletown, recently said:\n\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\n\n       Defunding Planned Parenthood would be the moral equivalent \n     of turning off the electricity and a whole segment of health \n     care would go dark.\n\n  That is what H. Con. Res. 36 means in human terms. In dollars and \ncents: preventive health care, the kind of work done by St. Vincent's \nin Bridgeport and Hartford Hospital, and Yale-New Haven hosptial, and \ncountless others around the State and in the country because our \nhospitals and health care providers are responding responsibly to the \nneed for higher quality and lower costs. We must preserve the momentum \nto move forward and to make sure the promise, as well as the \nobligation, the opportunity as well as the mandate, is fulfilled.\n  I call for my Senate colleagues to stand together for women such as \nRebecca and Maya and for clinics and hospitals and providers across the \nNation who depend on Planned Parenthood and to reject this resolution, \nto reject the effort to turn back the clock and to settle this debate \nonce and for all, to end the ideological war which has itself nothing \nto do with saving money; that in fact, will cost more than it saves. I \ncall for us to turn our attention, as we should and we must, to people \nwho want us to put America back to work to create jobs, to foster \neconomic growth, to fulfill the mandate that was articulated and \nexpressed so eloquently by the people of this country in this last \nelection, which was not to wage war on women's health.\n  The message was to put Connecticut and put America back to work, \ncreate jobs and continue our fragile economic recovery.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2477-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2477-S2488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today we are going to vote on last year's \nunfinished business. We are going to vote on a continuing resolution \nthat will fund the government through this fiscal year, which ends on \nSeptember 30. The proposal we have before us in order to fund the \ngovernment through the end of the fiscal year certainly is not perfect. \nIn fact, there are many--myself included--who would like to see it make \ndeeper reductions in spending. That said, we will be voting on a \nproposal that will cut spending by around $40 billion this year, and \nwhen you look at baseline spending over the next decade actually saves \nover $300 billion over the 10-year period.\n  What strikes me about that is that it will be the first time in a \nlong time that we have done something about reducing spending. That is \nnot something routinely or traditionally done here. In fact, we are \ngoing to reverse a trend that began a long time ago but accelerated a \ncouple years ago when nonnational security discretionary spending \nincreased by almost 25 percent in the last 2 years.\n  This is an important first step. Granted, it is a first step, and in \na minute, I am going to get to the bigger issue, but it is critical \nthat we send a message and signal to the American people that we have \nheard their voices loudly and clearly and we get what they want us to \ndo; that is, to get spending under control, shrink the size of the \nFederal Government, to get it to live within its means, and to quit \nspending money that we do not have in Washington. That is something \nthat has been happening here for a long time. It has taken on a whole \nnew dimension in the last couple of years.\n  As we talk about the unfinished business of last year, trying to get \na measure in place that will fund the government through the end of the \nyear, that will reduce spending by about $40 billion, we are talking \nabout the smaller part of overall spending when we look at the \nmacroeconomic view or pull back to what some would say to the 30,000-\nft. view and look at spending over the next decade. In fact, we had \nsomeone testify in the Finance Committee yesterday, the former \nComptroller General David Walker. He put it well when he said talking \nabout funding in the continuing resolution is like arguing about the \nbar tab on the Titanic. We are on a sinking ship, and we need to do \neverything we can in the short term, getting maximum amount of spending \nreduction, but then we need to pivot and start talking about the next \nbig battle, and that is the battle over the 2012 budget. Ironically, we \nare just now getting to the 112th Congress's business because we are \nwrapping up the business of the 111th Congress. The Democratic \nleadership here didn't pass a budget last year or a single \nappropriations bill. As a consequence, we are voting here now on a \ncontinuing resolution to do last year's business to get us through the \nend of this fiscal year before we can start the work of the 2012 \nbudget, which is where I think the big debate will begin about how we \nget this country back on a more reasonable fiscal path.\n\n  We have seen a couple of developments here in the last 2 weeks or so \nthat bear on that debate. One is last week, when we had the \nintroduction by the House Republicans of a budget plan, a 10-year \nbudget plan that was very aggressive in trying to take on the issue of \nspending and debt, very aggressive in trying to put progrowth policies \nin place that would help grow the economy and create jobs and that gets \nour economy back on track in this country. That was kind of the big \ndiscussion last week.\n  The President, I believe, felt left out of that discussion, so \nyesterday he decided to make a speech in which he would lay out his \nvision for the next decade and how we address the big challenges this \ncountry needs to tackle. I would describe that speech as a do-over \nbecause the President's first trip to the plate was really his budget, \nwhich he submitted a couple of months ago. That budget was \nconspicuously bereft of any effort to address the really big challenges \nfacing the country. It didn't talk about how we are going to reform \nentitlements, didn't address tax reform, and it actually increased \nspending--increased taxes and increased the debt dramatically over the \nnext decade. It nearly doubled the gross debt from $13 trillion or $14 \ntrillion to over $26 trillion, and that is using I think pretty \noptimistic economic assumptions.\n  That being said, because the President didn't address any of the big \nissues in his budget and because the House Republicans put a proposal \nforward last week which would, I think he felt as if he needed to get \nin the game. So yesterday he made a stridently partisan speech in which \nhe tried to put forth a plan. I would argue that speech yesterday was \nvery long on politics and very short on substance. There wasn't a lot \nin there to really sink your teeth into if you are someone who believes \nseriously that we need to make reforms in entitlement programs. There \nwas the usual prescription for dealing with the deficit and the debt, \nwhich consisted of increasing taxes. There are tax increases in here, \ntax increases in the President's proposal on small businesses--the job \ncreators in our economy.\n  I would point out to my colleagues that half of all small business \nincome is taxed at the individual level because many small businesses \nallow the income from that business to flow through to their individual \ntax return. In fact, the number of small businesses that would be \nimpacted by his proposal employ about 35 million people in our economy. \nSo you are talking about raising taxes on the job creators, on the \npeople who really are employing people across this country, and that \nwas a key element in the President's prescription for dealing with the \nfiscal crisis this country faces.\n  Another element of the President's plan was relying on this proposal \nthat was part of the health care reform bill to squeeze provider \npayments under Medicare to try to wring a little more out of Medicare. \nHe relies on an independent payment advisory board which would be \nempowered to go ahead and make reductions, to make cuts in provider \npayments. What is interesting about that is the health care reform bill \nlast year did make some significant cuts to providers, not to reform \nMedicare but to create the new health care entitlement program, which, \nwhen it is fully implemented, will cost $2.5 trillion. So that is what \nthe President used--any savings that were achieved in Medicare last \nyear. So when he talks\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\nabout now using this independent payment advisory board to make further \nreductions in provider payments, it is relying on the same old tried-\nand-true formula. I say tried and true, but it is actually a tried-and-\nfailed formula that has been in place before.\n  There is no reform in this proposal. There is nothing new or \ninnovative that says: Let's figure out a way to solve this Nation's \nfiscal problems, something that actually gets at the heart of the \nproblem and doesn't use the same old failed prescriptions that have \nbeen used in the past.\n  I frankly don't know what is going to happen. If you continue to cut \npayments to physicians and to hospitals, you will find fewer and fewer \nmedical providers who are going to serve Medicare and Medicaid patients \nin this country. It is as simple as that. When you lose a little on \neach transaction, on each customer or each patient you serve, you have \nto cost shift and make up for it by shifting more of the cost over to \nprivate payers, which continues to drive health care costs for \neverybody who is not receiving their health care from some government \nprogram even higher and higher. So there wasn't anything in there that \nI would suggest really gets at this problem.\n  Also conspicuously absent from that speech was anything to do with \nreforming Social Security. We all know Social Security is also a \nprogram which ran a deficit last year. It looks as if it will be in the \nblack this year but next year it starts running deficits and runs them \nwell into the future. We have to make that program solvent, not just \nfor the senior citizens who are benefiting from it today, those who are \nnearing retirement age, but for the next generation. The President \ndecided to punt on that subject as well.\n  So, as I said, the speech yesterday was long on politics, short on \nsubstance, and short on a meaningful discussion about how we get at and \naddress and fix these enormous fiscal challenges we face.\n  The other thing the President does is he uses a 12-year timeframe. We \nnormally operate here on a 10-year budget window. That is what the \nHouse and the Senate do. It is typically what the White House does when \nit submits a budget to Congress. So he stretched that out to 12 years, \nperhaps maybe to lessen the impact of some of the few reductions he \ndoes make in his budget, but nevertheless it is a very different \nschedule, in terms of the proposal he makes, relative to the one that \ncame forth last week from the House Republicans.\n  The reason this whole debate is important is because we continue to \nspend and spend as if there is no tomorrow, and it is money we just \nflat don't have. This year, we will take in $2.2 trillion, spend $3.7 \nor $3.8 trillion, and we are going to run a $1.6 trillion deficit. I \nhave said this before on the floor, but it is now 1:20 in the afternoon \ntoday, and by tomorrow, Friday, at 1:20 in the afternoon, we will have \nadded over $4 billion to the Federal debt. That is the rate at which \nthe spending and debt problem is going today. We cannot continue on \nthis path.\n  Some people would argue--the President and some of our colleagues on \nthe Democratic side--that the way you fix this is ``have a balanced \napproach'' that raises taxes, that there has to be a tax increase as a \npart of this. I don't think the American people ought to have their \ntaxes raised until we demonstrate a willingness to get at the heart of \nthe problem.\n  The problem here in Washington is not a revenue problem, it is a \nspending problem. The numbers bear that out. If you look at the last 40 \nyears of American history, the average amount we spend on the Federal \nGovernment as a percentage of our total economy is 20.6 percent. A \nlittle over one-fifth of our entire economic output is spending by the \nFederal Government. This year we will spend over 25 percent of our \ntotal economy on the Federal Government. So we have seen the Federal \nGovernment, in relation to our total economy, grow by about 20 percent \nover the historical average just in the last couple of years. In the \nlast 2 years of this administration, we have added almost $3.5 trillion \nto the Federal debt.\n  As I said before, spending increased--non-national security, \ndiscretionary spending increased in the last 2 years by almost 25 \npercent at a time when inflation in the overall economy was only \ngrowing at 2 percent. So you have the Federal Government spending at \nsomewhere on the order of 10 times or more than 10 times the rate of \ninflation. You can't defend or justify that to the American people.\n  The American people have a right to know we are serious about getting \nspending under control, as evidenced by the report of the Government \nAccountability Office a few weeks back where they looked at about one-\nthird of the overall government to determine where there was \nduplication and where there was wasteful spending. They came up with a \nnumber of conclusions in that report, one of which was that there are \n82 programs--82 programs--at the Federal Government that deal with \nteacher training spread across 20 agencies or so of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  Can you believe this--56 programs that teach financial literacy. \nImagine Washington, DC, lecturing or instructing anybody around this \ncountry about financial literacy, of all things, but there are 56 \nprograms spread across 10 different agencies or departments of \ngovernment that deal with financial literacy. I mean, the American \npeople have to be thinking, get serious.\n  This is the kind of thing that outrages and frustrates the American \npeople. That is why I think they want us to singularly focus on \nreducing spending and getting this debt under control not by raising \ntheir taxes in the middle of an economic downturn, particularly taxes \non our small businesses that will create the jobs to get the economy \nback on track but by reducing spending. That is where this debate ought \nto be centered. Regrettably, as I said, the President, in his speech \nyesterday, immediately latched on to the idea that we need to raise \ntaxes on our small businesses, on our job creators.\n  Well, we are going to have the chance, after the vote today on the \ncontinuing resolution--assuming that it passes--and then wrapping up \nlast year's unfinished business, to shift to this debate about the debt \nlimit. The debt limit will be the next major issue coming along that \nwill present an opportunity for both Republicans and Democrats to \nengage in a debate about how to solve this country's fiscal problems, \nstarting with measures we put in place that put caps on spending.\n  We have to get spending under control, and then we will have a debate \nabout the 2012 budget. It is unclear to me at this point whether the \nSenate will do a budget at all. The House of Representatives clearly \nwill. They passed it out of their Budget Committee, and they are going \nto vote on it today. They are going to put forward a plan that does \nreduce spending by over $6 trillion over the next 10 years, that brings \nreforms to our Tax Code, that lowers marginal income tax rates on our \nbusinesses and our individuals, and that hopefully will create economic \ngrowth and development out there and create jobs.\n  It is a budget that changes the way we look at some of these \ntraditional entitlement programs, insulating and protecting everybody \nwho is over the age of 55. And that is the ironic thing about it, \nbecause our colleagues on the other side get up and immediately attack \nthis proposal as cutting benefits to senior citizens. The House plan \nthat was put forward does not impact anybody over the age of 55. So if \nyou are retired today and drawing Medicare benefits or if you are \nnearing retirement age, under this particular proposal, you are \nunaffected. It would affect those younger than 55 who are beginning to \nlook at the retirement years and wondering whether any of these \nprograms are even going to be around for them. We can make those \nprograms sustainable and viable for younger Americans who are willing \nto look at these things in a new way. The House budget does that.\n  It makes reforms that put the patient back in charge, the consumer \nback in charge, that I think draws on the great impulses of tradition \nin this country--competition, choice, allowing people to have more \nopportunity and more flexibility to choose a plan that works for them.\n  It seems, at least to me, that we have to get to a new model because \nthe current model clearly doesn't work. It is an example of government \nspending that, if it perpetuates, has a $38 trillion unfunded liability \nin Medicare alone and has further unfunded liabilities in Social \nSecurity.\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\n  We have a major problem in this country, and it needs to be \naddressed. It starts with the debate on the debt limit and then \nhopefully on the 2012 budget. I am glad to see the President finally \nhaving a proposal out there and engaging in this debate. Unfortunately, \nhis vision is the wrong vision for the future of this country. But it \nis high time the American people saw us have this debate, take these \nissues on, and let's hope we can come together behind a proposal that \nwill reduce spending, reduce debt, and put us more on a fiscal footing \nthat is good for future generations and that gets this economy going \nand creates jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are going to be voting sometime \ntoday. I am concerned about the tea party Republican assault on the \nhealth of American women because that is what we are going to be \ndeciding. The focus on this has little to do with deficit reduction \nbecause better health automatically saves money. This assault is an \nattempt to change individual behavior to a standard that the tea party \npeople see as proper for others exercising their own free will. It \ncontains an element of unfathomable hypocrisy for those voting to kill \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  As Members of Congress, we all have immediate access to first-class \nhealth plans. We never have to think about health coverage for \nourselves or our spouses or our children--it is all in the package. \nThere is no decision to make between paying a medical bill or paying \nthe rent; no decision to make between buying medicine and buying \ngroceries; no decision to make between going into a hospital or going \ninto bankruptcy. Yet the Republicans here are trying to take health \ncare away from women, children, and families across America. They want \nto completely defund Planned Parenthood, an organization that has been \nserving women and families in America for more than 90 years.\n  Today Planned Parenthood operates more than 800 centers that serve 3 \nmillion women each and every year. For many women, Planned Parenthood \nis a critical source of medical care. To women who cannot afford \ncoverage, Planned Parenthood says don't worry, your health is more \nimportant.\n  They do not just offer counseling on family planning, they also offer \nlifesaving breast exams and cervical cancer screenings. Look at this. \nEighty centers nationwide serve 3 million patients each year, provide \n800,000 breast cancer screenings, provide 1 million cervical cancer \nscreenings. That is so important. Cancer screenings save lives. Since \nthe 1950s, cervical cancer screenings have cut mortality rates by more \nthan 70 percent. Remember, treating cancer and other diseases early \nenough saves health care dollars in the long run.\n  But this is not just about sound fiscal policy or better accounting. \nNo. No. They want to tell women, millions of them, if you cannot afford \nit, tough luck. Tough luck. This is about the tea party Republicans \nremaking America in their own image. Their real goal is to impose their \nradical ideology on American women.\n  They want to come into our homes, tell the women in our families how \nto live their lives. This issue is deeply personal to me. My wife and I \nhave five daughters and eight granddaughters, and nothing is more \nimportant to me than their health, their well being, and their freedom \nto make choices that suit their needs.\n  If we kill funding for Planned Parenthood, millions of women will \nlose access to essential care. Those tea party Republicans claim that \nwill help close our deficit of dollars. But it will leave us with a \ndeficit of decency. It is not just women's health the tea party \nRepublicans are after, it is also health care for middle-class families \nacross America.\n  They want to stop the landmark health reform law dead in its tracks. \nThis is the law that adds 32 million Americans on the rolls of the \ninsured.\n  So here is what I say to colleagues on the other side: If you do not \nwant ordinary people to have affordable coverage, then show some \nsincerity and throw in the coverage you have. Be honest. Vote no, and \ntell your constituents why you are doing this, and say you mean it when \nyou say no, and I am giving up my coverage to prove it. I am talking to \nSenators on the side of taking away the funding, and talking to Members \nof the House of Representatives to say no and mean no.\n  The health reform law makes health care more affordable, more \naccessible, and more sustainable, and holds insurers more accountable. \nIt makes medicine more affordable for seniors by closing the doughnut \nhole in the Medicare prescription drug benefit program.\n  The new law also allows young adults to stay on their parents' health \nplans until age 26, and it gives small businesses tax credits to help \nthem provide their employees with medical coverage. Without this law, \ninsurers could once again restrict benefits, rescind coverage when \npeople get sick, and refuse care to children with preexisting \nconditions. I do not think we want to return to the days when insurers \ncould turn their back and turn away sick children.\n  Life for me was upfront and personal when it came to my family's \nhealth care needs. I grew up in a working-class family in Patterson, \nNJ. My father worked in the local silk mills, and he died of cancer at \nage 43, leaving my mother a widow at age 37. Our family struggled in \nbankruptcy as my father's life ebbed away. My mother owed doctors, \nhospitals, pharmacies, money we did not have. After my service in \nEurope in the Army, because there was a government program, I was able \nto get my education through the GI bill. I joined two friends and built \na company so successful that it is hard to imagine. It employs 45,000 \npeople today, operating in more than 20 countries. Three of us from \npoor families. For me the GI bill made the difference. It is government \nstepping in when it was needed, and has put 45,000 people across this \nworld to work.\n  That is what government is about. It is there to be helpful. This is \nnot just an accounting office. It is not just a fiscal policy problem. \nBecause of my success in business, I never had to worry again about \nwhether I could provide health care for my family. I never forgot what \nit was like to be without health care.\n  We need the health reform law, because no American should ever have \nto make sacrifices to afford health care. Americans are beginning to \nexperience the benefits of this law. Why now would we want to put the \nprogress on hold?\n  I agree, we have serious economic problems in our country. But we are \nnot going to solve them by taking health care away from American women \nand families. Do not take away this critical assistance for people who \ncannot afford the care they need. If we have fiscal problems, if we \nhave debt and deficit problems, there are ways to solve them. But one \nway is not to take health care away from people who need it. It is an \ninjustice, and we should not permit it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4 p.m. be \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nother provisions of the previous order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Shelby pertaining to the introduction of S. 820 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor the next 15 minutes so Senator Vitter and I can introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Vitter pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 861 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I see other colleagues on the floor, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, shortly, we hopefully will be voting on \na budget agreement for this fiscal year, and that will start the \nprocess of the debate on the next fiscal year. What we are about to do \nis more than pass a budget agreement; we are about to define a vision \nof America. We are about to make choices now and in the coming weeks \nthat will reflect our values and our principles as a people and as a \nnation.\n  The real question before us, in my mind, is not simply about the \nnumbers, it is about competing visions of America, whether we choose a \nvision of America where the air and water are clean, where food and \nprescription drugs are safe, where roads and bridges and transportation \nsystems are modern, well maintained, and fuel prosperity for the \nfuture, an America that puts a premium on education and invests in jobs \nand the middle-class, an America where a mother who wakes up in the \nmiddle of the night with a sick child doesn't have to wonder if she can \nafford to take that child to the doctor or if her insurance will cover \nthe costs, an America in which seniors have a reliable Medicare system \nthey can count on, not just a voucher that doesn't even cover the cost \nof a plan in the private marketplace. That is an ugly vision of America \nwe have seen before, and it is why we passed Medicare in the first \nplace.\n  Let's be clear. This is not about the numbers. This is not just \nsimply about the details of deficit reduction. This is about two \ncompeting views of this Nation, one in which we embrace the concept of \ncommunity, each of us working together for the betterment of all of \nus--all of us sharing in the burden of balancing the budget and \nreducing the deficit.\n  The other is a tea party vision, in which no government is good \ngovernment and the notion of an American community is a myth, and we \nare simply a nation of competing individuals, each of us working for \nwhat we can get on our own. Tea partiers see an America in which the \nburden of balancing the budget should be borne by senior citizens, \nstudents, and middle-class families, while protecting subsidies to big \noil companies and giving even more tax breaks to the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  We see an America of shared prosperity and shared responsibility that \nreduces the deficit and balances the budget, knowing that millionaires \nand billionaires can be just as patriotic and willing to pay their fair \nshare as a soldier in Afghanistan whose family is living on an Army \npaycheck.\n  Our friends on the other side tell us tax cuts for millionaires and \nbillionaires create jobs and benefit middle-class families. They told \nus, when we passed the Bush tax cuts a little over a decade ago, it \nwould create millions of jobs for every American, and what happened? \nJobs were eliminated or sent overseas, and the wage gap increased. This \ntax policy may benefit some, but it doesn't create jobs and it doesn't \nreduce our deficit.\n  For some reason, we seem to think the wealthiest Americans are \nclamoring for more tax cuts, but I find no basis in fact for that. I \nhave spoken to many CEOs and leading corporate executives in my State \nand around the country, and never have I heard a word about how badly \nthey need another tax cut. I believe the wealthiest Americans are as \npatriotic as any one of us and are willing to step up to the plate and \npay their fair share if we simply ask them to support a rational tax \nreform program that emphasizes shared fiscal responsibility and shared \nprosperity.\n  In my view, tax cuts for millionaires are nothing more than a \npolitical sleight of hand, a smoke-and-mirrors vision of America, in \nwhich there is no shared responsibility, no sense of community but a \nmisguided belief that only if the rich had more money, the elderly, the \nsick, the poor, the middle-class families struggling to make ends meet, \nthe disabled child on Medicaid who needs round-the-clock care, we would \nsomehow be better off.\n  We have been there before, and it hasn't worked. It is a smoke-and-\nmirror vision of America to believe that if there were no environmental \nprotections, that polluters would protect our air and keep the water \nclean and safe because it is the right thing to do. Again, we have seen \nthat vision of America, and it came in a poisonous cloud of smog that \nlingered over America's cities, which is why Richard Nixon, a \nRepublican President, created the Environmental Protection Agency in \nthe first place.\n  If we are serious about reducing the deficit, we at least should be \nlooking, for example, at subsidies for big oil. The top five oil \ncompanies earned nearly $1 trillion--$1 trillion--over the last decade. \nPassing my bill to repeal oil subsidies would save taxpayers $33 \nbillion over the next 10 years. We can safely assume oil profits will \nbe much greater in the decade to come with higher oil prices, but let's \nassume that the top five oil companies only get another $1 trillion in \nprofits over the next decade. Taking back $33 billion in government \nhandouts would only shave about 3 percent of those profits. Let's not \nforget that much of these profits are in Federal waters and on Federal \nlands, so they are making these profits on America's own soil.\n\n  If we were serious about reducing the deficit, we would also be \nseriously looking, for example, at big oil subsidies and tax breaks. \nAccording to the data, the cost of exploration, development, and \nproduction of natural oil and gas in the United States averaged about \n$33.76 per barrel of oil. Oil is trading at $107 a barrel. That means \nbig oil companies are enjoying a profit of over $750 per barrel of oil \nthey extract. Why in the world would they ever need subsidies from the \nU.S. taxpayer in such conditions?\n  No, handing out money and reducing regulatory burdens on big oil \ncompanies and on the wealthiest Americans is not about balancing the \nbudget or reducing the deficit; it is about a vision of America that \nfavors the rich and would rather dismantle Medicare, cut Social \nSecurity, cut Medicaid for seniors, and the poorest among us in nursing \nhomes who have no other place to go, rather than to solve our long-term \ndeficit problems.\n  I am deeply disturbed at what is being proposed as we move forward in \nthe next debate of the next fiscal year and the so-called push for \nbalancing the budget by shifting $4 trillion from the promise of \nAmerica to protect this Nation and to create prosperity for its people, \nto the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut that actually does absolutely \nnothing to solve the deficit problem. I am disturbed when I see those \non the other side lining up to resist any compromise, any effort for a \nreasonable chance at a workable solution.\n  Before the President was even done speaking yesterday, the tea party \nand many Republicans had already made up their minds that there was \nnothing to talk about, no room for compromise; that there is no other \nview than their own.\n  When I first arrived in the other body, we may have had very clear \nand fundamental differences, but we understood we were there to govern. \nNow our Republican colleagues seem to have stopped governing in order \nto score political points and hope they can win an election. The \nextreme wing of the Republican Party is driving the legislative process \nand the Republican Party to the darkest reaches of the political \nspectrum, fundamentally threatening the very notion of democracy. They \nwant what they want, and they want it all. They will accept nothing \nless than everything. But let's not forget it was Republican policies \nthat got us here in the first place.\n  It wasn't long ago, not long after the last Republican government \nshutdown during another Democratic administration, when we had budget \nsurpluses--surpluses--as far as the eye could see. The day Bill Clinton \nleft office, he handed President Bush a $236 billion surplus, with a \nprojected surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years. When the \nBush administration left office and President Obama was sworn in after \n8 years of Republican economic policies that they are espousing, again, \nincluding tax cuts to the wealthiest, two wars waged unpaid for, \nturning a blind eye to the excesses of Wall Street--the new President \nfaced an economy that was at the abyss of a new depression. The \nRepublicans had turned a $236 billion budget surplus into a $1.3 \ntrillion budget deficit and projected shortfalls of $8 trillion over \nthe next decade.\n  Now they want to give more tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, \nlosing $700 billion on the revenue side over\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\nthe next 10 years by extending the Bush tax cuts and trillions more by \nslashing tax rates for corporations and millionaires without offsetting \ntax expenditures. Those making more than $1 million a year would see \ntax cuts of $125,000 each from the tax cuts and tens of thousands of \ndollars more from the proposed tax cuts, while people in my State would \nlose $34 billion in health benefits and 400,000 New Jerseyans end up \nwithout health coverage at all. They want to shift the balance to \nmillionaires and billionaires while making Draconian cuts to make up \nfor the deficits they create--cuts that do not reflect our values as a \npeople and as a nation.\n  So let me conclude by saying we all agree we must do more to rein in \nspending and get back to the kind of surpluses Democrats created in the \n1990s, but we can only get there through a reasonable framework that \nemphasizes shared prosperity and shared fiscal responsibility to \nachieve our common goal. The way we get there is through negotiation \nand compromise, not from smoke and mirrors, not through trickle-down \ntheories that have not worked, and strictly adhering to an ideological \npolitical agenda that fundamentally starts the clock all over again on \nthe battles for basic American protections that were fought and won in \nthe last century.\n  Let's not go back. Let's protect American values and keep America \nmoving forward and working. As I have said, you show me your budget and \nI will show you your values.\n  The Republican vision of this Nation, as defined in H.R. 1, does not \nrepresent this Senator's values. It is not the fulfillment of the \nAmerican promise, idea and ideal, and I do not believe it is who we are \nas a people and what we want our Nation to represent.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, it is amazing to me to be lectured to and \nhear about how awful the tea party is from folks who have never been to \na tea party to hear what the tea party represents. Come on down. Bring \nyour Huey Long rhetoric that there will be a chicken in every pot and a \nwindmill in every backyard. Bring it down to the tea party and let's \nhave a discussion. Bring it out to the public.\n  We hear from those who want to lecture the tea party about cutting \nspending. Who among these folks has voted against an appropriations \nbill? We haven't even seen one this year. We didn't see a budget. We \nare spending $2 trillion that we don't have, and they are here blaming \nit on the tea party.\n  Who is in charge here? It is not the tea party. Blame it on us. Give \nus an appropriations bill. Give us a budget. Do something constructive \nto fix the fiscal problems we have up here.\n  They say compromise is the ideal. They tell the tea party: You need \nto compromise. But do you know what the compromise is? They want to \nraise taxes. The debt commission wants to raise taxes. The President \nwants to raise taxes. That is what they are talking about.\n  Yesterday, the President said he is going to cut $4 trillion. Well, \ntry to read what is going on here. He said he was going to spend $46 \ntrillion a month ago in his budget. Before we even discuss his budget, \nhe is going to cut $4 trillion off the $46 trillion he is going to \nspend. These are no cuts. We will spend more this year than we spent \nlast year. Forget about all the numbers, all the baselines, and forget \nabout 6, 60, 30, 78, or 0, which is what the CBO scored this \nyesterday--zero in cuts. Forget about it and ask your Representatives: \nAre we going to spend more this year than last? If we are, that is not \na cut. Ask your Representatives, ask your Senators: Will the deficit be \nmore this year than last year?\n  The deficit will be bigger this year. We threaten to shut down \ngovernment over nothing because we are not cutting spending in any \nserious way. They want to blame it on the tea party because in their \nsecret caucus meetings they have done a poll that says the tea party \ncould be the villain. Call them ``extreme,'' call them all ``tea \npartiers,'' say the tea party has ``taken over'' the Republican Party.\n  Do you know what the tea party believes in? Good government. We \nbelieve in balancing the budget, in reducing spending. We have plans to \nfix Social Security. We introduced a plan yesterday. If the other side \nis serious about fixing entitlements, we have a plan. Come to us and \nwork with us, but don't just come down here and call us names.\n  Before you send any more money to Washington, ask your \nrepresentatives whether they are spending your money wisely. Mr. \nPresident, $100 billion in the budget last year is unaccounted for. We \ndon't know where it was spent or we think it was improperly spent--$100 \nbillion. In our senatorial offices we get several million dollars. Some \nof us want to be frugal with that and send some back to the Treasury. \nWe plan on sending several hundred thousand dollars back. We want to \nknow where the money goes. We are still not certain. We have been \nasking for months.\n  Some people say that money is kept in some fund for 3 years and may \ngo back. Other people told us that the leadership spends that money. We \ndon't have a definitive answer for even trying to save a couple hundred \nthousand dollars of your money that we have control of.\n  The Pentagon spends a lot of money. Are they spending the money \nwisely? You don't know because we cannot audit them. Why? Because the \nPentagon tells us that they are too big to audit. You heard about the \ncompanies saying they are too big to fail. The government now tells you \nthey are too big to be audited. We got a partial audit of the Federal \nReserve, and we got some information from that.\n  We are now fighting the war against Qadhafi. Last month, we were \ngiving him money. We gave him some foreign aid, and we helped to bail \nout his national bank. The national banks in those countries are the \nleaders' piggy bank. Half of it is probably spirited off to secret \naccounts in Switzerland. The U.S. taxpayer bailed out Qadhafi's bank, \nand now we are bombing it.\n  The budget bill that we are talking about has now been scored by the \nCBO and will cut almost nothing--maybe a couple hundred million \ndollars. It will increase defense spending by $8 billion and cut \nspending by $8 billion. The net is about zero. Our deficit this year \nwill be bigger than last year. Our overall spending will be bigger this \nyear than last year.\n  We are not yet serious in Washington. We have not yet recognized the \nseverity, the enormity, and the significance of how big this deficit \nis. This deficit is going to have serious repercussions. The Chinese \nhave bought over $1 trillion of our debt, and the Japanese, nearly a \ntrillion.\n  The Japanese have suffered an enormous national disaster. The \nquestion is, Will they continue to buy our debt or can they?\n  The other question is, How long can a government continue to exist \nthat spends more than it brings in? On the other side, they want to \nblame the tea party or the Republicans or the rich people. Do you know \nwhat. Both parties are responsible--Republicans, Democrats, Senators, \nCongressmen, the President--everybody up here is responsible. It is not \none party or the other.\n  When Republicans were in charge, they ran up the deficit. Now the \nDemocrats are in charge, and the main difference is that they are doing \nit faster. The Republicans weren't doing a good job either during our \ntime in power.\n  We have to understand that the people can do things; not everything \nhas to be done up here. The States can do things. We have to believe \nonce again in the American dream. Believing in the American dream is \nnot standing on the floor and castigating rich people. What is great \nabout our country is that any among us--any of our kids--can become \nrich people if they work hard, go to school, and achieve. We live in a \nmobile society, and that is what the American dream is about. We got \naway from Europe because all the land was owned and stifled by the \nnobility. We came here where there was plenty of land and opportunity, \nand the American dream is believing in that.\n  The interesting thing is, when they try to soak the rich--this old \nHuey Long stuff--it is actually failing with the American people \nbecause many of us believe that our kids could gain great wealth or \ngreat success. We still believe in the American dream. If they want to \ncastigate that and say forget about it and say what we need is just \nmore government, they need to explain to people why they don't believe \nin\n\n[[Page S2482]]\n\ncapitalism, in the American dream, and why they don't believe in the \ngreatness of America.\n  I still believe in America. I want to get government out of the way. \nI think we cannot have an America that succeeds until we are able to do \nsomething about our debt crisis. I fear that no one up here--or very \nfew here--on either side recognizes the severity and imminence of this \nproblem. My hope is that before a crisis occurs in our country we will \nbegin to seriously discuss balancing our budget and have plans to do so \nand seriously cut spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand there are other colleagues \non the Senate floor. I want to speak for a few minutes as chair of the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Committee and express my views about \nthe vote we are going to cast in a few hours relative to that \ncommittee.\n  To Senator Paul, I say respectfully--and it is going to be a lively \ndebate--that to a hungry family, a chicken in the pot looks pretty good \nevery now and then, and there are literally millions of children, \nsadly, in this country today who go home from school and open the \nrefrigerator or look on the stove, and they can't find a drumstick \nanywhere. That is what this debate is about.\n  No. 2, I used to love to hear President Clinton say that one of our \njobs here was to create more millionaires. I belong to the DLC, and I \nam proud of it--the Democratic Leadership Council. We believe in \ncreating opportunity that comes along with responsibility and creating \npaths forward to prosperity.\n  Most people I represent--including tea party people--don't believe \ncompanies such as GE--one of the biggest companies in the world--should \nget away with paying no taxes. I guess the Senator from Kentucky thinks \nthat is a good idea. We don't.\n  I also think most people I represent--including the tea party--think \npeople who make over $1 million a year--not millionaires or people who \nmake $250,000 a year, but people who make over $1 million a year--could \npay a little more so that we could afford either early childhood \neducation or early health care in an effective and efficient way \nbecause people know--tea party people and others--what a smart \ninvestment that is. This is going to be a very interesting debate. I \nlook forward to it.\n  I rise as chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee to discuss the full-year continuing resolution that the \nSenate will take up today. For weeks, the press swirled about a \npossible government shutdown. Almost all of the attention was on who \nwould be blamed if the government shut down. That has been averted for \nthe time being.\n  However, far too little attention has been focused on the \nconsequences of the funding cuts that were proposed by the House. With \nsome officials in Washington slashing budgets, terrorists continue to \nseek ways to do harm to this Nation. Terrorists do not care about \n``spending top lines'' and ``CHIMPS.'' What the terrorists care about \nis finding our vulnerabilities and exploiting them to do harm to \nAmericans, to target our military, and to damage our economy.\n  In the State of the Union earlier this year, the President stated \nthat al-Qaida and its affiliates continue to plan attacks against us. \nHe is stating the truth. He stressed that extremists are trying to \ninspire acts of violence by those already within our borders. According \nto the Attorney General, in the last 2 years, 126 individuals have been \nindicted for terrorist-related activities, including 50 United States \ncitizens. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano has said that the \nthreat of a terrorist attack is as high as it has been since 9/11.\n  Recent events have served to highlight the complicated dynamics of \nthis situation. The Fort Hood shooting happened, at the hands of a U.S. \ncitizen. The New York City subway bombing attempt happened, at the \nhands of a legal resident alien. The Times Square bombing attempt \nhappened, precipitated by a naturalized citizen. But we also continue \nto face threats from abroad. The 2009 Christmas day bombing attempt and \nthe October 2010 air cargo bombing attempt happened. We face \nincreasingly sophisticated daily cyber attacks from countries and \nhackers that desire to do us harm. Violence in Mexico is at \nunprecedented levels and there are concerns that the violence will \nspread across the border.\n  In addition to these threats, the Department of Homeland Security \nalso must prepare for and respond to natural disasters. The earthquake \nand tsunami in Japan and our memories of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nremind us of our need to be prepared for a catastrophic disaster.\n  The Homeland Security title of the full-year continuing resolution \ncontains a 2-percent cut in funding. I am particularly concerned about \nthe treatment of funding for FEMA disaster recovery efforts. We are \ncurrently facing a shortfall of at least $1.2 billion this year and $3 \nbillion next year in the disaster relief fund. These shortfalls are the \nresult of past catastrophic disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, \nGustav, and Ike, the Midwest floods of 2008, and the Tennessee floods \nof 2010. At the insistence of the House, an additional $1 billion was \nprovided on a non-emergency basis to meet the fiscal year 2011 \nshortfall. As a result of having to absorb the additional $1 billion \nwithin the DHS base budget, we were forced to cut necessary investments \nin our security, cuts of over 4 percent.\n  It makes no sense to cut programs that prepare, prevent, and help us \nrespond to future disasters to pay the costs of past catastrophic \ndisasters. Yet when you compare the full-year continuing resolution to \nthe Omnibus bill that we tried to bring to the floor in December, we \nlost funding for 175 canine teams for explosives detection. Despite the \nincreasing threat of homegrown terrorism, we lost $810 million to equip \nand train first responders. We lost funding for 1,300 handheld \nradiation detectors and funding for five Coast Guard boats and for 140 \nfoot icebreakers. We lost funding for urban search and rescue teams and \nfunds to deploy the latest technology for blocking cyber attacks on \nsensitive Federal computer systems.\n  In the past, on a bipartisan basis, we have funded the costs of \ncatastrophic disasters as an emergency. In fact, $110 billion out of \n$128 billion appropriated for the FEMA disaster relief fund has been \nappropriated as an emergency. We simply cannot responsibly secure the \nhomeland and prepare for future disasters if we are forced to absorb \nthe costs of past catastrophic disasters.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say that we were successful in \nnegotiations with the House in eliminating some of the most harmful \ncuts contained in H.R. 1. The bill no longer contains what I considered \nirresponsible cuts for the Coast Guard, for Customs and Border \nProtection, for immigration enforcement efforts, for the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, and for cyber security. But, the bill that \nwill be put before the Senate today does not provide resources that are \ncommensurate with the threat that we face. I believe this view is \nshared by a large majority of independent observers. I will vote for \nthis bill but urge caution as we proceed to fiscal year 2012.\n  I remind my colleagues that it is essential that we make decisions on \nhow to secure the homeland with the latest information on the threats \nthat we face, not based on arbitrary spending top lines that were \nproduced during the campaign. As we look ahead to drafting the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill for the fiscal year that begins in \nOctober, it is time to get off the campaign trail and work together on \na path forward for a more secure homeland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we have a vote today on a measure to \ncontinue spending for the Federal Government for the next couple \nmonths. It amounts to nearly $40 billion in cuts. That is a good start. \nI think most Americans would agree with that. But it is only a start. \nWe should now work together across party lines to bring down our long-\nterm debt in a responsible way that protects middle-income families \nand, of course, as well the most vulnerable in society.\n  We do have substantial cuts in this bill today. In fact, there are \nrecord cuts for what we know as discretionary funding.\n  At the same time, though, we have to get down to the more difficult \nbusiness\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\nof reducing deficit and debt and that work is ahead of us. As we do \nthat, we have to make sure we are protecting middle-income families and \nthose who are vulnerable.\n  This is a good start, but we should remember what families are going \nthrough right now, families all across the country, where one member of \nthat family--sometimes more--has lost their job. In Pennsylvania, for \nexample, we have over 500,000 people out of work. Fortunately, that \nnumber has come down since last summer. Last summer, it was approaching \n600,000; now it is about 511,000. But we need to bring that number \ndown.\n  As families are making decisions, they have to make some difficult \nchoices, especially those who lost a job, a home or sometimes both but \neven families who are not living through the horrific crisis of \nunemployment and joblessness, even families where one or two members of \nthat family are working. Those families, as well, have to make \ndifficult choices. That is the way we should approach this, as a family \nor at least to do our best to imitate what families have to do every \nday of the week and to make those difficult choices.\n  We are facing a deficit and debt set of facts and a challenge we have \nnever faced in the Nation's history, and we have to be responsive to \nthat. I spent a decade in State government in Pennsylvania as the \nauditor general of the State and, in the last 2 years in that decade, \nas treasurer. I know a lot about cutting waste, fraud, and abuse, how \nto identify it, how to cut it out, and how to make change. That is why \nI was so heartened by what I saw in a GAO report last month.\n  On March 1, the GAO released a report entitled ``Opportunities to \nReduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, \nand Enhance Revenue.'' It should serve as one measure, but it should \nserve as a how-to guide to reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in \ngovernment. It is all there.\n  Here are some of the highlights. The report identified numerous areas \nof the Federal budget where unnecessary duplication, overlap or \nfragmentation exist. By some estimates, addressing these redundancies \ncould save more than $100 billion and potentially as much as $200 \nbillion. It is not going to reduce the deficit by as much as we need to \nreduce it, but that, as well, is a very good start, a good place to \nlook. We need to take a hard look at reports such as that and take \naction.\n  I voted to support an amendment last week that would require the \nOffice of Management and Budget to immediately cut at least $5 billion \nin wasteful and duplicative spending in government programs. I was \nhappy to see that pass the Senate. This is another step, a first step, \nand a good start, in addition to what we are doing today by cutting \nalmost $40 billion. But we have to cut spending in a way that is smart. \nWe have to cut spending in a way that is smart enough to realize that \nthose decisions have to contribute to economic growth to keep the \neconomy in a State such as Pennsylvania and a country such as America \ngrowing. We have to continue to grow as we cut, and we have to continue \nto create jobs as we cut. We cannot do one and not the other.\n  The Federal budget should also reflect not just our national \npriorities but our values as well. This holds true in the budget we are \nabout to debate, the 2012 budget. Unfortunately, what Republican \nMembers in the House have proposed for the upcoming fiscal year puts \nthe entire burden of reducing the deficit on older citizens, students, \nand middle-income families. That does not sound like a family to me. \nThat does not sound like working together, coming together on a plan, \neveryone trying to sacrifice, everyone trying to pitch in. It sounds as \nif we are placing the burden on members of the family who should not \nbear the whole burden.\n  The Republican plan would end Medicare as we know it. It is as simple \nas that. It would end Medicare as we know it. In Pennsylvania, that \nmeans 2.2 million people who are Medicare beneficiaries would be \ndirectly and adversely impacted. These are not just numbers and \nstatistics. It happens to be 2.2 million people. But who are they? They \nare people who fought our wars. They are people who worked in our \nfactories. They are people who built this economy over many \ngenerations. They are people who took care of our children, taught our \nchildren, cared for our children. These are people who gave all of us \nlife and love, and we are going to come in with a Medicare scheme to \njust put the burden on them and say we have done deficit reduction? I \ndo not think that is what a family does, and I do not think that is \nwhat America has done or will ever do.\n  We worked hard to reduce out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries under \nthe affordable care act. The Republican House plan will double--\ndouble--out-of-pocket expenses, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. The Republican plan does nothing to reduce health costs or \nreform the health care delivery system. It does nothing at all to do \nthat. What it does is shift costs to older citizens and people with \ndisabilities.\n  The GOP plan in the House targets health care spending. Here is what \nit does: It cuts over $770 billion out of Medicaid by converting it to \na block grant program. What does that mean? It means that those who are \nsupposed to be able to rely on the good services provided in Medicaid \nhave to shoulder the burden. Medicaid provides health care to the most \nvulnerable people in our society. Older citizens living in nursing \nhomes, in many instances, millions of them rely on Medicaid, not always \njust Medicare. Children, tens of millions--I think the number right now \nis about 27 million to be exact--27 million people rely on Medicaid and \npeople with disabilities.\n  As we look to reform our budget and to reduce the deficit and debt as \nwe must, we should not take steps that will harm children by some of \nthe proposals we see for Medicaid.\n  About one-third of rural children in America are beneficiaries of \nMedicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. We should remember \nthat when we are thinking about what Medicaid is.\n  By every measure, Medicaid is both cost-effective and an essential \nlifeline for our children. Many people know about the early periodic \nscreening, diagnosis, and treatment provisions within Medicaid. It is \nthe gold standard for how poor children get their health care.\n  Thank goodness, we have had that in place all these decades. But we \nhave people now who want to eliminate that basic gold standard in \nhealth care.\n  We have a long way to go. We have a lot of work to do. We have much \nwork to do on the deficit and debt, and we have to get to that. We \nstill have to reduce spending. We did reduce it by a record amount in \nthe bill we are voting on today. But as we do this, just as families \nhave to come together and share burdens and cut costs, we have to \nremember our approach should be similar to any American family. \nUnfortunately, there are some people around here who do not seem to \nunderstand that, that we need to approach this as a family approaches \nit and not place all the burden on the vulnerable--on children, older \ncitizens, and those who sometimes do not have a voice in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in a few minutes, we are going to be voting \non the continuing resolution which our House colleagues are voting on \nliterally as we speak. I wish to address that briefly, but I must \ncomment on one of the things my colleague from Pennsylvania said.\n  He is critical of the Ryan budget but does not appear to have read \nthe Ryan budget because I know he would not deliberately \nmischaracterize it. He is wrong in several respects, and I will cite \none example. He said the Ryan budget will end Medicare as we know it \nand that millions of seniors will be directly affected. That is simply \nnot true, unless we count someone as a senior who is 53 or 54 years \nold. The Ryan budget does not affect anyone above the age of 54 with \nrespect to Medicare. It says, if you have Medicare and you are 55 or \nolder, nothing changes for you. All we do is provide premium support \nfor those age 54 and below.\n  It is simply incorrect to say millions of seniors would be directly \naffected by the Ryan budget with respect to their Medicare coverage.\n  Let me go back to the point of our discussion right now. As I said, \nwe will be voting very soon on the continuing resolution. This is the \nfinal continuing\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nresolution, we can finally say, for the fiscal year 2011, that funds \nthe government for the rest of this fiscal year. It does mark the end \nof a long and hard-fought process. I am pleased we have been able to \ncut billions of dollars from the Federal Government and avoid a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  It is true $38 billion in spending cuts represents a tiny fraction of \nthe Federal budget, and it is less than many of us would have liked. \nBut those who have been critical of the deal, saying it does not go far \nenough, should keep three points in mind.\n  First of all, our fiscal problems were not created in a day and will \nnot be solved in one budget. It is a good start. It is like the weight \nI put on. It took me a long time to add the 10 or 12 extra pounds, and \nI am not going to get them off overnight. It will take me time to get \nthem off.\n  The budget agreement begins a process that is critical to beginning \nthe reduction of our deficit. The agreement will enact the largest \nnondefense spending cut in dollar terms in American history, just \nmonths after President Obama asked Congress for a spending freeze that \nwould have provided no cuts whatsoever.\n  The Wall Street Journal points out:\n\n       Domestic discretionary spending grew by 6 percent in 2008, \n     11 percent in 2009, and 14 percent in 2010, but this year \n     will fall by 4 percent. That's no small reversal.\n\n  I believe they are correct.\n  Second, no one got everything they wanted. Some wanted more in cuts, \nsome wanted less. I would have preferred we cut more, but this was the \nbest deal we could get that could pass both Chambers of Congress and \nsigned by the President.\n  Third, this debate has altered the conversation about spending, and \nthat is a good thing. As columnist William McGurn wrote Wednesday, \nduring the budget negotiations, Speaker Boehner helped change the \nnational debate over spending ``from `stimulus' and `investment' to \n`how much spending we need to cut'--which is why [the President] \npress[ed] the reset button'' in his speech this week on spending and \ndebt. I think Mr. McGurn is correct. We have changed the fight from how \nmuch money we are going to spend on stimulus to how much we are going \nto cut from this and future budgets.\n  Once the final 2011 budget passes, and we move on to the much larger \ndiscussion about the 2012 budget, we will be talking not about saving \nbillions but about saving trillions of dollars. The problem, as we all \nknow, is a $14 trillion debt, with a large amount of that owned by \nChina and by other foreign countries. It also represents over $53 \ntrillion in unfunded liabilities.\n  In May, our Nation is expected to hit its debt ceiling, and the \nPresident has asked us to increase that ceiling. Senate Republicans and \nHouse Republicans--and I believe many Democrats as well--have said that \nin order to raise the debt ceiling, we need to do something significant \nabout the debt and about constraining future spending. The longer we \nwait, the worse the problems will get. They are exacerbated over time. \nAnd we are not going to raise the debt ceiling without ensuring we \ndon't have to keep on doing it in the future.\n  Raising taxes, as the President proposed, will not be helpful in this \nprocess. It is disappointing the only specific proposal the President \nlaid out in his speech yesterday was, in fact, this call for higher \ntaxes. Speaker Boehner has said raising taxes is a nonstarter, and I \nimagine the vast majority of Senate Republicans will take that position \nas well. Most Americans do not believe that we are undertaxed but that \nWashington has a spending problem.\n  I will briefly go over a few of the better ideas our conference has \nbeen discussing, which I think could attract support from both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  First is a balanced budget amendment, which all Senate Republicans \nhave cosponsored. This should not serve as a means to raise taxes but \nas a mechanism to ensure the Federal Government has to live within its \nmeans each year, just as most American families do.\n  Second, I believe there is strong support in the Republican caucus \nfor a constitutional spending limitation at 18 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. Why 18 percent? Because that is roughly equal to the \nrevenue as a percentage of gross domestic product over the last 40 \nyears. An 18-percent spending limit would stop Washington from spending \nmore than it takes in each year.\n  And third--and I am glad to see the Senator from Missouri in the \nChair while I pass on this compliment--Senators Corker and McCaskill \nhave sponsored the Commitment to American Prosperity Act, known as the \nCAP Act. I strongly support their legislation. It would cap both \nmandatory and discretionary spending and put all government spending on \nthe table.\n  Beginning in 2013, the CAP Act would establish Federal spending \nlimits that would, over 10 years, reduce spending to 20.6 percent of \nthe gross domestic products. That is the average of the last 40 years. \nTo reduce any gamesmanship, the bill codifies the definition for \nemergency spending.\n  I know some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle wish to see \neven more dramatic reductions as a part of the CAP Act. I will note the \nCorker-McCaskill proposal is responsible and mainstream and it could, \nhopefully, attract a good deal of support from both sides of the aisle.\n  Over in the House of Representatives, there are also some good ideas. \nBudget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has been a leader on fiscal issues, \nand that Chamber will soon consider his budget plan for the next fiscal \nyear. Chairman Ryan believes this blueprint could reverse Washington's \ntrend of spending beyond its means and passing the debt on to our \nchildren and grandchildren, and I believe he is on target. His budget \nreflects the kind of difficult and politically unpopular choices \nlawmakers will need to make in order to do something about our \nunsustainable spending and debt.\n  Perhaps that is why Democrat Erskine Bowles, head of the President's \ndeficit commission, praised the Ryan budget as ``a serious, honest and \nstraightforward approach.'' Notably, Mr. Bowles and his cochairman Alan \nSimpson said the President's budget ``doesn't go nearly far enough in \naddressing the Nation's fiscal challenges.''\n  Chairman Ryan's budget would return Federal spending--specifically \nwhat is known as nondefense discretionary spending--to 2008 levels. \nThat is the level before the massive spending unleashed by the Obama \nadministration. The spending cuts proposed in Ryan's budget total $5.8 \ntrillion over 10 years.\n  In a recent article, John Taylor, an economics professor at Stanford, \nGary Becker, a Nobel prize winner, and George Shultz, former Secretary \nof Labor, Treasury, and State, wrote:\n\n       Credible actions that reduce the rapid growth of Federal \n     spending and debt will raise economic growth and lower the \n     unemployment rate.\n\n  They also said:\n\n       Higher private investment, not more government purchases, \n     is the surest way to increase prosperity.\n\n  Reducing government spending can increase economic productivity and \njobs.\n  President Obama has sought to stimulate the economy and create jobs \nby spending trillions of government dollars. What has that gotten us? \nRecord deficits, excess borrowing--about 40 cents of every dollar the \ngovernment now spends will have to be borrowed--and it has gotten us \nstubbornly high unemployment.\n  Chairman Ryan's budget also calls for tax reform through sensible and \ngrowth-promoting policies. The budget contemplates a top tax rate of 25 \npercent for individuals and businesses. Currently, the tax rate on \nbusiness is 35 percent, the highest of all of the countries in the \ndeveloped world. That rate, by the way, discourages investment, it \ndiscourages job creation, and it makes America an expensive place in \nwhich to do business. In effect, it encourages business to move their \noperations overseas, something all of us are very concerned about.\n  What we need are solutions that emphasize the strength of American \nentrepreneurs and our private sector, not the government; to spur the \neconomy and help put people back to work.\n  In the debate ahead, I hope we can engage in serious discussions \nabout how to take on our fiscal problems in a responsible way--to bring \ndown the cost of government, boost our economy and promote economic \ngrowth. That is what Americans are looking for, and it is what our \ncountry needs.\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise to make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The Senate will soon receive from the House legislation to fund the \nFederal Government for the rest of this year--H.R. 1473. Normally, \nspending bills such as this one go through the Appropriations \nCommittee. Despite the fact that this spending bill the Senate will \nsoon take up covers funding for the entire Federal Government, \nincluding all appropriations bills for the year, it was never even \nconsidered by the House or Senate Appropriations Committees.\n  Snuck into this massive spending bill are legislative provisions that \ntypically are not allowed by Senate rules to be included in the \nappropriations process. The Senate has a rule--rule XVI--that prohibits \nSenate legislative amendments to an appropriations bill. Despite this \nSenate rule, the spending bill the Senate will consider today includes \nprovisions that are clearly legislative in nature. Specifically, I am \nreferring to section 1858 of the spending bill which repeals free \nchoice vouchers from the affordable care act that became law last year.\n  There should be no doubt that repealing a law or part of a law is \nlegislating. In this case, section 1858 repeals part of the Internal \nRevenue Code. Amending the Internal Revenue Code is general \nlegislation, not the appropriation of funds. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office has actually determined that free choice vouchers involve \nno appropriation of funds whatsoever.\n  Madam President, my parliamentary inquiry is whether repealing free \nchoice vouchers in the spending bill the Senate will soon consider is \nlegislating on an appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised that repealing any law is \nlegislative in nature, and repealing a law in an appropriations bill is \nlegislating on an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair for making this very clear; that \nrepealing free choice vouchers--the opportunity to come up with a \nmarketplace-oriented approach for people in a health care no man's \nland--in this spending bill is clearly legislating on an appropriations \nbill and that is not the way the Senate traditionally does business.\n  If this provision were brought up in the Senate, we now know it would \nbe ruled out of order. It would be ruled out of order because in the \nSenate we simply do not legislate on appropriations bills. The Senate \ndoesn't legislate on appropriations bills for a simple reason. Every \nSenator knows it would be open season for the special interest \nlobbyists all over this town.\n  The administration and this body took a stand earlier this year \nagainst earmarking--something the Chair is very much aware of--and I \nwish to quote from the President's State of the Union Address. The \nPresident said: The American people deserve to know that special \ninterests aren't larding up legislation with pet projects. Both parties \nin Congress should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks \ninside it, I will veto it.\n  Madam President, I wish to have somebody explain the difference \nbetween letting a lobbyist slip an earmark into an appropriations bill \nand slipping legislative language into an appropriations bill that \nbenefits a whole array of special interest lobbyists. It sure seems to \nhave the same effect to me.\n  I am not certain who proposed eliminating free choice vouchers in \nthis appropriations deal. Maybe a lobbyist asked for it or maybe some \nstaffer with special interest sympathies saw an opportunity to send the \nlobbyist what one lobbyist called today ``an early Easter gift.'' But \neither way, I know with 100 percent certainty this decision was not \nmade with the public interest in mind. The American people are not the \nones who benefit from eliminating free choice vouchers. The American \npeople like the idea of being able to have choices for their health \ncare--choices, I would point out, that are much like the ones we have \nas Members of Congress.\n  The fact is this is one provision in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act that combined the thinking of colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle--Democrats who wanted to expand coverage and \nRepublicans who have an interest in choice and competition. This was \nthe one provision that provided a concrete path to holding down health \ncare costs, and it has now been gutted by the special interests.\n  Some special interests are arguing that free choice vouchers would in \nsome way harm employer-based health coverage. What we know for certain \nis that for the group of people who could access a free choice voucher, \nthe employer-based health system is dysfunctional. It is dysfunctional \nfor them. The group of people who are covered by free choice vouchers--\nfolks who aren't eligible for the exchanges and folks who aren't \neligible for subsidies--now have only two choices: coverage that is \ncompletely unavailable or coverage that is completely unaffordable.\n  The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, at the time free choice \nvouchers was accepted, specifically talked about how this filled a gap \nin the bill. And now, with it gone, more than 300,000 Americans aren't \ngoing to have a path to affordable, good quality coverage. Free choice \nvouchers were needed at the time we worked on the affordable care act \nand they are even more necessary today.\n  For example, the Kaiser Family Foundation, in their most recent \nanalysis, has demonstrated how consistently, again and again, more \nhealth care costs are being shifted onto the backs of American workers. \nIn their most recent analysis, they found that employee health expenses \nin the last year have gone up 14 percent, and the employee was eating \nalmost all of that. Almost all of it was being shifted onto the backs \nof the workers.\n  This was important today--it was important when we moved originally \nto enact the legislation. It is even more important today. The fact is, \nthese individuals are only looking for another path because the system \ndoes not work for them. If it worked for them, we would not even have \nan issue. But as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee pointed \nout, this is a gap in the system, a gap that, had we been able to \nsustain free choice vouchers and stop the lobbyists from stripping them \nout, we would have had a way to ensure that hundreds and hundreds of \nthousands of hard-working Americans--these are folks who work at jobs--\nwould still be able to go to sleep at night knowing they had decent, \ngood-quality, affordable coverage for themselves and their families.\n  The Senate does not legislate on appropriations bills because, as the \nPresident said so appropriately, we should be working to rebuild \npeople's faith in the institution of government. We do not slip \nlegislative language into these kinds of bills that benefits a few \nspecial interest groups at the expense of hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans. This is not the way we do business.\n  Throughout 2009, I promised my constituents that I would not support \nhealth care reforms unless they were real reforms. This legislation \nlets special interest groups take real reform out of the health care \nlaw. It seems to me that, all over this town, the special interest \ngroups are looking at the bill and they are saying now it is going to \nbe possible, if we can just find, behind closed doors, some allies to \ntake away real cost containment, real opportunities for good-quality, \naffordable coverage for people. This legislation takes real reform out \nof the health care law. Because I keep my promises, I will not support \nit.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the last 2 weeks have been very good \nweeks for this country and this Congress. We are passing a continuing \nresolution and funding the Government and not letting the government \nclose makes a great deal of sense. I think that was very much to the \nbetter. Even more important, we now will have a significant debate, \nover the next few months, about what this country should be like over \nthe next several decades. That is very important for our country. It is \nwhat we should be doing. I salute Congressman Ryan for laying out on \nthe table a vision and Speaker Boehner for supporting it.\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\n  I disagree with that vision, but they did have the forthrightness and \nthe directness to put their views on the floor. It is a different \nvision than what America is today.\n  I also salute President Obama. He joined the issue yesterday, \nclearly, without obfuscation, directly, and showed the many places \nwhere he differed with Congressman Ryan. He laid out a different vision \nas to where America should go. In a minute, I will discuss my views of \nthose visions, but I wish to say this at the outset: It is very good to \nhave this debate. I hope this will be a month or two in which there \nwill be invective and there will be clashes, but I hope, at the end of \nthe day, the debate between the Republican vision of where America \nshould go and the Democratic vision--between Congressman Ryan and \nPresident Obama--will be one of those times when historians will look \nback and say this is a place where America, through its Congress and \nits President, chose a direction. That is, after all, why we are here.\n  We have many different issues to consider, but the role of \ngovernment, what it should do and what it should not, is probably the \nmost important for the next several decades. The fact that the issue \nhas been joined by Congressman Ryan on the one hand and President Obama \non the other can only be good for America. What we will do is come to a \nconclusion, hopefully, in the next month or two. Let me give my views \nof those two visions.\n  Yesterday, President Obama delivered a thoughtful, inspired speech \nabout the need to rein in our out-of-control deficit. He called for a \ncomprehensive approach, including cuts to defense and mandatory \nspending, and he rightfully put revenue on the table. His is a serious \nplan, one that would reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 12 \nyears. As only a President can do, he powerfully framed the debate that \nwill likely continue to rage, certainly for the next several months and \nprobably over the next year and a half--long after we resolve the debt \nceiling. This is a debate the American people want to have. It is a \ndebate Democrats are ready and eager to engage in. It is a debate we \nbelieve we will win. We have the high ground.\n  The House Republican plan puts the middle class last instead of \nfirst. It will never ever pass the Senate, and we know the American \npeople will reject it as well. The debate we just concluded, the debate \nabout the CR, was about spending levels. The debate ahead of us is \nabout more than spending levels, it is about the role of government \nitself.\n  House Republicans are not trying to balance the budget--no. They are \ntrying to fundamentally alter Americans' relationship with their \ngovernment. They believe the message of the last election was that \nAmericans wanted a dramatic change, a great limitation in how much the \nGovernment should do. It is our view, as Democrats, that the American \npeople gave us two messages. First, deal with the deficit. There is too \nmuch spending. I say, as a party, we ignore that message at our peril, \nbut we have not ignored that message, neither in the CR nor in the \nPresident's proposals.\n  The American people sent a second message as loudly and as strongly \nas the first; that is, grow the economy, help the middle class continue \nto have better lives, as they have over the last five decades, make \nsure there are meaningful jobs in America. I believe a budget that \nreflects the American people's view has to do both these things: reduce \nthe deficit but keep that American dream brightly burning, the American \ndream that the American middle class holds, which says the odds are \nquite good that we will be doing better 10 years from today than we are \ndoing now and the odds are better still that our children will do \nbetter than we. That is what we believe American people told us to do.\n  We believe the budget revealed by Congressman Ryan and supported by \nRepublicans is not what the American people want. It is a negative, \npessimistic message. It is a message that says the great days of \nAmerica are over and we do not believe it is what the people want. As \nwe go through this debate, we shall see how that comes out. I believe \nwe will prevail.\n  The Republican budget unveiled last week by Chairman Ryan is, on \ncloser inspection, not a serious document. The pundits and political \nhandicappers may have hailed it as a bold, daring approach to the \nfiscal challenges facing our country, but a closer examination reveals \nthat Ryan's budget hews exactly to his parties' orthodoxy. It does not \ngore a single Republican ox. The House Republican budget puts the \nentire burden of reducing the deficit on seniors, students, and middle-\nclass families. At the same time, it protects corporate welfare for oil \ncompanies, gives giant new tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, \nand leaves Pentagon spending almost completely untouched.\n  Consider what Paul Ryan wants to do to Medicare. His plan ends \nMedicare as we know it and replaces it with a private voucher system \nthat will cut benefits. Seniors would be left to fend for themselves \nwith no guarantee of affordable coverage. They would have to pay \nthousands of dollars more out of their pockets.\n  As this chart shows, under the current Medicare system, the average \nsenior on Medicare in 2022 will contribute about 25 percent of the cost \nof their health care. But under the Ryan plan, seniors would have to \npay 68 percent of the cost of coverage themselves according to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  That is an outrageous burden. Simply put, it would drive many seniors \ninto poverty. This generation of seniors, the first generation who was \nable to say they could retire and not go to bed every night sweating \nabout how they were going to pay for health care if they or their \nspouse got an illness, would be the last generation to do so under Paul \nRyan's vision.\n  In America, we have said we have bounty. And some of that bounty \nshould go to those in their golden years, to those who worked hard and \nwho built the country and who raised the families and fought the wars. \nThey should not have to worry that they could not afford health care \nif, God forbid, a serious illness afflicted them. The Ryan budget turns \nits back on that vision.\n  Republicans have been patting themselves on the back recently for \ntackling entitlement reform, but their approach is nothing more than a \nrigid, ideological quest to unravel the social safety net.\n  Medicare certainly has cost issues, but a better way to protect and \npreserve Medicare for future generations is to cut out the waste and \ninefficiency that everyone knows exists, not to privatize the program. \nOur plan is simple when it comes to Medicare: Mend it, do not end it. \nIn the health care reform law, we made a good downpayment on this \neffort. We began to shift Medicare in the larger health care system \nfrom an expensive, fee-for-service model toward a system that pays \nproviders for episodes of care. The truth is, when it comes to reining \nin the cost of Medicare, the President did it first, and he did it \nbetter. We Democrats are willing to build off that law. We can make \nfurther reforms to the delivery system. It needs further reforms. And \nwe will further drive down the costs. The Ryan budget reverses progress \nwe have already made and in doing so reopens the doughnut hole, further \nburdening seniors' budgets.\n  It is bad enough that the Ryan budget ends Medicare as we know it and \nincreases costs for seniors, but just as egregious is what Ryan \nproposes to do with all the money he takes from seniors on Medicare. As \nthis second chart shows and as the President said yesterday, House \nRepublicans want to give millionaires a new tax cut of $200,000. To pay \nfor it, it would make 33 seniors each pay $6,000 more for health care. \nWhat kind of vision is that? The Ryan budget uses Medicare cuts to \nreduce the tax rate on millionaires and billionaires to 25 percent from \n35 percent. That is the lowest level since 1931 when Herbert Hoover was \nPresident. The Ryan budget reduces taxes on the rich to the lowest \nlevel since 1931, the Hoover era, the era of the Great Depression.\n  I have nothing against the rich. God bless them. Many of them are \nliving the American dream. They are what many of us aspire to be. But \nin order to keep that dream alive and get our country on firmer fiscal \nfooting, we need a little shared sacrifice. Democrats want to work with \nRepublicans to get our fiscal house in order, but we believe the best \nway to do it is to end the\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\nmillionaires' tax break, not cut Medicare benefits.\n  Let me be clear. A grand bargain on long-term deficit reduction is \nnext to impossible unless we look at raising revenue. Unfortunately, \nRepublican leaders are already trying to rule out revenue. If the other \nside refuses to even consider savings in the Tax Code, they will lose \ncredibility with the American people. We simply cannot balance the \nbudget by focusing solely on domestic discretionary spending, a narrow \n12 percent slice of the budget. Cancer research and Head Start did not \ncreate our current deficit problem, and we will not fix it by going \nafter cancer research and Head Start.\n  Thankfully, many rank-and-file Republicans seem to agree with the \nneed to put revenue on the table. The Senator from Oklahoma, a true \nfiscal conservative, said a blanket defense of all tax cuts is \nprofoundly misguided. My Republican friend from Nebraska said \nRepublicans need to keep an open mind and keep everything on the table, \nincluding revenue. My Republican friend from Georgia had said that \nrevenue, along with entitlement cuts, should be part of the budget \ncompromise. My friend from Tennessee, with whom I work closely on the \nRules Committee, said that tax subsidies for big oil ``may be too \nexpensive.'' As you can see, many of my colleagues are prepared to \ntackle this challenge with, to use the phrase of the Republican Senator \nfrom Nebraska, ``an open mind.''\n  The bottom line is that any budget that leaves defense and revenue \noff the table is ultimately untenable. Indeed, a dollar cut from \ndefense spending reduces the deficit just as much as a dollar cut from \ndomestic discretionary spending. While there is certainly waste on the \ndomestic discretionary side of the budget, there is also certainly \nwaste on the defense side.\n  While we are certainly open to compromise, Democrats will not \ntolerate the House Republican budget assault on Medicare. It is not \nfair, it is not right, and it will never, never pass the Senate.\n  I am hopeful that both parties in both Chambers of Congress will come \ntogether to reach a reasonable, responsible deficit deal, but in order \nto do that, Republican leaders need to take off their ideological \nstraitjackets. They can start by going to the drafting room and coming \nup with a fairer, more broad-based proposal than the Ryan budget.\n  In conclusion, Speaker Boehner needed Democrats to pass this year's \nbudget, and he will need Democrats to pass a long-term deficit \nreduction plan as well. The sooner he abandons the tea party, the \nsooner we can have a compromise.\n  We hope the coming debate will yield a sound, serious deal. That is \nour hope. That is our wish. That is what the next few months are about. \nIf it doesn't, we Democrats will have to take this contrast of \npriorities into 2012. We know that in that battle, too, we will have \nthe high ground.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see my distinguished colleagues, the \nsenior Senator from Hawaii and the senior Senator from Mississippi, the \nleaders of our Appropriations Committee, on the floor. I just ask if I \nmay be able to continue for 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Please.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I appreciate the extremely hard work the \nmajority leader--and I have told him this--and the President--I have \ntold him that--and our distinguished chairman--I have told him that--\nthe work they have done to get the best possible deal under extremely \ndifficult circumstances.\n  I now understand that with the final resolution, I will not be able \nto vote for it, as I assume others in the Vermont delegation will not. \nI am afraid that it creates an impossible bargain. It averts a \ngovernment shutdown at the expense of our overall national interests.\n  This year, Congress spent most of its time negotiating three rounds \nof deeper and deeper cuts in the current year's budget, an exercise in \noftentimes misguided wheel-spinning which ignores the fact that \ndiscretionary spending is but a relative fraction of the overall budget \nwhile addressing some of the most pressing and urgent needs of ordinary \nAmericans. Advocates paint this agreement in moral terms. I agree with \nthem. Budgets are about our real priorities.\n  There is so much in this budget package that is inconsistent with \nbasic Vermont and American values. Drastic cuts ending hunger programs \nfor low-income women and children, elimination of Vermont's \nweatherization program, and cuts to economic development programs that \ngrow jobs in my State of Vermont are not my idea of prudent sacrifices. \nThere is no moral credit to Congress to cut vouchers for homeless \nVermont veterans who served their country honorably, nor does Congress \ncover itself in glory by denying first-generation Vermonters help in \ngoing to college because of cuts to the TRIO Program. Is there moral \ngood in eliminating housing counseling for low-income families facing \nforeclosure or slashing small stipends for seniors who are on Meals on \nWheels? The estimates of these cuts in my little State range as high as \n$150 million--a tremendous burden at a time when we face the worst time \nsince the Great Depression.\n\n  The reason we are here, as a column pointed out very well in our \nnational papers yesterday, is because even though we had an agreement \nto pass an omnibus bill last December, at the last minute, those on the \nother side of the aisle who had agreed on that reneged, and of course \nwe were not able to get the 60 votes necessary in the Senate.\n  I had supported that omnibus budget bill even though there were \nenormous cuts in it. It would have enacted tens of billions of dollars \nin carefully drawn, reasonable reductions below the White House budget \nproposal. The distinguished Senator from Hawaii had worked very hard \nand encouraged us to make cut after cut after cut. We all agreed with \nhim. I agreed with him. It was in the omnibus. And if that had passed, \nwe would not be here. But because those who had agreed to support it \nchanged their minds at the last minute, it killed the omnibus bill and \nit forced the Congress into a series of stopgap funding bills and now \ninto a slapdash continuing resolution.\n  In addition to the cuts in the omnibus bill, I also supported \nreductions of billions more, and I voted for billions of dollars in \ncuts and short-term reductions in the continuing resolutions earlier \nthis year.\n  Now, some who tout this round of cuts as the most important and as \nthe largest cuts in discretionary spending in history are the same ones \nwho pushed through hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts to \ncompanies that ship jobs overseas--American jobs overseas--greatly \nadding to the profits of our oil companies that are now charging us $4 \na gallon for gas and more; pushed through for multimillionaires, many \nof whom said they did not want the tax cuts--pushed it through \nnonetheless.\n  The correlation between those spending cuts and those unfunded tax \ncuts is direct. It is unflattering to the proponents of both \ninitiatives.\n  Frankly, I am tired of being lectured on fiscal sanity from those who \nvoted for an unnecessary war in Iraq, saying that is because of 9/11, \neven though, as we know from every single report that has come out, \nIraq had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11. But we spent $1 trillion, \nthousands of American lives, tens of thousands of other peoples lives \nin Iraq, and then, for the first time in the history of this country, \ninstead of paying for a war, as we always have in the past, we say: Oh, \nno, we will borrow the money. And by the way, we will give you a tax \ncut too.\n  So who paid for that war in Iraq? The men and women who valiantly \nfought there and their families who waited, wondering if they would \ncome back alive, broken, or dead, and often were given the worst and \ngrimmest news. They are the only ones who sacrificed. Everybody else \ngot a tax cut, and we borrowed the money from China and everywhere else \nto pay for a war we should have never been in, and $1 trillion later, \n10 years later, we are still spending tens of billions of dollars \nthere.\n  Some corporations--some others made a lot of money; we did not. And \nthen we spend another 8 or 9 years that we should not have been in \nAfghanistan doing the same thing--borrowing the money for that.\n  It seems that our soldiers paid a great burden, and the American \npeople paid a great burden. But boy, some\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\nmade out like bandits. I don't want any lectures from those who gave \nthe bandits their bag of gold.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2488-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2488-S2491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FISCAL YEAR 2011 SAFER PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I want to highlight an important \nprovision that is included in the Homeland Security division of this \nbill. It is related to the firefighter hiring program known as SAFER. \nIn 2009 and 2010, Congress approved waivers for several restrictions of \nthe SAFER grant program because in this economic downturn fire \ndepartments were struggling to meet those requirements. By adding this \nflexibility to the program, fire departments were able to make the best \nuse of the funding provided in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. A provision \nin this bill maintains three of the same waivers for fiscal year 2011 \nand specifically allows for the grants to be used to retain and/or \nrehire personnel, to supplant local funds, and a local match is not \nrequired. While some might argue that it is a local responsibility to \nhire firefighters, it has been made clear disaster after disaster--and \nespecially including catastrophic events such as the 9/11 attacks and \nHurricane Katrina--that firefighters are the first people we call on \nfrom all over the Nation to serve in a national response. Of course, I \nsupported the inclusion of all six waivers contained in the Inouye \namendment. Through negotiations we were able to secure the provisions \nthat allow for the retention and/or rehiring of firefighters, the \nwaiver of a cost share, and the ability to supplant local funds.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my subcommittee chairman for highlighting this \nimportant provision. Ensuring that the SAFER grants are available to \nretain and/or rehire firefighters and waiving match requirements will \nprovide communities the assistance they need in these tough times.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, much attention has been given to how the \nRyan plan ends Medicare as we know it by turning Medicare into a \nvoucher program.\n  For example, on April 6, 2011, AARP wrote to Congressman Ryan:\n\n       Today's budget proposal appropriately acknowledges that \n     health care costs must be addressed if the federal budget is \n     to be balanced. However, rather than recognizing that health \n     care is an unavoidable necessity which must be made more \n     affordable for all Americans, this proposal simply shifts \n     these high costs onto Medicare beneficiaries, and shifts the \n     even higher costs of increased uninsured care onto everyone \n     else. By creating a ``premium support'' system for future \n     Medicare beneficiaries, the proposal will increase costs for \n     beneficiaries while removing Medicare's promise of secure \n     health coverage--a guarantee that future seniors have \n     contributed to through a lifetime of hard work.\n\n  The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities put out a statement on \nApril 6, 2011 stating:\n\n       Many future Medicare beneficiaries with modest incomes, \n     such as elderly widows who must live on $15,000 or $20,000 a \n     year, also would likely be hit by the plan's Medicare \n     provisions; the Medicare voucher (or defined contribution) \n     they would receive would fall farther and farther behind \n     health care costs--and purchase less and less coverage--with \n     each passing year. Aggravating this problem, Ryan has said \n     that his plan calls for repeal of a key measure of the health \n     reform law that is designed to moderate Medicare costs--the \n     Independent Payment Advisory Board. In other words, his plan \n     would scrap mechanisms to slow growth in the costs of health \n     care services that Medicare beneficiaries need, even as it \n     cuts back the portion of those costs that Medicare would \n     cover.\n\n  The Center for American Progress writes:\n\n       Medicare as we know it would end for new beneficiaries in \n     2022 under the House Republican budget proposal. It would be \n     replaced with a government voucher that would be paid \n     directly to private insurance companies. This system would \n     double costs to seniors. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget \n     Office, or CBO, concluded that ``most elderly people would \n     pay more for their health care than they would pay under the \n     current Medicare system.''\n\n  However, there has been less discussion of the other ways in which \nthe Ryan plan would hurt current beneficiaries.\n  So I would like to give some specific examples how the changes \nCongressman Ryan proposed will impact current Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The Republican plan will force beneficiaries to pay for preventive \nservices and eliminates the free annual wellness exam they can \ncurrently receive. Nearly all 44 million beneficiaries who have \nMedicare, including 2.2 million in Pennsylvania, can now receive free \npreventive services--such as mammograms and colonoscopies--as well as a \nfree annual wellness visit with their doctor.\n  The Republican plan will eliminate the efforts that have begun to \nclose the doughnut hole. If the Republican budget becomes law, costs \nfor Medicare beneficiaries who fall into the doughnut hole will \nincrease drastically. Over 266,000 Pennsylvanians will pay an \nadditional $149 million in 2012 and $3 billion through 2020.\n  The Republican plan hurts beneficiaries today by repealing \nimprovements designed to save them money and provide needed services. \nIt hurts beneficiaries even more beginning in 2022 when end Medicare as \nwe know it and puts in place a voucher system to ration health care and \nincrease costs for beneficiaries.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last Friday night, in the absence of a \nbudget deal, the Federal Government came within 1 hour of shutting its \ndoors and all but emergency services. The obstacle to an agreement at \nthat point was not a matter of spending levels or budget cuts. The \nobstacle was ideologically driven policy riders that some insisted on \nincluding in the budget bill. Thankfully, in the end, we prevailed in \nstripping out the abhorrent rider to bar funding for Planned \nParenthood.\n  A small but vocal minority is adamant about eliminating one specific \norganization's health centers, which provide health care and family \nplanning services for women nationwide. Planned Parenthood centers \nreceive Federal funding from title X of the Public Health Service Act--\nthe only Federal grant program dedicated to offering people \ncomprehensive family planning and related preventive health services. \nPresident Nixon was instrumental in enacting this legislation, and it \nhas been supported since then by lawmakers and Presidents of both \nparties. As many women can tell you, title X was a remarkable \nbreakthrough in women's health care.\n  What a travesty it would have been to gut health services to women \nthat literally have meant the difference between life or death, health \nor grave illness, to countless American women. Vermonters were \noutspoken in their opposition to this rollback for women's health, and \nI am proud of our State and grateful for our success in this round.\n  Tens of thousands of women in Vermont depend on title X of the Public \nHealth Service Act for lifesaving preventive treatments and care. \nAround the country, there are many providers of title X services, but \nin Vermont, Planned Parenthood centers are the only clinics where many \nlower income women can go for family planning care. Planned Parenthood \ncenters in Vermont offer women and teens annual health exams, cervical \nand breast cancer screenings, and HIV screenings and counseling. Last \nyear in Vermont, Planned Parenthood provided critical primary and \npreventive services to nearly 21,000 patients.\n  In the last few weeks more than 6,000 Vermonters have contacted me \nabout their support for the funds that make title X health services \npossible and for Planned Parenthood's long and commendable record of \nmaking title X's promise a reality for millions of American women in \nVermont and across the Nation. I have heard from nurses and doctors in \nVermont urging me to support funding for Planned Parenthood in order to \ncontinue essential care these centers offer to their own patients and \nto women who would not receive primary health care were it not for \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Despite the misleading and blatantly false statements of some \nideologically driven advocates, more than 90 percent of the care \nPlanned Parenthood health centers offer is preventive. In fact, 6 of \nevery 10 women who use Planned Parenthood for title X services describe \nit as their primary source of medical care. And despite what some \nopponents of women's health funding have proclaimed, absolutely no \ntitle X funding can be used for abortion services. The sad irony is \nthat defunding title X and Planned Parenthood would result in more \nunintended pregnancies, and probably more abortions.\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\n  This drive to defund women's health services offered by a particular \norganization also raises constitutional concerns. Article I, section 9, \nparagraph 3 of our Constitution expressly forbids passage of any ``bill \nof attainder.'' According to the late former Chief Justice of the \nUnited States, William Rehnquist, ``A bill of attainder was a \nlegislative act that singled out one or more persons and imposed \npunishment on them, without benefit of trial. Such actions were \nregarded as odious by the Framers of the Constitution because it was \nthe traditional role of a court, judging an individual case, to impose \npunishment.'' Yet those promoting the anti-Planned Parenthood rider \nclearly intend to single out one organization by name to ``punish'' it, \n``punishing'' as well the millions of women who Planned Parenthood \nserves.\n  Proponents of this rider have cited what they call ``evidence'' that \nPlanned Parenthood has acted unlawfully. Other supporters of this \nvirulent effort charge that the organization has been ``accused'' of a \nvariety of things. These comments make clear that their legislative \nintent is to punish for these unverified accusations. Some in fact have \ngone so far as to accuse Planned Parenthood of violating the law that \nprohibits any Federal funds to be used to provide abortions.\n  There is no substantive reason to believe such accusations. If there \nis any violation of this or any Federal law, it is the role of the \nexecutive branch to prosecute and try the offenders. That is not the \nrole of this body, though that is what some are advocating, through \ntheir injection of accusations and partisan politics into this debate.\n  The Framers' original intent was to prohibit bills that single out \none entity for punishment because that is not Congress's role in the \nseparation of powers they so carefully devised for our Republic.\n  Aside from the serious constitutional issues with the pending measure \nis one naked fact from which proponents of this legislative rider \ncannot hide: Nothing in this pernicious rider would actually reduce \nspending. Their proposal would save not one penny. This is about \n``punishment,'' not fiscal responsibility.\n  Does this Congress care more about what looks good on a bumper \nsticker or what matters in the daily lives of real people? The \narrogance and shortsighted attitude of a minority has put at risk the \nlives and health of millions of women. My wife Marcelle is a cancer \nsurvivor. We were lucky. We had good health care and a salary that \nallowed us to pay the bills when she got sick. Other people are not so \nlucky. Without the services that Planned Parenthood provides, thousands \nof low-income women in Vermont would lose their ability to have regular \ncancer screenings that could save their lives too. That we are even \nconsidering the elimination of these health services to America's women \nis shameful. That it was the sticking point that nearly forced the \nshutdown of the Federal Government is a disgrace.\n  Title X was a true breakthrough for the health of American women. \nShould we as a nation walk back from the remarkable progress we have \nmade in women's health? Of course not. The mean-spirited and \nideological attacks must end, and these ideological assaults on women's \nhealth care must end.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there is no doubt that we must take \naction to reduce our budget deficit. The question is, How will we \naccomplish this? Will we do as we have done all too often over the last \nfew years, and protect the tax cuts of the well-to-do at the expense of \nmiddle-class families? Or will we seek a balanced approach that seeks \nto spread the burden of deficit reduction so that the upper income \nfolks who have so prospered the last few years also contribute to the \nsolution?\n  There is no question in my mind that deficit reduction requires \nshared sacrifice. By that test, the legislation before us is highly \nproblematic. True, it manages to avoid some of the most extreme budget \ncuts that House Republicans included in their original appropriations \nbill. The bill before us is surely reasonable in comparison with that \nextreme measure. But the test cannot be whether it is better than HR 1. \nWe can and must do better.\n  What troubles me most is that this legislation seeks to address the \nproblem in only one manner, targeting nondefense discretionary programs \nthat make up a fraction of our budget. I remain convinced it is a \nmistake to attack the deficit only through cuts in domestic \ndiscretionary spending, and not also end the huge Bush tax cuts for \nupper incomes, and close tax loopholes and reduce tax expenditures that \nmost budget experts believe must be part of any serious deficit \nreduction plan. Simple math makes clear that those kinds of revenues \nmust be a part of the solution.\n  The refusal to take a balanced approach in this legislation means \nthat to reach its deficit reduction target, this bill makes cuts that \nare, in my mind, too large. It reduces funding for the COPS program and \ngrants to state and local law enforcement agencies by more than one-\nquarter, making our communities less safe. It reduces energy efficiency \nfunds by 18 percent, as though this issue wasn't crucial to our \nNation's future security and prosperity. It cuts funding for the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention by 11 percent, as though the \nhealth of our citizens was not a priority.\n  This bill eliminates all funding for the HUD Housing Counseling \nAssistance Program, eliminates it entirely, ignoring the fact that \ncommunities across the nation are reeling from a foreclosure crisis.\n  This bill cuts by 20 percent funding for Army Corps of Engineers \nconstruction. That provides funding for the barrier that we hope will \nkeep destructive Asian carp out of the Great Lakes, and believe me, \nthat is false economy. The economic damage Asian carp can do if they \nestablish themselves in the Lakes is incalculable. The bill also cuts \nmore than one-quarter of funding for vital water infrastructure \nprograms important not just in Michigan but around the state, and it \nmakes a deeply misguided 37 percent cut in Great Lakes restoration \ninitiative funding, a totally unjustifiable reduction of our commitment \nto lakes that are an engine of economic activity for all the states in \nthe Great Lakes region.\n  There are some important programs that have escaped the worst cuts. I \nam pleased that students will still be able to receive a maximum Pell \ngrant of $5,500, and that the misguided proposal to reduce these grants \nhas been defeated. I am pleased that this bill generally avoids \nmisguided Republican attempts to deprive financial regulatory agencies \nof the resources they need to prevent the next financial collapse.\n  This bill rescinds highway funding that was provided at least 13 \nyears ago, including funds from the ISTEA reauthorization bill. That \nshould mean that the funding for the traverse city bypass, later \nreprogrammed to the grand vision, will not be included in that \nrescission since it is no longer part of the ISTEA bill. At the request \nof the community, the funds were reprogrammed in the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2005 for an entirely different purpose than the \noriginal legislation and in an entirely different bill. Since that time \nthe community has completed the comprehensive grand vision study and is \nnow poised to implement its recommendations.\n  I am also glad that the bill contains a full year Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act, so that our troops and their families will \nno longer have any doubt about when their next paycheck will arrive. \nAnd I am pleased that it does not include ideologically motivated \npolicy riders that would interfere with women's health care and \nenvironmental protection.\n  But on balance, this bill lacks balance. It seeks solutions only in \ncutting domestic programs that make our Nation safer and more \nprosperous, that protect our environment, and that help the families \nthat have suffered most during the financial crisis and recession, \nwhile protecting the tax cuts that benefit those at the very top.\n  Because of that lack of balance, that lack of fairness, I am unable \nto support this bill. But I am encouraged that, thanks to the \nleadership President Obama showed this week, and thanks to the voices \nof the many of us who are arguing for a balanced approach to deficit \nreduction, we are finally engaged in an open and honest debate over the \nvision we should follow for the future of our country.\n  In the weeks and months ahead, we will finally seek an answer to the \nquestion of whether we will all share in the\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nsacrifices required, and whether the same people who have done so very \nwell over the last decade or so will be asked to contribute. I agree \nwith our President, who said this week:\n\n       At a time when the tax burden on the wealthy is at its \n     lowest level in half a century, the most fortunate among us \n     can afford to pay a little more. I don't need another tax \n     cut. Warren Buffett doesn't need another tax cut. Not if we \n     have to pay for it by making seniors pay more for Medicare. \n     Or by cutting kids from Head Start. Or by taking away college \n     scholarships that I wouldn't be here without. . . . And I \n     believe that most wealthy Americans would agree with me. They \n     want to give back to the country that's done so much for \n     them. Washington just hasn't asked them to.\n\n  Let me add that I will vote against both of the correcting \nresolutions before us today. It is ironic indeed that Republicans claim \nto be fighting the deficit by blocking the implementation of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which according to the \nCongressional Budget Office will reduce the deficit by $210 billion \nfrom 2012 to 2021. Likewise, the attempt to prohibit funding for \nPlanned Parenthood has nothing to do with the deficit and everything to \ndo with extreme ideology.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, after 6\\1/2\\ months it appears the \nCongress may finally be able to finish the fiscal year 2011 \nappropriations process. Earlier today the House passed a Department of \nDefense Appropriations bill which includes an extension of the current \ncontinuing resolution through the end of the fiscal year. If the Senate \npasses this legislation and the President signs it, we will be able to \nclose the books on this issue and focus our attention on the budget for \nfiscal year 2012.\n  In reflecting upon how we got here, I wish to point out to my \ncolleagues that the fundamental reason we find ourselves debating a \ncontinuing resolution today is because 1 year ago the Congress was \nunable to agree upon a budget resolution. The failure to reach a \nconsensus agreement on the budget meant the Appropriations Committee \nwas asked to resolve the differences in spending itself. After months \nof attempting to do so, the committee was unable to bridge the gap \nbetween the Republicans and Democrats.\n  When the committee finally adopted a funding level proposed by the \nRepublicans, a hostile political environment crippled the committee's \nefforts to enact a bipartisan budget plan. As we go forward I would ask \nall of my colleagues to think carefully about this, and I urge everyone \nto cooperate both here in the Senate and with our colleagues in the \nHouse. If we can fashion a compromise budget agreement this year it \nmight allow our committee to restore the bipartisan working \nrelationship which has long been the hallmark of the committee for \ngenerations. I sincerely hope that will be the case.\n  In some respects today we can take that first step. The bill that we \nare considering reflects a bipartisan agreement reached among the \nleadership of the House and Senate and the White House with the details \nbeing worked out by the Committees on Appropriations. It is a very \ntough measure that cuts domestic spending more than I am comfortable \nwith, but it is dramatically superior to the alternative passed by the \nHouse 2 months ago and equally superior to not passing an extension \nthrough the end of the year.\n  In total, the measure reduces government spending $78.5 billion below \nthe President's request. It is nearly $40 billion below the enacted \nlevel for fiscal year 2010. Never before have we cut our appropriated \nfunding so drastically. By far and away this is the largest 1-year cut \nfrom the President's budget request in the Nation's history. The bill \ncuts all categories of spending: defense, international, and domestic, \ndiscretionary and mandatory. While some of my colleagues will argue \nthat the Department of Defense was ``let off the hook,'' others will \nprobably say the bill cuts more from defense than is prudent.\n  Including military construction, the Defense Department's budget is \nreduced $20 billion below the President's request. In comparison to the \nfiscal year 2010 enacted funding, the department's budget is \napproximately $2 billion below a freeze, with military construction \ndown by more than $6 billion and the rest of defense increasing by more \nthan $4 billion.\n  The priority in this defense bill is first and foremost to ensure \nthat we treat our military personnel and their families fairly. This \nmeans a 1.4 percent pay raise. It means fully funding health care, but \nit also means ensuring that our forces have the proper equipment and \nthe funding necessary to operate it. While funding is austere, the bill \nincludes important enhancements such as buying more missiles for our \nAegis missile defense ships, and more helicopters for search and rescue \noperations and medical evacuation in Afghanistan. It means investing in \nnew technologies at a faster pace than requested, purchasing more \ndrones to find and wipe out terrorists, and ensuring the safety of our \nsoldiers and Marines by accelerating the purchases of safer Stryker \nvehicles and MRAPs.\n  Accomplishing this while at the same time reducing defense spending \nhas been a challenge, but working with our colleagues in the House we \nhave put together a plan which fulfills all of these objectives.\n  But this bill isn't just about defense. For the State Department and \nforeign assistance, we are providing $8 billion less than was \nrequested. This low level of funding was the most we could get our \ncolleagues in the House to agree with, and it means many important \nprograms will have to be reduced. We won't be able to make as much \nprogress on fighting AIDS and hunger. We won't have as much funding as \nI would like to support our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. But \nconsidering the budget situation we face, we will have to make do.\n  It is in the area of domestic spending in which the bill makes the \nmost serious reductions, with the total included being approximately \n$50 billion below the President's request. In achieving this rate of \nsavings, this compromise measure sought out as many different ways to \nreduce spending as possible to allow us to preserve our critically \nimportant priorities. We were able to mitigate the damage by looking at \nareas where we could identify savings from mandatory spending and by \nrescinding lower priority funds. In total, domestic discretionary \nspending is cut by $38.3 billion while mandatory spending comes down by \n$17.7 billion.\n  Many, many programs had to be cut to reach these levels. In health \ncare, in education, in housing, in infrastructure, but this bill is \nmuch better than the approach adopted by the House in HR 1. For \nexample, we were able to fully fund Head Start--restoring the House \nRepublican cut of $1.4 billion which would have denied 218,000 children \nan opportunity to learn. We provided $30.7 billion for NIH, $1.4 \nbillion more than the House Republicans. We provided $2.1 billion more \nfor food safety than the Republican plan.\n  In energy, housing, our National Parks, our transit programs, in \nevery area we forced the House to back away from their unwise cuts \nwhich would have devastated the progress we are making to restore the \neconomy and protect our people. Crazy ideas like furloughing Social \nSecurity workers and shutting off food inspections were turned around. \nBut there is more to this story. The House bill wasn't just about \ndangerous and drastic cuts; it was also an attempt to legislate \nterrible social policy on a must pass emergency spending bill.\n  Here too we turned them around. Nearly a dozen provisions to overturn \nhealth care reform were rejected. Eleven riders to gut the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency were rejected. Provisions to eliminate \nsuccessful programs like needle exchanges, and the Corporation on \nPublic Broadcasting were denied. Their attempts to rewrite gun laws and \nnet neutrality were rejected.\n  It is true and regrettable that we had to accept limited provisions \naffecting the District of Columbia on abortion and school vouchers. We \nare not happy about that. Still, in comparison to what the House wanted \nto do, this bill is an enormous improvement even for the District of \nColumbia.\n  As in any compromise, neither party to the agreement is happy with \nevery item in the bill. Some on the other side would have preferred \nmore cuts in domestic programs while most members on our side believe \nwe have cut our domestic priorities too deeply. But, this is truly a \nbipartisan bill. When it is approved it will be the most significant\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\nlegislation to pass the Congress this year.\n  I believe this bill provides a road map on how we can continue to \nwork across party lines to achieve what is necessary for the country. \nYesterday the President unveiled his long-range strategy to reduce the \ndeficit. His approach is extremely different than the approach of the \nHouse Republicans. In 2 weeks our Senate Budget Committee will unveil \nits plan on regaining fiscal control. It is not overstating the case to \nsay that it is truly a matter of urgent national security that we reach \nacross party lines and conclude an agreement with our colleagues in the \nHouse to regain control over our government's finances.\n  Both parties feel strongly about their recommendations and the \nstructure of future budgets. The philosophical divisions are wide. But \nas I watched the President's speech, I thought about this continuing \nresolution and how we were able to bridge a huge divide between the \nHouses and the political parties. Because of this experience I became \nmore optimistic that we can find a way to work with our House \ncolleagues and come up with a deficit reduction plan that would \nrepresent all of our best efforts to act in the Country's interest.\n  Today it is vitally important that we take that first step toward \nputting our fiscal house in order by adopting this bill. It is also \ncritical that the Congress demonstrate that it can act in the spirit of \ncompromise and in the national interest. This bill represents a fair \ncompromise which will meet our country's needs, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Madam President, I submit pursuant to Senate rules a report, and I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Disclosure of Congressionally Directed Spending Items\n\n       I certify in accordance with rule XLIV of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate that there are no congressionally \n     directed spending items contained in H.R. 1473.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, as ranking member of the Committee on \nAppropriations, I regret that the Senate must consider in mid-April an \nappropriations bill for a fiscal year that is already half over. It \ndisturbs me that we have subjected the Federal Government to eight \nshort-term continuing resolutions over the past 6 months. Such measures \nare inefficient, add hidden costs to Federal contracts and \nprocurements, and make it difficult for State and local governments to \nplan effectively. Such measures also have a detrimental impact on the \nmorale of the Federal workforce, including our men and women in uniform \nwho last week, even while engaged in hostilities overseas, were left \nwondering about their next paycheck.\n  However, this delay has made possible significant spending \nreductions. The bill cuts $38 billion from the spending levels in place \nat the beginning of this Congress. It also cuts $78 billion from the \nPresident's fiscal year 2011 budget request. These reductions in \nspending will compound over time and, if sustained, will result in a \nsignificant reduction in our national debt. These reductions don't come \nwithout consequences, however. The bill cuts programs that are \nimportant both nationally and in my State of Mississippi. This bill \ncontains rescissions of funds I once fought hard to appropriate but \nwhich have not been spent for a variety of reasons. In many cases, we \ndon't yet know the precise impacts of the various cuts because so much \ndiscretion is left to the implementing agencies. We all recognize, \nhowever, that sacrifices must be made in order to achieve the greater \ngood of fiscal solvency.\n  We also recognize that the bill is only one step toward addressing \nour Nation's debt problem. Although discretionary spending will be an \nimportant component of any solution to that problem, we will fail to \nsolve it if we focus on discretionary spending alone. Hopefully, the \nagreement reached on this bill will lay a foundation for the much more \ndifficult decisions on entitlements and taxes that lie ahead.\n  We also realize some will think this bill cuts far too little and \nsome will think it cuts too much. I suspect that, individually, each of \nus could write spending bills at much lower levels than are contained \nin this legislation. We could fund those things we deem to be \npriorities and significantly cut back or eliminate the rest. But this \nlegislation, instead, represents the priorities of the people of the \nentire Nation as expressed and negotiated by their duly elected \nRepresentatives, Senators, and the President.\n  On balance, the process has worked well. But without a budget \nresolution or any agreement on an appropriate top-line discretionary \nspending level, there was little agreement on the level of funding in \nappropriations bills. As a result, we are once again presented with a \nsingle trillion-dollar package that no Senator has had an opportunity \nto amend. The bill gives enormous flexibility to the executive branch \nbecause it does not contain the detailed directives typically found in \nappropriations bills and reports. And, of course, it is 6 months late.\n  I hope in the coming months that Congress and the President will \nreach consensus on a budget plan that will address each of the major \ndrivers of our current fiscal imbalance, including discretionary \nspending. We need to find a way to bring fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations bills to the floor individually and get them to \nconference with the other body. I believe such a process would provide \nneeded constraints on spending levels while allowing all Members to \ninfluence the content of the individual bills.\n  Madam President, I will vote for this bill, and I urge the Senate to \napprove it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair. Madam President, it is \ncoincidental, but my remarks follow in a logical path from those of my \ncolleague and friend from Texas, particularly with regard to the \nthoughtful questions he raised about Syria.\n  I have come to the floor to speak about the historic and \nextraordinary events that are taking place in Syria where, for the past \n3 weeks, the Syrian people have been peacefully and courageously taking \nto the streets of their cities. I wish to talk particularly about what \nmay happen in Syria over the next 24 hours.\n  What is happening, of course, in Syria is part of a broader story \nthat is unfolding across the Middle East--a democratic awakening in \nwhich millions of ordinary people are rising up against corrupt \nautocratic regimes that have ruled the region and suppressed these \npeople for decades. But the strategic stakes in Syria are among the \nhighest anywhere in the region. In fact, I would say what happens in \nSyria in the coming days will have far-reaching consequences for the \nfuture of the Middle East and for our national security here in the \nUnited States.\n  The uprising in Syria began, like those in Tunisia and Egypt, \nspontaneously and unexpectedly. It rose from the people, not from \noutside. It began in the city of Dara'a, in southern Syria near the \nJordanian border, after the Assad regime arrested a group of \nschoolchildren there. When the citizens of Dara'a began peacefully \nassembling to protest this absurd act of repression, the police \nresponded by firing live ammunition into the crowd. Rather than being \nintimidated by this violence, however, the protest movement persisted \nand spread.\n  Although the Assad regime was trying desperately to prevent accurate \ninformation about what is happening inside Syria from reaching the rest \nof the world, it is clear that people in many cities around the country \nare now in open revolt against the Assad regime.\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\nFrom Latakia, to Aleppo, and from the Kurdish northeast to the villages \nalong the Mediterranean coastline, more and more Syrians from diverse \nbackgrounds are rising up and demanding their freedom.\n  What exactly are they asking for? It is the same basic demands we \nhear throughout the region, and they are very familiar--they should \nbe--to the American people, because they are the very demands that \nenergized and motivated our rebellion and the American Revolution and \nthe founding documents of our country. The people of Syria want greater \npolitical freedom and they want economic opportunity. They want into \nthe modern world. They want to be treated with respect by their \ngovernment, and they want an end to the culture of corruption and \nimpunity that surrounds the Assad regime.\n  How has Bashar al Assad reacted to these legitimate grievances? The \nanswer is he has responded not by offering reform but by unleashing \nwhat President Obama has rightly characterized as abhorrent violence \nand repression against the Syrian people. He has responded with thugs \nand militias who have attacked peaceful protestors. He has responded by \nspouting conspiracy theories rather than loosening his autocratic grip. \nAnd as we know now, he has responded by calling on his allies, his \npatrons in Teheran, to help him crush the demonstrations by the Syrian \npeople, just as the Iranian regime--the fanatical, extremist, \nexpansionist regime in Teheran, stamped out the protests that took \nplace in Teheran after the June 2009 election.\n  It is now clear what path Bashar al Assad is on. Rather than pursuing \nreform, he is taking a page from the Qadhafi model. He is betting that \nhe can beat his people into submission through force and that the world \nwill let him get away with slaughter.\n  Let's be very clear what it means if Bashar succeeds. It will send a \nmost perverse but unmistakable message that leaders such as Mubarak and \nBen Ali in Egypt and Tunisia respectively and who are allied with the \nUnited States get overthrown, but leaders such as Assad, who are allied \nwith Iran, survive. Is that a message we want to send?\n  What about tomorrow? Why do I focus on the next 24 hours? Tomorrow is \nlikely to be a critical day for the future of Syria as protestors come \ntogether after Friday's prayers. There is a significant danger that it \nwill also become a very bloody day if Assad continues on the path of \nviolence and brutality against his own people.\n  This is, therefore, an urgent moment for American leadership, at \nleast for America's voice to be heard. It is important for President \nAssad in Damascus to know today, before the protests that are likely to \ntake place throughout Syria tomorrow, that his regime will be held \naccountable for its actions.\n  I hope we will be prepared to act quickly together with the world \ncommunity if Assad fails to heed the will of the Syrian people and \ntries to hang on to power through repression and murder.\n  What can we do? Well, to begin with, we can impose tough and targeted \nsanctions on the Syrian officials responsible for the human rights \nabuses that are being perpetrated against their own people. We can also \nwork with our allies to summon a special session of the U.N. Human \nRights Council in Geneva, just as we did in the case of Libya, and we \ncan refer Assad's regime to the international criminal court, just as \nwe did with Qadhafi.\n  We should also embrace the Syrian opposition, the freedom fighters. I \nhope senior American officials will meet with prominent Syrian \ndissidents who are here in Washington now. I also urge the \nadministration to speak out clearly in support of the Syrian people who \ndeserve praise for their courage as they risk their lives for freedom \nand human rights. They must know that the United States, still the \nbeacon of liberty in the world, stands on their side. In the face of \nattacks by the Syrian regime, Syrian protesters have remained \nremarkably peaceful, as the protesters in Tunisia and Egypt before them \ndid. In the face of sectarian provocations by Assad, the people of \nSyria who are protesting have remained together, unified, giving a \nmessage of national unity.\n  I know some have suggested that we should hesitate before throwing \nour support to the Syrian opposition, to the Syrian people as they rise \nup, and this argument goes like this: Bashar al Assad is the devil we \nknow. We don't know what might replace him if he fails. But we know \nenough about Bashar al Assad to know, and we know enough about the \nopposition to know that it cannot be worse than Assad and will be much \nbetter.\n  The arguments that we should wait and see are, in my opinion, moral \nand strategic nonsense when we look at the record of Assad. He is \nIran's most important Arab ally and, in some senses, Iran's only real \nally and the strategic linchpin between Iran and its terrorist proxies, \nHamas and Hezbollah, whom he sustains with financial and military \nsupport. Assad is responsible for a terrible campaign, long standing, \nof intimidation and destabilization of Lebanon, and the blood of \nLebanese leaders--too many of them--is on his hands, including that of \nthe great Lebanese leader Rafik Hariri.\n  As Senator Cornyn said, Assad also has the blood of countless \nAmerican soldiers on his hands, having allowed Syria to be used for \nyears by foreign extremist fighters affiliated with al-Qaida and their \nilk to head to Iraq to attack and kill Americans and Iraqis.\n  Finally, let's not forget Syria's illegal nuclear activities. This is \na regime that tried to build a secret nuclear reactor. They did so with \nhelp from North Korea. This is a regime that continues to refuse to \ncooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency in its \ninvestigation of Syria's illegal nuclear activities.\n  The plain fact is that Bashar al Assad is not a reformer, he is a \ndictator. He runs a totalitarian regime that has long been one of the \nworst in the Middle East.\n  This is a regime that has repressed, intimidated, and, in fact, \ntortured and slaughtered Syrian people. It is a regime that is deeply \ncorrupt, and it is a regime that has been a menace to its neighbors and \nto the cause of peace throughout the region.\n  We now have an opportunity--and I say a responsibility--to support \nfreedom for the Syrian people as they seek a better future for \nthemselves. It would be a shame if they and we lost this opportunity \nfor the Arab spring to come to Syria. I hope, together with our allies, \nwe will seize this moment and stand in solidarity with the people in \nSyria who are fighting for the fundamental values on which our own \ncountry was built: freedom and opportunity.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with my \ngood friend, the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, a lot of Members now understand the \nproblem we have with the port of Charleston in 2011. There is no money \nin the President's budget to do a scoping study. Under the new rules \nconcerning earmarking, it has been very difficult to find a way \nforward. With the help of the majority leader and his staff and the \npeople on Appropriations--the staffs of Senators Feinstein and Lamar \nAlexander--we came up with\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\nlanguage that would allow 12 different ports to have studies completed \nin fiscal year 2011, if the Corps chose to engage in those studies. It \nwas not a requirement, and it had no sums required in terms of what the \nCorps had to spend. It was purely discretionary. Unfortunately, our \nHouse colleagues did not accept that language.\n  My problem is that in fiscal year 2011, there is no mechanism as of \nyet to allow a scoping study to be done for the potential deepening of \nthe Charleston harbor to accept supercargo ships coming through the \nPanama Canal in 2014. This harbor, along with others, has to be \ndeepened to accept these new ships. The amount of money is $40,000 on \nthe Federal side to be matched by the State. People ask me: Why can't \nyou come up with the money? Boeing, BMW, Michelin, the State of South \nCarolina?\n  I would do the $40,000, but I can't. You cannot have a private entity \ntake over a Federal Government responsibility. So this is one of those \nsituations that is a catch-22. It is an anomaly in the law. The Vice \nPresident's office and Congressman Clyburn, a lot of us, Congressman \nScott, have been working diligently, with the assistance of the \nmajority leader, to find a pathway forward within the current system. \nWe are very close to finding a way to get this study done because it \nwas a previously authorized program under current law.\n  I have put a hold on everything I could put a hold on.\n  Now I believe we are making progress. The majority leader has some \nneeds, and I want to let him know I am willing to work with him and \nothers to end the Senate well before we go out on Easter break. I thank \nhim for the help he has given me to take care of a problem that no one \ncould have anticipated. But it is a real problem for the people of \nSouth Carolina. I wish to let him know I appreciate the effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, I am aware of the 12 ports that need help. But out \nof the 12, there is none more needed--and we as a country would get \nsuch a bang for our buck--to do what is necessary than the port of \nCharleston. I first compliment the Senator from South Carolina for his \nproposed solution to a challenge facing the State. He is dogged in \nrepresenting the State of South Carolina. This is an issue that is \nimportant to the people of his State. His solution would not in any way \nviolate any of the rules we have in the Senate. It is something that \nwould not be part of congressionally directed spending in the true \nsense of the word that has been not approved by people in recent years. \nI have been part of the Appropriations Committee since I first came to \nthe Senate.\n  I love that committee. I know the good things it can do for our \ncountry and has done for our country. This merit-based competitive port \nfund that has been suggested would not be limited to South Carolina, \neven though I think it is the most needy of the 12. This would not \nguarantee that the port study in Charleston would go forward but would \nprovide the Corps the opportunity to move forward should they choose.\n  Mr. President, I not only have been a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, but for a long, long time--a long time--the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici, and I--that was our subcommittee, Energy and \nWater, and that is where this money comes from.\n  This is so necessary to be done. I understand the Corps' obligations. \nThis is something we have to do. And even though my friend acknowledged \nthis vote we just took care of the funding until the end of this year--\nbut that is the end of this fiscal year. There are going to be other \npieces of legislation to come to this floor. We could, at any time--any \ntime--move forward on this. I thought we had a solution because of the \nanomaly we found ourselves in to work this out with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  It is not often that I am a cheerleader for pieces of legislation \nthat are suggested and moved forward by Republicans, but I was on this \none. This is something that is merit-based and is fair. I am going to \ncontinue to do everything I can for my friend from South Carolina to \nsee if before the end of this fiscal year we can get something done. It \nis important to him. It is important to our country because of the \nvalue that port has to our country.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the majority leader very much. It is appreciated \non behalf of all of us in South Carolina. And I look forward to finding \na solution for the country as a whole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SPC Dennis \n``Danny'' Poulin, a Rhode Islander who served in the Massachusetts \nNational Guard.\n  On March 28, Specialist Poulin was a gunner in an MRAP when it rolled \nover in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. He was medically evacuated to \nLandstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, where, tragically, he \ndied 2 days later but surrounded by his loving family. He was laid to \nrest today in Rhode Island.\n  Specialist Poulin grew up in Pawtucket, RI, and graduated in 2004 \nfrom Tolman High School. He joined the National Guard in 2008 and was \npromoted to specialist in May of 2010. As a member of the Massachusetts \nNational Guard Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 181st Infantry \nRegiment, he deployed to Afghanistan in July 2010.\n  Each generation of Americans is called upon to protect and sustain \nour democracy. And there are no greater heroes than the men and women \nwho have worn the uniform of this Nation and who have sacrificed for \nthis country to keep it safe and to keep it free.\n  It is our duty to protect the freedom they sacrificed their lives for \nthrough our service, our citizenship. We must continue to keep their \nmemories alive and honor their heroism.\n  Today, our thoughts are with Specialist Poulin's mother Doris, his \nfather Richard, his sisters, Jennifer and Angelique, his longtime \ngirlfriend Ashley and their son Nikolous, and all of his family, \nfriends, and his comrades-in-arms. We join them in commemorating his \nsacrifice and honoring his example of selfless service, of love, and of \ncourage that he has demonstrated to all of us.\n  Specialist Poulin is one among many Rhode Islanders who have proven \ntheir loyalty, their integrity, and their personal courage by giving \nthe last full measure of their lives in service to their country in \nAfghanistan, in Iraq, and throughout the centuries. Today, we honor his \nmemory and honor the memory of those who have served and those who have \nsacrificed.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am honored to join my senior Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Jack Reed, today on the floor of the U.S. Senate to \nhonor the brave service of SPC Dennis C. Poulin, who died of injuries \nsustained while serving his country in Afghanistan.\n  Specialist Poulin, or ``Danny,'' as he was known, had been assigned \nto the Kunar Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan. I have \nvisited on several occasions the Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction \nTeam, and I am well aware of the demands that are put on the security \nteams who allow the provincial reconstruction offices to do their vital \nwork.\n  Danny's vehicle overturned while he was conducting a mounted combat \npatrol, causing severe injuries. Sadly, as a result of those injuries, \nhe passed away on March 31, 2011, at Landstuhl Medical Center \nsurrounded by his family.\n  Danny was born in Pawtucket, RI, where he lived for most of his life. \nAfter graduating from Tolman High School, he joined the Army National \nGuard and served with the Massachusetts National Guard's Alpha Company, \n1st Battalion, 181st Infantry Regiment.\n  Specialist Poulin served with honor and distinction, receiving \nnumerous awards and decorations, including the Army Commendation Medal, \nthe Army Achievement Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Meritorious \nUnit Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, \nthe Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, \nand the Combat\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\nInfantry Badge. We hope that upon review of this incident, he will be \nawarded his Nation's Purple Heart.\n  Danny will be remembered for his commitment to his family and unit. \nHe was a devoted father, son, and brother, who loved his family very \ndeeply. His fellow soldiers describe him as a hero and the kind of guy \nwho always put others before himself.\n  As family and friends gather today in Rhode Island for his memorial \nservice, I would like to join Senator Reed in expressing my most \nsincere condolences for this terrible loss to his family and to our \nState. And on behalf of all Rhode Islanders, I want to thank Danny for \nhis selfless service and his ultimate sacrifice.\n  Our hearts go out to his mother Doris, to his father Richard, to his \nsisters, Jennifer and Angelique, to his girlfriend Ashley, and \nespecially to his 5-year-old son Nikolous, who will carry on his legacy \nand spirit.\n  We will never forget the sacrifice Danny and his family and friends \nhave endured for our country, and my thoughts and prayers are with them \nduring this difficult time.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for its attention to these remarks, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m., \nTuesday, May 3, the Senate resume consideration of S. 493, the small \nbusiness jobs bill; that no amendments, points of order, or motions be \nin order during the pendency of this agreement other than the \namendments listed in this agreement and budget points of order and \napplicable motions to waive; that the pending amendments be set aside \nand Senator Landrieu or her designee be recognized to call up the \nfollowing amendments: DeMint No. 300 to Paul No. 299; Carper No. 289, \nwith a modification, which is at the desk; Pryor No. 278; Merkley No. \n272; and Landrieu No. 234; that the DeMint second-degree amendment No. \n300 be agreed to; that the time until 2:15 p.m. be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees; that at 2:15 p.m., the \nSenate proceed to votes in relation to the following amendments in the \norder listed below: Cornyn No. 186; Paul No. 199, as amended; Hutchison \nNo. 197; Cardin No. 240; Snowe No. 253; Carper No. 289, as modified; \nPryor No. 278; Merkley No. 272; and Landrieu No. 234; that there be no \namendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes other than the \nDeMint second-degree amendment to the Paul amendment; that each \namendment be subject to a 60-vote threshold; and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; further, that \nthe Vitter amendment No. 178 and the Pryor amendment No. 229 be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object, I have an \nadditional amendment I would like to have considered on this list. I \nthought we had an agreement that there would be an even number of \namendments offered on both sides, and now I understand that in the \nrequest that is put forward by the majority leader, there are five \namendments on the Democratic side and four amendments on our side.\n  I would like to ask consent, because I thought my amendment--Snowe \namendment No. 299--would also be included in the agreement. So I am \nasking unanimous consent that the order be modified to include Snowe \namendment No. 299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the leader modify?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to my friend's request with the \nfollowing explanation: We have worked very hard to get this bill done. \nThis is a committee of which the Senator from Maine was chairman. She \nis now the ranking member. This legislation--underline this--is \nextremely important. It has done in the past wonderful things for our \ncountry. This innovation that this bill allows to go forward has \ncreated things such as the electric toothbrush and many other things. \nIt is a good piece of legislation.\n  The legislation of my friend from Maine is not relevant or germane to \nthis legislation. What is going to happen--if she objects to the \nrequest I have offered, this bill will not go forward. And that is too \nbad. We have worked all week long--in fact, some into last week--trying \nto get these amendments cleared and agreed to.\n  The sad part about her amendment is that we cannot get agreement not \nonly from our side but on her side. Without going into detail who they \nare, people do not want to do this amendment because it has no direct \nrelevance to this legislation.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, her legislation has not had a \nhearing. It is something that is a big bill not only in content but in \npages, and it should have a hearing. Senators should know what they are \nvoting on in more detail. The other amendments we have gone through \nhave been perused very closely and people understand what is in them \nand people can vote intelligently on those.\n  Now, my first inclination is to say: Well, let's go ahead and do it \nand try to defeat it, but that is not the way we should do legislation.\n  So I am terribly disappointed that the Senator from Maine, the former \nchairman of this committee, recognizing the importance of this \nlegislation, is going to cause this legislation to fail, and we very \nlikely will not have time to bring it up again. Now, if that is what my \nfriend wants on her legislative conscience, that is fine. But I think \nit really should not be there. For someone who understands this \nlegislation as well as she does, it is wrong to stand in the way of our \ncompleting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments that have been \nmade by the majority leader. But to the contrary, this is very relevant \nto the underlying legislation. It is about regulatory reform. And if \nyou were to ask the small business community exactly what is their \nmajor priority in the U.S. Congress, it would be regulatory reform. \nUndeniably, it is one of the most onerous burdens placed on small \nbusinesses today, and our economic well-being. We have had numerous \nhearings within our committee that touch on the issue of regulatory \nreform, and my legislation would reform the process to ensure that \nsmall businesses are free to compete and to create jobs.\n  What could be more important at a time when we are struggling to \ncreate jobs in our economy, where we need to create millions of jobs if \nwe are ever going to turn around this serious unemployment rate that is \nplaguing our Nation today and critically affecting the personal \nfinancial well-being of all Americans?\n  So, Mr. President, I am surprised with the standard proposed now \nabout hearings. We have had numerous hearings touching on the subject. \nThe question is that we never addressed the issue in the U.S. Senate. \nAs I look through the number of amendments that are going to be offered \nto vote on in the majority leader's unanimous consent request, many of \nthese amendments have not had hearings either, they have not been the \nsubject of very specific hearings.\n  The point is, everyone has had the opportunity and would have the \nopportunity to review this legislation and debate it amply, and would \nbe able to explore these issues. My legislation has drawn the broad \nsupport of the small business community nationwide. They reviewed the \nlegislation. They understand the implications. They understand the \nbenefits if we do regulatory reform, and they understand the \nconsequences if we do not.\n\n  So I am just surprised that there is a new standard here because we \nhave passed numerous pieces of legislation on the floor of the Senate \nthat may not be subject to a specific hearing, but have been touched \nupon in numerous hearings on various subjects. The same is true of the \namendment that had been included in the majority leader's unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  So I will have to object at this time to the underlying consent \nagreement since I am unable to have a vote on my amendment. Hopefully, \nwe can review this upon return from the recess so we can go forward \nwith these votes.\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would finally say that this legislation, \nunder any circumstances, is not relevant or germane to the underlying \nbill. That is very clear. This legislation that now has to be \nconsidered by the Senate has not had a hearing. Sure, we have had \nhearings on regulatory reform. We have had hearings on the environment \nalso. But when you bring up a piece of legislation that is new, we \ndeserve to know what it is about.\n  These other amendments, we know what they are about. Hers is too \ndetailed and complicated. It is not germane or relevant. It has had no \nhearings. I am stunned by the new standard suggested by my friend from \nMaine: Democrats have more amendments than Republicans; therefore, we \nshould consider an amendment that is not germane, irrelevant, and has \nnever had a hearing.\n  So I am disappointed my friend from Maine is killing this \nlegislation. We have spent enough time on this legislation, and it is \nreally too bad. The chairman of the committee doesn't support it. The \nchairman of the Small Business Committee does not support this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I heard the majority leader's comments, and \nI appreciate them. It is not about the evenness of the amendments, but \nthat was the agreement. That was the understanding before I arrived on \nthe floor. My staff worked in concert with the staff of the Small \nBusiness Committee chair, Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, so that was \nthe agreement. So that agreement obviously changed sometime in the last \nhour.\n  Getting beyond that point, though, in talking about hearings, when I \nlook at the list of amendments that are going to be voted on and put \nforward in the majority leader's unanimous consent agreement, many of \nthese amendments have not had specific hearings. But everybody in the \nsmall business community, every small business in America, understands \nthe value of regulatory reform. It is a very straightforward piece of \nlegislation.\n  Many of these issues have been addressed in hearings. Last fall we \nhad a small business jobs bill, part of which was a $30 billion lending \nfacility, and, believe me, there were serious problems with that \nlending facility. But that was not the subject of one Senate hearing, \nand I just want to understand, to garner clarity with respect to the \nstandards that are now being established.\n  This issue is very important. Regulatory reform is absolutely crucial \nand central to small business job creation, not to mention survival. \nYou don't have to take too many Main Street tours to figure out what is \nhappening on Main Street. They are struggling to survive. Last year \nalone there were $26 billion in additional regulatory costs that was \nimposed on small businesses across this country as a result of new \nregulations--$26 billion. But what is the total cost of regulations in \nAmerica? It is $1.7 trillion.\n  So is there any question in terms of the urgency and the imperative \nof addressing this issue? It is very central to the underlying \nlegislation. It is about small businesses. It is about regulation and \nthe hardships and the costs that are associated with it, and it is \ndisproportionate on the small business community. It is \ndisproportionate. They pay more than $10,000 per employee, more than \nthe large companies because they don't have the number of employees to \nbe able to fill out the forms and do all that is required that is \nassociated with the complexities and the costs of complying with those \nregulations.\n  So that is the issue. We had a $30 billion lending facility as part \nand parcel of a piece of legislation that was voted on and became law. \nThere are issues with it today and it was not subject to even one \nSenate hearing.\n  So what I am saying is it was my understanding that we had an \nagreement. That is what I understood, that we were going to have an \neven number of amendments on both sides to be offered and that my \namendment was going to be included and brought up for a vote. If \nMembers of the Senate don't want to vote for the amendment, they don't \nhave to vote for the amendment. It is just saying: Please allow us to \nhave a vote on this specific amendment just like the others that are in \nthe majority leader's unanimous consent request. That is all I am \nasking.\n  We have had this bill pending for the last month, and I wanted to \nbring it up, but, unfortunately, for a lot of reasons, we are where we \nare today. That doesn't mean to say that we should not have the \nopportunity to vote on this particular amendment that had been prepared \nto go more than a month ago to be considered on the floor of the \nSenate. But, in any event, I regret we are in this position tonight. \nHopefully, we can work through this during the course of the recess so \nthat we have the opportunity to vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the longer the Senator from Maine talks, the \nmore reason there is not to bring that up in the status that it is in \nnow.\n  She is absolutely right. The issue she talks about in the Wall Street \nreform bill was brought in at a time when there hadn't been hearings, \nand it has created a furor around the country. Now there are people on \nall sides of the issue trying to change that. That is why we need to \nhold hearings. She is absolutely right. The more she talks, the more \nreason there is not to do this amendment.\n  For her to suggest that regulatory reform is something she is all-\nknowing about--and she hasn't said that, but that is the implicit \nstatement she is making--I understand regulation reform. It is a \nburden, and we have to change it.\n  We have been through a number of procedures here. We can remember \nduring the Clinton administration when Al Gore was in charge of \nreducing regulations, and we did a lot of that. It was good, but we \ndidn't do enough. I worked with a Republican Senator by the name of \nNichols from Oklahoma. We changed the law drastically, and it has been \nused in this Congress and the last Congress on several occasions to get \nrid of bad regulations that an administration promulgates. We now have \nthe ability to do that.\n  Is there more we can do? Yes. But to march into this, as suggested by \nmy friend from Maine, would cause people to make a decision on \nlegislation that has not been adequately reviewed. That is why, I \nrepeat, the more she talks about what needs to be done around here, the \nmore reason there is not to do her legislation.\n  As far as an agreement, I had no agreement with anybody. This consent \nagreement was drafted just a short time ago. I have never suggested to \nthe Senator from Maine--we have never had a conversation about this \nuntil during the last votes.\n  I moved to proceed to this bill more than a month ago--more than a \nmonth ago. There comes a time when we have to move the bill or move to \nsomething else.\n  During our next work period, we have some big, important things to \ndo. We are going to have to deal with the PATRIOT Act. We have other \nthings that are extremely important. We cannot spend more time on this \nlegislation. It is unfair to our country, and it is unfair to the small \nbusiness community that badly wants this legislation to go forward so \nthey can do things, as I repeat, such as invent more electric \ntoothbrush-type items.\n  There comes a time when we have to make a decision as to whether \npeople are just stalling this legislation or trying to send some \npolitical message saying: Look, I was able to offer an amendment; I \nwant to do regulation reform, when there is no chance in the world that \nthe Senators have adequate information upon which to vote.\n  So I am very disappointed that very likely this legislation will be \nkilled as a result of my friend, the former chairman of this committee, \nand certainly--I hope she understands how important this underlying \nlegislation is and how her legislation has nothing to do with what is \nin keeping with the germaneness or relevancy to this legislation.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to show my appreciation for the \nactions of seven young Americans who make up this year's School Safety \nPatrol Lifesaving Award recipients as chosen by the American Automobile \nAssociation. In 1920, the American Automobile Association, AAA, began \nthe School Safety Patrol Program in hopes of promoting traffic safety \namongst school children. The AAA School Safety Patrol Program has been \nawarding its highest honor, the Lifesaving Award, to those patrollers \nwho have acted to save the life of another since 1949. This year, seven \nheroic school safety patrollers are receiving this award, and it is my \nhonor to recognize their courageous actions.\n  On February 2, 2011, Paul Hardin, a fifth grader at Canterbury Woods \nElementary School in Annadale, VA, averted a possible tragedy by \npreventing an adult female pedestrian from stepping out into oncoming \ntraffic. When the pedestrian approached the crosswalk, Paul verbally \nwarned her to stop. She ignored Paul's warning and continued walking \ninto the crosswalk at which time Paul stepped off the sidewalk and \ngrasped the woman's arm to prevent her from crossing. An approaching \ncar was within 5 feet of the crosswalk. Paul put the safety of a parent \nbefore his own in his heroic effort to prevent a dangerous situation.\n  Marisha Little and Sierra Walters, safety patrollers at Ranson \nElementary School in Ranson, WV, worked together to save the life of a \nkindergarten student who wandered away from the school heading toward a \nmajor road crossing. This life saving incident that occurred on January \n18, 2011, was the first of two that Marisha Little took part in at \nRanson Elementary. The patrollers remembered seeing the student walking \nalone away from the school and became worried when they no longer had \nhim in sight. After alerting her safety patrol advisor, Sierra left her \npost to find him. Sierra found him and brought him back to the post \nwhere she instructed him to stand behind Marisha. Shortly after, he \ndarted into the street in the path of an oncoming car when he saw his \naunt approaching the school area. Marisha jumped into action, grabbed \nhim and pulled him back to the sidewalk. Their keen awareness and quick \nthinking brought him back to school and prevented him from being hit by \nthe car.\n  Marisha Little and Talyn Underwood were credited with the second life \nsaving incident at Ranson Elementary School in the same month. On \nJanuary 31, 2011, they prevented a second grade student from being \nstruck by a moving vehicle. The student was horsing around, talking to \nhis friends while running backwards into oncoming traffic. Marisha and \nTalyn noticed that the vehicle driver closest to the student was \nlooking in the other direction. Marisha and Talyn screamed loudly to \nalert the student at the same time working their way toward him. Talyn \nreached him first and pulled him by his jacket from the direct path of \nthe moving car. Both students were very quick to respond and didn't \nthink about their own safety in their effort to save their fellow \nstudent.\n  Kamryn Mendell is a safety patroller at the Fox Chapel Elementary \nSchool in Germantown, MD. On September 28, 2010, during morning patrol \nduties, Kamryn immediately reacted when she realized that a first grade \nstudent was beginning to walk into the pathway of a school bus that was \nturning into the school's bus loop. Kamryn and her partner were holding \nback students from crossing when Kamryn's partner had to step away to \nremove a cone to allow the bus to enter the loop. Kamryn kept the \nchildren from crossing with one hand and reached out to grab the first \ngrader who was now 4 to 5 feet in front of the bus. The bus driver \ndidn't see him and continued driving into the loop. Kamryn's fast \nthinking and immediate actions averted a certain life threatening \ninjury.\n  Evan Siegel, a safety patroller at Salmon Creek Elementary School in \nVancouver, WA, saved a 7-year-old girl from being hit by an oncoming \ncar. On a December morning in 2010, Evan noticed a car approaching the \nintersection. It was driven by a teenager who was texting and totally \nunaware that the little girl had entered the crosswalk without \npermission. Evan reacted quickly by putting his crosswalk stick in \nfront of her and pulling her to safety. At the time the car was 10 feet \naway from her and the driver was not slowing down. Evan's courage and \nquick actions are to thank for keeping this young girl safe.\n  Jake Vowell, a fifth grader at George B. Carpenter Elementary School \nin Park Ridge, IL, is credited with saving the life of a 6-year-old \nstudent on February 2, 2010. He was on morning patrol duty, when two \ncars failed to stop at the stop sign when Jake noticed a young girl \nattempting to cross the street. He bravely went out into the street and \npulled her back to safety. His dedication and awareness put him in a \nposition to save this young girl from harm.\n  These seven heroic young leaders demonstrate courage, awareness, and \na commitment to safety. Moreover, these traits are what the AAA School \nSafety Patrol Program embodies as an institution. Patrollers exemplify \nthe kind of services that are needed so that young people safely \nnavigate traffic hazards to and from school. I applaud their commitment \nto improving our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2497-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2497-S2498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Specialist Brent M. Maher\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I address \nmy colleagues today. A hero from my home State, SPC Brent M. Maher of \nHoney Creek, IA, was killed in action on Monday, April 11, 2011 in the \nPaktya Province of Afghanistan. He was 31 years old. Specialist Maher \nwas the gunner on a ``Cougar'' mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, \nMRAP, that was struck by an improvised explosive device.\n  Specialist Maher served in the Iowa Army National Guard, Company B, \n1st Battalion, 168th Infantry, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry \nDivision, out of Shenandoah, IA. Specialist Maher has been posthumously \npromoted to sergeant. Prior to his service in the Iowa National Guard, \nSpecialist Maher served over 7 years in the U.S. Navy. In all, \nSpecialist Maher dedicated 11 years of his life to serving and \nprotecting our Nation. Words simply cannot express the debt we owe to \nSpecialist Maher and all of the other servicemembers fighting for our \nNation.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Brent Maher's family and friends, \nincluding his wife Brenna and his three children, as well as his mother \nCheryl and everyone else who will be grieving his loss.\n  Specialist Maher truly loved his job in the U.S. military. He was \nproud of the difference that he was making in the lives of the Afghan \npeople. It is because of individuals like specialist Maher and his \nloving and supportive family that America is the nation it is today. At \ntimes like these, I think that it is important that we pause and \nremember the lives of those lost in order that we can enjoy our way of \nlife. As we go about our lives as free people, we ought to bear in mind \nthe sacrifices made by Specialist Maher and others in our Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2498-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  CYBER SECURITY PUBLIC AWARENESS ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Cyber \nSecurity Public Awareness Act of 2011, which I have introduced with \nSenator Kyl.\n  The damage caused by malicious activity in cyberspace is enormous and \nunrelenting. Every year, cyber attacks inflict vast damage on our \nNation's consumers, businesses, and government agencies. This constant \ncyber assault has resulted in the theft of millions of Americans' \nidentities; exfiltration of billions of dollars of intellectual \nproperty; loss of countless American jobs; vulnerability of critical \ninfrastructure to sabotage; and intrusions into sensitive government \nnetworks.\n  These massive attacks have not received the attention they deserve. \nInstead, we as a nation remain woefully unaware of the risks that cyber \nattacks pose to our economy, our national security, and our privacy. \nThis problem is caused in large part by the fact that cyber threat \ninformation ordinarily is classified when it is gathered by the \ngovernment or held as proprietary when collected by a company that has \nbeen attacked. As a result, Americans do not have an appropriate sense \nof the threats that they face as individual Internet users, the damage \ninflicted on our businesses and the jobs they create, or the scale of \nthe attacks undertaken by foreign agents against American interests.\n  We must not wait for a disaster before we recognize and respond to \nthe cyber threats we face. A false sense of complacency is not a \nsecurity strategy. For that reason, I believe that raising public \nawareness of cyber security threats is an important element of the \nsubstantial work that we in Congress must do to improve our Nation's \ncyber security.\n  The Cyber Security Public Awareness Act of 2011 takes up that \nchallenge. It will raise the public awareness of the cyber threats \nagainst our nation in a manner that protects classified, business-\nsensitive, and proprietary information. By doing so, it will provide \nconsumers, businesses, and policymakers with the continuous flow of \ninformation necessary to secure our networks, identities, \ninfrastructure, and innovation economy.\n  The bill improves public awareness with respect to three key issues: \nattacks on the government, attacks on infrastructure, and attacks on \nbusinesses and consumers.\n  The bill enhances public awareness of attacks on Federal networks by \nrequiring that the Department of Homeland Security and the Department \nof Defense submit reports to Congress that detail cyber incidents on \nthe ``.gov'' and ``.mil'' domains. These reports would provide \naggregate statistics on breaches, the volume of data exfiltrated, and \nthe estimated cost of remedying these breaches, as well as the \ncontinuing risk of cyber sabotage after an incident.\n  The bill also improves government reporting in two other ways. It \nrequires the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation to submit annual reports on their investigations and \nprosecutions of cyber crimes, as well as on the resources devoted to \ncyber crime and on any legal impediments that frustrate those efforts. \nIt also requires the Department of Justice, in consultation with the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts, to study the preparedness of the \nFederal courts to handle cases relating to botnets or other cyber \nthreats, and to consider whether courts need improved procedural rules, \ntraining, or organization to handle such cases.\n  The bill includes four provisions to enhance the awareness of threats \nagainst our nation's critical infrastructure. First, it requires \nprimary regulators to report to Congress on the cyber vulnerabilities \nin our Nation's critical infrastructure, including our energy, \nfinancial, transportation, and communications sectors, and of \nrecommended steps to thwart or diminish cyber attacks in each industry. \nSecond, it requires the Department of Homeland Security to commission \nreports on improving the network security of critical infrastructure \nentities, including through the possible creation of a secure domain \nthat relies on technical advancements or notice and consent to \nincreased security measures. Third, it requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to identify producers of information technology that \nare linked directly or indirectly to foreign governments. This \nprovision also requires reporting of the vulnerability to malicious \nactivity, including cyber crime or espionage, associated with the use \nof these producers' technologies in the United States' \ntelecommunications networks. And fourth, the bill requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of \nDefense and the Director of National Intelligence, to submit a report \nto Congress describing the threat of a cyber attack disrupting the \nUnited States' electrical grid, the implications of such a disruption, \nthe possibility of quickly reconstituting electrical service in the \nevent of a cyber attack, and plans to prevent such a disruption.\n  The bill also seeks to enhance cyber awareness in the private sector \nand among businesses and consumers using the Internet. It requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to report to Congress on policies and \nprocedures for Federal agencies to assist a private sector entity in \nthe event of a cyber attack that could result in the loss of life or \nsignificant harm to the national economy or national security. To \nensure that our markets properly reflect cyber risks, the bill also \ntasks the Securities Exchange Commission with reporting to Congress on, \nfirst, the extent of financial risk and legal liability of issuers of \nsecurities caused by cyber intrusions or other cybercrimes, and, \nsecond, whether current financial statements of issuers transparently \nreflect these risks. Finally, the bill will help enhance consumer \nawareness of cyber threats by requiring a report to Congress on legal \nor other impediments to public awareness of common cyber security \nthreats, the minimal standards of computer security needed for \nresponsible Internet use, and the availability of commercial products \nto meet those standards. This provision also requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to report on its plans to enhance public awareness of \ncommon cyber security threats and to recommend congressional actions to \naddress remaining impediments to appropriate public awareness of common \ncyber security threats.\n  The Senate has a lot of work ahead as it seeks to improve our \nNation's cyber security. One vital element of this work will be to \nensure that we have an appropriate public awareness of cyber security \nthreats going forward. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthis important task as well as on cyber security issues more broadly.\n  I would particularly like to thank Senator Kyl for working with me on \nthis piece of legislation. Senator Kyl has worked on cyber security \nissues extensively in the past, and we have worked together on \nIntelligence issues, so I very much look forward to partnering with him \non this and other cyber security bills. As demonstrated by the hearing \nwe held this week in the Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee, as well as by the important work previously done \nby the Commerce, Homeland Security, Judiciary, and other Committees, \nthis is a vitally important and urgent national security issue, but one \nthat we can confront in a serious and bipartisan manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2498-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2498-S2499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 96th \nAnniversary of the Armenian Genocide--a tragedy that has left a dark \nstain on the collective conscience of mankind.\n  What has made this tragedy even more painful--particularly for the \nArmenian people--is the failure of successive U.S. administrations to \nacknowledge the deliberate massacre of the Armenians by its rightful \nname--genocide.\n  So today, I also rise to reiterate my call to President Barack Obama \nto finally right this terrible wrong.\n  In 2008, then-Senator Obama said:\n\n       . . . the Armenian Genocide is not an allegation, a \n     personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely \n     documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of \n     historical evidence. The facts are undeniable.\n\n  I could not agree more. And every day that goes by without full \nacknowledgement of these undeniable facts by the United States prolongs \nthe pain felt by descendants of the victims, as well as the entire \nArmenian community.\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\n  Countless experts have documented the atrocities that occurred \nbetween 1915 and 1923, when more than 1.5 million Armenians were \nmarched to their deaths in the deserts of the Middle East, murdered in \nconcentration camps, drowned at sea, and forced to endure unimaginable \nacts of brutality at the hands of the Ottoman Empire--now modern-day \nTurkey.\n  Yet successive U.S. administrations continue only to refer to the \ngenocide by such terms as ``annihilation,'' ``massacre,'' and \n``murder.''\n  This is not only an affront to the memory of the victims and to their \ndescendants, but it does a disservice to the United States as it seeks \nto stand up to those who are perpetrating violence today.\n  In a recent speech President Obama eloquently said:\n\n       Some nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities \n     in other countries. The United States of America is \n     different.\n\n  The United States is not a nation that turns a blind eye to \natrocities, and that is why it is so important that we finally \nacknowledge the Armenian genocide for what it was--genocide.\n  As I have said, genocide is only possible when people avert their \neyes. Any effort to deal with genocide--in the past, present, or \nfuture, must begin with the truth.\n  So this April 24, as we pause to remember the victims and to honor \nthe countless contributions Armenian Americans have made to our great \ncountry, I hope that the U.S. finally stands on the right side of \nhistory and calls the tragedy of 1915-1923 by its rightful name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2499-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CITIZENSHIP NOW!\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for the past 8 years, Citizenship Now!, a \nproject of the City University of New York and the New York Daily News, \nhas conducted a citizenship and immigration call-in, which I have \nvisited every time it has been held at the News headquarters in \nManhattan, NY. On Monday, April 25, the ninth call-in begins, and it is \nanticipated that the volunteers who answer the telephone will handle \nthe 100,000th call by Friday April 29. That means 100,000 families \nreceived information to help them get on the path to U.S. citizenship. \nAmong the sponsors have been the NYS Bureau of Refugee and Immigrant \nAssistance, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, CUNY Law \nSchool, Univision, and Radio WADO, with support from Verizon and \nGristedes.\n  At the weeklong call-in, community paralegals, CUNY counselors, \nstudents, and other volunteers, supervised by experienced citizenship \nand immigration attorneys and Board of Immigration Appeals-accredited \nindividuals, answer callers' questions. CUNY trains the volunteers at \nan all-day training conference that precedes the call-in, and all \nvolunteers receive a comprehensive training manual. Whenever I visit \nthe volunteers, I bring with me an expert staff person from my office \nwho handles constituent inquiries from immigrants and their families. \nWe fully appreciate the special and unique outreach effort this free \npublic service provides.\n  The call-in provides an important safeguard weapon against scammers \nengaging in the unlawful practice of law. Callers who qualify for \nnaturalization or another immigration benefit are referred to reputable \nnon-for-profits. Many are referred to one of CUNY Citizenship Now!'s \nnine citizenship and immigration law service centers where they can get \nfree application assistance and advice. The News features the \nphotographs and biographies of the volunteers in print and on its Web \nsite and runs stories about the people who are being served. When a \ncaller wishes to contact a private attorney, she or he is referred to \nthe New York City Bar Association referral panel and the American \nImmigration Lawyers Association referral service.\n  The CUNY/Daily News Citizenship Now! Project is by far the largest \nuniversity-based immigration service program in the country assisting \nmany thousands of individuals with citizenship and immigration law \nservices each year, all at no cost to the applicants. This public \nservice partnership deserves our recognition and appreciation for the \nsuperb efforts underway to help people in need.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the contributions made \neach day by our Nation's 3,068 county governments and the men and women \nwho serve in county government. They are tireless public servants whose \ndaily efforts to ensure that local government works for all Americans \nare honored during National County Government Month, which takes place \neach April.\n  As a former county executive for New Castle County, DE, I know that \ncounty governments are responsible for providing essential services \nimportant to our communities. New Castle County provides critical \nservices in public safety, land use, parks and libraries, sewers, and \neconomic development. Many other counties provide a broad range of \nservices, such as maintaining roads, bridges, and water systems, and \noperating airports and other transit, and delivering critical health \ncare services. Counties provide law enforcement, courtroom, and jail \nservices, schools, and numerous social services for children, seniors \nand families, and often serve as the first lines of defense for \nemergency response and preparedness.\n  Since 1991, the National Association of Counties, or NACo, has \nencouraged counties across America to highlight their programs and \nservices in order to raise awareness of the important role county \ngovernments play in our national life. National County Government Month \nis a great opportunity to recognize this.\n  The National County Government Month theme for 2011 is ``Serving Our \nVeterans, Armed Forces, and Their Families.'' NACo president Glen \nWhitley, county judge for Tarrant County, TX, is urging all counties to \nhonor and to thank their residents who have served or are currently \nserving our Nation in the military. In addition, Judge Whitley is \nurging counties to showcase their many important services to America's \nveterans, military servicemembers, and their families, such as those \nrelating to physical and mental health, housing, employment, and the \njustice system.\n  In New Castle County, as in many counties across the country, we felt \nthe impact of the call to duty on servicemembers and their families, as \ncounty employees many in our public safety community deployed to Iraq \nand Afghanistan with units of the Reserve and National Guard. I am \npleased to join Judge Whitley and county officials across the country \nin honoring servicemembers and veterans and highlighting the important \nservices county governments provide.\n  National County Government Month also provides the Senate with an \nopportunity to acknowledge that county governments with the help of the \nNational Association of Counties are working together to restore the \npartnership among all levels of government to serve communities across \nAmerica better. We in the Senate share our constituents with county \ngovernment officials and face common challenges. It is incumbent upon \nus to recognize the men and women who work tirelessly within local \ngovernments and provide essential services directly to our \nconstituents. They deserve our sincerest gratitude.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues and all Americans to celebrate April \nas National County Government Month with their home counties and to \nrecognize the important role county governments play in their \ncommunities and the critical services they provide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2499-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2499-S2500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SENATOR JOHN HEINZ\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

A family lost a husband and a father. \nA Commonwealth lost a tireless advocate for older citizens and our \nworkers. I am honored to serve in the Senate seat he held from 1977 to \n1991.\n  Senator Heinz understood that health care has a human face that \ncannot be ignored. He appreciated that employers cannot shoulder the \nburden of costs alone and understood changes needed to be made. He \nworked hard to obtain results for individuals through his position on \nthe Finance Committee and his chairmanship of the Special Committee on \nAging.\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\n  Senator Heinz was a fighter for those without power, a voice for the \nvoiceless. He enjoyed the work that goes along with being a Senator. He \ndelved into policy issues and strived to figure out how government \nworked and how it could work better. He promoted innovation, looked to \nthe future, and sought to find real solutions to the real problems \npeople faced. He worked with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto obtain results. As he once said, ``Our greatest strengths have been \nour diversity and energy, our willingness to tackle problems and solve \nthem, our confidence in the future, and our refusal to be bound by the \npresent.''\n  This month we remember Senator Heinz and his legacy of public service \non behalf of all the people of Pennsylvania, especially those who \nneeded a Senator fighting for them every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2500-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MATT MINER\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to say goodbye to one of \nthe most trusted members of my staff, my chief counsel on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Matt Miner. Matt is leaving to join the prestigious law firm \nof White and Case, where he will be a partner in the Global White \nCollar Practice Group. Matt has been with me since 2008, and I have \nalways been able to rely on his steady, informed judgment, his \ndiscretion, and his indispensable expertise that came from years of \npracticing law both as an assistant U.S. attorney in Montgomery, AL, \nand in private practice.\n  Before joining my staff, Matt served as counsel to chairman Norm \nColeman on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and as chief \ncounsel for crime, terrorism and oversight for former chairman and \nranking member Arlen Specter on the Judiciary Committee. Matt has ably \nserved on my staff for the last 3 years, but his time as Republican \nstaff director of the full Judiciary Committee during the end of the \n111th Congress was especially noteworthy. Matt led the committee during \nthat difficult time, when many last-ditch efforts were made to move \nflawed legislation to the finish line.\n  As a former assistant U.S. attorney, Matt is widely known and \nrespected by Members and staff on both sides of the aisle for his \nexpertise and judgment in the areas of criminal law and sentencing. \nMatt was the principal Senate Republican staffer for the Adam Walsh Act \nof 2006, landmark legislation that laid the groundwork for a national, \ninterstate sex offender registry and which imposed tough new penalties \nand expanded offenses that cracked down on sex trafficking of minors, \nchild pornography, and various sexual assault offenses. Matt also was \nthe key staffer for the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which \nappropriately modified penalties for crack cocaine offenses. His \nknowledge and judgment were key to negotiating a bill that moderated \nthese penalties while ensuring sufficient deterrence for dealers and \ntraffickers.\n  Matt is also highly regarded for his expertise on national security \nissues and was an invaluable resource not only to me but to other \nMembers and their staffs during critical debates on the PATRIOT Act, \nmedia shield, and state secrets. And during my time as ranking member, \nMatt helped to manage two Supreme Court confirmations and numerous \nhigh-level Justice Department confirmations.\n  Importantly, Matt has always taken the time to be a mentor to several \njunior lawyers and staff on the Judiciary Committee, talking with them \nabout opportunities and careers and teaching them how to be effective \nlawyers. I know the junior lawyers on the committee very much \nappreciate that guidance.\n  A Senator is blessed indeed if he has top staff people of outstanding \nability and dedication, but it is a special blessing if the staff \nperson can be depended on to properly reflect and advance the Senator's \nhighest and best values. Matt has my trust and confidence. When he \nsummarizes a complex issue, I know he has intelligently considered it \nand has fairly reported the pros and cons. Such an ability is rare, and \nit has been exceedingly valuable to me. Matt has served his country \nwell, advanced the rule of law, and been a tremendous asset to me as I \nseek to fulfill my duty to the people of this country.\n  I am happy for him in this new position and wish him Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2500-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2500-S2501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR JOHN ``JACK'' GILLIGAN\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, today I wish to honor John ``Jack'' \nGilligan, a model of public service, of decency and intellect, who \nturned 90-years-old last month and now celebrates the 40th anniversary \nof his administration as the 62nd Governor of Ohio.\n  Today there is a great debate on the future of country, as there was \nwhen Jack served as Governor of Ohio from 1971-1974. Our economic \ncompetitiveness was threatened by expanding debt, declining \nmanufacturing, rising gas prices, and waning dominance in technology \nand innovation. Today, we face those challenges coupled with \ncompetition from emerging powers in Asia and productivity increasing \nbut wages stagnating in America. Whether 40 years ago or today, what \nthe middle class looks like in America what we want the future of our \ncountry to look like depends on our leaders making smart, tough, and \nsometimes politically unpopular decisions.\n  That is the role Jack Gilligan played, with poise and skill, and with \nhonesty and candor. When Ohio's public workers needed a voice at that \ntable, he expanded their collective bargaining rights. Understanding \nthat education and infrastructure are keys to our economic \ncompetitiveness, he bolstered investments in each, while understanding \ntax burdens also mean better schools, safer roads, and stronger vital \npublic services like police and fire protection. He also expanded the \nright to vote by lowering the voting age to 18 years old and expanded \nprograms for mental health services and environmental protection.\n  It was during his time as Governor, when I first met Jack Gilligan. \nIt was 1972, when I ran in my first election, for State Representative \nfor the Ohio House representing my hometown of Mansfield. Jack visited \nme one day and offered simple advice, ``Be yourself, know who you're \nfighting for and what you stand for.'' It is advice that I have \nfollowed ever since, wisdom that applies to anyone seeking to uphold \nthe sacred public trust.\n  And by listening to Jack, you learn about the great State of Ohio of \nits geographic and demographic diversity. Jack will say we are a \ndifferent State every 20 miles. We have the same farmers but who grow \ndifferent crops. We have small towns, but we also have different rural \ncommunities. We have the same immigrants but from different countries; \nthe same union family but from different unions. Jack understands that \nthe diversity of our State not only makes it the heartland of America \nbut also its heartbeat.\n  Born March 22, 1922, in Cincinnati, John Gilligan graduated from St. \nXavier High School in 1939 and the University of Notre Dame in 1943. He \nthen enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving in the Atlantic, the Pacific, \nand the Mediterranean during World War II. He was awarded a Silver Star \nfor his service in Okinawa.\n  Upon returning to his hometown after the war, he completed a master's \ndegree and doctorate course work in English literature at the \nUniversity of Cincinnati. He then began his teaching career at Xavier \nUniversity.\n  In 1953, he began his decades long service to the people of Ohio. \nFrom 1953 to 1963, Jack served on the Cincinnati City Council during \nthe civil rights era. His progressivism took him to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1964 as the Congressman from Ohio's 1st District, \nwhere he helped pass groundbreaking progressive pieces of legislation, \nlike the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Undaunted by his defeat for \nreelection--after his district was gerrymandered--and for the Senate in \n1968, Jack continued his public service beyond the halls of government.\n  By 1970, he ran for Governor, driving an old, used van he bought from \na dry cleaner and sleeping on a cot in the back. When a voter asked if \nhe or she could help, he asked them to fill the van with gas. He won. \nAnd he fought each day thereafter to represent the interests of Ohio's \nmiddle class.\n  After leaving the Governor's office in 1974, Jack was asked by \nPresident Carter to serve as Director of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development, USAID, leading efforts to reorganize our \nNation's foreign assistance management programs. By the\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\n1980s and 1990s he returned to teaching, returning to teach at his alma \nmaters, the University of Notre Dame, where he helped found the Kroc \nInstitute for International Peace Studies, and the University of \nCincinnati College of Law. But even in academia, Jack remained active \nin politics and public service. In 1999, at the age of 78, the former \nCongressman-turned-Governor served on the Board of Education for \nCincinnati Public Schools.\n  And throughout his commitment to public service, Jack Gilligan has \nremained a steadfast family man. He married Katie Dixon, with whom he \nraised four children before she died in 1996. He since remarried to \nSusan Freemont, a family practice physician from Cincinnati.\n  As the family patriarch, he has inspired his children Donald, \nKathleen, John, and Ellen to pursue the public good. Kathleen now \nserves as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, having \npreviously served as Governor of Kansas the only time in our Nation's \nhistory that a father and daughter have served as Governors. Secretary \nSebelius helped pass the most important health care law since the \ncreation of Medicare and Medicaid, enacted with the help of her father \nnearly 50 years earlier. To Jack's family, thank you for sharing him \nwith a grateful State and a grateful Nation.\n  2011 marks the 90th birthday of John ``Jack'' Gilligan's and the 40th \nanniversary of his leadership as Ohio's Governor. To Jack, I thank you \nfor your service and for your counsel. And thank you for your continued \nbelief that the fight for social and economic justice is always worth \nit, so long as we remember who we fight for and what we stand for.\n  Happy Birthday, Governor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2500-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2500-S2501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR JOHN ``JACK'' GILLIGAN\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Today, we recognize Roy Estess as one of the giants in NASA \nhistory because of his leadership, intellect, integrity and vision.\n  It was always a pleasure to visit with Roy in Washington or at the \nStennis Space Center because he was both a visionary and a pragmatist. \nHe was a great friend and a trusted source of good advice and counsel \nfor me throughout my career.\n  I continue to marvel at the growth of Stennis, which came to be known \nas the ``Federal City,'' and at the national and international scope of \nwork taking place there every day. Stennis is an essential part of \nNASA's mission today, due largely to Roy's commitment for over 40 \nyears. His footprints will long remain along the paths and roads of \nthat center, which has become a unique asset for our Nation.\n  Roy Estess' legacy continues to influence the future of Stennis and \nthe gulf coast with the construction of the INFINITY Science Center. \nThis project was his vision and dream, and one that will carry on his \neffective, but unassuming, way of inspiring passion for science, \neducation and space exploration.\n  Roy Estess was a true leader who left an indelible mark on me, on the \nState of Mississippi, and on our Nation and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2501-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RAMON C. CORTINES\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Ramon C. \nCortines, his distinguished career and his dedication to improving our \nNation's schools. Cortines is retiring today after 55 years in public \neducation.\n  I know Ramon, or ``Ray,'' as the superintendent of the Los Angeles \nUnified School District in Los Angeles, CA--the Nation's second largest \nschool district. I applaud Ray for being a zealous advocate on behalf \nof the Los Angeles Unified School District and the State of California. \nHis tireless efforts helped to bring Federal funding and reform to its \nschools, especially during this difficult time of budget cuts and \nteacher layoffs.\n  Ray has committed himself to educating young minds. His career \nstarted with humble beginnings as a teacher in elementary, middle and \nhigh schools. After his first teaching job in Aptos, Ray became a \nteacher and administrator in Covina, CA.\n  His career flourished, taking him to administrative positions of \nprincipal, assistant superintendent, administrative director and \nsuperintendent. Ray became an administrator for 4 years and \nsuperintendent of schools for 11 years in Pasadena, CA; superintendent \nin San Jose, CA, for 2 years; superintendent in San Francisco for 6 \nyears; and New York City Schools chancellor for 2 years.\n  Ray also recognizes the importance of higher education. He has acted \nas a consultant to the University of California, the California State \nUniversity and the California Community College systems.\n  Ray's leadership didn't stop at the local level. In December 1992, he \nchaired a U.S. Department of Education transition team for then-\nPresident-elect Clinton. Ray served as a senior adviser to former U.S. \nSecretary of Education Richard Riley. He was also nominated to serve as \nAssistant Secretary of Education for Intergovernmental Affairs by \nPresident Bill Clinton. He served on numerous task forces and \ncommittees with the California Department of Education, U.S. Department \nof Education and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Ray isn't afraid to fight for California schools. He has advocated on \nbehalf of teachers and students in California by testifying on Capitol \nHill about the importance of increasing funding for title I and special \neducation programs, as well as saving teachers' jobs.\n  Ray dedicated himself to serving his country in other ways. He served \nin the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955.\n  I admire Ray's hard work, dedication and commitment to raising \nacademic achievement and turning around low-performing schools. As Los \nAngeles Unified School District Superintendent, Ray concentrated on \nimproving instruction and teacher quality. Under his leadership, the \ndistrict experienced a 16-point increase on the 2010 California \nAcademic Performance Index. The district's overall score topped the 700 \nthreshold for the first time. Ray restructured the first school in the \ndistrict--Fremont High School. Ray's leadership style is no-nonsense \nand I applaud him for what he has accomplished.\n  All of us who care about providing every student with a quality \neducation will miss him.\n  I congratulate Ray on his years of remarkable service to our Nation \nand to our State's education system. We are grateful to him for his \nleadership and commitment to making the classroom a better place for \nour students. I am sure that his students and colleagues will always \nremember the impact he made on their lives and their \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2501-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2501-S2502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING RICHARD ``DICK'' ELIASON\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I honor the life and \nservice of Richard ``Dick'' Eliason. Dick passed away on April 3, 2011. \nHe will be remembered for his decades of service to Alaska and his \nsteadfast commitment to sensible, long-term management of Alaska's \nfisheries. Dick was the first Alaskan nominated to the 2006 Wild Salmon \nHall of Fame at the Pacific Northwest Salmon Center for his leadership \nprimarily in banning fin fish farming in Alaska and his work on the \n``Wild Stock Priority.''\n  Dick was born in Seattle, WA, on October 14, 1925. As an only child \nhe spent his childhood fishing between Washington and Port Alexander \nwith his parents, George and Elsie Eliason. The family decided to move \nto Sitka in 1939 where he attended Sitka High School. Following high \nschool, during World War II Dick spent 3 years aboard a sub chaser in \nthe Navy patrolling the Hawaiian Islands.\n  In 1950, Dick met Nurse Betty Gemmell from Montana and married her. \nTogether they had five children; Greta, George, Ida, Richard, Jr. and\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\nStanley. Betty passed away in 1981 and later Dick married Patricia \nMcConnell.\n  As a young man, Dick was very busy owning a succession of fishing \nboats, bartending at the American Legion, and working for many years as \na pipefitter. While the early years were tough raising his growing \nfamily, he certainly succeeded in raising a loving family. He continued \nto work as a commercial fisherman for nearly 70 years.\n  Dick entered public service early, serving on the territorial public \nutilities board. He entered the political arena in the early 1960s in \nSitka where he was elected to the assembly and went on to become mayor. \nAt the State level, Dick served as a member of the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives from 1968 to 1970 and 1972 to 1980 and as a member of \nthe Alaska Senate from 1980 to 1992. Dick also worked for his community \nas a member of the VFW, the Elks, the Moose and the Masons.\n  In his 22 years in the Alaska Legislature, he championed the \ninterests of fishermen and fishing communities. He fought for \nsustainable yield management of our fisheries and the hatchery system, \nand against fin fish farming and illegal high seas fishing.\n  Over the course of time, the fin fish farming ban has changed in the \nmind of Alaskans. The universally popular idea in Alaska was once much \nmore controversial. In 1988, salmon prices soared to levels not seen \nagain until lately giving corporations and other businesses an \nopportunity to compete in the emerging farmed salmon market.\n  Dick wisely saw that to protect the wild stocks and the people who \nearned a living off of them was more than a temporary issue. Dick \nrecognized the long lasting effects that his legislation could offer. \nHis legacy of protecting wild salmon and promoting quality salmon is \nnot bound to Alaska: his legacy is enjoyed by those even beyond the \nreaches of this Nation.\n  Dick would say that he merely worked to protect a way of life, but it \nwas his own way of life that typically allowed him to shine brighter \nthan others and to succeed. He was acutely aware of how to communicate \nand bargain among his colleagues. By all accounts, Dick was not likely \nto let his title or power go to his head, even though he had plenty of \nboth. He was the consummate statesman. He was fair and knew how to roll \nwith the punches in a way that only he could.\n  Dick leaves an esteemed legacy that Alaska will benefit from for \nyears to come. I extend my sympathies to the Eliason family and feel \nblessed to have known this great Alaskan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2501-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2501-S2502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING RICHARD ``DICK'' ELIASON\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI.

He fought for \nsustainable yield management of our fisheries and the hatchery system, \nand against fin fish farming and illegal high seas fishing.\n  Over the course of time, the fin fish farming ban has changed in the \nmind of Alaskans. The universally popular idea in Alaska was once much \nmore controversial. In 1988, salmon prices soared to levels not seen \nagain until lately giving corporations and other businesses an \nopportunity to compete in the emerging farmed salmon market.\n  Dick wisely saw that to protect the wild stocks and the people who \nearned a living off of them was more than a temporary issue. Dick \nrecognized the long lasting effects that his legislation could offer. \nHis legacy of protecting wild salmon and promoting quality salmon is \nnot bound to Alaska: his legacy is enjoyed by those even beyond the \nreaches of this Nation.\n  Dick would say that he merely worked to protect a way of life, but it \nwas his own way of life that typically allowed him to shine brighter \nthan others and to succeed. He was acutely aware of how to communicate \nand bargain among his colleagues. By all accounts, Dick was not likely \nto let his title or power go to his head, even though he had plenty of \nboth. He was the consummate statesman. He was fair and knew how to roll \nwith the punches in a way that only he could.\n  Dick leaves an esteemed legacy that Alaska will benefit from for \nyears to come. I extend my sympathies to the Eliason family and feel \nblessed to have known this great Alaskan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2502-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING JAMES MARTIN FITZGERALD\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. My home State of Alaska is a young State. \nBarely over 50 years old. I often marvel at the fact that so many of \nthose who led Alaska during territorial days and were instrumental in \nthe statehood movement also played important roles in poststatehood \nmodern Alaska. Very few of our 50 states can boast that its founders \nare still around to guide the current generation of leaders. Alaska has \nbeen deeply fortunate in this respect. And we've never taken the wisdom \nof these individuals for granted.\n  I speak today to honor the life of one of these individuals who \npassed away last week--Senior U.S. District Judge James Martin \nFitzgerald, a member of Alaska's Territorial Bar, one of the first \neight individuals selected to serve on the Alaska Superior Court, an \nassociate justice of the Alaska Supreme Court and a Federal judge since \n1974.\n  Judge Fitzgerald was born in Portland, OR, in 1920. He enrolled in \nthe University of Oregon and played football for the Ducks. But shortly \nthereafter he left college, when he was called to active duty in the \nNational Guard. Following discharge from the National Guard he resumed \nundergraduate study at Willamette University, once again playing on the \nfootball team.\n  But World War II interceded. On December 6, 1941, the Willamette team \nplayed an away game at the University of Hawaii. The next morning, the \nteam was waiting outside the Moana Loa Hotel for a bus to take them on \na sightseeing tour as bombs fell on Pearl Harbor.\n  The entire Willamette football team was conscripted to help defend \nthe Island of Oahu. After brief training they were armed with World War \nI era rifles and put on guard duty at a Honolulu High School. The team \nwent on sentry rotations to keep watch over nearby water towers and \nstorage tanks that were potential Japanese targets. They strung barbed \nwire along the Waikiki beach.\n  The football team remained in Honolulu for several weeks until their \ncoach convinced the captain of the SS President Coolidge to take the \nteam home in exchange for aiding the hundreds of critically wounded \nservicemen that were on board.\n  On Christmas Day 1941, the team arrived in San Francisco. Judge \nFitzgerald promptly enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He spent 5 years \nfighting for our country as a radio gunner for a torpedo squadron in \nthe South Pacific.\n  Honorably discharged once again in 1946, Fitzgerald returned to \nPortland. He married his wife Karin in 1950. Fitzgerald worked as a \nfirefighter and reenrolled at Willamette where he completed work toward \nhis B.A. and subsequently earned a law degree in 1951. The newly \nmarried couple spent their first summer in Ketchikan, Alaska where he \nworked in a lumber mill and a salmon cannery.\n  Upon graduation from law school, Judge Fitzgerald returned to \nKetchikan. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Ketchikan for 4 \nyears then relocated to Anchorage where he served as the city attorney.\n  Judge Fitzgerald was subsequently named counsel to Alaska's first \nGovernor, William Egan, and was appointed the first commissioner of the \nAlaska Department of Public Safety\n  In November 1959, Judge Fitzgerald was selected to be one of the \nfirst eight judges of the newly created Alaska Superior Court, which is \nour trial court. Prior to Alaska's admission to the statehood, the \nFederal Government maintained the judicial system for the territory. A \nnew court system for our new State had to be created from scratch. The \neight new judges were promptly dispatched to New Jersey to learn how a \nState trial court operates. Among his colleagues on that trip was Judge \nJames von der Heydt, who like Fitzgerald, would also one day serve on \nthe U.S. District Court.\n  Judge Fitzgerald was elevated to the Alaska Supreme Court in 1972 and \nserved there until 1974 when he was confirmed to serve on the federal \nbench.\n  Judge Fitzgerald was sworn in as a U.S. district judge on December \n20, 1974. He served as chief judge of the District of Alaska from 1984 \nuntil 1989 and became a senior district judge in 1989.\n  Judge James Fitzgerald passed away surrounded by his family on April \n3, 2011. He is survived by his wife Karin Fitzgerald and their four \nchildren. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I extend condolences to \nKarin, Judge Fitzgerald's family and his many friends in the Alaska Bar \nand the community as a whole.\n  James Fitzgerald's life was one of sacrifice and public service. He \nset aside his college education and an opportunity to play varsity \nfootball in order to serve his country in time of war. He was a \ndedicated attorney and jurist who brought peace to the territory of \nAlaska and then went on to help create Alaska's highly respected State \ncourt system before joining the Federal bench. He served my beloved \nState of Alaska for well over 50 years; and it is my hope that his life \nwill continue to serve as an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2502-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2502-S2503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WISCONSIN CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the Wisconsin Chapter of the American \nInstitute of Architects, AIA Wisconsin, was established in 1911 with a \ncommitment to creating better places to work and live through \narchitectural design and advocacy. This year, we celebrate the 100-year \nanniversary of Wisconsin's AIA Chapter. I would like to congratulate \nall past and present members of AIA Wisconsin for a century of service \nand their devotion to designing the buildings that are hallmarks of \nWisconsin's architectural landscape.\n  Over the years, AIA Wisconsin has developed into four active local \nchapters, each covering a quadrant of our State. With more than 1,300 \nmembers, AIA Wisconsin brings fellowship to\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\nWisconsin's architects while providing educational, public awareness \nand advocacy opportunities. Wisconsin architects are at the forefront \nof technology, keeping abreast of energy efficient solutions that they \nintegrate into their designs. These innovations help Wisconsin \ncommunities become more sustainable and livable, a goal we can all \nagree on.\n  Further, I am pleased to commend AIA Wisconsin for its community \ninvolvement. Wisconsin AIA provides educational opportunities through \norganized programs, public lectures, architectural competitions and \neducational summer camps in our state. I am confident that AIA \nWisconsin will continue to provide these opportunities and creative \ndesign solutions to create a green economy in Wisconsin.\n  On behalf of our State and Nation, I thank AIA Wisconsin for a \ncentury of work that has connected and improved Wisconsin's architects, \ncreating the landmarks we have come to recognize as part of our great \nState's heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2503-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN PODHORETZ\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nJohn Podhoretz, who next week will reach one of life's momentous, and \ntoo often dreaded, milestones: turning 50 years of age. John is today \nbest known for his work as editor of Commentary magazine and for his \nregular column in the New York Post, but these activities only scratch \nthe surface of his career. While, God willing, John has many more years \nahead of him and much left to do here, I believe this milestone is an \nopportune moment to reflect upon his many unique and influential \ncontributions to publishing, punditry, political thought, and pop \nculture.\n  Given his iconic lineage, it comes as no surprise to me that John has \naccomplished so much in his first five decades. He was born of two \nintellectual giants, Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter, and grew up on \nManhattan's Upper West Side. He studied at the University of Chicago, \ngraduated from there in 1981, and then settled in Washington, DC, to \nbegin his promising career.\n  He served as speechwriter to Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush \nand as special assistant to White House drug czar, William Bennett. An \naccomplished journalist and writer, John has contributed to the \nWashington Times, the New York Post, US News & World Report, and the \nAmerican Spectator. He is a refreshing critic of film and popular \nculture, and he once dabbled in entertainment as a consultant to the \npopular political fiction show ``The West Wing.'' He is even a five-\ntime champion of the hit trivia game show ``Jeopardy!''\n  John is what I would call an ``idea entrepreneur.'' He understands \nthat ideas have consequences and knows how to spread those ideas near \nand far. In 1995, together with Bill Kristol and Fred Barnes, John \ncofounded the Weekly Standard, a conservative opinion journal which he \nstill writes for today as a movie critic. Over the years, the Standard \nhas become more than just required reading for conservative thinkers--\nit is read by policy and opinion makers of all political stripes, and \nit has enormous reach inside the Beltway and well beyond. Thanks to \nJohn's contributions, the Standard has become, Well, a standard of \npolitical thought leadership.\n  John followed in his father's footsteps by becoming editor of \nCommentary magazine, a profoundly influential journal that seamlessly \ntackles the most pressing questions on political, social and cultural \nissues. In 2007, he launched the magazine's widely read and respected \nblog, Contentions, bringing Commentary into the new age of media. Just \nas he did with the Standard, John continues to prove at Commentary that \nideas are powerful.\n  John is unafraid to challenge conventional wisdom and he is an \nunabashed defender of the values that make our country great: freedom, \ndemocracy, human dignity, and economic opportunity. On top of all that, \nbased on watching and listening to him on that great day in August 2006 \nwhen his dear friend, Jacob Wisse, married my daughter, Becca \nLieberman, John Podhoretz is a surprisingly impressive dancer and \nsinger!\n  So, Mr. President, I congratulate John on 50 years well done. He has \nenormous personality, a great sense of humor, and a lovely family. I \nwish them happiness on this occasion. John, Happy Birthday!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2503-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2503-S2504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO AL HAWKES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I frequently come to the floor to \nspeak about a Maine small business that has done remarkable things in \nits community, or a business owner who has made a lasting impression on \nhis or her company's employees. Today, I wish to recognize a Maine \nentrepreneur who has an inspiring life story that many have never \nheard. It is with great pride that I introduce to you a very special \nMaine resident and lifelong musician, Mr. Allerton Hawkes, whose \namazing contributions to Maine's small business community and to the \nentire Nation's bluegrass legacy know no bounds.\n  Mr. Hawkes was born on Christmas Day, 1930, in the city of \nProvidence, RI. Soon thereafter, when Al was 10, his family returned to \nthe southern Maine city of Westbrook to live on an old family farm. As \na young teenager in the 1940s, Al began listening to bluegrass music by \ntuning in to remote Southern music radio stations, and he was \ndetermined to play several stringed instruments often associated with \nbluegrass. He soon became friend with a man named Alton Meyers, whom he \nmet scavenging through record bins at a used furniture store in \nPortland. Because of their shared love of music, they became the first \ninterracial duo to play bluegrass--presenting many live performances \nand radio shows until 1951, when both began their service in the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  This duo remains to this day, historically, our only interracial \nbluegrass duo. Although Mr. Meyers passed away in 2000, Al Hawkes--now \nin his 80s, continues to be involved in the bluegrass movement. \nFortunately for all of us, the bluegrass duo's recordings have been \npreserved forever by Bear Family Records which has provided the \nNation's audience with a compact disc recording containing 70 minutes \nand 27 tracks of this special part of our American musical heritage. \nFurthermore, Al has been joined by several friends in compiling a CD to \nbenefit research combating Parkinson's disease, which is forthcoming.\n  Al continues to live in Maine and has amassed a very valuable \ncollection of American bluegrass and country recordings. He has been \nrecognized by the International Bluegrass Music Museum as one of the \npioneers in bluegrass at a ceremony in Owensboro, KY. Al's historical \nlegacy is contained in a documentary entitled ``The Eventful Life of Al \nHawkes,'' which also recently aired six times on Maine's Public \nBroadcasting Network. His famous remark about his musical history--that \nhe believes there is a ``bluegrass gene'' which he inherited--seems to \nreflect in his additional musical accomplishments, playing with other \nbluegrass and country stars throughout the years and being the \nrecipient of 25 awards in the musical lexicon.\n  Beyond bluegrass, Al's deep-seated Maine legacy revolves around a \nhuge sign of a repairman which, to this day, is a famous landmark in \nsouthern Maine. As a small business entrepreneur who ran both a TV \nrepair and dry cleaning business in the noteworthy Hawkes Plaza, Al \nactually made and installed the famous icon sign of the 13-foot high \nrepairman who once sported 385 light bulbs, fluorescent lights and \nmoving parts which gave the illusion of a walking repairman. To \nresidents' delight, the sign--although no longer sporting the creative \nlights or moving parts--still remains a treasure which sustains \ngenerational memories, nearly 50 years after Al built it in 1962. \nIndeed, Maine's unique character has thus been supported by Al's \nwonderful inventiveness on several fronts throughout the years.\n  Al Hawkes is truly a Maine and national treasure whose inheritance of \nthat special ``bluegrass gene'' has provided us all with the rich and \nentertaining joy and privilege of listening to great, distinctive \nAmerican music. I am proud that Al has chosen to stay in Maine, and has \nled such a distinguished and varied career, from small business owner \nand entrepreneurs, to pioneering and accomplished musician. I wish Al \nall the best, and thank him for his outstanding contributions to our \nNation's cultural life.\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2504-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JOSE S. CHAVEZ\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, the State of New \nMexico lost a great man on March 17, 2011, when Jose S. Chavez passed \naway at the age of 93. He was a man who served our country proudly \nduring World War II and was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. I \nwould like to honor his memory today.\n  Mr. Chavez was a man of strength. He had a strong faith, a strong \nwill to survive, and was described as the strength and patriarch of his \nlarge and loving family.\n  As a member of the 200th Coastal Artillery and 515th Anti-Aircraft \nBattalion, Mr. Chavez served his country in the Phillipines during \nWorld War II. He was captured along with many other of his fellow \nsoldiers and forced to endure the horrors of the Bataan Death March and \nthe more than 3 years of captivity which followed.\n  Mr. Chavez is credited with saving many lives during the horrific \nmarch--picking up and carrying men to keep them from being killed. \nMistaken for dead and put in a grave three times during his captivity, \nMr. Chavez refused to give up. It was his strong faith in God, and also \nin those he served with, which helped him and others survive the \ninhumane conditions they faced.\n  After returning home he worked as a farmer before continuing his \nservice to his country by reenlisting in the military and later taking \na government job.\n  Mr. Chavez's strength extended beyond the battlefield to his home \nlife, where he was the pillar of his large family. He built the home \nthat he and his wife of 65 years, Susie, lived in and was known as the \nman who could fix anything and could always be found tinkering away at \na project.\n  His family will miss his strong-willed and loving personality, and \ncertainly feel the void left by Mr. Chavez's passing. Let us take a \nmoment today to remember Mr. Chavez and the remarkable strength he \nshared not only with his family, but with our country during his \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2504-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO EDGAR PEARA\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on April 14, the Government of \nFrance will present the National Order of the Legion of Honor to Edgar \nPeara one of Oregon's more modest heroes.\n  The Ordre national de la Legion d'honneur was established by Napoleon \nBonaparte in 1802 as a way of recognizing exceptional merit regardless \nof rank, class, or privilege. The Order remains the highest decoration \nin France and is being bestowed upon Edgar for his service in that \ncountry during World War II.\n  Already highly decorated by the United States for bravery and valor, \nEdgar's story is indeed remarkable and worthy of high praise. After the \nbombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Edgar immediately \nvolunteered for the military. At first he was told he would be more \nvaluable to the Nation if he returned to his engineer studies, but the \ncall to action was too strong. By June 1942 he received a commission in \nthe U.S. Army and was assigned as an officer in the 531 Amphibious \nCombat Regiment of the 1st Engineer Amphibious Combat Brigade.\n  His unit specialized in supporting large amphibious invasions, \nclearing the way for the infantry and keeping the Army on the move. By \nNovember 1942, Edgar's outfit landed in Arzew, Algeria, where Edgar, \ndetermined to keep the situation as calm as possible, went from house \nto house telling anxious Algerians unfamiliar with war or Americans \nthat ``we come in peace. We are not here to harm anyone. We simply want \nyou to surrender any weapons so that all armed resistance ceases.'' He \nsaid later that ``No one gave us any trouble and we collected so many \narms we could hardly carry them all.''\n  This action set the tone for Edgar's entire war experience and his \nlater life. As he prepared for the invasion of Italy, Edgar made a \nconscious effort to look for, and be grateful for, whatever there was \nto be appreciated that day, whether it was food, a dry place to sleep, \nreasonable weather, the friendships of comrades, and being well and \nsafe. As Edgar put it, ``That change in attitude helped make me a \nhappier person, for I stopped thinking that my contentment had to lie \nin the future when the war was over.''\n  After participating in the invasions of Sicily and mainland Italy, \nEdgar was moved to the southwest coast of England in order to help \nready allied forces for D-day. He landed at Utah Beach on the upper \nFrench coast on June 6, 1944. Early that morning he noticed a battalion \nmedical aid station was under intense fire. Recognizing the danger to \nthose helpless soldiers, he scrambled to find a more protected area. He \ncame across an abandoned German concrete underground command post. \nDodging bullets and shells, he ran back to help move the wounded to \nsafety.\n  Edgar would later be part of the invasion of Okinawa, Japan, making \nhim one of the few veterans to serve in Africa, Europe, and the \nPacific.\n  Taking what he learned from his experiences in war, Edgar dedicated \nhimself to a life of internal peace and became a staunch advocate of \ngreater peace for all humanity. He used his GI Bill to train for \nordination as a Christian Science practitioner. During the Korean war, \nEdgar served as a Christian Science chaplain at the U.S. Naval Training \nCenter, Great Lakes, IL. After this duty he went on to become a \nUnitarian Universalist minister. Edgar has worked diligently to help \nothers find the same peace he discovered in his own heart and to help \nall mankind achieve greater peace between neighbors and nations.\n  As an Oregonian, I could not be more proud of Edgar, his wonderful \nstory, and his life's work. He truly is a hero and embodies the best of \nour State. As our Nation continues to struggle in conflicts overseas, \nEdgar serves as a testament to the belief that sometime restraint is as \npowerful as force in times of war. I am very appreciative of Edgar's \nselfless service.The people of France are thanking him today with this \naward. Oregon thanks him for continuing to make us proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2504-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2504-4", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2504-5", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2504-S2505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:52 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1217.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ncount a period of receipt of outpatient observation services in a \nhospital toward satisfying the 3-day inpatient hospital requirement for \ncoverage of skilled nursing facility services under Medicare; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today too many Medicare beneficiaries are \nbeing saddled with thousands of dollars of unnecessary out-of-pocket \ncosts for stays at skilled nursing facilities, SNF, solely because of \nthe technical classification of their hospital stay.\n  Hospitals are increasingly serving Medicare beneficiaries using an \n``outpatient observation status'' rather than admitting them as an \ninpatient--a billing technicality. Because of this, patients are \nenduring longer hospital stays in observation status and may \nunknowingly be treated under outpatient observation status for the \nentirety of their hospital visit.\n  While the classification of a hospital stay does not affect either \nthe type or level of care a beneficiary receives, it has significant \nrepercussions on Medicare coverage of SNF care. Under current law, \nMedicare covers SNF care only if beneficiaries have 3 consecutive days \nof hospitalization as an inpatient, not counting the day of discharge.\n  Although the Medicare Program manuals limit observation status to 24 \nto 48 hours, many beneficiaries nationwide are experiencing extended \nstays in acute care hospitals under observation status. According to \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, MedPAC, the number of \nbeneficiaries receiving outpatient observation services for longer than \n48 hours rapidly increased, by more than 70 percent, from 2006 to 2008.\n  The growth in observation care has not only generated considerable \nbeneficiary confusion as to why Medicare does not cover their SNF care \nafter a hospitalization, but also it has also become a substantial \nfinancial barrier to medically necessary post-acute care. Beneficiaries \nare left facing thousands of dollars in unreimbursed out-of-pocket \ncharges for their care. Those who cannot afford to pay privately for \ntheir stay in a SNF may decide to forgo care altogether.\n  I have heard countless stories of hardship from Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Massachusetts because of this unfair policy. I would \nlike to share the inexcusable experience of one of my constituents, \nRosemary Crossin. Rosemary is 81 years old and suffers from Parkinson's \ndisease, arthritis, and diabetes. She was treated at a Boston hospital \nfollowing a fall that left her with a broken shoulder and a broken \nhand.\n  Upon arrival at the hospital, she was examined in the ER for over 6 \nhours, where she waited on a hard stretcher and received a CT scan, an \nx ray, and two doses of morphine. At the end of her examination, \nRosemary, disoriented and unable to walk on her own due to the \ncombination of her chronic conditions, morphine, and broken bones, was \ntreated in the hospital under observation status.\n  At no time did the hospital inform Rosemary's family what observation \nstatus meant. Rosemary remained in the hospital for over 4 days while \nshe recovered, after which time a physician determined that Rosemary be \ntransferred to an extended stay facility to complete her \nrehabilitation.\n  Despite spending over 4 days in the hospital, after the hospital \nitself determined she was not fit to return home, Rosemary was never \nadmitted as an inpatient. Because she was never classified as an \ninpatient for billing purposes, she was told that her costs would not \nbe covered by Medicare. Rosemary was told that she would have to prepay \n$7998 to the skilled nursing facility or remain at the hospital at a \ncost of $1200 per day. This is wrong, and it needs to be changed.\n  Currently, Rosemary continues to rehabilitate her injuries at the \nskilled nursing facility. Unfortunately, because she was in observation \nstatus for her entire hospital stay, all subsequent costs will need to \nbe paid for out-of-pocket.\n  Rosemary could have to spend up to $18,000 out-of-pocket following \nher fall, all because the hospital kept her under observation status \nfor more than 96 hours after it determined she was not fit to go home.\n  Unfortunately, Rosemary's experience is not unique. That is why \nSenator Snowe and I are working together to prevent billing \ntechnicalities from hampering access to skilled nursing care. Today, we \nare introducing the Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act of 2011, \nwhich would eliminate financial barriers to skilled nursing care in \nMedicare by allowing observation stays to be counted toward the 3-day \nmandatory inpatient stay for Medicare coverage of SNF services.\n  This legislation is supported by a number of national organizations \nfrom both the provider and beneficiary communities. I would like to \nthank a number of organizations that have been integral to the \ndevelopment of the Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act of 2011 \nand that have endorsed our legislation today, including the AARP, the \nAmerican Health Care Association, the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Medical Directors Association, the Center for Medicare \nAdvocacy, LeadingAge, and the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  The Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act will ensure that \nvulnerable patients like Rosemary will no longer have to suffer or \nworry about affording medically needed care because of a hospital \nbilling classification issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our legislation to eliminate \nunnecessary barriers to skilled nursing care and to bring peace of mind \nto patients and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 820. A bill to repeal the current Internal Revenue Code and \nreplace it with a flat tax, thereby guaranteeing economic growth and \ngreater fairness for all Americans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce my \nflat tax bill, the Smart, Manageable and Responsible Tax Act, referred \nto as the SMART Act.\n  In the United States, there are few, if any, days that are viewed \nwith the same resentment and contempt year after year as April 15: \nnational tax day.\n  Our current Tax Code totals more than 70,000 pages, making tax \ncompliance unnecessarily complex, confusing and costly. During the past \n10 years, there have been over 4,400 changes to the Tax Code, including \nan estimated 579 changes in 2010 alone.\n  The inclusion of the additional 1099 tax reporting requirements in \nthe health care reform bill are just one example of the onerous \nrequirements throughout our Tax Code.\n  As we have learned since the passage of these requirements last \nMarch, incremental improvements to the Tax\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\nCode are not easy. It took Congress over a year to finally agree to \nrepeal the 1099 changes that common sense tells us are essential to \nalleviating the burdens on small business. Yet our Tax Code is riddled \nwith other similarly ill-conceived requirements.\n  Over the course of a year, individuals spend an average of 26 hours, \nover half of a work week, preparing for their tax filings.\n  Although this has been standard practice for decades, I do not \nbelieve average taxpayers should have to pore over IRS regulations for \nhours or pay someone to prepare their returns. Unfortunately, under our \nconvoluted tax system they are left with little choice.\n  I have said a number of times before that our current tax system is \nunfair. It punishes success and stifles economic growth. The best \nremedy is to adopt a single tax rate for all taxpayers. Transitioning \nto a flat tax would not only increase fairness in the Tax Code, it \nwould also increase the incentives to work and invest.\n  By eliminating the thousands of tax loopholes, deductions, and \ncredits that can often only be utilized with extensive tax planning and \nexpensive advisers, hardworking Americans can rest assured that \ncorporations with billions of dollars in profit and sophisticated \ntaxpayers are not able to unfairly reduce or eliminate their tax \nliabilities and leave middle-class Americans footing the bill.\n  The SMART Act also reforms our corporate Tax Code. The United States \ncurrently has the second highest corporate tax rate in the world. \nAmerican companies routinely make the difficult decision to move \noperations overseas to reduce their tax burden. Under my legislation, \ncompanies would pay a flat tax rate of 17 percent on their profits. \nCutting the corporate tax rate in half would increase domestic \ncompanies' competitiveness with foreign corporations and eliminate the \nincentives to shift jobs overseas.\n  This bill provides a simple, commonsense solution to the complexities \nand inequities of the current tax system. Taxpayers would be able to \ndetermine their tax liability quickly and easily, and file a tax return \nthe size of a postcard.\n  The SMART Tax would repeal the current Internal Tax Code and replace \nit with a single tax rate for all taxpayers of 17 percent on all \nsalaries, wages, and pensions. The only exemptions would be a personal \nexemption of $13,410 for a single person; $17,120 for a head of \nhousehold; $26,810 for a married couple filing jointly; and $5,780 for \neach dependent, with these amounts indexed to inflation.\n  Additionally, under my legislation, earnings from savings and \ninvestments would not be included in taxable income. Eliminating this \ndouble taxation would increase the savings rate in our country and \nimmediately spur investments in the economy, create jobs and boost \neconomic growth.\n  Approximately 60 percent of individual taxpayers now pay preparers to \ncomplete their taxes for them. An additional 29 percent of individuals \nuse tax software to assist with their filings. What this means for most \npeople is that in addition to paying the government every year, they \nmust pay someone or buy software to tell them exactly how much to pay \ntheir government.\n  The American people want and need fundamental tax reform that would \nsave time and money and bring fairness to our tax structure. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would implement much-needed reforms \nthat eliminate onerous paperwork and promote economic growth in our \ncountry.\n  I recognize that this bill is a monumental shift away from our \ncurrent tax laws, but our economy needs a boost, and we must not allow \nthe enormity of the task to deter us from enacting better, more \nefficient tax laws. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Coons, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Franken, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Merkley, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Inouye, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 821. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \neliminate discrimination in the immigration laws by permitting \npermanent partners of United States citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the same manner \nas spouses of citizens and lawful permanent residents and to penalize \nimmigration fraud in connection with permanent partnerships; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing the Uniting \nAmerican Families Act, UAFA, which grants same-sex binational couples \nthe same immigration benefits heterosexual couples have long enjoyed. \nThis is the fourth Congress in which I have introduced this \nlegislation, and I am proud to be joined by 17 Senators, many of whom \nalso cosponsored this bill when it was introduced in the last Congress. \nI want to thank Senators Akaka, Blumenthal, Boxer, Cardin, Casey, \nCoons, Durbin, Franken, Gillibrand, Harkin, Kerry, Lautenberg, Merkley, \nMurray, Schumer, Whitehouse, and Wyden for joining me as original \ncosponsors today.\n  A core tenet of our immigration policy is preserving family unity. \nYet gay and lesbian Americans are still forced to choose between their \ncountry and being with those they love. This destructive policy tears \nfamilies apart and forces hardworking Americans to make the heart-\nwrenching choice to leave the country they love and start over in one \nof the countries that now recognize immigration benefits for same-sex \ncouples. I hear from Vermont couples who face this difficult decision \nevery year. No American should face such a choice.\n  Over the past decade, Americans have begun to reject the notion that \nU.S. citizens who are gay or lesbian should not have loving \nrelationships. As a result of this cultural shift, 5 States, including \nVermont, now allow same-sex couples to get married. At the end of the \n111th Congress, bipartisan votes in both the Senate and the House \nreversed the Military's ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy, a 17 year old \npolicy that barred gay and lesbian service men and women from openly \nserving in the military. I hope that my colleagues who supported this \nimportant civil rights reform will join me in calling for fairness and \nequality in our immigration laws.\n  Some opponents of the Uniting American Families Act have argued that \nit would increase the potential for visa fraud. I share the belief that \nall immigration applications should be screened for fraud, but I am \nconfident that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will have no \nmore difficulty identifying fraud in same-sex relationships than they \ndo in heterosexual marriages. The penalties for fraud under this bill \nwould be the same as the penalties for marriage fraud. These are very \nstrict penalties: a sentence of up to 5 years in prison, $250,000 in \nfines for the U.S. citizen partner, and deportation for the foreign \npartner. In addition, in order to qualify as a bi-national couple under \nUAFA, petitioners must prove that they are at least 18 years of age and \nin a committed, lifelong, financially interdependent relationship with \nanother adult. The American ideals that respect human relationships and \nfamily bonds should not be impeded by fears of fraud, which the \nimmigration agency is very capable of controlling.\n  Since I last introduced the Uniting American Families Act in 2009, \nmore than six additional countries have begun to offer immigration \nbenefits to same-sex couples, bringing the total to at least 25 \nnations. Some of these nations are our closest allies, including our \ngood friends to the North. America should join Argentina, Australia, \nBelgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, \nGermany, Greenland, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, The \nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, \nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n  Unfortunately, among developed countries with a culture of respect \nfor human rights and fairness, the United States is falling behind by \ndenying Americans an equitable immigration policy. I hope all Senators \nwill agree that the United States should not have a policy that forces \nAmericans to choose between their jobs and country, and their loved \nones. I urge all Senators to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 821\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend and modify the research tax credit, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my first bill in \nthe Senate, one I believe will promote competitiveness and spur the \ngrowth of sustainable middle class jobs. As I noted in my maiden speech \nin January, the people of Delaware sent me here with a mission to work \nwith my colleagues to help create jobs and get our economy moving \nagain.\n  My bill, the Job Creation Through Innovation Act, will do just that. \nBy making strategic investments in research and development and \nincentives for economic growth, this legislation will help companies in \nDelaware and across the United States innovate, create jobs, and \ncompete globally.\n  First, it will simplify, expand, and make permanent the Research and \nDevelopment Tax Credit. When this credit was enacted into law in 1981, \nthe United States was the best place in the world to perform research \nand development. Thirty years and fourteen temporary extensions later, \nwe still do not have a permanent R credit on the books. Passing \ntemporary extensions, one after another, undermines the very purpose of \nthis credit. Whenever there is uncertainty about the credit's future \navailability, businesses discount its value, and we reap only the \ncounterproductive effect of reducing the credit's benefit to our \neconomy. Research and development projects are never stop-and-go, and \nthe R tax credit shouldn't be either.\n  Second, many new small businesses today are ineligible for the R \ncredit, because they are not yet profitable. My bill will create a new \nSmall Business Innovation Credit, which will provide much-needed \nsupport to these start-ups. Currently, the R credit is non-\nrefundable, so only those companies with income tax liability benefit \nfrom it. This poses a special problem for research-intensive start-up \nbusinesses--just the sort of businesses that have the potential to \ndevelop revolutionary technologies and products. Such firms often spend \ntheir first several years operating at a loss while spending a great \ndeal of money on research and development. The Small Business \nInnovation Credit will address this by allowing companies with 500 \nemployees or fewer to claim a refundable R credit.\n  Another provision of my bill is a new Domestic Manufacturing Tax \nCredit, which will provide additional tax incentives to companies that \nboth conduct research and manufacture their products right here in \nAmerica. This will reward companies that invest in America and give \nmultinational firms another reason to keep manufacturing jobs from \nbeing shipped overseas.\n  The Job Creation Through Innovation Act would additionally extend the \nSection 1603 Treasury Grants Program--or ``TGP''--and the Advanced \nEnergy Manufacturing Credit. Both of these were authorized in the \nRecovery Act and are designed to promote clean energy technology and \ninvestment. Both have also had a significant and beneficial impact on \nenergy project developers and manufacturers in my home state of \nDelaware and other states in the past 2 years.\n  The TGP provides payments for specified energy property in lieu of \ninvestment tax credits and production tax credits. Economic certainty \nis critical to wind, solar, biofuel, geothermal, and other clean energy \nprojects, and, according to a survey of leading participants in the tax \nequity market, without an extension of the TGP the anticipated total \nfinancing available for renewable resource projects would decrease \nsignificantly, should it be left to expire at the end of 2011. My bill \nextends the TGP for another year.\n  The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Credit, also called the 48C \nIncentive, provides a thirty percent investment tax credit to domestic \nmanufacturers who build or expand facilities that produce a range of \nclean energy products and technologies. These credits can also be used \nto leverage private investment, and it is estimated that this tax \ncredit has to date helped businesses raise more than $5.4 billion from \njust a $2.3 billion Federal investment. It is also estimated to have \ncreated 58,000 jobs. My bill will provide an additional $5 billion in \nincentives, of which up to $1.5 billion would be made available to \ncompanies whose applications are already pending under the original \nsolicitation.\n  In my maiden speech in January, I spoke at length about the new \nagenda for manufacturing I intend to promote during my service in the \nSenate, and this bill is just the first step. I am proud that Delaware \nis already on the cutting-edge of the high-tech and clean energy \nmanufacturing revolution I believe will be the key to winning the \nfuture.\n  While we are all rightly focused now on the deficit and cutting our \nbudget, we must also think ahead and make those long-term investments \nthat will boost our economy, incentivize clean energy resources and \nmanufacturing, and grow the jobs we need to sustain a strong middle \nclass in this country for years to come. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in this effort, and I commend those who already have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 825\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish \na program to provide loans and loan guarantees to enable eligible \npublic entities to acquire interests in real property that are in \ncompliance with habitat conversation plans approved by the Secretary of \nthe Interior under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nInfrastructure Facilitation and Habitat Conservation Act of 2011.\n  This legislation will make it easier for communities to build \ninfrastructure and grow by allowing to access federal loan guarantees \nwhen they conserve land to mitigate the impacts to the environment and \nendangered species.\n  This bill creates a ten year pilot program, to be administered \njointly by the Secretaries of the Interior and Treasury, making credit \nmore readily available to eligible public entities which are sponsors \nof Habitat Conservation Plans, HCPs, under section 10 of the Endangered \nSpecies Act of 1973.\n  Habitat Conservation Plans were authorized by an amendment to the \nEndangered Species Act in 1982 as a means to permanently protect the \nhabitat of threatened and endangered species, while facilitating the \ndevelopment of infrastructure, through issuance of a long-term \n``incidental take permit''. More than 500 such plans have been approved \nby the Secretary of the Interior, providing protection for nearly 50 \nmillion acres of habitat nationwide and allowing development and \ninfrastructure to proceed.\n  Equally important, HCPs are very effective in avoiding, minimizing \nand mitigating the effects of development on endangered species and \ntheir habitats. HCPs are an essential tool, as Congress intended, in \nbalancing the requirements of the Endangered Species Act with on-going \ninfrastructure construction and development activity.\n  In California, the Western Riverside County Multiple-Species HCP is a \nprime example of effective habitat management. The Western Riverside \nMSHCP covers an area of 1.26 million acres, of which 500,000 will be \npermanently protected for the benefit of 146 species of plants and \nanimals. At the same time, it is building its infrastructure and \ntransportation needs for the next century.\n  To date, more than 40,000 acres of property have been conserved. In \nthe case of the Western Riverside MSHCP, as with other HCPs nationwide, \nthis strategy for advance mitigation of environmental impacts has \nfacilitated the development of much-needed transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Riverside has been one of the Nation's fastest growing counties, with \na rate of growth during the last decade of 42 percent. Unless the \ndevelopment of infrastructure can be made to keep pace with this \nexplosive population growth, neither environmental or livability goals \nwill be attained.\n  Owing to the economic downturn, however, the pace of habitat \nacquisition in Western Riverside and other similarly-situated \ncommunities has slowed to a crawl. Revenue which had been generated to \nfinance acquisition of habitat during periods of robust development has \nalso slowed to a trickle, at just the moment when real estate values \nare at historic lows.\n  Ready access to capital during this period would enable Western \nRiverside to complete its habitat acquisition program for half of what \nit was estimated to cost in 2008, for a savings of $2 billion.\n  Under this bill, loan guarantee applicants would have to demonstrate \ntheir credit-worthiness and the likely success of their habitat \nacquisition programs. Priority would be given to HCPs in biologically \nrich regions whose natural attributes are threatened by rapid \ndevelopment. Other than the modest costs of administration, the bill \nwould entail no federal expenditure unless the local government \ndefaulted a very rare occurrence.\n  The Federal guarantees will assure access to commercial credit at \nreduced rates of interest, enabling these communities to take advantage \nof temporarily low prices for habitat. Prompt enactment of this \nlegislation will provide multiple benefits at very low cost to the \nFederal taxpayer protection of more habitat more quickly, accelerated \ndevelopment of infrastructure with minimum environmental impact, and \nreduction in the total cost of HCP land acquisition.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I believe it will \nencourage development and growth and conservation of land and \nprotection of endangered species, at minimal Federal risk. It is \nexactly the Federal local partnership that we need to use to maximize \nefficient use of Federal dollars.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 826\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nestablish the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy as the \nlead Federal agency for coordinating Federal, State, and local \nassistance provided to promote the energy retrofitting of schools; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing a \nbipartisan bill along with my colleague Senator Collins to help improve \nthe health and efficiency of our schools by making them more energy \nefficient, while creating much-needed jobs in the process. Though it is \noften over-looked, energy efficiency is a huge job creator. Not only \ndoes it create jobs through the purchase and installation of efficient \nmaterials, it frees up scarce school finances to retain teachers and \nimportant programs.\n  There are numerous Federal programs and funds already available to \nschools to help them become more energy efficient. However, as I \nlearned in my travels across Colorado, schools face a morass of \nprograms and agency offices across the government, and it is \nchallenging for schools to take full advantage of them.\n  The bipartisan Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2011 \nwill force the government to coordinate their efforts so that schools \nare less confused and they can better navigate the existing Federal \nprograms and financing options available to them. Put simply, it will \nstreamline the Federal Government while still leaving decisions to the \nStates, school boards and local officials to determine what is best for \ntheir schools.\n  I have seen the benefits of energy efficient buildings first hand \nwhen traveling in Colorado. The Cherry Creek School District in \nGreenwood Village, Colorado has incorporated day lighting techniques \nand ice storage to cool the buildings during the day. Because of these \ninnovative improvements, the school district has enjoyed significant \ncost savings. In another example, the Poudre School District in Fort \nCollins, Colorado, actively promotes sustainable design guidelines, \ncalling it their ``Ethic of Sustainability.'' This program includes an \nelementary school in Fort Collins that actually uses recycled blue \njeans as insulation for the school buildings.\n  I hope that in passing this bill we will see more examples of these \nsuccessful and creative projects across the country--projects that will \nincrease the efficiency of our schools and teach our students about the \nimportance of saving energy. I urge my colleagues--of both parties--to \njoin me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 828\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nprovide for country of origin labeling for dairy products; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing the Dairy \nCountry Of Origin Labeling Act, or Dairy COOL, with Senator Schumer, \nSenator Gillibrand, Senator Sherrod Brown, and Senator Sanders.\n  Our bill is very straightforward; it simply extends country of origin \nlabeling requirements to dairy products. The current country of origin \nlabeling law, which went into effect in 2008, applies to meats, \nproduce, and nuts, but it doesn't include dairy products. Our bill adds \ndairy products--including milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and butter--\nto the list.\n  This bill is about families. Minnesota families should have the right \nto know where the food they buy was produced. Consumers have this \ninformation for meat and produce; they should have it for the dairy \nproducts they feed their families every day. Minnesota dairy farmers \nand family farmers across the Nation should have the right to \ndistinguish their products from imported products.\n  Hardly a week goes by where you don't hear another story of \ncontaminated food and toys that were imported from foreign countries \nbut only discovered after they were in American homes. Labeling our \ndairy products lets parents make informed choices at the grocery store. \nIt gives consumers the information they need to be confident about the \nquality and safety of the food they buy.\n  Farming is a risky business. Prices have stabilized for now, but less \nthan two years ago, high feed prices and unpredictable price swings \nthreatened the viability of family dairies across the country. This \nbill isn't a silver bullet, but it does give family farms another tool \nthat will help them compete in a crowded marketplace.

A bill to reauthorize certain port security programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the SAFE Port \nReauthorization Act of 2011. This bill extends important programs that \nhelp to protect our nation's critical shipping lanes and seaports from \nattack and sabotage.\n  The SAFE Port Reauthorization Act of 2011 is cosponsored by my \ncolleague,\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nSenator Murray. Senator Murray and I drafted the original SAFE Port Act \nin 2005, leading to its enactment in 2006. I am pleased that she has \nagain joined me to extend and strengthen this important law. Several \nstakeholders have expressed their support for our efforts, including \nthe American Waterways Operators, National Association of Boating Law \nAdministrators, Retail Industry Leaders Association, Association of \nMarina Industries, National Boating Federation, and National Marine \nManufacturers Association.\n  The scope of what we need to protect is broad. America has 361 \nseaports--each vital links in our Nation's transportation network. Our \nseaports move more than 95 percent of overseas trade. In 2010, United \nStates ports logged 57,600 ports-of-call by foreign-flagged cargo \nvessels, bringing 11 million shipping containers to our shores.\n  Coming from a State with three international cargo ports--including \nPortland, the largest port by tonnage in New England--I am keenly aware \nof the importance of seaports to our national economy and to the \ncommunities in which they are located.\n  Our seaports operate as vital centers of economic activity; they also \nrepresent vulnerable targets. As the air cargo plot emanating from \nYemen last fall demonstrated, terrorists remain committed to exploiting \ncommercial shipments as a way of moving explosives or weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Maritime shipping containers are a special source of concern. A \nsingle obscure container, hidden among a ship's cargo of several \nhundred containers, could be used to conceal a dirty bomb. In other \nwords, a container could be turned into a 21st century Trojan horse.\n  The shipping container's security vulnerabilities are so well known \nthat it has also been called ``the poor man's missile,'' because for \nonly a few thousand dollars, a terrorist could ship a weapon or \nexplosive across the Atlantic or the Pacific to a U.S. port.\n  And the contents of such a container don't have to be something as \ncomplex as a nuclear or biological weapon. As former Customs and Border \nProtection Commissioner Robert Bonner told The New York Times, a single \ncontainer packed with readily available ammonium sulfate fertilizer and \na detonation system could produce 10 times the blast that destroyed the \nMurrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.\n  Whatever the type of weapon, an attack on one or more U.S. ports \ncould cause great loss of life and large numbers of injuries; it could \ndamage our energy supplies and infrastructure; it could cripple \nretailers and manufacturers dependent on incoming inventory; and it \ncould hamper our ability to move and supply American military forces \nfighting against the forces of terrorism.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit seaports and, as one examines \nsome of the Nation's busiest harbors, one sees what a terrorist might \ncall ``high-value targets.'' In February, while touring the Port of \nMiami and Port Everglades with the Coast Guard, I witnessed firsthand \nthe large and sprawling urban populations, cruise ship docks, container \nterminals, and bulk fuel facilities that are situated around these \nports. At other locations, there are large sports stadiums and ferries \noperating nearby as well.\n  Add up these factors, and one realizes immediately the death and \ndestruction that a ship carrying a container hiding a weapon of mass \ndestruction could inflict at a single port.\n  Of course, a port can be a conduit for an attack as well as a target. \nA container with dangerous cargo could be loaded on a truck or rail \ncar, or have its contents unpacked at the port and distributed to \nsupport attacks elsewhere. In 2008, we saw that the port in Mumbai, \nIndia, offered the means for a gang of terrorists to launch an attack \non a section of the city's downtown. That attack killed more than 170 \npeople and wounded hundreds more.\n  To address these security threats, our bill would reauthorize these \nSAFE Port Act cargo security programs that have proven to be successful \nthe Automated Targeting System that identifies high-risk cargo; the \nContainer Security Initiative that ensures high-risk cargo containers \nare inspected at ports overseas before they travel to the United \nStates; and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, or C-TPAT, \nthat provides incentives to importers to enhance the security of their \ncargo from point of origin to destination.\n  The bill would also strengthen the C-TPAT program by providing new \nbenefits, including offering voluntary security training to industry \nparticipants and providing participants an information sharing \nmechanism on maritime and port security threats, and authorizing \nCustoms and Border Protection to conduct unannounced inspections to \nensure that security practices are robust. The cooperation of private \nindustry is vital to protecting supply chains, and C-TPAT is a \nnecessary tool for securing their active cooperation in supply chain \nsecurity efforts.\n  The bill also would extend the competitive, risk-based, port security \ngrants that have improved the security of our ports. An authorization \nfor the next 5 years at $300 million per year, as included in the \nPresident's budget, is lower than the current $400 million \nauthorization in recognition of the severe budget constraints we face. \nTo address concerns expressed by port authorities and terminal \noperators from across the country, the bill places deadlines on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to ensure a timely response is provided \nto port security grant applications, extensions, and cost-share waiver \nrequests.\n  In addition to continuing and improving critical port security \nprograms, the bill also would strengthen the America's Waterway Watch \nProgram, which promotes voluntary reporting of suspected terrorist \nactivity or suspicious behavior against a vessel, facility, port, or \nwaterway.\n  Our bill would protect citizens from frivolous lawsuits when they \nreport, in good faith, suspicious behavior that may indicate terrorist \nactivity against the United States. It builds on a provision from the \n2007 homeland security law that encourages people to report potential \nterrorist threats directed against transportation systems by protecting \npeople from those who would misuse our legal system in an attempt to \nchill the willingness of citizens to come forward and report possible \ndangers.\n  In addition, this legislation enhances research and development \nefforts to improve maritime cargo security. The demonstration project \nauthorized by this law would study the feasibility of using composite \nmaterials in cargo containers to improve container integrity and deploy \nnext-generation sensors.\n  This legislation also addresses the difficulties in administering the \nmandate of x-raying and scanning for radiation all cargo containers \noverseas that are destined for the United States by July 2012. Until x-\nray scanning technology is proven effective at detecting radiological \nmaterial and not disruptive of trade, requiring the x-raying of all \nU.S. bound cargo, regardless of its risk, at every foreign port, is \nmisguided and provides a false sense of security. It would also impose \nonerous restrictions on the flow of commerce, costing billions with \nlittle additional security benefit.\n  Under the original provisions of the SAFE Port Act, all cargo \ndesignated as high-risk at foreign ports is already scanned for \nradiation and x-rayed. In addition, cargo entering the U.S. at all \nmajor seaports is scanned for radiation. These security measures \ncurrently in place are part of a layered, risk-based method to ensure \ncargo entering the U.S. is safe.\n  This legislation would eliminate the deadline for 100 percent x-\nraying of containers if the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies \nthe effectiveness of individual security measures of that layered \nsecurity approach. This is a more reasonable method to secure our cargo \nuntil a new method of x-raying containers is proven effective and \nfeasible.\n  The SAFE Port Reauthorization Act of 2011 will help us to continue an \neffective, layered, coordinated security system that extends from point \nof origin to point of destination, and that covers the people, the \nvessels, the cargo, and the facilities involved in our maritime \ncommerce. It will continue to address a major vulnerability in our \nhomeland security critical infrastructure while preserving the flow of \ngoods on which our economy depends.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. \n        Franken, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 833. A bill to provide grants to States to ensure that all \nstudents in the middle grades are taught an academically rigorous \ncurriculum with effective supports so that students complete the middle \ngrades prepared for success in secondary school and postsecondary \nendeavors, to improve State and district policies and programs relating \nto the academic achievement of students in the middle grades, to \ndevelop and implement effective middle grades models for struggling \nstudents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is my honor today to introduce the \nSuccess in the Middle Act of 2011. This bill recognizes the role of the \nmiddle grades as a tipping point in the education of many of our \nNation's students, especially those who are at risk of dropping out. \nSuccess in the Middle invests much-needed attention and resources in \nmiddle grades education, requiring states to create plans to \nspecifically address the unique needs of students in the age group, and \nfocusing on schools that feed students into some of our country's most \ndropout prone high schools so they are ready for the curriculum and the \nunique social pressures they will encounter there.\n  My concern about the middle grades began in a unique place behind my \ndesk in the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office. After serving as \nthe United States Attorney for Rhode Island, where I dealt with cases \ninvolving mobsters and white collar crime, I now suddenly had hundreds \nof juvenile cases coming across my desk. I asked my staff to examine \nthe problem and together we tried to find the root of it. Ultimately, \nit all seemed to go back to one issue: middle school truancy. In order \nto better see what was happening in middle schools, my office adopted \none, Oliver Hazard Perry Middle School in Providence. We worked hard to \ncreate a real relationship between the police department and the school \nto help get truant kids back in classrooms; we worked with the local \nutility to get lights in the parking lot so teachers felt safe staying \nafter school; partnered with local businesses to get teachers phones in \nthe classrooms so they could call parents when the kids went missing; \nbegan a mentoring program between students and attorneys in my office; \nand brought in community groups to start afterschool programs.\n  The experience at Perry helped me realize what an impact the middle \ngrades have on a child's future. It is an age where a child is \nbeginning to make his or her own decisions, but can still be influenced \nby adults and by enriching experiences in their lives. The middle \ngrades are a time when, if properly directed, students look to their \nfutures and set goals for themselves in order to enter high school \nready to achieve that first vital goal: graduation.\n  When I entered the Senate, one of my first priorities was to continue \nto advocate for improved middle grades education. In Rhode Island, I \nconvened a small group of teachers, public and private school \nadministrators, union leaders, afterschool experts, and others who \nshared my deep interest in the middle grades to continue the \nconversation about how best to improve them. This group examined the \nissues faced by these students and how curriculum, the professional \ndevelopment of teachers, and the environment of the school affected \nthem on a daily basis. Their work has influenced how I perceive \neducation policy and has been invaluable as we have moved forward with \nSuccess in the Middle.\n  To see just how badly our middle grade students need this help, let \nus take a look at the facts: Less than 1/3 of 8th grade students scored \nproficient in reading and math on the 2009 National Assessment on \nEducational Progress, NAEP, and nearly 30 percent scored below the \nbasic level in math. A lack of basic skills at the end of the middle \ngrades has serious implications students who enter high school two or \nmore years behind have only a 50 percent chance of progressing on time \nto 10th grade, creating a significant risk of dropping out. Sixth grade \nstudents who do not attend school regularly, who frequently receive \ndisciplinary actions, or who fail math or English have a less than 15 \npercent chance of graduating high school on time and a 20 percent \nchance of graduating one year late.\n  This is why investing wisely in the middle grades is so important. \nSuccess in the Middle makes that investment, creating a formula grant \nprogram that help states invest in proven strategies for the middle \ngrades, including comprehensive school-wide improvement efforts, \ntargeted professional development, and student supports such as \nextended learning time and personal academic plans. It also requires \nthe creation of early warning and intervention systems for at-risk \nstudents and transition plans for the middle grades. Finally, Success \nin the Middle invests in national research into best practices for the \nmiddle grades.\n  I am proud to introduce Success in the Middle, which in previous \nCongresses was introduced by then-Senator Obama and by my senior \nSenator from Rhode Island, Jack Reed. I am proud to follow in the \nfootsteps of these champions of education, who have demonstrated the \nvital need to focus our efforts on the middle grades in order to best \nserve our Nation's children, especially those most at risk for dropping \nout.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 839. A bill to ban the sale of certain synthetic drugs; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Klobuchar, in cosponsoring the Combating Designer Drugs Act of \n2011. All too often we are confronted with new and emerging drugs that \nspread quickly on the scene. However, what is most concerning about \nthis new generation of drugs is how quickly these substances are sold \nand marketed to kids. Although these substances were created for \nscientific research they are now packaged as innocent products and sold \non the shelves of local stores or via the internet.\n  Recent reports in the media along with increasing calls to poison \ncontrol centers and visits to emergency rooms reveals that more and \nmore kids are using products laced with substances that are very \ndangerous. Although these products are currently legal and can be sold \nin stores and online, many people who use products are under a false \nimpression that these products are safe because they are legal. \nHowever, use of these products is anything but safe.\n  Last month, a teenager from Blaine, MN, died after overdosing on a \nsubstance called 2C-E that he and others used at a party. Police report \n10 other individuals were hospitalized after using this substance. \nAccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration, 2C-E along with its \ncousins in the 2C family are used for their hallucinogenic qualities. \nThese drugs are marketed as similar to illegal drugs like LSD or \nEcstasy and can be used in similar ways. A popular way to pass these \ndrugs off as safe is by labeling them as ``fake,'' but clearly the \nvictims of this drug have suffered very real consequences.\n  Last month, I, along with Senator Feinstein, introduced legislation \nto ban the chemicals found in synthetic or ``fake'' marijuana. This \nlegislation came in part from the death of Indianola, IA, resident \nDavid Rozga, who committed suicide shortly after smoking a package of \nK2, a product laced with synthetic marijuana compounds. Since then the \nDrug Enforcement Administration has identified more substances that are \nused in a similar way such as 2C-E and others. The Combating Designer \nDrugs Act of 2011 is part of the ongoing effort to identify drugs that \nare being marketed as legal, safe alternatives to illegal drugs and \nplaces them among their rightful place as dangerous drugs like meth and \ncocaine. Specifically, this legislation targets drugs found in the 2C \nfamily, which were invented for scientific research but never intended \nto be used for humans and makes them schedule I controlled substances.\n  Mr. President, the sale and use of synthetic drugs like those in the \n2C family represent a new and dangerous trend in drug abuse. We must \ntake strong action to eliminate the ease in which these substances can \nreach the market before their use gets out of hand. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation to remove these dangerous drugs \nfrom our society.\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n        Merkley):\n  S. 841. A bill to provide cost-sharing assistance to improve access \nto the markets of foreign countries for energy efficiency products and \nrenewable energy products exported by small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nRenewable Energy Market Access Program Act, or REMAP Act, which I am \nre-introducing in the 112th Congress with my colleagues, Senators \nStabenow and Merkley. This bill is designed to help grow American \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency exports abroad by helping small \nand medium sized renewable energy businesses promote, export and \nultimately penetrate foreign markets. In turn this bill will help grow \nthe American economy and create American jobs.\n  This effort is a smaller piece of what needs to be a comprehensive \nand cohesive approach to reduce our trade deficit in clean energy goods \nand bolster our economy. Despite efforts to do just that, we still \nstruggle to build a manufacturing base that can provide the goods \nnecessary to meet the global demand for renewable energy products. It \nis astonishing that increasingly, we import more renewable energy goods \nthan we export. A recent Senate report showed that over a 5 year period \nfrom 2004-2008, our trade deficit in renewable energy goods increased \n350 percent, which is attributed to increased U.S. demand that is met \nlargely by imports from Asia and Europe. Not only are we failing to \nmeet our own domestic demand, but we are slow to take advantage of \nmarket opportunities abroad. It is estimated that 90 percent of \nworldwide investments in renewable energy goods occur in G-20 \ncountries, and the developing world is projected to comprise 80 percent \nof the world's future energy demand, yet the United States is not well \npositioned to capture these growing and burgeoning markets for \nrenewable energy goods. If we are truly dedicated to strengthening our \ncapability to grow renewable energy manufacturing and to becoming \nenergy independent, we need to do more. We need to invest strategically \nat home, and we must also look beyond our shores to build markets for \ndomestic manufacturers markets that can translate into sustainable, \nwell-paying jobs here at home.\n  My legislation would create the Renewable Energy Market Access \nProgram to focus on equipping small and medium sized enterprises with \nthe tools they need to access foreign markets, thereby strengthening \nour domestic economy and creating jobs. Through REMAP, trade \nassociations and state-regional trade groups would apply to the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce to enter into cooperative agreements to provide \nmarketing and trade assistance to small- and medium-sized companies in \nthe renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. The assistance \nwould help facilitate the export of their goods to existing and new \nforeign markets. The agreements would also offer eligible participants \nan opportunity to share the costs related to innovative marketing and \npromotion activities. The public funding for any one application would \nnever exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the proposal, ensuring \nbuy-in from the applicant and an ongoing working relationship with the \nDepartment of Commerce. In sum, this bill will help streamline access \nto the global marketplace for small businesses and help promote \nAmerican renewable energy and energy efficiency products overseas.\n  I believe that this legislation takes an important step in the right \ndirection to support the growing renewable energy industry. I have been \nencouraged by the efforts of my colleagues here in the U.S. Congress \nand in the Administration to place a strong emphasis on supporting and \ngrowing all of America's exports but our future will be in solving our \nshared energy challenges.\n  While we look at ways to enhance market access to foreign markets, \nCongress must also develop sensible policy mechanisms to address unfair \ntrade barriers and other anti-competitive tactics that are used to keep \nour goods from markets in countries with which we have stable \nrelations. Such tactics should be addressed, but should not keep us \nfrom pursuing other opportunities to build foreign markets for American \nbusinesses. This is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis legislation to support our small business community in growing our \nnation's economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 841\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish outer Continental Shelf lease and permit \nprocessing coordination offices, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President--I wish to speak about legislation I am \nintroducing today aimed at streamlining a cumbersome development \nprocess for offshore oil and gas development adjacent to Alaska.\n  About a month ago, President Obama proposed essentially that when he \ncalled for increased domestic oil and gas development and cutting \nforeign oil imports by a third by 2025. The President even said his \nadministration is ``looking at potential new development in Alaska, \nboth onshore and offshore.''\n  We Alaskans were glad to hear the President use the ``A'' word--\nAlaska. As America's energy storehouse for better than a quarter \ncentury, we are anxious to continue supplying our nation a stable \nsource of energy just as we have been doing since oil starting flowing \nthrough the trans-Alaska pipeline in 1977.\n  Simply put, Alaska has enormous untapped oil and gas reserves--an \nestimated 40 to 60 billion barrels of oil on State and Federal lands \nand waters. That is approaching a decade's worth of U.S. consumption.\n  We also hold the Nation's largest conventional natural gas reserves--\nmore than 100 trillion cubic feet of this clean-burning fuel.\n  As is always the case, it is the details that matter. While we \nwelcome the President's interest in increased energy development in our \nstate, his administration--and those which preceded him--have enacted \nroadblocks to this laudable goal.\n  In the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, ConocoPhillips has been \nworking for years to secure a permit to build a bridge into a petroleum \nreserve to development oil--only to be stalled by the Army Corps of \nEngineers and EPA.\n  Moving to the offshore, Shell has been working for 5 years and \ninvested more than $3 billion for the opportunity to drill exploratory \nwells in Alaska's Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. They got very close last \nyear but just when it appeared the development had the green light a \nfew weeks ago, an internal EPA Environmental Appeals Board sent the air \nquality permit back to the drawing board.\n  Business as usual simply isn't working when it comes to increased oil \nand gas development in my State.\n  Accordingly, today I am introducing legislation that would create an \noffice of Federal coordination for the Arctic OCS, modeled after \nlegislation the late Senator Ted Stevens passed establishing a Federal \ngas pipeline coordinator. This office would have authority to work \nacross the agencies causing Alaska so much heartburn today--the EPA, \nArmy Corps of Engineers and Interior Department.\n  The Federal OCS coordinator would work with the State of Alaska and \naffected local governments to streamline development in the Chukchi and \nBeaufort seas, which hold such promise for future oil and gas \ndevelopment.\n  Additionally, it would expedite judicial review of claims related to \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and Department of Interior permits for \ndevelopment in this area. Let me be clear, this legislation does not \nprevent citizens from solving disputes in the court system. However, it \ndoes recognize that America needs this energy and issues surrounding it \nshould be solved quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 843\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide incentives for States and local educational \nagencies to implement comprehensive reforms and innovative strategies \nthat are designed to lead to significant improvement in outcomes for \nall students and significant reductions in achievement gaps among \nsubgroups of students, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nBennet, to introduce the Race to the Top Act of 2011. The Race to the \nTop Act will authorize the continuation of the highly successful Race \nto the Top program that was established by the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act. The bill also expands this successful program to \nschool districts and authorizes the program for 2012 and the succeeding \n5 years. Race to the Top calls for competitive grants for States and \nschool districts that invest in bold educational reforms designed to \nbring about significant improvement in academic outcomes for all \nstudents and significant reductions in achievement gaps.\n  When No Child Left Behind was signed into law nine years ago, we made \na national commitment to fix our educational system--a system in which \nlow-income minority students were performing significantly below their \nhigher-income peers. We made a commitment to bring an end to \nunacceptable achievement gaps and to ensure that each and every child--\nregardless of race, nationality or family income--could succeed in our \npublic schools and graduate with the skills necessary for success in \ncollege or the workforce. Despite the commitments we made, unacceptable \nachievement gaps persist. Still today our public schools are not \npreparing our students to succeed in college and the workforce. Each \nyear, 30 percent of American students fail to receive their high school \ndiploma on time and graduation rates are consistently lower for \nminority students. One-third of our students who do graduate from high \nschool are not ready for college. In international standardized tests \ninvolving students from 65 nations, fifteen year olds in the United \nStates rank 31st in mathematics, 23rd in science, and 15th in reading. \nImproving public education and closing student achievement gaps remains \none of the most important issues of our time.\n  We have made some progress, but until we have equal and excellent \neducational opportunities for all of our children, regardless of \nethnicity or income, we have not done our job. While, in many ways, No \nChild Left Behind moved us in the right direction, it needs to be \nupdated, and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act must be \nreauthorized. The continuation of the Race to the Top program should be \npart of that update.\n  The positive impact of Race to the Top has been impressive. The \ncompetition for Race to the Top money has incentivized States to \nimplement high, internationally benchmarked, core standards and to \ncreate a positive climate for public charter schools. Race to the Top \nrecognizes the essential role teachers play in education and has \nprompted States to get serious about teacher effectiveness, \ndistribution, evaluation, and accountability. And Race to the Top has \nprompted states to improve policies aimed at turning around America's \nlowest performing schools.\n  Under Race to the Top 46 States and the District of Columbia have \ndeveloped statewide reform plans; States changed laws to increase their \nability to intervene in their lowest performing schools; 22 States \nenacted laws to improve teacher quality, including alternative \ncertification, effectiveness and evaluation systems; 42 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have moved forward to adopt high college- and \ncareer- ready standards; 16 States have altered laws or policies to \ncreate or expand the number of charter schools.\n  Race to the Top is working. We know it is benefiting States that were \nsuccessful in receiving funds but it is also working for States that \ndid not receive funds, simply because those States have already enacted \nchanges that will improve education. Many States remain committed to \ntheir new educational reforms regardless of their success in securing \nRace to the Top funding.\n  Race to the Top can also play a unique role in local reforms. As I \nindicated earlier, this new bill would support districts that are \ncommitted to leading the way with bold comprehensive reform. I know \nsome officials in my home State, Connecticut, were disappointed about \nnot being selected as a Race to the Top winner. But I do believe the \nchildren in Connecticut were winners because we have strengthened our \nState laws, policies, and curriculum to lift our charter school caps, \nimprove Science, Technology, Education, and Mathematics education, and \nstrengthen our teacher evaluation process. I commend our State and \nlocal leaders that collaborated in making all of that possible. If we \ncontinue the Race to the Top program, as our bill would do, more \nStates, and now districts, will be winners and we can continue this \nmovement towards important educational reform.\n  Race to the Top has been an effective catalyst for educational reform \nand has encouraged all stakeholders to come together and work together \nto improve state agendas. It is essential that we keep the momentum of \nthe first two waves of Race to the Top moving forward. Other States and \nnow districts deserve the opportunity to engage in comprehensive \neducational reform. Since our goal is to make all schools high quality \nschools, the real winner in the Race to the Top competition will be \nstudents across America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 844\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for enhanced treatment, support, services, \nand research for individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their \nfamilies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the month of April is set aside as Autism \nAwareness Month. This is a time when people and families affected by \nautism raise awareness about the challenges people with autism face. I \nam proud today to introduce with my colleagues Senators Casey, \nMenendez, Lautenberg, and Gillibrand the Autism Services and Workforce \nAcceleration Act of 2011, which authorizes federal funding for \nservices, treatment, support, and research on autism spectrum \ndisorders.\n  Everywhere I go in Illinois, I meet people whose lives have been \naffected by autism. My office receives hundreds of letters and phone \ncalls each year from Illinoisans asking Congress to do something to \nhelp with the burden that autism brings, and we are hearing from more \nand more families every year.\n  Nationally, 1 out of every 110 children has autism. Autism affects \nchildren and families physically, psychologically, socially, and \nfinancially. It is often a major factor contributing to severe family \nfinancial difficulties, marital and family disruption, parental \noverburden that may lead to neglect and other developmental delays in \nsiblings, as well as educational and employment challenges throughout \nthe autistic person's life cycle.\n  Unfortunately, parents are not only worried about getting the \nservices they need for their autistic children when they are young. \nParents must worry about how to care for their children as they mature \ninto adults. I met two concerned parents from Illinois whose 20-year-\nold son is profoundly affected by autism and has struggled with major \nbehavioral problems. He was in a special education program at school, \nbut his teachers didn't know how to deal with his behavioral problems \nand he was suspended on numerous occasions. Eventually, his parents \nfound a school that was a better fit and his behavior improved. He is \ndoing well now, but when he turns 22 he will no longer be eligible for \nservices through the public school system. They are trying to find a \nplace for him in a day program for adults with autism, but there are \nnot enough of these programs, and the waitlists are long. These parents \nlove their son, but worry every day about what will happen to him when \nthey are too old to care for him.\n  Across the country people with autism confront a precipitous drop in \nservices after early adulthood. We need to help people with autism \nachieve their full potential by ensuring they can access to vital \nservices that enhance their quality of life. This bill includes a \nprovision that helps youth and adults with autism access essential \npost-secondary education, vocational training, employment, housing, \ntransportation, and health services.\n  During the 109th Congress, I cosponsored the Combating Autism Act, \nwhich was signed into law in December 2006. That bill called on the \nFederal Government to increase research into the causes and treatment \nof autism and to improve training and support for individuals with \nautism and their caretakers.\n  The legislature in my home State of Illinois has also listened to the \nvoices of the 26,000 families in the state living with autism. In \nresponse to the overwhelming cost of autism-related services, the State \npassed legislation signed into law in December 2008, requiring health \nplans to provide coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of autism.\n  It is time now for the Federal Government to renew and build upon the \ncommitments it has already made to help the millions of families across \nthe nation struggling with autism.\n  My legislation would support these individuals and families in \nseveral ways.\n  First, the legislation creates a demonstration project to develop \nAutism Care Programs. These programs are designed to increase access to \nquality health care services and promote communication among health \ncare providers, educators, and other service providers. Families who \nchoose to access services through these programs would be able to \ndesignate a personal care coordinator as a source of contact for their \nfamily. This personal care coordinator would help to refer and \ncoordinate a full array of medical, behavioral, mental health, \neducational and family care services to individuals and families in a \nsingle location.\n  Next, the bill authorizes a grant program to provide services to \nyouth and adults with autism. These services include post-secondary \neducation, vocational and self advocacy skills, employment, residential \nservices, health and wellness, recreational and social activities, \ntransportation, and personal safety. These services will help youth and \nadults with autism live as independently as possible and improve their \nquality of life. With the increasing number of children diagnosed with \nautism, these services will only become more important over time.\n  The bill authorizes grants to develop a national multimedia campaign \nto increase public education and awareness about healthy developmental \nmilestones and autism throughout the lifespan. These campaigns will be \ntargeted to general public audience and professional groups such as \nmedical, criminal justice, or emergency professions.\n  Finally, it creates a national training initiative on autism and a \ntechnical assistance center to develop and expand interdisciplinary \ntraining and continuing education on autism spectrum disorders.\n  Taken together, these initiatives would go an enormous way in \nsupporting and improving the lives of individuals with autism and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 850\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Autism (sometimes called ``classical autism'') is the \n     most common condition in a group of developmental disorders \n     known as autism spectrum disorders.\n       (2) Autism spectrum disorders include autism as well as \n     Asperger syndrome, Retts syndrome, childhood disintegrative \n     disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise \n     specified (usually referred to as PDD-NOS), as well as other \n     related developmental disorders.\n       (3) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders have the \n     same rights as other individuals to exert control and choice \n     over their own lives, to live independently, and to \n     participate fully in, and contribute to, their communities \n     and society through full integration and inclusion in the \n     economic, political, social, cultural, and educational \n     mainstream of society. Individuals with autism spectrum \n     disorders have the right to a life with dignity and purpose.\n       (4) While there is no uniform prevalence or severity of \n     symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders, the \n     National Institutes of Health has determined that autism \n     spectrum disorders are characterized by 3 distinctive \n     behaviors: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal \n     and nonverbal communication, and unusual, repetitive, or \n     severely limited activities and interests.\n       (5) Both children and adults with autism spectrum disorders \n     can show difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication, \n     social interactions, and sensory processing. Individuals with \n     autism spectrum disorders exhibit different symptoms or \n     behaviors, which may range from mild to significant, and \n     require varying degrees of support from friends, families, \n     service providers, and communities.\n       (6) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often need \n     assistance in the areas of comprehensive early intervention, \n     health, recreation, job training, employment, housing, \n     transportation, and early, primary, and secondary education. \n     Greater coordination and streamlining within the service \n     delivery system will enable individuals with autism spectrum \n     disorders and their families to access assistance from all \n     sectors throughout an individual's lifespan.\n       (7) A 2009 report from the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention found that the prevalence of autism spectrum \n     disorders is estimated to be 1 in 110 people in the United \n     States.\n       (8) The Harvard School of Public Health reported that the \n     cost of caring for and treating individuals with autism \n     spectrum disorders in the United States is more than \n     $35,000,000,000 annually (an estimated $3,200,000 over an \n     individual's lifetime).\n       (9) Although the overall incidence of autism is consistent \n     around the globe, researchers with the Journal of Paediatrics \n     and Child Health have found that males are 4 times more \n     likely to develop an autism spectrum disorder than females. \n     Autism spectrum disorders know no racial, ethnic, or social \n     boundaries, nor differences in family income, lifestyle, or \n     educational levels, and can affect any child.\n       (10) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders from low-\n     income, rural, and minority communities often face \n     significant obstacles to accurate diagnosis and necessary \n     specialized services, supports, and education.\n       (11) There is strong consensus within the research \n     community that intensive treatment as soon as possible \n     following diagnosis not only can reduce the cost of lifelong \n     care by two-thirds, but also yields the most positive life \n     outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorders.\n       (12) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their \n     families experience a wide range of medical issues. Few \n     common standards exist for the diagnosis and management of \n     many aspects of clinical care. Behavioral difficulties may be \n     attributed to the overarching disorder rather than to the \n     pain and discomfort of a medical condition, which may go \n     undetected and untreated. The health care and other \n     treatments available in different communities can vary \n     widely. Many families, lacking access to comprehensive and \n     coordinated health care, must fend for themselves to find the \n     best health care, treatments, and services in a complex \n     clinical world.\n       (13) Effective health care, treatment, and services for \n     individuals with autism spectrum disorders depends upon a \n     continuous exchange among researchers and caregivers. \n     Evidence-based and promising autism practices should move \n     quickly into communities, allowing individuals with autism \n     spectrum disorders and their families to benefit from the \n     newest research and enabling researchers to learn from the \n     life experiences of the people whom their work most directly \n     affects.\n       (14) There is a critical shortage of appropriately trained \n     personnel across numerous important disciplines who can \n     assess, diagnose, treat, and support children and adults with \n     autism spectrum disorders and their families. Practicing \n     professionals, as well as those in training to become \n     professionals, need the most up-to-date practices informed by \n     the most current research findings.\n       (15) The appropriate goals of the Nation regarding \n     individuals with autism spectrum disorder are the same as the \n     appropriate goals of the Nation regarding individuals with \n     disabilities in general, as established in the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.): to assure \n     equality of opportunity, full participation, independent \n     living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals.\n       (16) Finally, individuals with autism spectrum disorders \n     are often denied health care benefits solely because of their \n     diagnosis, even though proven, effective treatments for \n     autism spectrum disorders do exist.\n\n     SEC. 3. PARENTAL RIGHTS RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify the legal \n     rights of parents or legal guardians under Federal, State, or \n     local law regarding the care of their children.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years \n     2012 through 2016 such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bennet, Mr. \n        Franken, Mr. Brown of Ohio, and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 851. A bill to establish expanded learning time initiatives, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as we seek to ensure that our students \nhave the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in college and \ncareers, we must revisit how learning time is structured to help them \nmeet the ever-rising expectations and ever-growing demands of the 21st \ncentury global economy. The Time for Innovation Matters in Education \nAct, or TIME Act, would provide high-need schools with the resources \nthey need to expand the school day, week, or year so students have more \ntime to learn. By providing additional time for more in-depth and \nrigorous learning opportunities in core and other academic subjects, as \nwell as enrichment activities that contribute to a well-rounded \neducation, we can increase students' academic engagement and outcomes \nto help close our nation's achievement gap. That is why I am pleased to \nintroduce this legislation, which my colleague Rep. Donald Payne will \nintroduce in the House, today.\n  Under our present school calendar, most American students spend 6 \nhours a day for 180 days in school each year. This outdated calendar \nwas designed to meet the needs of a farm- and factory-based economy in \nthe early 20th century, and fails to provide students with the learning \ntime needed to complete a rigorous curriculum and meet high standards. \nIn fact, American students spend about 30 percent less time in school \nthan students in other leading nations, leaving American students at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. For example, students in China, Japan, and \nSouth Korea attend school 40 days more on average than American \nstudents and significantly outperform American students on average in \nmath and science. To strengthen our competitiveness and remain a global \nleader, we must increase how much learning time we provide our \nstudents, especially our at-risk students.\n  The TIME Act would give schools the flexibility to comprehensively \nredesign and expand their schedules and increase learning time by at \nleast 30 percent to meet students' diverse academic needs and \ninterests. The TIME Act's goal is not merely to encourage schools to \nadd more time at the end of the day, but to take a close look at how \nthey use their time and to redesign the entire school schedule to \ncreate a program or curriculum with teaching and learning opportunities \nto better meet students' needs. This legislation encourages strong \npartnerships between schools and community partners such as community-\nbased organizations, institutions of higher education, and cultural \norganizations to help provide students with a broader and richer \nlearning experience, which should include music, fine arts, and \nphysical education--important pursuits that all too often lose ground \nin our schools due to a focus on reading and math.\n  Many schools around the country have expanded learning time in their \ncalendars with promising results, such as Boston's Clarence Edwards \nMiddle School, which was one of the lowest-performing schools just a \nfew years ago. But in only three years of expanded learning time, \ndedicated school leaders and teachers were able to redesign and \ntransform the school into one of the city's and state's highest-\nperforming schools. Students, particularly those who are furthest \nbehind, benefit from more time for learning, and programs that \nsignificantly increase the total number of hours in a regular school \nschedule lead to gains in student academic achievement. In 2006, \nminority students and students with disabilities in Clarence Edwards \nscored far below the state averages in English and math, and while \nEnglish language learners met state averages in math, none were \nproficient in English. By 2009, every subgroup met or outperformed \nstate averages, in most cases by wide margins.\n  According to research, expanded learning time is especially important \nfor our high-need students. Students in disadvantaged families show a \ndrop-off in learning over long summer recesses compared to their \nhigher-income classmates, and they fall farther behind each year. These \nstudents are also less likely to have parents with the time and \nresources to help them with their school work. Expanded learning time \ncan help these students accelerate gains and catch up on their learning \ngaps by expanding the school year and shortening summer recess. In \naddition to those at risk of falling behind, more time for learning \nhelps students who are on grade level get ahead by providing additional \ntime for enrichment and a broader curriculum. Additional time also \nenables more students to participate in experiential and interactive \nlearning, internships, and other work-\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\nbased and service learning opportunities in their schools and \ncommunities, all of which help keep students engaged in school and make \nschool more relevant.\n  Equally important, expanded learning time initiatives provide \nteachers with increased opportunities to work collaboratively and to \nparticipate in common planning, within and across grades and subjects, \nto improve instruction, and, in turn, increase student achievement. \nThis extra time in the school schedule empowers teachers to complete \nthe curriculum, meet the needs of all students, and collaborate with \ncolleagues. The TIME Act requires grantees to design comprehensive \nplans, in collaboration with teachers, to encompass professional \ndevelopment that focuses on changes in teaching practices and \ncurriculum delivery that will result in improved student academic \nachievement as well as student engagement and success.\n  To accurately assess the difference these programs make, the TIME Act \ncalls for a rigorous evaluation that will measure several critical \nperformance indicators. We need to know which models and practices \nproduce the best outcomes for students and this evaluation will ensure \nthat we identify and disseminate them nationwide. As we reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, I am committed to helping \ncommunities offer expanded learning time so that more students can \nsucceed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Schumer, and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 852. A bill to improve the H-2A agricultural worker program for \nuse by dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the 111th Congress, after hearing the \nconcerns of Vermont's dairy farmers, I introduced the H-2A Improvement \nAct in order to give the dairy industry access to legal foreign workers \nunder our agricultural visa program. I am proud to introduce this \nlegislation once again, and I am especially pleased to have Senator \nEnzi join me as a cosponsor of this bill. I thank the senior Senator \nfrom Wyoming for his support, and I look forward to working with him to \nadvance this legislation. I also thank Senators Sanders, Schumer, Kohl, \nand Gillibrand for their support.\n  Our bill adds an explicit provision to the H-2A law to allow dairy \nworkers, sheepherders, and goatherders to obtain visas through the H-2A \nvisa program to assist American farmers. Under current law, the dairy \nindustry is completely excluded from obtaining lawful H-2A workers. \nUnder current Department of Labor regulations and guidance, the \nemployers of foreign sheepherders and goatherders in the Western States \ncan use the H-2A program. The authority for these employers to do so is \nnot codified, however, and is therefore subject to the whims of a \nFederal agency. This legislation will provide the express authority and \ncertainty for these important agricultural industries to use the visa \nprogram as Congress intended.\n  Although milk prices have improved over the past year, dairy farmers \nstill struggle to meet their labor needs. I have heard from Vermont \nfarmers, Vermont's Secretary of Agriculture, and the broader dairy \nindustry about the challenges the current situation presents. I \nrecognize that the H-2A program is imperfect, and I recognize that the \nbest solution is the comprehensive approach in the AgJOBS bill. But \nbasic access to the H-2A program is a better option than what dairy \nfarmers now have, which is no access at all. It is simply illogical to \nsubject such an important agricultural sector to unequal treatment. The \ndenial of access to lawful, willing agricultural workers places a \nsubstantial burden on employers.\n  The H-2A Improvement Act contains provisions designed to accommodate \nthe specific needs of dairy farming, sheepherding, and goatherding. It \nwill allow workers in these industries to enter the United States for \nan initial employment period of 3 years. The bill grants U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services the authority to approve a worker \nfor an additional 3-year period as needed. After the first 3 year \nperiod is completed, the worker is eligible to petition for lawful \npermanent residency.\n  The provisions contained in this bill are very similar to provisions \nthat have been a part of the long pending AgJOBS bill, legislation that \nI continue to strongly support. But the dairy farmers who continue to \noperate under this unfair system need help now. Just as much as any \nother segment of agriculture, they too deserve access to the H-2A \nprogram to meet their legitimate labor needs.\n  For years, I have urged the Department of Labor to use its regulatory \nauthority to give dairy farmers access to H-2A workers. I was \ndisappointed that, despite those requests and the recommendations of \nthe broader dairy community, the final H-2A rule released by the \nDepartment in February 2010 failed to extend access to the dairy \nindustry.\n  As a Senator from a State that prides itself on its dairy products \nand a long tradition of family farming, it is unacceptable that dairy \nfarmers are put in a position of choosing between their livelihoods and \ntaking risks with a potential employee's immigration status. I strongly \nbelieve that the vast majority of dairy farmers want to hire a lawful \nworkforce, and our policy should support these goals.\n  By expanding the H-2A program to include dairy workers, sheepherders \nand goatherders, the H-2A Improvement Act would protect both American \nand foreign workers. It would prevent American workers from having to \ncompete with an unauthorized work force, which enables unscrupulous \nemployers to pay lower wages and make employees work under unsafe labor \nconditions. It would protect foreign workers by requiring that \nemployers comply with existing H-2A regulations, wage and hour laws, \nand occupational safety laws. It would grant foreign dairy workers the \ndignity and stability of lawful status, and the opportunity to step out \nof the shadows and be productive members of the communities in which \nthey work. Despite the imperfections of the current H-2A system, these \nare the objectives this legislation strives to achieve.\n  The H-2A Improvement Act is a straight-forward, targeted fix that \nmakes sure all law abiding farmers in America have the same access to \nforeign agricultural labors. I recognize that many agricultural \nemployers have legitimate frustrations with the current regulatory \nprocess. I intend to maintain my strong support of AgJOBS legislation, \nwhich would provide the most immediate and substantial benefit to our \nNation's farmers and foreign agricultural workers. But I am unwilling \nto forego an opportunity to enact meaningful, bipartisan legislation to \npromote basic fairness for dairy, goat, and sheep farmers under our \nimmigration laws. I hope Senators will support this common sense \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to make \navailable to the public aggregate data on providers of services and \nsuppliers under the Medicare program and to allow qualified individuals \nand groups access to claims and payment data under the Medicare program \nfor purposes of conducting health research and detecting fraud; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Congress will soon debate the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2012, and one of the issues under \nconsideration is how to contain the cost of the Medicare program. While \nthere is significant disagreement about some of the proposals already \nput forward, one part of the solution that members on both sides of the \naisle agree on is cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  For several years, the Government Accountability Office has \ndesignated Medicare as a high risk program because its size and \ncomplexity make it a target for waste, fraud and abuse. Medicare pays \n4.5 million claims per work day, so catching false or inflated claims \nis a challenge. As a result, every year an estimated $30-60 billion in \nMedicare spending is wasted on fraud and abuse.\n  Under President Obama, the Executive branch has stepped up its \nenforcement activities. The Department of Health and Human Services and \nDepartment of Justice joined together to form Health Care Fraud \nPrevention and Enforcement Action Teams to combat Medicare fraud. These \nstrike forces have netted hundreds of potential criminals in the past \ncouple of years.\n  Nongovernmental groups can also play a role in detecting fraud. \nNormally, individual Medicare providers' billing data is not available \nto the public as a result of a 1979 lawsuit that blocked disclosure of \nthis information. But under a special arrangement, The Wall Street \nJournal and Center for Public Integrity were allowed access to a 5 \npercent sample of the Medicare payment data.\n  Even using just this small sliver of the data, the newspaper was able \nto identify suspicious billing and potential abuses of the Medicare \nsystem. However, based on the agreement with CMS, the paper could not \nname individual physicians.\n  I think that the exercise by the Wall Street Journal shows that \noutside group provide a valuable complement to the government's own \nfraud detection research. That is why I am introducing the Medicare \nSpending Transparency Act today.\n  The legislation would increase transparency of the Medicare program \nby providing two things.\n  First, it would provide access to aggregated claims data.\n  It would require CMS to annually publish on its website summary level \ninformation about how and what Medicare is paying to individual \nMedicare providers such as hospitals, physicians and home health \nagencies.\n  Information would the include the total amount paid, number of unique \npatients seen, total number of patient visits, and a summary of the \nservices provided. This will provide a snapshot of Medicare spending to \ninterested groups. It will also discourage fraudulent providers from \noverbilling Medicare.\n  Secondly, a complete set of Medicare data would be made available to \nqualified groups or individuals for the purposes of fraud detection and \nresearch. All patient identifying information would be protected, \nconsistent with HIPAA and other privacy laws.\n  To access this information, the individual or group would have to \ndemonstrate technical capacity to make prudent and productive use of \nthe data. Any published analysis of the data must disclose the names, \nfunding sources, employer or other relevant affiliations, and data \nanalysis methods of the researchers.\n  This legislation would bring transparency to the Medicare program by \nproviding basic information about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. \nIf nongovernmental groups want to dedicate their own resources to \nrooting out fraud, we should welcome those efforts.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to aid gifted and talented learners, including high-ability \nlearners not formally identified as gifted; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the last reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was specifically \ndesigned ``To close the achievement gap with accountability, \nflexibility, and choice, so that no child is left behind.'' Going into \nthe next reauthorization of this law, there has already been much \ndiscussion about the extent to which each element of that goal has been \nachieved. While there is some evidence of a narrowing of the \nachievement gap between disadvantaged and minority students and their \nmore advantaged peers when it comes to meeting minimum ``proficiency'' \ngoals, the achievement gap among high-ability students has been \nwidening. Some of our most promising students, the scientists, \ninventors, and problem solvers of the future, are being left behind.\n  I want to be clear that I am not necessarily talking just about high-\nachieving students. I am talking about high-ability students with gifts \nand talents that go beyond simply the ability to master grade level \ncontent. There is sometimes a tendency to assume that gifted students \nare the straight A students and vice versa, the students we needn't \nworry about because they are doing fine on their own. Sadly, that's far \nfrom true. A student may get straight A's because his or her abilities \nand pace of learning just happen to be exactly matched with the grade \nlevel curriculum and pace of instruction. Those are not the students I \nam talking about. By definition, a gifted and talented students is one \nwho gives evidence of high achievement capability and needs services \nbeyond the standard content provided in the standard way in order to \nfully develop those capabilities.\n  In fact, gifted students may significantly underperform. Many high-\nability students get poor grades due to boredom. Some drop out of \nschool or exhibit problem behaviors, and gifted students are often well \nrepresented in alternative schools. Still, even if they are getting \nstraight A's on content that is not challenging to them, they are still \nunderperforming. That hidden gap between achievement and potential \nought to be alarming to all of us who are concerned about our Nation's \nfuture economic competitiveness.\n  On the most recent international tests, students in China topped the \ncharts in math, science, and reading, while U.S. students were in the \nmiddle to bottom of the pack. Few American students are reaching the \nmost advanced achievement levels on national and state-level tests, \nwith miniscule numbers of children of color or children from poverty \nreaching those levels. A dynamic economy needs a steady supply of \nindividuals capable of achieving at advanced levels, yet we rely on \nimported talent while systematically holding back our brightest young \nminds here at home.\n  I would recommend to my colleagues the book Genius Denied by Jan and \nBob Davidson of the Davidson Institute in Nevada. It describes the many \nobstacles faced by some of our brightest students in trying to get an \nappropriate education. The book tells the story of a boy named Carlos \nwho didn't speak until he was 3\\1/2\\ years old, but then began to speak \nin complete sentences like a much older child. His mother had been told \nhe might be autistic or have a learning disability, but when she had \nhim tested, she learned he was actually gifted. He learned to read and \nwrite with incredible speed and was able to grasp simple algebra \nproblems. However, in his Kindergarten class, they were learning to add \nsingle digits by grouping teddy bears. He was miserable, and despite \nhis natural love of learning, he cried to stay home from school. He was \nteased for being different and the stress of school got to be so great \nthat his hair started falling out. He began talking about wishing that \nhe was dumb or even dead.\n\n  The book also talks about a boy named Tim who is dyslexic and also \nprofoundly gifted. His gifts compensated for his inability to read so \nhe was able to earn normal grades, but his school would not make \nappropriate accommodations for his learning disability because he was \nachieving at acceptable levels. School officials also maintained they \nhad no obligation to accommodate his gifts. This left Tim frustrated. \nHis zeal for learning waned because his disability held him back while \nhis gifts went undeveloped, but both went unaddressed by his school \nbecause he was not failing. Eventually, his mother was forced to pull \nhim out of the public school and educate him at home.\n  Many schools have special gifted and talented programs with staff \ntrained in gifted education strategies, but a great many others do not. \nThis leads to the uneven availability of appropriate services. Title I \nschools are far less likely to have any services for gifted students. \nIs this because there are no high-ability disadvantaged students? \nCertainly not. There are high-ability students in every school and low \nincome doesn't mean low ability. It is of course appropriate to ensure \nthat struggling students receive the support they need to achieve to \ntheir potential, but when disadvantaged high-ability students go \nunrecognized and unchallenged, thus falling short of the level of \nachievement they are capable of attaining, the tremendous loss of human\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\npotential is truly tragic both for the students and for our society.\n  So should every cash-strapped Title I school hire special teachers \nwith a background in gifted and talented education and start offering \ngifted education programming? Well, that would be ideal, and would \nlikely help improve the academic achievement of all students in those \nschools, but a lack of funds need not be a barrier to schools meeting \nthe unique learning needs of their high-ability students. For instance, \na report by some of the leading experts in the field at the University \nof Iowa's Belin-Blank Center titled ``A Nation Deceived: How Schools \nHold Back America's Brightest Students'' outlines both the problem of \nschools systematically failing to support their high-ability students \nand an almost no-cost solution--acceleration. Simply allowing students \nto take classes with their intellectual peers, where the curriculum is \nmatched to their ability rather than to their age, often results in \nbetter academic results as well as happier, better adjusted students. \nAlso, knowing that all teachers have high-ability students with unique \nlearning needs in their classrooms, there is a great need for \nprofessional development opportunities to incorporate the ability to \nrecognize and meet those needs.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill, with Senator Casey of Pennsylvania, \nto ensure that Federal education policy no longer overlooks the needs \nof high-ability students. It's called the TALENT Act, which stands for: \nTo Aid Gifted and High-Ability Learners by Empowering the Nation's \nTeachers. My bill corrects the lack of focus on high-ability students, \nespecially those students in underserved settings, including rural \ncommunities, by including them in the school, district, and state \nplanning process that already exists under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. It also raises the expectation that teachers have the \nskills to address the special learning needs of various populations of \nstudents, including gifted and high-ability learners. To that end, my \nbill provides for professional development grants to help general \neducation teachers and other school personnel better understand how to \nrecognize and respond to the needs of high-ability students. Finally, \nbecause we have much to learn about how best to address the very unique \nlearning needs of this often overlooked population of students, my bill \nretools and builds upon the goals and purpose of the existing Javits \nGifted and Talented Students Education Act so that we continue to \nexplore and test strategies to identify and serve high-ability students \nfrom underserved groups. These strategies can then be put into the \nhands of teachers across the country.\n  Meeting the needs of our brightest students, the ones our country is \ncounting on for our future prosperity, is not a luxury, it is a \nnecessity. That isn't a justification for embarking on some sort of new \nspending and sticking them with the bill, however. Instead, my \nlegislation would accomplish its goals in a cost-effective way by \namending existing law to account for the needs of gifted and high-\nability learners as well as retooling the old Javits program to have a \ngreater impact. For too long, Federal education policy has been so \nfocused on preventing failure that we have neglected to promote and \nencourage success. We can no longer afford to ignore the needs of our \nbrightest students and thus squander their potential. My legislation \nwill put our country on track to tap that potential which is so \nessential to the future happiness of the students and the future \nprosperity of our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 860. A bill to ensure that methodologies and technologies used by \nthe Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to screen for and detect \nthe presence of chemical, nuclear, biological, and radiological weapons \nin municipal solid waste are as effective as the methodologies and \ntechnologies used by the Bureau to screen for those materials in other \nitems of commerce entering the United States through commercial motor \nvehicle transport; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have been fighting over the past several \nyears to stop the thousands of trash shipments entering into Michigan \nfrom Canada. This year brought some welcome good news: Canada has \nstopped shipping its city trash to Michigan, eliminating about 1.5 \nmillion tons of trash a year that had been dumped into Michigan \nlandfills, and taking more than 40,000 trucks a year off Michigan \nroads. The end of these shipments fulfills a 2005 agreement that \nSenator Stabenow and I reached with Ontario officials to end all \nshipments of municipally managed trash to Michigan by the end of 2010.\n  However, private trash shipments from Canada are still being brought \ninto Michigan. Tons of waste from private companies, including from \nconstruction, industry, and commercial sources, are being imported into \nMichigan for disposal in our landfills. Most of these shipments enter \nat three border crossings in Michigan: Port Huron, Sault Ste Marie, and \nDetroit. The loads of municipal solid waste are more than just a \nnuisance. These trash trucks from Canada pose a threat to our \nenvironment, health, and security.\n  This legislation Senator Stabenow and I are introducing today would \nrequire the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection of the Department \nof Homeland Security to report to Congress on the methodologies used by \nthe Bureau to screen for the presence of chemical, nuclear, biological, \nand radiological weapons in municipal solid waste. The report would \nneed to indicate whether the techniques used by the Bureau to screen \nfor these dangerous materials in municipal solid waste are as effective \nas the methodologies used by the Bureau to screen for such materials in \nother items of commerce entering the United States. If the Bureau of \nCustoms cannot demonstrate that screening of municipal waste shipments \nis adequate, then they have 6 months to implement the technologies to \nimplement adequate screening procedures. If such measures are not \nimplemented, then the Secretary of Homeland Security shall deny entry \nof any commercial motor vehicle carrying municipal solid waste from \nCanada until the Secretary certifies that the methods and technology \nused to inspect the trash trucks are as effective as the methods and \ntechnology used to inspect other vehicles.\n  I believe this legislation will help to protect the people of this \ncountry, and I hope this Congress will act quickly on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 860\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore the natural resources, ecosystems, \nfisheries, marine habitats, and coastal wetland of Gulf Coast States, \nto create jobs and revive the economic health of communities adversely \naffected by the explosion on, and sinking of, the mobile offshore \ndrilling unit Deepwater Horizon, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am going to speak for 2 or 3 minutes \nin a brief introduction, and then turn it over to my colleague from \nLouisiana. We are both very excited and enthusiastic to present to the \nSenate and to Congress work that has been underway for almost a year.\n  As you know, next week on April 20, we will be marking the 1-year \nanniversary of the Deepwater Horizon explosion, which killed 11 men--\nthey are still in our thoughts and prayers, and their families to this \nday--injured dozens of others and shocked millions with the explosion \nthat occurred a year ago next Wednesday.\n  There are many steps our Nation has to take and must take to respond \nto that horrific incident. Senator Vitter and I are on the floor today \nto introduce the Restore the Gulf Coast Act of 2011, which we believe \nis one of the most important things that needs to be done in response \nto this incident.\n  It was frankly long overdue even before this tragedy happened, and I \nwill briefly explain. This gulf coast is a very important coast of \nAmerica.\n  I know all of the people of our coasts believe they are all \nimportant--but we who live on the gulf coast are particularly proud of \nthe coast of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida \nbecause on this coast not only do we have port and maritime activities, \nwhich is true of every coast, we also support the Nation in hosting a \nvery important domestic oil and gas industry, which is primarily \noffshore, but a great deal on shore, both close and on our marshes.\n  In addition, we have a very vibrant and robust fishing industry, both \ncommercial and recreational. We have ecotourism and migratory bird \nroutes from the south going north. Obviously this is a flyway for \nmigratory birds and extremely important to wildlife enthusiasts and \nhunters and fishermen. May I also add--and not let us forget--the \ntourism industry. So we say proudly in the gulf coast, we are America's \nworking coast. We seek a balance between mining and exploring for and \nusing our natural resources, and balancing that so this coast can be \nsustainable.\n  This is a great opportunity for the Nation to do right by the gulf \ncoast. It is a great opportunity for the polluters to step up and do \nthe right thing. It is a great opportunity to give a break to taxpayers \nbecause the bill Senator Vitter and I are putting forward--and we hope \nour other colleagues will join us in--will basically say the fine BP is \ngoing to pay--and maybe other contractors as well--that 80 percent of \nthat fine should go to the area where the injury occurred.\n  I am going to take the next minute to put up this horrifying picture \nthat people will remember because a year ago this is what the site \nlooked like when the Deepwater Horizon exploded and 5 million barrels \nof oil escaped from this tragedy and marred the beaches and marshes and \nocean, and we are still recovering, and will for years.\n  But because of the 5 million barrels of oil that were spilled, this \npolluter, BP, and its contractors are going to have to pay a very \nserious fine to the Federal Government. We believe that fine is best \ndirected to help the environment which was injured and to get the \ntaxpayers off the hook and put the polluters on the hook for picking up \nthis tab, and to do so in a way that is fair to the Gulf Coast States. \nThat is what Senator Vitter will speak about in more detail.\n  Let me show you one picture, happily. Today, the beaches along the \ngulf coast--in large measure--look like this, as shown in this picture. \nThis is the way they normally look. Because not only do we drill for \noil and gas off of our waters, but our children swim in this water. We \nrecreate and have picnics along the beach. This is the way we would \nlike this beach to look for decades to come.\n  If we are successful in getting our bill passed through the Congress \nand signed by the President in the near future, this is possible, along \nwith pictures like this one I show you, which represents a great and \nproud industry: the shrimping industry on the gulf coast, which \nsupplies fresh seafood for restaurants all over our Nation and, in some \ncases, the world.\n  So at this point, let me turn it to Senator Vitter for some more \ndetail. I want to say, it has been a pleasure and I thank the Senator \nfor his support. We want this to be a bipartisan effort. Both the \nindustry and environmental groups are very interested in working with \nus on this issue. We think it is the right policy for our country.\n  I yield to Senator Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague Senator \nLandrieu in introducing today this RESTORE the Gulf Coast Act of 2011. \nI want to also thank her and compliment her on her leadership on this \nissue. Senator Landrieu has been developing this legislation tirelessly \nsince the tragedy, working with many others who will soon be \ncosponsors, we hope, in this effort.\n  I also want to recognize Congressman Steve Scalise and his Louisiana \nHouse colleagues for having similar legislation in the House.\n  As we near this 1-year anniversary of the disaster, first we need to \nremember the victims, the human victims--the 11 people who lost their \nlives and their families. Those families still have a huge hole in \ntheir lives, and we need to continue to remember them and pray for \nthem.\n  But we also need to help restore the affected area. A lot of other \nlives were impacted through the environmental and economic devastation. \nWe need to work on that as well.\n  This RESTORE the Gulf Coast Act of 2011 would go a long way in \nrestoring those lives, in healing those impacts. This was a horrible \ntragedy, and, of course, the physical, the environmental damage was \nborne by these five Gulf Coast States. Therefore, we think it is more \nthan fair that 80 percent of the fines directly related to this event--\nwhich would not have been incurred, would not be in existence but for \nthis tragedy--be dedicated to restoration along the gulf coast.\n  Senator Landrieu, with my support, and others, has worked out a very \nfair formula to impact all of the Gulf Coast States in a positive way. \nWe think it is more than fair because it assures some minimum funding \nto all of the affected States and then has another pot of money that is \nspecifically focused on direct impacts. We think this is a very fair \nway to go about it. It also dovetails with the work that has been going \non in the States and federally through the President's commission on \nimpacts.\n  So we think this would be an excellent way to approach it. It is more \nthan fair to the Federal Government and to the Federal taxpayer because \nthe money retained that is still flowing to the Federal Treasury more \nthan covers all the expenses of the Federal Government related to this \nevent. It goes well beyond those direct expenses.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for her leadership, and I ask all of our \ncolleagues to come together around this effort. This concept has been \nexplicitly endorsed by President Obama. This concept has been \nexplicitly endorsed by the President's commission on the oilspill. All \nof those folks have absolutely said, yes, 80 percent of these Clean \nWater Act fines need to stay on the gulf coast for much-needed \nrestoration. This legislation will get that done in a fair, \nstraightforward way. I urge all of my colleagues to support it and help \npass it in the next few weeks and months.\n  Mr. President, with that, I turn the floor back to my colleague from \nLouisiana.\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see other colleagues on the floor \nwaiting to speak so I will try to wrap up these remarks in about 5 \nminutes. But I do want to add a few things and thank my colleague \nagain. He is on the committee that will take this bill into \nconsideration. That committee is chaired by Senator Barbara Boxer. I \nwant to thank her, our colleague from California, the Chair of the EPW \nCommittee, and her staff, who have been working with us very closely \nover the last year as we fashioned this approach. I think the Senator, \nof course, will speak for herself, but I think it is in her philosophy \nthat the polluters should pay, not the taxpayer, and that the area that \nwas injured should be the area that receives the response. It is \nimportant that the environment that was injured should be first \nattended to first. That is the essence and nature of our bill.\n  But to put a couple of other things in the Record, Senator Vitter \nmentioned this, but it is worth repeating. President Obama has already \nendorsed this general concept, and I want to thank him for his early \nleadership on this issue. I had some real reservations early on about \nthe national oilspill commission. I honestly did not think there were \nenough people representing the industry perspective, only the \nenvironmental perspective. But I was happy to see that commission \nreport came out fairly balanced. Both Bob Graham, who is a former \ncolleague of ours from Florida, and Bill Reilly, the former EPA \nDirector under President Bush, came to the same conclusion: that one of \nthe best ways to spend this fine money would be restoring this very \nimportant coastal area. This should not just be for the gulf coast but \nfor the Nation. Frankly, the world should take notice and to try to \nfind a path forward for coastal communities to have sustainable \neconomies.\n  This is an important question, not just for the gulf coast, not just \nfor the east coast, not just for the west coast, but I might say, this \nmight be one of the great questions in the world today. 60 percent or \nmore of the population of the world lives near coastlines. The question \nof how can people live there productively, safely, and how the \nenvironment can sustain them in that growth and development is an \nimportant question to get answers to.\n  Let me say, as a resident of the gulf coast, we do not have enough \nanswers. We do not have enough money to ask questions. That is what \nthis money will go for: some science and technology, some basic \nresearch, and, most importantly, some money to restore our coast--to do \nthe right things by this environment.\n  I want to recognize the entities that support this cause. Secretary \nRay Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy added to his portfolio to examine \nthis issue, and he, too, arrived at the same conclusion: that a very \nexcellent and smart way to spend some of these fine moneys would be on \nthese programs.\n  Just a couple of minutes more to put some facts into the Record; and \nother Senators from other States--Florida, Texas, Mississippi, and \nAlabama--can enter their own data.\n  I think it is important for people to understand, when we talk about \nthe coast of Louisiana, just the coast of Louisiana--this is going to \nbe hard for people to believe, but it is actually true--if you count \nthe tidal miles of Louisiana, which is about 7,000 tidal miles from the \ntip here, as shown on this map, all the way over to Texas from our \nMississippi border--7,000 tidal miles--if you stretch that out, it is \nthe same as going from Miami to Seattle. I need people to get that in \ntheir mind.\n  I know this looks like a little shore because it is not a big shore \nlike California or Florida. But the nature of this shore--because it is \nnot just a beach; it is America's greatest wetlands and marshes--if you \nstretched it out with all of its inlets and bays and estuaries, it \nwould go from Miami to Seattle.\n  This area is threatened, and has been for years. Yes, the oil and gas \nindustry, unfortunately, has contributed to some of this damage. But it \nis also because the Mississippi River flows through here, and it has \nbeen dammed and tamed as best as men and women can try to tame natural \nthings. The hydraulics have changed. The sea level has risen. This area \nis under great threat.\n  Mr. President, 1,500 square miles have been lost since 1930; 25 \nsquare miles of wetlands each year, which means a football field every \n30 minutes. This is an urgent matter. There is no loss of land anywhere \nin the continental United States that has as much threat to it as there \nis to this coast. We have struggled for years to find a revenue stream \nto help fix it. We understand the rest of the country says: Why should \nwe fix it? It is not our coast. But what we say back is: This coast is \nimportant to the whole Nation. It drains 40 percent of the continent. \nIt is the greatest river system in North America. No one can get wheat \nout of Kansas or Iowa without coming through this Mississippi River. So \nthere is a national interest.\n  Seventeen percent of GDP is basically supported and created by this \ngulf coast economy.\n  We are also willing to pay our own way as well. Our parishes have \ntaxed themselves. The State has set up a constitutional safeguard, a \nlockbox--if we had only done that with Social Security. We are happy to \nhave a lockbox for the wetlands money that comes in, so it can only be \nused for that purpose. So we are very proud of the actions our locals \nhave taken. Now it is time for the Federal Government to act.\n  A few more statistics: 30 percent of the commercial fisheries in the \nUnited States come off this coast, and $1.7 billion in economic impact \nfor recreational fishing--again, over 50 percent of the domestic oil \nand gas, because we drill for oil and gas here, that keep lights on and \nelectricity flowing in Chambers such as this, in rooms and buildings \nall over our country. So that is why this is so important.\n  I am going to add some other statistics for the Record about some of \nthe economic impacts of this. Again, this is an important coast to the \ncountry and it is an important effort for the world for us in America \nto get this right. Think about the drilling that is occurring off the \ncoast of Africa or Brazil or Australia or Israel and what happens. \nLet's prevent any explosions. Let's prevent these disasters. We are \nstruggling to do that, and the record is pretty good, despite the \ncriticism that comes, and that is a speech for another day.\n  But the question is, When there is an accident, when this happens, \nhow do we take that penalty money and invest it in the coast so it is \nmore resilient and it will benefit people in every way over a long \nperiod of time in a very balanced fashion.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues along the gulf coast, from Florida \nto Alabama to Mississippi and Texas, Republicans and Democrats alike, \nMembers of the House as well, to step forward and join me and Senator \nVitter. We are open to ideas and thoughts about how the money should be \nallocated but within general sets of principles we have outlined today. \nI wish to, again, thank Senator Boxer whose committee will consider \nthis in the very near future. We are hoping for a hearing in the very \nnear future and then a markup on this bill to move it forward to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsome further statistics about this horrific spill and our valuable \ncoast.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On April 20, 11 men died in a massive oil rig explosion in \n     the Gulf of Mexico.\n       For 3 months, oil flowed uncontrollably into the waters of \n     the Gulf of Mexico. 4.9 million barrels of oil was discharged \n     during the spill. That equates to 50,000 barrels of oil each \n     day.\n       600 miles of the Gulf coastline were oiled. More than half \n     of that coastline is in Louisiana.\n       320 miles of Louisiana's coastline were oiled and some oil \n     is still lingering in the marshes near Bay Jimmy on the east \n     side of Plaquemine Parish.\n       6,814 dead animals have been collected, including 6,104 \n     birds, 609 sea turtles, 100 dolphins and other mammals, and 1 \n     other reptile.\n       86,985 square miles of waters were closed to fishing. \n     Approximately 36% of Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico \n     were closed to fishing for months.\n       30 percent of commercial fisheries in the United States are \n     located in the Gulf of Mexico.\n       It is estimated that $2.5 billion were lost in our Gulf of \n     Mexico fishing industry.\n       $23 billion is estimated in impacts to tourism across the \n     Gulf Coast over a three-year\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\n     period, as estimated by the U.S. Travel Association.\n       The Gulf Coast accounts for a $1.7 billion economic impact \n     to the nation from recreational fishing.\n       30 percent of the nation's crude oil supply and 34 percent \n     of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. are produced in \n     Louisiana or adjacent Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).\n       Nearly 50 percent of all the domestically produced oil and \n     gas that fuels this nation comes from the Gulf of Mexico.\n       $8 to 10 billion in direct OCS revenues go to the U.S. \n     Treasury each year.\n       $3 trillion is contributed to the national economy by the \n     Gulf Coast.\n       12 million people live in coastal Louisiana.\n       17 percent of the National GDP comes from the Gulf Coast.\n       1,900 square miles of land have been lost in Louisiana \n     since 1930.\n       25 square miles of wetlands are lost each year--or a \n     football field-sized area every 30 minutes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 862. A bill to provide for a comprehensive Gulf of Mexico \nrestoration plan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. NELSON Of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today, 360 days after \nthe Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, taking \nthe lives of 11 Americans and forever changing the lives of their \nfriends and families. Following the explosion, hundreds of millions of \ngallons of oil spewed out of that monster well for months, devastating \nthe environment and the economy of the Gulf Coast. It is my hope and my \nbelief that by the passage of time, the hard work and dedication of \nindividuals, and the power of mother nature, the Gulf Coast will \nrecover. But it will not be immediate.\n  I can't believe Congress hasn't addressed things like liability, and \nthat some in Congress still are dead set on carrying out the oil \nindustry's agenda, regardless of all the safety, economic and \nenvironmental concerns. Meantime, the companies say we need to allow \nadditional offshore drilling. What they don't say is we have already \ngiven them tens of millions of additional acres in the Gulf of Mexico \nwhere they haven't even started drilling yet.\n  Under current law, the party responsible for an oil spill will be \nassessed fines for violations of the Clean Water Act. Those fines go to \nthe Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. But several folks have suggested \nthat those fines should go to the Gulf Coast--to restore the \nenvironment, provide economic recovery, and to make the Gulf more \nresilient to disasters--including the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, \nand the President's Oil Spill Commission headed up by Senator Bob \nGraham and Bill Reilly. Just like some of the lessons we learned after \nthe Exxon-Valdez oil spill led to the passage of landmark laws, we need \nto take the lessons of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and restore the \nGulf.\n  So today, before the 1 year anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon, I \nam introducing a bill to put the Gulf Coast back to work and return it \nto the healthy, vibrant ecosystem it used to be--complete with sugar \nwhite sand beaches and some of the best fishing in the world. I have \nheard from city commissioners, hotel workers, fishermen and Americans \nthat visit our beautiful Gulf coast that this is the right thing to do. \nThe Gulf of Mexico Recovery, Restoration, and Resiliency Act will get \nfunding to local governments for environmental education, restoration \nand research, as well as workforce development, and tourism promotion \nprojects. It will create a Council with state and federal members to \ndevelop a comprehensive plan for the Gulf of Mexico. This bill will \nensure long-term cooperative monitoring of the status of our fishery \nresources--where fishermen will work alongside scientists to protect \ntheir livelihoods by collecting the best data.\n  Most importantly, this bill will bring together all of the folks who \ncare about the Gulf and provide them with the funding to restore it. \nSpecifically, the bill creates a Citizen's Advisory Committee and a \nScience Advisory Committee to provide input on the direction of Gulf \nrestoration activities. Our federal resource partners like the \nDepartment of Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, and the Environmental Protection Agency will all have a \nseat at the table. Our State and local voices will be heard and have \nopportunities to undertake projects that support a healthy Gulf and a \nvibrant coastal economy.\n  It was heartbreaking less than a year ago to watch as oil spewed into \nthe Gulf of Mexico, to hear of dead dolphins washing ashore, and to \nspeak with folks who have lost their businesses because nobody came to \nthe beach last summer. But it is also gives me hope to know that Gulf \nresidents are a resilient, hard-working type. I know that if we can get \nthem the tools and a strong plan for rebuilding, the Gulf will start to \nrecover. We can make it right by sending the Clean Water Act fines to \nthe areas that took the hit. So I'm asking that my Senate colleagues \nwill support my efforts to help restore this national treasure, and I \nlook forward to working towards that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 862\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 148\n\n       Whereas, on February 15, 2011, protests against longtime \n     Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi began in Benghazi, Libya, \n     following the arrest of human rights advocate Fathi Tarbel;\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2011, rebels in Libya, armed with \n     outdated anti-aircraft guns and facing overwhelming firepower \n     from Qaddafi forces, were forced to retreat from strongholds \n     in eastern Libya, while doctors in Libya reported that \n     civilian casualties had doubled, mostly as the result of \n     airstrikes ordered by Qaddafi;\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2011, France became the first country \n     to recognize the Libyan Transitional National Council, \n     organized by the Libyan rebel leadership, as the legitimate \n     government of Libya;\n       Whereas, on March 12, 2011, Amr Moussa, secretary general \n     of the Arab League, announced, ``The Arab League has \n     officially requested the United Nations Security Council to \n     impose a no-fly zone against any military action against the \n     Libyan people.'';\n       Whereas, on March 16, 2011, Muammar Qaddafi's forces neared \n     the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, and Saif al-Islam, \n     Qaddafi's son, vowed that ``everything will be over in 48 \n     hours'';\n       Whereas, on March 16, 2011, following United Nations \n     Security Council negotiations, U.S. Permanent Representative \n     to the United Nations Susan Rice announced United States \n     support for a no-fly zone, stating, ``But the U.S. view is \n     that we need to be prepared to contemplate steps that \n     include, but perhaps go beyond, a no-fly zone.'';\n       Whereas, on March 17, 2011, the United Nations Security \n     Council voted to approve a no-fly zone over Libya, passing \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which \n     authorized ``all necessary measures'' to protect civilians;\n       Whereas, on March 19, 2011, President Barack Obama \n     authorized United States military operations against Libya, \n     and Operation Odyssey Dawn commenced;\n       Whereas, on March 19, 2011, the United States Armed Forces \n     began air and sea strikes against targets along the coast of \n     Libya against Libyan air defenses;\n       Whereas, on March 21, 2011, President Obama sent a letter \n     notifying Congress that he had ordered strikes on Libya and \n     outlining United States military actions in Libya during the \n     preceding 48 hours;\n       Whereas, on March 23, 2011, Muammar Qaddafi's forces \n     shelled the town of Misrata, held by Libyan rebels, killing \n     dozens of civilians;\n       Whereas, on March 24, 2011, coalition forces hit military \n     targets deep inside Libya, but failed to prevent Qaddafi's \n     tanks from re-entering Misrata and besieging its main \n     hospital;\n       Whereas, on March 24, 2011, North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organisation (NATO) Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen \n     announced that NATO would take command of enforcing the no-\n     fly zone over Libya and was considering taking control of the \n     full United Nations-backed military mission;\n       Whereas, on March 30, 2011, forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi \n     pressed further east with an artillery offensive, pushing \n     Libyan rebels back more than 95 miles towards Brega;\n       Whereas, on March 31, 2011, United States Africa Command, \n     which had led the initial phases of military operations \n     against Libya under Operation Odyssey Dawn, transferred \n     command and control of international air operations over \n     Libya to NATO;\n       Whereas, as of March 31, 2011, Operation Unified Protector, \n     under sole command of NATO, is now responsible for the arms \n     embargo, no-fly zone, and actions to protect civilians in \n     Libya;\n       Whereas, as of April 4, 2011, in support of Operation \n     Odyssey Dawn and Operation Unified Protector, the United \n     States had flown approximately 1,600 military sorties and, as \n     of April 7, 2011, had launched 228 Tomahawk Land Attack \n     Missiles and spent approximately $632,000,000;\n       Whereas President Obama has repeatedly indicated that his \n     policy on Libya is that Muammar Qaddafi should no longer \n     serve as the leader of the Government of Libya;\n       Whereas, on February 26, 2011, 11 days after the protests \n     began, President Obama discussed the situation in Libya with \n     Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and, according to a White \n     House statement, said, ``When a leader's only means of \n     staying in power is to use mass violence against his own \n     people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do \n     what is right for his country by leaving now.'';\n       Whereas, on March 3, 2011, President Obama, at a joint \n     press conference with President of Mexico Felipe Calderon, \n     said, ``Muammar Qaddafi has lost the legitimacy to lead and \n     he must leave. . . [W]e will continue to send the clear \n     message that it's time for Qaddafi to go.'';\n       Whereas, on March 18, 2011, President Obama, at a joint \n     press conference with President of Chile Sebastian Pinera, \n     said, ``I have also stated that it is U.S. policy that \n     Qaddafi needs to go. And we got a wide range of tools in \n     addition to our military efforts to support that policy.'';\n       Whereas, on March 28, 2011, President Obama, in an address \n     to the Nation, began to draw a distinction between United \n     States political and military objectives in Libya, saying, \n     ``There is no question that Libya--and the world--would be \n     better off with Qaddafi out of power. I, along with many \n     other world leaders, have embraced that goal, and will \n     actively pursue it through non-military means.'';\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\n       Whereas, on March 29, 2011, President Obama, in an \n     interview on NBC Nightly News, continued to draw this \n     distinction, saying, ``Our primary military goal is to \n     protect civilian populations and to set up the no-fly zone. \n     Our primary strategic goal is for Qaddafi to step down so \n     that the Libyan people have an opportunity to live a decent \n     life.'';\n       Whereas, despite President Obama's policy that Muammar \n     Qaddafi should no longer serve as the leader of the \n     Government of Libya, President Obama has not presented \n     Congress with a plan to achieve that policy objective;\n       Whereas President Obama has not sought from Congress any \n     type of authorization for the use of military force against \n     Libya;\n       Whereas passage of a non-binding, simple resolution by the \n     Senate is not equivalent to an authorization for the use of \n     military force, passed by both the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives and signed by the President; and\n       Whereas senior officials in the Obama Administration, \n     including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, \n     Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and Harold Koh, the \n     Department of State's Legal Adviser, have incorrectly pointed \n     to the Senate passage of a non-binding resolution, Senate \n     Resolution 85 (112th Congress), as an expression of \n     congressional consent for the United States military \n     intervention in Libya: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should submit to Congress--\n       (A) a detailed description of United States policy \n     objectives in Libya, both during and after Muammar Qaddafi's \n     rule;\n       (B) a detailed plan to achieve those objectives;\n       (C) a detailed estimate of the full cost of the United \n     States military operations in Libya and any other actions \n     required to implement the plan; and\n       (D) a detailed description of the limitations the President \n     has placed on the nature, duration, and scope of United \n     States military operations in Libya, as referenced in his \n     March 21, 2011, letter to Congress; and\n       (2) the President should seek a congressional authorization \n     for the use of military force against Libya.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, moments ago, I sent to the desk a \nresolution on my behalf, as well as that of Senator Collins, Senator \nBlunt, Senator Lee, Senator Roberts, and Senator Inhofe, relating to \nthe military operations in Libya. I would like to speak for a few \nmoments about that and about my concerns.\n  Like all of our colleagues, I respect our troops and honor them and, \nof course, their sense of duty, which obligates them to do whatever the \nCommander in Chief has directed them to do. And, of course, I respect \nthe role of our President as Commander in Chief. But I have grown \nincreasingly concerned that the role of Congress in consultation and in \ncommunication with the White House on matters of such grave import to \nour country and our men and women in uniform as intervening in a \nforeign country--that the powers of Congress have seemingly been \nignored or certainly eroded.\n  We know this is not new. Since the end of World War II, to my \nrecollection, the U.S. Congress has never exercised its authority under \narticle I, section 8 of the Constitution to declare war. Instead, when \nour nation has been involved in military operations, we have had \nsomething other than a war declared by Congress, but most often with \ncommunication and consultation and even authorization by the Congress.\n  I believe it is imperative, particularly in light of the events \nsubsequent to our intervention in Libya, that the President should \nsubmit a plan to Congress on Libya. I believe the President should also \ncome to Congress and ask for a congressional authorization for our \ncontinued participation, even in a NATO mission of which the United \nStates bears a disproportionate responsibility.\n  Like many Americans, I admire the Libyans who protested against \nMuammar Qaddafi beginning on February 15 of this year. And the \ntimeline, I believe, is important. February 15. They showed they wanted \nthe same things as people in Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Iran, and \nso many other nations in the Middle East; that is, a chance to live in \nfreedom and to have a voice in determining their own future.\n  But, like many Americans, I was also concerned that the people of \nLibya got so little encouragement from our own President. True, \nPresident Obama said on March 3 that Qaddafi had lost legitimacy and he \n``must step down from power and leave'' immediately. That was on March \n3. He indicated this was the policy of the U.S.--that regime change was \nour goal in Libya--regime change. But he obviously had no plan to \naccomplish that goal or to further assist the Libyan people in \naccomplishing it themselves, other than handing the responsibility off \nto NATO. Now, this is not like handing it off to some third party that \nis alien to us or not part of us. We--the United States--are a \nsignificant part of NATO's operations. For example, in Afghanistan, \nbasically for every one coalition troop from other NATO countries, \nthere are two American troops, and we bear the proportionate financial \nresponsibility as well.\n  The President watched as Qaddafi forces regained the momentum against \nthose who had taken up arms against the regime. France--France--became \nthe first nation to recognize the Libyan Transitional National Council \nas the legitimate government of Libya on March 10. And then the Arab \nLeague asked that a no-fly zone be imposed over Libya on March 12. \nFinally, on March 17--this was almost a month after the first protests \nagainst Qaddafi in Libya--the United Nations Security Council approved \na no-fly zone over Libya, as well as necessary measures to protect \ncivilians in that country.\n  U.N. Security Council resolutions take a lot of time to negotiate. \nThere is obviously the need for a lot of consultation between the \nnations making up the U.N. Security Council. That is why I am only left \nto wonder why it was during this period of time that the President made \nso little effort to consult with Congress in a substantive way. I admit \nhe appeared to act like he checked the box once or twice. He sent us a \nletter on March 21--2 days after Operation Odyssey Dawn began--letting \nus know what we could have learned from reading the newspaper and \nwatching cable television, that he had ordered strikes on Libya. But \nthe level of consultation with Congress about Libya was nothing like \nwhat we had in the years leading up to U.S. military involvement in \nIraq and Afghanistan, where Congress issued an explicit authorization \nfor use of military force at the request of the President of the United \nStates.\n  This is not just a constitutional powers matter. I think this is also \na matter of communicating with the American people about the reasons \nfor our intervention in Libya and expressing to the American people \nwhat the plan is so they can do what they naturally want to do; that \nis, provide support for our men and women in uniform, particularly when \nthey are in harm's way.\n  The President waited until 9 days after our planes and missiles were \nin the air to make his case to the American people in a speech at the \nNational Defense University. During that speech, the President began to \ndraw a very confusing distinction between our political and military \nobjectives in Libya, saying:\n\n       There is no question that Libya--and the world--will be \n     better off with Qaddafi out of power. I, along with many \n     other world leaders, have embraced that goal, and will \n     actively pursue it through non-military means.\n\n  Or, as he put it in an interview the next day, he said:\n\n       Our primary military goal is to protect civilian \n     populations and to set up the no-fly zone. Our primary \n     strategic goal is for Qaddafi to step down so that the Libyan \n     people have an opportunity to live a decent life.\n\n  I bet I am not the only person in the country who is confused by this \ndichotomy between our military goals and our strategic goals. I think \nthey should be the same.\n  We know the American people still have many questions about what we \nare doing in Libya and why. As a matter of fact, I met this morning \nwith some Texas Army National Guardsmen who were visiting the Capitol \njust today, who asked me a question on this very subject because they \nare confused. If our men and women in uniform are confused about the \nPresident's objective, and the American people do not understand what \nit is either, it means there has not been a good case made explaining \nthe need for military intervention and the ongoing operations. But do \nnot take my word for it. According to a Pew Research poll on April 3, \nonly 30 percent of Americans believe the United States or our allies \nhave a clear goal in Libya--30 percent. Our troops deserve more \nclarity.\n  The President told our troops that their involvement in Libya would \nlast a matter of days, not weeks. These men\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\nand women, as we all acknowledge, are the finest fighting force in the \nworld. They can accomplish any mission given to them. But they can also \ntell the difference between days and weeks. Our troops can tell that \nthey are still responsible for about 25 percent of the NATO support \nmissions in Libya. They hear the voices calling for NATO to expand its \noperations. And then they know that any expansion of NATO's mission, in \nscope or duration, puts more of them in harm's way. They simply deserve \nmore clarity, as do the American people.\n  So I think the Congress, on behalf of the American people, consistent \nwith our constitutional responsibilities and our shared power in \nmatters as serious as this, deserve a plan from the President of the \nUnited States, so he can present it to us and we can have what we \nsorely need, which is a genuine debate about our role in the future--\nthe way forward in Libya.\n  So what should that plan look like? I will make a few suggestions. I \nbelieve a credible plan should contain a detailed description of U.S. \npolicy objectives in Libya both during and after Qaddafi's rule. It \nshould include a detailed plan to achieve those objectives. And \nparticularly in these times when we are struggling with enormous debt \nand deficits, it should include a detailed estimate of the costs of \nU.S. military operations in Libya and any other actions required to \nimplement the plan.\n  Congress, of course, has the responsibility for the federal purse \nstrings and would be asked to appropriate the money, so I think it is \nentirely appropriate that the President present to us a plan that we \ncan debate and vote on in the form of an authorization.\n  I think a credible plan should also include a detailed description of \nthe limitations the President has placed on the nature, duration, and \nscope of U.S. military operations in Libya--the limitations he referred \nto in his letter of March 21 to Congress.\n  A plan from the President would, of course, be a catalyst for a long-\noverdue debate right here in the Halls of what we call occasionally the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. But we cannot deliberate without \ndebate and without an honest appraisal of where we are and where we are \ngoing. In fact, it is clear, just by referring back to the debate we \nhad on Iraq and Afghanistan, that the amount of time devoted in this \nbody to Libya is dwarfed by the fulsome debates we had over a period of \nyears relative to our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Now, what questions should a Senate debate over Libya hope to \naddress? Well, I can think of a few.\n  Was the Secretary of Defense correct when he said Libya is not a \nvital interest for the United States?\n  Is the situation on the ground in Libya--as reported by the news--\nbasically now a stalemate? Remember that the initial U.S. commander of \ncoalition operations in Libya, General Carter Ham, testified before the \nArmed Services Committee just last week. He agreed with that assessment \nthat it was essentially now a stalemate.\n  I think this is, to me, the simplest, the most direct question: If \nthe President's goal was to stop Qaddafi from killing Libyans, \ncivilians rebelling against him and protesting against his tyrannical \nrule, how in the world do we stop the killing without stopping the \nkiller? That would be Muammar Qaddafi. How can we stop the killing of \ncivilians until we achieve the objective of removing him by any means \nnecessary?\n\n  I think it is also appropriate to inquire as to whether the Pottery \nBarn rule applies in Libya. Colin Powell, former Secretary of State and \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, once observed that, Once you \nbreak it, you own it, the so-called Pottery Barn rule.\n  Has the administration's focus on Libya distracted it from our \nongoing efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, which are both vital \ninterests? We have committed huge amounts of blood and treasure to \nsuccess in both of those countries, and I think Congress needs to know, \nand we need to have a fulsome debate, about whether this mission in \nLibya has distracted from those other two vital missions.\n  We also need to talk about whether NATO's performance in Libya has \njeopardized its effectiveness and reputation. Is there a risk that the \nalliance is already splitting because of caveats or restrictions that \nsome of the coalition members are placing on their participation in the \nongoing intervention in Libya?\n  Finally, I think we need to know, because certainly everything that \nhappens becomes precedent for some future action, whether there is \nsomething that one might call an ``Obama doctrine.'' Is it that the \nUnited States will use military force when requested by our allies such \nas France or, perhaps, international bodies such as the Arab League or \nthe United Nations, but not otherwise? Is it something like the United \nStates will protect civilians when they capture the world's media \nattention, but ignore their suffering otherwise? Is it something that \nexplains why, for example, we are engaged in Libya but not engaged in \nSyria?\n  Remember that Syria is a nation that is slaughtering its own \ncivilians--a humanitarian crisis, I would submit. It is a known state \nsponsor of terrorism, so designated by the U.S. Department of State, \nand it is a well-known and notorious conduit for arms from Iran to the \nLebanese Hezbollah. Whatever the Obama doctrine is, why doesn't it \napply to Syria? We need to ask those questions and I think we need and \ndeserve--and the American people even more so deserve--answers.\n  I believe our debate in the Senate should result in a vote on a \ncongressional authorization for the President's plan, whatever that is, \nin Libya, but we ought to have a conversation, we ought to communicate, \nwe ought to have a consultation, not allow the President to treat \nCongress like a potted plant when it comes to intervening in a foreign \nnation in a military fashion. I believe the President should ask \nCongress for an authorization, and I believe we should vote on one.\n  I certainly don't believe that what we have done so far, which is \npass a simple resolution without much notice or debate, is sufficient. \nFrankly, I don't understand why some of my colleagues are so willing to \nacquiesce to the President, thereby conceding to the executive branch \nall authority in dealing with a matter of this gravity and seriousness.\n  I believe a robust debate about Libya would be good for the Senate, \nit would be good for the House of Representatives, I think it would be \ngood for the American people, and I think it would be good for the \nPresident. If the President takes action knowing that the American \npeople and the Congress are behind his plan, that is good for America, \nand that is what we need.\n  I am afraid, though, that the President is taking the support of the \nAmerican people for granted. The American people instinctively want to \nsupport our Commander in Chief, but history shows our military \noperations are most successful when the people of the United States are \nbehind them. When the American people are not--when they become \ndisengaged or disillusioned--success becomes much more difficult, not \njust in Libya but for future missions as well. I hope the President \nwill act in such a way that shows respect for Congress as a coequal \nbranch of government, and for the American people, who expect that \ntheir representatives will debate questions of this gravity in the open \nand ask the questions they themselves would ask before their sons and \ndaughters are put in danger. I hope the American people will have the \nbenefit of a vigorous debate on Libya in the Senate.\n  It is with that objective in mind that my colleagues and I have \nsubmitted a resolution. I know there are other resolutions. I believe \nthe Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nSenator from Arizona have another one. I am advised that Senator Ensign \nfrom Nevada and Senator Hutchison from Texas have another one. I think \nwe need to consider all of those views and have a debate and vote on \nthese issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2542-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2542-S2543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 149--RECOGNIZING AND SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS \n                   OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. CASEY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (5) to inspire and sustain a lifelong commitment to service \n     and civic engagement;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days, a program of Youth \n     Service America, is the largest service event in the world \n     and the only service event dedicated to engaging young people \n     ages 5 through 25;\n       Whereas, in 2011, Global Youth Service Days is being \n     observed for the 23rd consecutive year in the United States \n     and for the 12th year globally in more than 100 countries;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days provides an opportunity \n     for young people to position themselves as assets, resources, \n     active citizens, and community leaders through the \n     application of their knowledge, idealism, energy, creativity, \n     and unique perspective to improving their communities by \n     addressing a myriad of critical issues, such as childhood \n     obesity, illiteracy, hunger, environmental degradation, \n     public safety, and disaster preparedness;\n       Whereas, in 2011, thousands of participants in schools and \n     community-based organizations plan to hold Global Youth \n     Service Days activities as part of a Semester of Service, an \n     extended service-learning campaign launched on Martin Luther \n     King, Jr. Day of Service, in which young people spend the \n     semester addressing a meaningful community need connected to \n     intentional learning goals or academic standards over the \n     course of at least 70 hours;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days engages millions of young \n     people worldwide with the support of the Global Youth Service \n     Network of the Youth Service America, including more than 200 \n     national and international partners, 100 State and local lead \n     agencies, and thousands of local schools, afterschool \n     programs, youth development organizations, community \n     organizations, faith-based organizations, government \n     agencies, businesses, neighborhood associations, and \n     families;\n       Whereas, in 2011, Youth Service America intends to \n     distribute more than $1,000,000 in grants to more than 800 \n     projects led by young people, including State Farm GYSD Lead \n     Agency and Good Neighbor grants, UnitedHealth Heroes grants, \n     Sodexo Youth and Lead Organizer grants, Disney Friends for \n     Change grants, Learn and Serve America STEMester of Service \n     grants, NEA Youth Leaders for Literacy grants, and MLK \n     Semester of Service Lead Organizer Grants;\n       Whereas high quality community service and service-learning \n     programs increase--\n       (1) the academic engagement and achievement of young \n     people;\n       (2) the workforce readiness and 21st century skills of \n     young people;\n       (3) the civic knowledge and engagement of young people;\n       (4) the intercultural understanding and global citizenship \n     of young people; and\n       (5) the connectedness and commitment of young people to \n     their communities; and\n       Whereas section 198(g) of the National and Community \n     Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12653(g)) recognizes Global \n     Youth Service Days as national days of service and calls on \n     the Corporation for National and Community Service, other \n     Federal agencies and departments, and the President of the \n     United States to recognize and support youth-led activities \n     on the designated days: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions \n     of young people of the United States and encourages the \n     continued engagement and support of young people dedicated to \n     serving their neighbors, their communities, and the United \n     States;\n       (2) designates April 15 through 17, 2011, as ``Global Youth \n     Service Days''; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     Global Youth Service Days by--\n       (A) encouraging young people to participate in community \n     service and service-learning projects and to join their peers \n     in those projects;\n       (B) recognizing the volunteer efforts of the young people \n     of the United States throughout the year;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential for job loss, of proposed rules, periodically \n     review existing regulations to determine their impact on \n     small entities, and repeal regulations that are unnecessarily \n     duplicative or have outlived their stated purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     loss.\n\n     SEC. _02. INCLUDING INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN SMALL ENTITY \n                   ANALYSES.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `economic impact' means, with respect to a \n     proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) the economic effects on small entities directly \n     regulated by the rule; and\n       ``(B) the reasonably foreseeable economic effects of the \n     rule on small entities that--\n       ``(i) purchase products or services from, sell products or \n     services to, or otherwise conduct business with entities \n     directly regulated by the rule;\n       ``(ii) are directly regulated by other governmental \n     entities as a result of the rule; or\n       ``(iii) are not directly regulated by the agency as a \n     result of the rule but are otherwise subject to other agency \n     regulations as a result of the rule.''.\n\n     SEC. _03.

Mr. President, today, the Senate will pass the Food Safety \nAccountability Act, an important bill to hold criminals who poison our \nfood supply accountable for their crimes. I would like to thank \nSenators Klobuchar, Franken, Durbin, Feinstein, Kohl, and Blumenthal \nfor their support. Senators Hatch, Sessions, Coburn, and Grassley had \nconcerns about the breadth of the bill, and we were able to work \ntogether to address those concerns. The bill received unanimous, \nbipartisan support when it was reported out of the Judiciary Committee, \nand I am pleased that it has now received similar support from the \nSenate. I urge the House to quickly take up the Senate bill and join us \nin taking this important step toward protecting our food supply.\n  The Food Safety Accountability Act increases the sentences that \nprosecutors can seek for people who violate our food safety laws in \nthose cases where there is conscious or reckless disregard of a risk of \ndeath or serious bodily injury. Last summer, a salmonella outbreak \ncaused hundreds of people to fall ill and triggered a national egg \nrecall. The cause of the outbreak is still under investigation, but \nsalmonella poisoning is all too common and sometimes results from \ninexcusable knowing conduct like that carefully targeted by the Food \nSafety Accountability Act.\n  In the last Congress, a mother from Vermont, Gabrielle Meunier, \ntestified before the Senate Agriculture Committee about her 7-year-old \nson, Christopher, who became severely ill and was hospitalized for 6 \ndays after he developed salmonella poisoning from peanut crackers 2 \nyears ago. Thankfully, Christopher recovered, but Mrs. Meunier's story \nhighlighted improvements that are needed in our food safety system. No \nparent should have to go through what Mrs. Meunier experienced. The \nAmerican people should be confident that the food they buy for their \nfamilies is safe.\n  Current statutes do not provide sufficient criminal sanctions for \nthose who knowingly violate our food safety laws. Knowingly \ndistributing adulterated food is already illegal, but it is merely a \nmisdemeanor right now, and the Sentencing Commission has found that it \ngenerally does not result in jail time. The fines and recalls that \nusually result from criminal violations under current law fall short in \nprotecting the public from harmful products. Too often, those who are \nwilling to endanger our children in pursuit of profits view such fines \nor recalls as merely the cost of doing business.\n  The company responsible for the eggs at the root of the last summer's \nsalmonella crisis has a long history of environmental, immigration, \nlabor, and food safety violations. It is clear that fines are not \nenough to protect the public and effectively deter this unacceptable \nconduct. We need to make sure that those who knowingly poison the food \nsupply will go to jail. This bill will help to do that. This bill \nsignificantly increases the chances that those who commit food safety \ncrimes will face jail time, rather than a slap on the wrist, for their \ncriminal conduct.\n  Food safety received considerable attention last year, and I was \npleased that Congress finally passed comprehensive food safety reforms. \nBut our work is not done. On behalf of the hundreds of individuals \nsickened by recent salmonella outbreaks, I urge the House to quickly \npass the Food Safety Accountability Act and join the Senate in \ncontinuing to improve our food safety system.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The bill (S. 216), as amended, was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2552-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2552-S2553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING AND SUPPORTING WOMEN IN NORTH AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 127\n\n       Whereas in 2009, approximately 702,000 children were \n     determined to be victims of abuse or neglect;\n       Whereas in 2009, an estimated 1,770 children died as a \n     result of abuse or neglect;\n       Whereas in 2009, an estimated 80.8 percent of the children \n     who died due to abuse or neglect were under the age of 4;\n       Whereas in 2009, of the children under the age of 4 who \n     died due to abuse or neglect, 46.2 percent were under the age \n     of 1;\n       Whereas abused or neglected children have a higher risk for \n     developing health problems in adulthood, including \n     alcoholism, depression, drug abuse, eating disorders, \n     obesity, suicide, and certain chronic diseases;\n       Whereas a National Institute of Justice study indicated \n     that abused or neglected children--\n       (1) are 11 times more likely to be arrested for criminal \n     behavior as juveniles; and\n       (2) are 2.7 times more likely to be arrested for violent \n     and criminal behavior as adults;\n       Whereas an estimated \\1/3\\ of abused or neglected children \n     grow up to abuse or neglect their own children;\n       Whereas providing community-based services to families \n     impacted by child abuse or neglect may be far less costly \n     than--\n       (1) the emotional and physical damage inflicted on children \n     who have been abused or neglected;\n       (2) providing other services to abused or neglected \n     children, including child protective, law enforcement, court, \n     foster care, or health care services; or\n       (3) providing treatment to adults recovering from child \n     abuse; and\n       Whereas child abuse and neglect have long-term economic and \n     societal costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2011 as ``National Child Abuse \n     Prevention Month'';\n       (2) recognizes and applauds the national and community \n     organizations that work to promote awareness about child \n     abuse and neglect, including by identifying risk factors and \n     developing prevention strategies;\n       (3) supports the proclamation issued by President Obama \n     declaring April 2011 to be ``National Child Abuse Prevention \n     Month''; and\n       (4) should increase public awareness of prevention programs \n     relating to child abuse and neglect, and continue to work \n     with States to reduce the incidence of child abuse and \n     neglect in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2553-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2553-S2554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 138\n\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2009, the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council passed Resolution S-9/1, authorizing a ``fact-\n     finding mission'' regarding the conduct of the Government of \n     Israel during Operation Cast Lead between December 27, 2008, \n     and January 18, 2009;\n       Whereas that resolution prejudged the outcome of the fact \n     finding mission by mandating that it investigate ``violations \n     of international human rights law and international \n     humanitarian law by the occupying power, Israel, against the \n     Palestinian people'';\n       Whereas, on September 15, 2009, the ``United Nations Fact \n     Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict'' released its report, \n     now known as the ``Goldstone report'', named for its chair, \n     South African Jurist Richard Goldstone;\n       Whereas the report made numerous unsubstantiated assertions \n     against Israel, in particular accusing the Government of \n     Israel of committing war crimes by deliberately targeting \n     civilians during its operations in Gaza;\n       Whereas the report downplayed the overwhelming evidence \n     that Hamas deliberately used Palestinian civilians and \n     civilian institutions as human shields against Israel and \n     deliberately targeted Israeli civilians with rocket fire for \n     over eight years prior to the operation;\n       Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to \n     welcome the report, to endorse its recommendations, and to \n     condemn Israel without mentioning Hamas;\n       Whereas, as a result of the report, the United Nations \n     General Assembly has passed two resolutions endorsing the \n     report's findings, the United Nations Secretary-General has \n     been requested to submit several reports on implementation of \n     its recommendations, and the Human Rights Council is \n     scheduled to follow up on implementation of the report during \n     future sessions;\n       Whereas the findings of the Goldstone report and the \n     subsequent and continued United Nations member state actions \n     following up on those findings have caused and continue to \n     cause extensive harm to Israel's standing in the world and \n     could potentially create legal problems for Israel and its \n     leaders;\n       Whereas Justice Richard Goldstone publicly retracted the \n     central claims of the report he authored in an op-ed in The \n     Washington Post on April 2, 2011;\n       Whereas Justice Goldstone wrote in that article that if he \n     ``had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would \n     have been a different document'';\n       Whereas Justice Goldstone concluded that, contrary to his \n     report's findings, the Government of Israel did not \n     intentionally target civilians in the Gaza Strip as a matter \n     of policy;\n       Whereas, in contrast, Justice Goldstone states that the \n     crimes committed by Hamas were clearly intentional, were \n     targeted at civilians, and constitute a violation of \n     international law;\n       Whereas Justice Goldstone also conceded that the number of \n     civilian casualties in Gaza was far smaller than the report \n     alleged;\n       Whereas Justice Goldstone admitted that Israel investigated \n     the findings in the report, while expressing disappointment \n     that Hamas has not taken any steps to look into the report's \n     findings;

Mr. President, I wish to speak about a resolution \ndesignating April 15 through 17, 2011, as Global Youth Service Days'' \nthat recognizes and commends the significant community service efforts \nthat youth are making in communities across the country and around the \nworld on this weekend in April and every day. This resolution also \nencourages the citizens of the United States to acknowledge and support \nthese volunteer efforts. Passage of this resolution sends a very strong \nmessage of support to the thousands of youth across our great nation \nwho are contributing positively to their communities--your efforts are \nrecognized and appreciated.\n  Beginning this Friday, April 15, youth from across the United States \nand around the world will carry out community service projects in areas \nranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. Through this \nservice, many will embark on a lifelong path of service and civic \nengagement in more than 100 countries around the world.\n  Mr. President, the participation of youth in service to their \ncommunities is more than just a way to spend a Saturday afternoon. All \nyear long, young people across America--indeed across the globe--\nidentify and address the needs of their communities, make positive \ndifferences in the world around them, learn leadership and \norganizational skills, and gain insights into the problems of their \nfellow citizens.\n  The positive effects of this service are not limited to the projects \nour young people complete. Youth who are engaged in volunteer service \nand service-learning activities do better in school than their \nclassmates who do not volunteer because they see a direct connection to \nwhat they are learning and the real world in which they live. Youth who \nengage in volunteering and other positive activities are also more \nlikely to avoid risky behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use, crime, \nand promiscuity. Service within the community also contributes \npositively to young people's character development, civic \nparticipation, and philanthropic activity as adults.\n  Youth service also plays a role in encouraging our young people to \nstay in school. A survey by Civic Enterprises found that 47 percent of \nhigh school dropouts reported that boredom in school was a primary \nreason why they dropped out. High quality service-learning activities \ncan, however, help young people see that school matters to them \npersonally.\n  It is important, therefore, that the U.S. Senate encourage youth to \nengage in community service and to congratulate them for the service \nthey provide. I thank Senators Begich, Feinstein, Akaka, Mikulski, \nLevin, Stabenow, Cochran, Murray, and Mark Udall for joining with me in \ncosponsoring this resolution and all other Senators for supporting \npassage of it.\n  In an effort to recognize and support youth volunteers in my State, I \nam proud to acknowledge some of the activities that will occur this \nyear in Alaska in observance of National and Global Youth Service Days:\n  Anchorage's Promise, which works to mobilize all sectors of the \ncommunity to build the character and competence of Anchorage's children \nand youth, will sponsor the annual Kids' Day three-day events in \nAnchorage again this year. Youth will provide significant service to \ntheir peers and to adults who will attend Kids' Day activities this \nweekend:\n\n       Over 100 youth and AmeriCorps members will spend their day \n     volunteering at Kids' Day in order to help make it a safe, \n     fun, and successful event.\n       Teens will serve as greeters, pass out bags, help vendors \n     set up their booths, and clean up during and after the event.\n       Kindness for Kids, Inc. will provide students with \n     materials to stuff and sew pillows which will later be \n     delivered to the children in the hospital.\n       Adults and youth will be able to make cards to express \n     support for our troops.\n       Youth who formed the Japan Relief Fund will sell bracelets \n     they have made the benefit the relief efforts of the Red \n     Cross in Japan.\n       Anchorage's Promise Youth Advisory Board will present Teen \n     City Center Stage, a positive, judgment-free space where \n     teens can create graffiti art, join youth-led organizations, \n     and enjoy entertainment.\n       Students from Chugiak High School's Family Career and \n     Community Leaders of America program will present a family \n     meal toolkit that will contain healthy family meal recipes \n     that incorporate simple, affordable, and healthy food \n     choices.\n       Volunteer students from the Anchorage School district will \n     read to their younger peers as part of ``Wild About \n     Reading''. The child will then get to take the book home.\n       Youth volunteers with Volunteers of America Alaska and \n     Communities Mobilizing for Change on Alcohol will provide an \n     art project and information on underage drinking.\n       The Anchorage Public Library Teen Advisory Board will help \n     kids decorate banners that will be put on display in the \n     library.\n\n  In addition to the Kids' Day events, young people from every region \nof Alaska will serve their many ways, including:\n\n       Students at Pacific Northern Academy have donated hand-made \n     fleece scarves, hats, blankets, greeting cards, meal, and \n     decorations to various local agencies in Anchorage.\n       Youth volunteers, coordinated by the Anchorage Public \n     Library, will help organize summer reading celebration \n     materials.\n       Members of the St. John's United Methodist Church youth \n     group spent their spring break volunteering at the Food Bank \n     of Alaska in Anchorage.\n       Last November, the Wrangell Community Youth Action Group \n     collected and donated over 10,000 pounds of food for needy \n     families and Thanksgiving dinners in their community.\n       Hundreds of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts participated in \n     ``Scouting for Food'' last weekend by distributing flyers \n     about their food drive in neighborhoods, and then going door-\n     to-door collecting the donations.\n       The St. Francis Xavier Youth Group held a cake auction to \n     raise $2,590 to support a mission in Jamaica that helps the \n     poor with food, transportation, and education.\n       The Anchorage's Promise Youth Advisory Board volunteered at \n     Covenant House Alaska to assist them in preparing for First \n     Friday, a monthly art walk that takes place in downtown \n     Anchorage. YAB members put together sandwiches, made name \n     tags, and made labels for the art work that was displayed.\n       Members of the Chugiak Family Career and Community Leaders \n     of America held a Christmas party for the homeless teens at \n     Anchorage's Covenant House.\n       Youth from Two Rivers donated clothing items to Big \n     Brothers Big Sisters of America.\n       Youth in Dillingham have created a ``Chain of Kindness'' to \n     which people from the community contribute links when they \n     observe acts of kindness. The chain is hung in the entrance \n     of the local high school.\n       The Alaska Youth for Environmental Action has created a \n     resolution for the Anchorage assembly on beginning an annual \n     ``Week without Bags,'' to encourage consumers to bring their \n     own bags to the grocery store and encourage retailers to \n     provide incentive for customers that do so.\n\n  Mr. President, I am so proud of all of these young people and many \nmore across my State of Alaska. I value their idealism, energy, \ncreativity, and unique perspectives as they volunteer to make their \ncommunities better and assist those in need.\n  Many similarly wonderful activities will be taking place all across \nthe nation. I encourage all of my colleagues to visit the Youth Service \nAmerica Web site www.ysa.org to find out about the selfless and \ncreative youth who are contributing in their own States this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/14/senate-section/article/S2556-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2556-S2557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--S. 375\n\n  Mr. REID.
