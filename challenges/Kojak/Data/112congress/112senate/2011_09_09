Mr. President, I applaud the bipartisan approach taken by \nthe President last night regarding his jobs act. He described it and \ndescribed it well. It is really a commonsense plan, and this plan will \nbe a tax cut for middle-class families and even small businesses. It \nwill put laid-off teachers and first responders back to work. It will \nsend construction workers to jobsites around the country to renovate \nschools and to build roads and bridges. It will also ensure that Iraq \nand Afghan veterans who have returned from serving their country come \nhome to a job. It will also help Americans who have been unemployed for \nfar too long keep their families afloat while they look for jobs.\n  Reagan Republicans would have embraced this reasonable, commonsense \napproach, the so-called American Jobs Act. All the ideas in this \nlegislation have been supported by Democrats and Republicans in years \npast. Some of the ideas originally came from Republicans.\n  This jobs plan won't add a single penny to the deficit. In fact, we \nall know reducing unemployment is the fastest way to reducing the debt.\n  I urge reasonable Republicans to resist the voices of the tea party \nand others who would oppose this legislation and root for our economy \nto fail. It is sad that they do, but they do, and they do it for \npolitical reasons. They should see that this proposal is made up of \nbipartisan ideas, supported in the past by Members of both parties. \nThey must not continue to bow to the tea party Republicans, who are \nwilling to do anything to hurt the President. Instead of hurting the \nPresident, they are causing a tea party recession. We cannot allow \ntheir radical political agenda to crowd out America's jobs agenda.\n  The uncertainty of this summer--the fight over whether to default on \nour financial obligations and a shocking credit downgrade--has rocked \nan economy that was already shaky. But this fall and this legislation \noffer us an opportunity to set the American economy back on the right \ntrack, and we need to do that.\n  I look forward to studying the President's bill. The Senate will \nbegin debate on this proposal as soon as possible. I know not every \nRepublican will support this legislation, and I know not every Democrat \nwill support all aspects of the legislation, but it is a good piece of \nlegislation, and we need to work together. I look forward to an open, \nhonest, and respectful debate. So I hope my Republican colleagues will\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\ncontribute constructively to this process in the coming weeks rather \nthan resorting to the obstructionist tactics which have so dominated \nWashington for the last 8 months. I hope a new day of compromise is \ndawning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5472-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the eve of September 11, I would ask that \nwe all remember this: The challenges we face as a Nation, whether \nthreats to our security or to our economic security, are the same. Our \nNation's security and our economic security are tied together.\n  This Sunday, my fellow Nevadans and I and the rest of the Nation will \njoin in a remembrance to the tragic events of that fateful day 10 years \nago, and we will mourn the thousands of innocent lives lost in New \nYork, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. We will never forget the events of \nthat Tuesday morning, which dawned so clear. It was a bright blue sky \nthat ended gloomy and dark.\n  But we should also remember the spirit of unity and determination \nthat blossomed amidst the darkness of that day. In the weeks and months \nthat followed, we were not Democrats and Republicans, liberals and \nconservatives, red States and blue States, we were Americans. Beneath \nthe partisanship of Washington, that is as true today as it was 10 \nyears ago. It doesn't mean we will not disagree. In fact, the same \nfreedom that allows us to disagree is also the root of our democracy. \nBut it does mean we must work together in the best interests of this \ngreat Nation and in the interests of every man or woman who calls \nAmerica home, no matter how difficult.\n  Today, the greatest challenge facing this Nation is putting 14 \nmillion Americans back to work and returning some prosperity to our \neconomy. I look forward to tackling that challenge as one Nation. We \nneed to join together in that cause.\n  Mr. President, would you announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5472-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the courtesy of the \nSenator from Utah. I will be very brief. I will actually be propitious \nin many ways. I am here at a time when the Senator from Virginia is the \nPresiding Officer.\n  Last night there was a focus on a short-term stimulus. I wish to \nthank the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Georgia who have \nled efforts over the course of the last many months to focus on trying \nto deal with our longer term issues. I think there are many of us in \nthis body, as well as in the House of Representatives, who believe the \nbest way for us to deal with our short-term economic situation is to \ndeal with the long-term structural issues that are affecting our \ncountry so much.\n  So I am here today to express hope and to say I feel a tremendous \nconsensus building. I know the Presiding Officer and I were in a \nmeeting earlier this week where I think there was demonstrated a lot of \nconsensus by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate toward using this \nsupercommittee and encouraging the supercommittee. There was tremendous \noptimism expressed about what this supercommittee is getting ready to \ndo. But we wish to encourage them to look at a number of deficit \nreduction ideas which may be twice or even more than the original \ncharge and, secondarily, to encourage them to use this tremendous \nopportunity for tax reform, much like was laid out in many of the \nBowles-Simpson concepts, and to have Medicare entitlement reform as \npart of that; and, thirdly--and this is me speaking individually, \nalthough I think there is consensus building around this too--to do \nsomething longer term as it relates to infrastructure, such as having a \n6-year highway bill. I feel that momentum building in the House. I \nthink it exists in the Senate.\n  The reason I am on the Senate floor today is to say one thing. We \nhave a tremendous opportunity to deal with our long-term issues which \nwill immediately affect our economy now and stimulate it, if we will do \nthat. I hope what we will not do is become sidetracked on issues that \nare more around the edges, more around the fringe, issues that are \nshort-term in nature. The Presiding Officer, who has created jobs in \nhis lifetime, and I have done the same thing in my lifetime, and I \nunderstand it is important to create a long-term environment where \npeople have confidence that we have actually dealt with this country's \nproblems. There is nothing--nothing--that could be more stimulative in \nthe short term than for people to see that this body and the body \nacross the way on the other side of the Capitol have dealt with these \nissues in an appropriate way.\n  I am encouraging us to stay focused, to stay focused on the \nsupercommittee, to continue to encourage them to do even more than what \nis their charge. I think there is a lot of consensus around that, and I \nam thankful to be a part of that encouragement.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank again the \nsenior Senator from Utah for his tremendous courtesy and certainly his \nleadership on so many of these issues. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He is one of the more \nprescient people in this body, and we all care a great deal for him. I \nappreciate his leadership in this great body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5472-5", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5472-S5474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I remember September 11, 2001, as if it \nwere yesterday. I was here in my office at my desk when the unthinkable \nhappened. I remember driving to the Senate that morning thinking it was \nsuch a beautiful day. It was a crisp fall morning with a remarkable \nblue sky. Over the years, I have often wondered how such resplendence \ncould occur amid such evil and suffering. I take solace in knowing that \nnearly 3,000 innocent victims, including 3 Utahns, hopefully touched \nthe face of God that day.\n  Yet since that horrible day, Americans have once again risen to the \nchallenge. As President George W. Bush said 3 months after the attacks:\n\n       Our enemies have made the mistake that America's enemies \n     always make. They saw liberty and thought they saw weakness.\n\n  But 10 years on, Americans have shown, once again, our resolve can \nnever be broken. When confronted by evil, we will not yield.\n  I remember on that day I came over here to the Senate, and we were \ntold to evacuate the Capitol. As we walked out--some running as fast as \nthey could--and walked down the steps of the Senate side of the \nCapitol, I turned around and saw that Senator Helms was back up on the \nveranda, and he was having difficulties, as he did in his later years, \nwith ambulation, and I walked back up the steps, and he leaned on my \narm as we came down the steps and were among the last to leave the \nCapitol at that time. We were warned there might be a plane flying into \nthe Capitol or into the White House, and it was a matter of great \nconcern to everybody.\n  But 10 years later, as I have said, Americans have once again shown \nthe\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\nresolve that is necessary. We have confronted evil, and we will \ncontinue to do so, and we will never yield.\n  We, as a nation, continue to stand up to this threat and we have done \nmuch to overcome it. But we should never become complacent.\n  As the 9/11 Commission's recent report card on the implementation of \nits recommendations clearly shows, we have made important advances in \nsecuring the homeland, but a lot of work needs to be accomplished.\n  Some of the most profound changes, and also some of the least \nunderstood, have occurred in our intelligence community. For example, \nthe 16 different agencies which constitute our intelligence community \nare collaborating as never before. Part of that is because of the \nPATRIOT Act, which requires that type of collaboration. The PATRIOT Act \nhas worked very well, and even though there are some on the far right \nand the far left who do not accept the PATRIOT Act, I have to tell you \nit has worked amazingly well in helping us to protect our homeland.\n  As the Commission pointed out, collaboration in the intelligence \ncommunity was essential to the success of the raid which killed Osama \nbin Laden. That was 10 years later, but it sent a message to the world \nthat we are not going to quit until we find these people, root them \nout, and get rid of them.\n  In addition, I also believe our Nation is much safer due to the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program. The Terrorist Surveillance Program \nenables our intelligence agencies to monitor international \ncommunications from al-Qaida. This initiative has been the subject of \nmuch debate in Congress. However, the legislative compromise which was \nreached, I believe, strikes a proper balance by permitting our \nintelligence agencies to operate in an efficient manner while \nstrengthening the oversight role of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, which has worked amazingly well.\n  However, the need for improvements still remains. The Commission \nnotes that over the past 6 years we have had four Directors of National \nIntelligence. As many managers would agree, such leadership changes \nwill disrupt the implementation of any organization's modernization \nstrategy. Yet in the realm of counterterrorism, the slightest misstep \ncould be exploited by our foes to launch another attack.\n  Other areas which require immediate attention include securing our \nborders. An important tool in helping us verify the identity of \nvisitors to the United States is our biometric entry system, called US-\nVISIT. Unfortunately, the security offered by this system is \nincomplete. As the Commission pointed out, US-VISIT does not yet have a \nfully operational system to record when visitors leave our Nation. Such \na capability is not only useful in tracking terrorists but is also an \nimportant capability in stemming illegal immigration.\n  That is why I have introduced S. 332, the Strengthening Our \nCommitment to Legal Immigration and America's Security Act. This bill \nrequires the Secretary of Homeland Security to create a mandatory exit \nprocedure for foreign visitors to our country, the United States of \nAmerica. Unfortunately, my optimism regarding Afghanistan, the planning \nground and safe haven for those who plotted the attacks of September \n11, has somewhat receded.\n  The surge of forces has led to great gains in the southern Afghan \nprovinces of Helmand and Kandahar. This is the heartland of the \nTaliban. According to GEN David Rodriguez, who until recently was our \nDeputy Commander in Afghanistan, the Taliban ``enjoyed near total \ncontrol'' of these areas as recently as 2009. Moreover, our additional \nforces enabled the implementation of a robust counterinsurgency \nstrategy. This means we had sufficient forces not only to clear an area \nof the Taliban but to hold it. As a result, we were able to provide \nsecurity to the local population, assist in the development of the \nprimarily agrarian economy, and train Afghani security forces.\n  Unfortunately, the President's arbitrary decision to reduce the \nnumber of our forces deployed to Afghanistan by approximately a third, \nand instructing the reduction to be completed by next summer, only adds \nto the burden of our forces that remain.\n  In fact, this summer I was fortunate to host former Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, GEN Michael Hayden, at a speaking event in \nUtah. I found his insight on this matter most illuminating. General \nHayden did not quarrel with the notion of reducing the number of troops \nin Afghanistan. However, he was troubled by the timing of the drawdown. \nSpecifically, the general stated he would have kept the troops in place \nuntil the conclusion of the 2012 summer fighting season.\n  That being said, I have absolute confidence in our new commander, GEN \nJohn Allen. He succeeds General Petraeus, with whom I met over there in \nAfghanistan, and have met on other occasions, and who has done a \ntremendous singular service for our country. I have great respect for \nhim. But I expect General Allen to be just as good. General Allen was \none of the vital catalysts in the Sunni awakening in Iraq. The Sunni \nawakening and our counterinsurgency strategy are considered by many to \nbe the driving forces for our success during the Iraqi surge. And, of \ncourse, we all remember what General Petraeus did there as well. I am \nconfident General Allen will maintain the hard-won momentum our forces \nhave achieved in Afghanistan, despite the reduction in resources.\n  In addition, our troops will be assisted by an even greater number of \nAfghan troops. In this month's edition of Foreign Affairs, General \nRodriguez wrote that the Afghan Army by the end of 2010 had increased \nin size to 143,000, which surpassed that year's goal by 9,000 troops. \nIn addition, the Afghan Army ``has quickly become one of the country's \nmost respected institutions.'' The general also writes:\n\n       In 2011, 95 percent of all Afghan army units have been \n     partnered with coalition forces, and they are showing steady \n     improvement in providing security and in their ability to \n     independently thwart insurgent attacks.\n\n  In conclusion, much has been accomplished, but more remains to be \ndone. The memory of that day--and those we lost--will be forever with \nus. We must never forget the hard lessons we learned on September 11. \nWe must not become complacent or believe the threat is over or has \ngone. We have done much to mitigate the threats posed against us, but \nwe always must be on guard for anything in the future.\n  The hallmark of our democracy consists of the principles of liberty \nand equality, cherished by our citizens. The terrorists who attacked us \non September 11 saw the civic virtues of our peaceful Republic and \nwrongfully concluded that we were weak. As others have been reminded in \nthe past, it is a mistake to underestimate the courage and resolve of \nAmericans when our constitutional ideals come under attack or when our \nlives and liberties are threatened.\n  Even on that first day, the example of police and firemen charging \ninto burning buildings at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and \ncivilians fighting back above the skies of Shanksville, PA, showed to \nthe world that America had not lost its resolve. To this day, we remain \nvigilant in our commitment to protect the natural rights to life and \nliberty announced in our Declaration of Independence and guaranteed by \nour beloved Constitution.\n  Ten years have followed since that day, but I remain proud of the \nexample that America has set for the world as it continues its \nrelentless pursuit of those who would kill innocents and plot mass \nterrorist attacks on civilian populations.\n  President Roosevelt called the attack on Pearl Harbor ``a date which \nwill live in infamy.'' Similarly, September 11, 2001, remains a day of \nremembrance and resolve. We will always remember those who were killed \nthat day and the loved ones they left behind, and we resolve to secure \njustice for those victims by bringing justice to those responsible for \nthe attacks and who continue to plot against us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

All \nAmericans share this goal, even as we may have some disagreements over \nthe best way to do it.\n  I think one way to create jobs most of us would agree on is opening \nnew markets overseas to American workers, products and trade. U.S. \nproducts are the finest in the world, and we must lower barriers that \nimpede free trade. To that end, we heard the President repeat, as he \nhas previously on numerous occasions in speaking to Congress and the \nAmerican people, that we must lower barriers that impede free trade. To \nthat end, we heard the President say last night that he wants Congress \nto pass the three free-trade agreements, with Korea, Colombia, and \nPanama, that were concluded many years ago. I could not agree more.\n  Indeed, the International Trade Commission estimates that passing \nthese three trade agreements could increase U.S. exports by $13 \nbillion, creating approximately 250,000 new jobs.\n  So Republicans in Congress and many Democrats are ready to pass these \ntrade agreements. I believe if we had a vote on the merits of those \nagreements they would pass with strong bipartisan support just as \nprevious trade agreements have. The problem is, they continue to sit on \nthe President's desk where they have been since the day he took office. \nUntil he sends those agreements to Congress, there is nothing we can do \nto pass them.\n  Why does the President continue to urge Congress to pass agreements \nthat we cannot pass until they are submitted to Congress?\n  Considering that the President wants these agreements passed, and \nconsidering that Congress has the votes to pass them, and considering \nthe overwhelming benefits that each of these free-trade agreements \nwould bring to our workers and our economy, the obvious question, then, \nis, Why hasn't the President chosen to send these agreements to \nCongress for final approval?\n  The answer, I am afraid, has much to do with electoral politics. My \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have long insisted that the \nprice of getting trade agreements through Congress is passage of \ndomestic spending bills geared to assist U.S. workers who have been \nadversely affected by foreign trade. For this reason, in 2002, Congress \npassed the trade adjusted assistance legislation that provided short-\nterm support for worker retraining and other assistance. Many \nRepublicans were skeptical about whether this program and others like \nit achieved their goals. But we went along for the sake of our national \ninterest in expanding free trade.\n  However, in 2009, without any action taken on our three pending trade \nagreements, my friends on the other side of the aisle dramatically \nincreased the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program as part of the \nstimulus bill, raising spending on this program annually by more than \n$\\1/2\\ billion.\n  I might add that the stimulus bill was supposed to be a temporary \nstimulus. Now my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwant to make that increase permanent. In essence, a program that was \ndesigned to assist workers who had been adversely affected by free \ntrade was transformed into a domestic slush fund for reasons that had \nnothing at all to do with expanding free trade.\n  What is worse, after repeatedly claiming it supports the free-trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and Korea, earlier this year the \nWhite House announced that the cost of its support was reauthorization \nof the new trade adjustment assistance, with funding not set at the \noriginal 2002 level but the 2009 stimulus level.\n  So here we had a program that had been expanded from its original \ncost under the dubious guise of a temporary economic stimulus, and then \nwe were told this temporary funding increase, which was designed to \nexpire along with the stimulus, should, in fact, be turned into a \npermanent domestic spending program.\n  My friends, this is why Americans are so angry with Washington and \nwith Congress. It is this mentality that has led to the explosion of \ngovernment spending and national debt in this country, and it is \nunsustainable.\n  I acknowledge that expanding trade does temporarily put some of our \nworkers at a disadvantage. I remember being roundly criticized during \nthe 2008 Presidential campaign when I had the audacity to tell Michigan \nworkers the truth--that many of the jobs that had left their State for \ncheaper labor markets overseas were never coming back.\n  So I understand that trade can create difficulties for some American \nworkers. I am not opposed in principle to supporting those workers \ntemporarily so they can develop new skills, find new jobs. I don't \noppose, nor do I seek to kill, trade adjustment assistance--just to \nrestore it to its original 2002 levels. That said, for a minute let's \nlook closer at how the Federal Government has been going about \nemployment and worker training programs such as this.\n  Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office released a \nstudy entitled ``Multiple Training and Employment Programs: Providing \nInformation on Co-Locating Services and Consolidating Administrative \nStructures Could Promote Efficiencies.'' A translation from the \nbureaucrats is, How is the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program working \nout? Here is what the GAO reported on Federal employment and retraining \nprograms, including trade adjustment assistance:\n\n       The number of employment and training programs and their \n     funding have increased since our 2003 report when we last \n     reported on them. For fiscal year 2009, we identified 47 \n     employment and training programs administered across nine \n     agencies. Together, these programs spent approximately $18 \n     billion on employment and training services in fiscal year \n     2009, according to our survey data. This is an increase of 3 \n     programs and about $5 billion from our 2003 report. Adjusting \n     for inflation, the amount of the increase is about $2 \n     billion.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       We estimate, based on survey responses, that this increase \n     is likely due to temporary funding from the Recovery Act for \n     14 of the 47 programs we identified. In addition to \n     increasing funding for existing programs, the Recovery Act \n     [the stimulus package] also created 3 new programs and \n     modified several existing programs' target population groups \n     and eligibility requirements, according to agency officials. \n     For example, the Recovery Act modified the Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance program by expanding group eligibility to include \n     certain dislocated service workers who were impacted by \n     foreign trade.\n\n  So, according to the GAO, many of our multiplying employment and \ntraining programs are duplicative of other such programs funded by the \nFederal Government. But that is not all. The GAO continues:\n\n       Based on our survey of agency officials, we determined that \n     only 5 of the 47 programs have had impact studies that assess \n     whether the program is responsible for improved employment \n     outcomes. The five impact studies generally found that the \n     effects of participation were not consistent across programs, \n     with only some demonstrating positive impacts that tended to \n     be small, inconclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.\n\n  I will repeat that last sentence:\n\n       The five impact studies generally found that the effects of \n     participation were not consistent across programs, with only \n     some demonstrating positive impacts that tended to be small, \n     inconclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.\n\n  Not only are many of these employment and training programs \nduplicative, the GAO has found very little empirical evidence to \nsupport whether these programs are even accomplishing their intended \ngoals, and what empirical evidence they have found is, I repeat, \n``small, inconclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.''\n  Trade adjustment assistance is among these programs. So my question \nis simple: At this time of crushing Federal debt and increasing fiscal \nausterity, why should we increase spending on a program that is likely \nduplicated by other Federal efforts and of which we cannot even say for \nsure it is working?\n  The real tragedy is, because our trade agenda has ground to a halt \nover this disagreement, the people who are suffering most are our \nworkers and America's international economic leadership. The United \nStates may not be\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\ndoing much to advance free trade, but that is definitely not the case \nwith other countries which are vigorously competing to get their \nworkers and businesses into new overseas markets, often to the \ndetriment of the United States of America. While we stand still, the \nworld is moving past us.\n  In the 5 years we have failed to ratify the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement, U.S. companies have paid more than $3.2 billion in Colombian \nimport tariffs. That would disappear under the free-trade agreement. \nSince 2008 the United States has lost more than $800 million in \nagricultural exports to countries that trade freely with Colombia. \nAlthough less stark, the same story is true with Panama.\n  The people most disadvantaged by our failure to ratify these trade \nagreements are U.S. workers. What is more, Colombia, Panama, and Korea \nare not waiting on us. Our allies are not dependent upon us. They are \nconfidently pursuing their own interests--with us if possible but \nwithout us if necessary. Colombia and Panama and many other Latin \nAmerican countries are concluding their own trade agreements often at \nour expense. Since 2006 U.S. exporters lost 10 percent of their market \nshare in Panama. From 2008 to 2009, our main agricultural exports to \nColombia declined by more than 60 percent. These jobs are going to \nEurope, Canada, and China, but not because their workers are \noutcompeting ours but because Washington is forcing our exporters to \ncompete with one hand tied behind their backs.\n  Indeed, Colombia recently began implementing its trade agreement with \nCanada, further disadvantaging our workers and what should be a natural \nmarket for us. Just this summer, South Korea's free-trade agreement \nwith the European Union took effect.\n  We are losing ground and we need to get moving on trade immediately. \nI recognize the cost of doing so again will be Republicans' \nacquiescence to a vote to reauthorize Trade Adjustment Assistance. The \nSenate minority leader has repeatedly said he will support holding such \na vote. So there is literally no reason why the White House should not \nsend our trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and Korea to Congress \nfor an immediate vote. But as the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, \nhas correctly insisted, these trade agreements should not be linked to \na reauthorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance at their artificially \ninflated stimulus funding level.\n  I would remind my colleagues that in the first speech the President \ngave to Congress in early 2009, he advocated the passage of free-trade \nagreements. Again, last night, he mentioned the importance of the \npassage of free-trade agreements and called on Congress to pass these \nagreements. Our message back is: Mr. President, send us those \nagreements. Let us have open and honest debate. Let us have amendments. \nLet us have votes. But let us move forward. I am confident we can pass \nthese free-trade agreements, but they have to be submitted to Congress. \nIt seems fairly simple. Please, then, Mr. President, don't call on \nCongress again to pass these agreements unless you send them over to \nthe Congress so we can ratify these agreements.\n  It is terrible what has happened in Colombia--losing billions of \ndollars we have had to pay in import tariffs for our goods going into \nColombia, which should not have happened. By the way, Colombian goods \ncome into the United States free of tariff because of the Andean trade \npreference agreements. So we are now at a disadvantage, where we pay \ntariffs on American goods going into Colombia but no tariff on \nColombian goods coming into the United States. It makes no sense. South \nKorea--I believe it was last July--ratified a free-trade agreement with \nEurope. We are losing market share, and we are losing billions of \ndollars and thousands and thousands of jobs because we have not \nratified these agreements.\n  The only way we can ratify them is for the President to send them \nover. Send them over, Mr. President. Send them over. Last night, he \nsaid: Pass these bills now. I am saying: Send the free-trade agreements \nover now. I will be glad to debate, amend--with time limits--and pass \nthese free-trade agreements. I am confident there will be an \noverwhelming majority of bipartisan support for these agreements. We \ncan work out the Trade Adjustment Assistance issue. We can debate and \nvote on it. But we have to have the agreements before us so we can move \nforward on it.\n  The people in my State are hurting. People all over America are \nhurting, as the President acknowledged at the beginning of his remarks \nlast night. We can act. This is one area where I am confident we could \nmove forward. So let us have those agreements sent over, and let us \ntake them up as our first and most important priority in the coming \nweeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5475-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5475-S5476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Father Mychal Judge was a Catholic priest \nand chaplain of the New York Fire Department. On the morning of \nSeptember 11, 2001, he rushed to where he was needed--to the World \nTrade Center. He was administering last rites to a fallen firefighter \nwhen he died amid falling debris from the towers. He is listed as \nvictim 0001, the first recorded fatality of the attacks on America.\n  A photo of an ash-covered firefighter carrying Father Mychal's body \nfrom the wreckage would become one of the most enduring photos of the \nattacks. Five years after his death, a documentary film about Father \nMychal was released. It opens with an interview in which he says:\n\n       You wonder what your last hour of life could be. Will I be \n     doing something for someone, trying to save a life?\n\n  When we think of 9/11, we remember the shock and horror and the \ncrushing grief. But we also remember the courage shown that day by the \nfirefighters, po1ice, and first responders, by the passengers of United \nFlight 93, and so many others. We remember and honor all those who have \ncontinued to sacrifice to keep us safe, especially the more than 2 \nmillion members of our military who have served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Sadly, more than 6,200 of them have given their lives in \nthese wars, and nearly 46,000 have suffered serious wounds.\n  We remember clearly the outpouring of compassion and common purpose \nthat united us on 9/11 and for weeks after. Like Father Mychal, people \nacross America reached out to help others in their time of need. Jay \nWinuk is trying to recapture that spirit of good will on this 10th \nanniversary of 9/11. Jay's brother Glenn was an attorney in New York \nand an emergency medical technician with a volunteer fire department. \nHe was at home on 9/11 when the first plane hit. He rushed downtown to \nhelp evacuate people in his office building a block from the World \nTrade Center and then joined rescue efforts in the South Tower. He died \nin its collapse.\n  On the first anniversary of the attacks, Jay Winuk launched an effort \ninspired by his brother's sacrifice. It is called MyGoodDeed. The folks \nat MyGoodDeed and other organizations are working to inspire at least 1 \nmillion Americans to honor the victims and survivors of 9/11 by \nperforming good deeds and charitable service in their memories this \nSunday, the 10th anniversary. It would be, they say, the single largest \nday of charitable service in our Nation's history.\n  There are service activities of every kind planned for Chicago and \ncities across America. If you are interested in lending a hand, you can \ngo to www.911day.org. Other Americans in Illinois and across our Nation \nwill spend part of Sunday in prayer and at community gatherings \ndesigned to build new bridges of understanding between people from \ndifferent backgrounds and different faiths. I will be attending one of \nthose gatherings on Sunday. I am sure many of my colleagues will as \nwell.\n  As Members of Congress, we also have an obligation to honor the \nvictims and heroes of 9/11 in another way. In the early evening of 9/\n11, Members of Congress came together on the steps of the Capitol and \npledged to work together and to support President Bush in fighting \nterrorism. Three days later, we passed a supplemental appropriations \nbill to provide billions of dollars to clean up and rebuild the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon and to help the victims and their \nfamilies. That same day, Congress authorized President Bush to use \n``all necessary and appropriate force'' against those who participated \nin the terrorist attacks.\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\n  Soon after that, we approved billions of dollars in aid the airline \nindustry and more billions for the commercial insurance industry. We \npassed a major stimulus package, including tax cuts, to strengthen our \nbattered economy and help workers who had lost jobs in the attacks. We \nagreed to put aside our differences on contentious issues and work \nquickly, and work together, to help the American people and our economy \nin a time of crisis.\n  Today, Americans are living with a different fear than we felt on 9/\n11. They are concerned about how they are going to support their \nfamilies. They are worried they might not find another job or lose the \njob they have. Middle-class families who have seen their home values \nplummet and their retirement savings halved in the last few years worry \nabout how they will pay for the kids' college and whether they will be \nable to retire with even a little dignity and security. We need to \ndemonstrate the same urgency and unity in repairing our economy as we \nshowed in recovering from 9/11.\n  Last night, President Obama came before Congress and laid out a \nresponsible plan to create good jobs in America today, invest in our \nNation's future, and reduce our deficit. I hope this Senate will give \nthe President's plan prompt and fair consideration. We can negotiate. \nWe can make adjustments and improvements. We can look at alternative \nplans. The only thing we can't do is nothing. To debate and delay \nendlessly while people are losing their jobs and their homes is \ninexcusable.\n  Nearly 3,000 innocent people lost their lives on September 11, and \nnearly 3,000 children lost a father or a mother. On this 10th \nanniversary of 9/11, I say to my congressional colleagues, both \nDemocrats and Republicans: Let's sort through our differences--\nhonestly, fairly and quickly--and work together to get our economy back \non track and Americans back to work. Let's preserve the American dream \nfor the families of 9/11 and for all of America's families. That is how \nthis Congress can honor the victims and heroes of 9/11.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5476-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, for the 13th consecutive year, \ncommunities across the world today are pausing during the 9th hour of \nthe 9th day of the 9th month to acknowledge International Fetal Alcohol \nSpectrum Disorders Awareness Day. FASD Day will be observed in my home \nState of Alaska with ceremonies across the State.\n  I am grateful that this body is also recognizing Fetal Alcohol \nSpectrum Disorders Awareness Day with a moment of reflection. For this, \nI thank my colleagues, especially the senior Senator from South Dakota, \nTim Johnson, who has joined with me in offering a resolution \nrecognizing September 9, 2011, as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \nDisorders Awareness Day. I hope we will continue to pause in the ninth \nhour of the ninth day each September until fetal alcohol spectrum \ndisorders are eradicated.\n  FASD is an umbrella term that describes a range of physical and \nmental birth defects that can occur in a fetus when a pregnant woman \nconsumes alcohol. It is a leading cause of nonhereditary mental \nretardation in the United States. Many children affected by maternal \ndrinking during pregnancy have irreversible conditions, including \nsevere brain damage. It is causing permanent lifelong disability.\n  Unlike thousands of other diseases, FASD is 100 percent preventable. \nPrevention merely requires a woman to abstain from alcohol during \npregnancy. Knowing that it is entirely preventable, it saddens me to \nthink that every year in this country an estimated 1 in every 100 \nbabies is born with FASD. That is about 40,000 infants annually. FASD \naffects more children than Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy, spina \nbifida, and muscular dystrophy combined.\n  All in all, the direct and indirect economic costs of FASD in the \nUnited States are estimated to be $5.4 billion. FASD is found in every \ncommunity in America. It does not discriminate.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have given many speeches recognizing \nFASD day. In each of those speeches, I have talked about Alaska's high \nrate of FASD. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention project \nestablished that in 2002, Alaska's FASD rate was the highest in the \nNation. Among our Native communities, the rate of FASD has been 15 \ntimes higher than in non-Native areas in our State. But this year I am \nproud to report that our statistics have vastly improved.\n  According to the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, \nAlaska Native babies were born with fetal alcohol syndrome half as \noften around the year 2000 as they were 5 to 7 years earlier. Through a \nmajor Federal-State prevention and education effort from 1991 to 1996, \nand with a second effort from 1998 to 2006, the rate of fetal alcohol \nsyndrome among Alaska Native babies decreased by 49 percent. Alaska's \noverall rate dropped to 13.5 from 20.0. More work can and should \ncertainly be done, but this is a remarkable improvement for a State \nwith historically the highest rate of FASD.\n  Mr. President, 40,000 American children each year are born with FASD. \nBut education in prevention, treatment, and research of FASD will save \ncountless future health care costs relating to this devastating but \nentirely preventable disorder.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' support of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \nDisorder Awareness Day and hope we all remember the innocent babies \nafflicted with this disorder. I hope we continue to recognize the ninth \nhour of the ninth day of each September until fetal alcohol syndrome \ndisorders are eradicated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5476-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \nRESPECT TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES OF SEPTEMBER 11, \n                              2001--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to accept \nfrom the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial and \nMuseum at the World Trade Center Foundation, Inc., the donation of \ntitle to The National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World \nTrade Center, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on the morning of September 11, 2001, \nnearly 3,000 people who would lose their lives in the most horrific \nattack on America since the bombing of Pearl Harbor began their day \nlike it was any other.\n  Many got dressed and headed for work. Others packed their bags and \nwent to the airport. All would leave their loved ones that morning \nbelieving they would be home soon to continue the lives they worked so \nhard to create.\n  Instead these innocents were murdered by terrorists at the World \nTrade Center, the Pentagon, and in a field in Shanksville, PA. This \ndespicable act forever changed our great nation and the world. Families \nwere shattered, a war began, and the relative peace and security we \nenjoyed was ripped away.\n  I recently toured the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan and \nalthough the rubble has been cleared and great structures are rising \nfrom the earth, there is a solemn air that permeates the place.\n  Despite the bustling crews and the towering cranes stacking metal and \nshaping the new towers it is still the spot where husbands, wives, \nfathers, mothers, sisters and brothers died in fiery fashion.\n  Being there reminded me of the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the \nformative years that followed.\n  I was a boy of 17 when I heard the announcer shout over the radio \nthat Japanese planes were attacking Pearl Harbor. I remember running \noutside with my father to see the bright red suns painted on the wings \nof the Zeroes as they raced toward their target amid black puffs of \nanti-aircraft fire.\n  I knew at that moment that my country and my life would never be the \nsame. Six decades later that moment came again when I watched passenger \njets crash into the side of the World Trade Center.\n  After Pearl Harbor I put on the uniform and went off to fight for \nthis country as did thousands of my brave brothers from the Greatest \nGeneration. Our nation was shocked into action by the events of \nDecember 7, 1941 and a generation of Americans fought and died to shape \nthe new world that came after the bombs fell.\n  America was awakened in similar fashion on the morning of September \n11, 2001 and 10 years later we are still fighting and dying to create a \nfuture better than the one we lost that day.\n  Today, next to the new towers at the World Trade Center site, is the \nNational September 11 Memorial and Museum at Ground Zero. It is a \nmagnificent structure. Two waterfall rimmed pools, situated in the \noriginal foot prints of the fallen towers, sit side by side. The names \nof the fallen are engraved in panels that form a railing around each \npool.\n  It is a fitting memorial for those who died but we must honor their \nmemory by telling their story and educating the world about what \nhappened on September 11, 2001.\n  Yes, it was America that was attacked, but the world changed forever \nthat day and this memorial and museum is much more than a collection of \nartifacts, it is a symbol of America reborn and a reminder that the \nworld order is always changing.\n  Today, I rise to introduce a bill that will allow the United States, \nthrough the Secretary of the Interior, to take ownership of the lands, \nthe Memorial and the Museum, after the appropriate approvals are \nsecured from the Governor of the State of New York, the Governor of the \nState of New Jersey, and the Mayor of New York City.\n  The Department of the Interior will enter into a cooperative \nagreement with the Board of the non-profit National September 11 \nMemorial and Museum at the World Trade Center, Inc., which may provide \ntechnical and financial assistance to the Memorial and Museum relating \nto its operations and maintenance.\n  The legislation would authorize appropriations of $20 million in \nfiscal year 2013, the first full fiscal year after which the Museum is \nscheduled to open to the public, and in subsequent years.\n  All funds appropriated must be matched by non-Federal sources, such \nas admission fees, gifts and fundraising, with the resulting Federal \nshare being about 33 percent or less of the overall budget of the \nMemorial and Museum.\n  It is our duty to help perpetuate this seminal moment in American \nhistory.\n  Let us take responsibility for preserving our past and driving our \nfuture by honoring the fallen and their families with this lasting \ntribute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National September 11 \n     Memorial and Museum Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

SMITH\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wanted to be afforded this opportunity \nto address the Senate. I recognize I may be all that is standing in \nfront of the Presiding Officer and the folks who do such a good job of \nmaintaining order in the Senate and adjournment so I will try to make \nmy remarks relatively brief--relatively.\n  I rise again today to honor another great Federal employee, Michael \nSmith. As the Director of the Strategic Source Program Office within \nthe Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, Mr. Smith has saved U.S. \ntaxpayers an estimated $750 million over a 3-year period by merging the \nbuying power of 22 different components within DHS.\n  Mr. Smith recognizes--which I also recognized as Governor and I know \nthe Presiding Officer did when he was the Governor of the great State \nof West Virginia--that centralized procurement operations is a critical \nstep to creating efficiencies and savings in government.\n  As Governor I fostered development of the State centralized \nprocurement system, eVA, and mandated that all of the State's entities \nuse that system for\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\npurchases. For example, we were able to reduce what we paid for \nlightbulbs in Virginia from 38 cents to 23 cents each. That didn't \nclose a $6 billion shortfall by itself, but we buy a lot of lightbulbs \nin Virginia, and I know they do in West Virginia as well.\n  Mr. Smith has taken a similar approach at the Federal level, and his \naccomplishment was no small feat. After analyzing the purchasing data \nat DHS, he identified several critical security problems and services \nthat could be consolidated for purposes of purchasing, such as \nammunition, uniforms, and communications equipment.\n  He brought together the program and acquisition staff of 22 DHS \ncomponents, including the Transportation Security Administration and \nCustoms and Border Protection, to agree to work together. Mr. Smith's \nsupervisors said that he listened to the different needs of the DHS \ncomponents and was able to lead them to common solutions to meet all \ntheir individual requirements under a new contract.\n  According to Nick Nayak, the DHS chief procurement officer, ``Mr. \nSmith led a new way of doing business where agencies provided a letter \ndetailing their financial and policy commitment to initiative to obtain \nthe business pricing for the government.'' Mr. Smith's collaborative \napproach has been so successful that the White House has asked him to \nintroduce his methodology to other larger agencies.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Mr. Smith for his \nexcellent work. I am also proud to recognize him as a Virginian, a \nMarine Corps veteran, and someone who has dedicated the past 28 years \nto public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5479-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before I relinquish the floor, I do want \nto take a couple of minutes on two other items. No. 1, as the Presiding \nOfficer this morning, I heard a number of Senators come forward and \nrecognize, as others have over the last few days, that we are \napproaching the 10th anniversary of 9/11.\n  I am sure all of us here remember where we were that Tuesday morning. \nI personally recall I was in a campaign for Governor at that point. I \nhad just gotten a haircut and a big debate was 3 days away when I first \ngot the news. Suddenly the big debate didn't seem that terribly \nimportant. Within an hour I had been at my campaign headquarters, saw \nthe plane crash into the Pentagon with smoke billowing out.\n  In the last 10 years I think this country has made remarkable strides \nin making sure Americans are safer than they were 10 years ago. We have \nseen a whole new series of collaborations between our intelligence \nservice agencies. We have seen greater collaboration here at home \namongst our law enforcement.\n  As we all come together on Sunday and reflect back on the last 10 \nyears and the horrors that were brought to this country, I hope we will \nall say a little prayer for those members of our military and those \nmembers of the intelligence community for the magnificent work they \nhave done making our country much safer.\n  I think, as well, as we see reports even today of possible threats, \nwe recognize we can never be 100 percent safe. I remember during my \ntenure as Governor, within the first year, we in Virginia and the \nDistrict and Maryland were caught in almost 3 weeks of remarkable \nterror with what later became known as the sniper incidents. For a lot \nof that time we didn't know whether this was a possible terrorist \nincident or was it what it turned out to be, two deranged lone-wolf \nassassins wreaking havoc across most of the mid-Atlantic.\n  We need to bear in mind that while we and our government will do \neverything possible to keep us safe, we also have to rely upon \nindividuals in collaboration with law enforcement as they spot \nincidents that seem unusual.\n  But even with that collaboration, there may be times that someone, \nwhether home-grown or foreign, someone, a lone-wolf type assassin or \nterrorist, could slip through, and I think it is important that, 10 \nyears after that enormous tragedy, we as a people be more resilient. We \ncannot allow a single act of terror to change the way we live, our \nfreedoms, our civil liberties, because, candidly, there is no way any \nterrorist can inflict so much individual harm that it can do permanent \ndamage to our country. But if they do spread fear or make us as a \npeople change the way we interact, change the kind respect we have for \neach other, the respect we have for our freedoms, then they will be \nmore successful than with any single incident of harm.\n  I know the Presiding Officer and many of the folks who work here and \nmany of the young pages, as we go into this weekend of reflection--and \nI hope many of the folks who are listening today--will take a moment \nand not only reflect back on that 10th anniversary but also do an act \nof service. I think this is a great time for us as Americans to show \nservice back to our communities.\n  I know I will be in the Pentagon Sunday morning, where we were hit in \nVirginia. The Pentagon is a national institution, but we in Virginia \nare proud it resides in the Commonwealth. I will be in the Pentagon \nSunday morning to be with some who lost loved ones on that day. But I \nwill also be doing acts of community service throughout this weekend as \nwell, to make sure we show that great spirit of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5479-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INVESTING IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I also wish to take one final moment, and \nI will be very brief. I want to echo something my colleague from \nTennessee said. It is something the Presiding Officer has been very \nactive with over the last few months. We all heard the President last \nnight. Some of us may agree or disagree with all the actions the \nPresident laid out. I think there are things we can do as a government \ntargeted to help spur economic growth and job creation that needs to be \nour top priority.\n  I do think we have to recognize there is not a single silver bullet, \nthat the major tools the government uses during a period of economic \nturmoil we have actually already used. The central government can lower \ninterest rates. The government can use federal stimulus. We have used \nboth of those. There can be certain additional things we can do around \nthe edges, but one of the most important things we can do to get this \neconomy restarted is generate confidence, confidence amongst the \nAmerican consumers and the American people that we in Washington are \nnot going to mess things up any worse, confidence amongst our business \ncommunity, particularly larger businesses that are sitting on $2.5 \ntrillion, and they are in a financially better position today than they \nwere back in 2008 when we first experienced the beginnings of the \nfinancial crisis, to get that money off the sidelines and reinvest it \nin America.\n  One of the most important things we can do--and the President touched \nupon it last night, but there has been a group of bipartisan Senators \nthat has been working on this for a long period of time--is to \nrecognize that unless we get our long-term debt problems under control, \nthen I don't think we will see the resurgence of confidence this \neconomy and this country needs.\n  I look forward to working with the President and Members of both \nparties and targeting investments. I hope, as well, with the Presiding \nOfficer, with my friend from Tennessee, with my friend, the Senator \nfrom Georgia, and others, that we can work with this so-called new \nsupercommittee to urge them to be bold, and that if they will be bold \nand we put in place over a 10-year frame a long-term deficit reduction \nplan, I hope we reduce the deficit by at least $4 trillion, \nencompassing what we have already done. That plan phased in over a \ndecade will do as much to generate job creation in the short term as \nany other action. I look forward to that work ahead.\n  I look forward to reflecting back with all my fellow Americans upon \nboth the sacrifice and tragedy, but also the amazing resilience of the \nAmerican people in the last decade, and I compliment Mr. Smith and so \nmany federal employees for the work they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/09/senate-section/article/S5479-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5479-S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FALLEN HEROES OF 9/11 ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
