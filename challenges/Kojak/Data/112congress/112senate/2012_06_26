Mr. President, we are currently considering the motion to \nconcur in the House message to accompany the FDA bill postcloture. We \nhope to work something out on that so that we can move to it early \nevening.\n  The first hour of debate this morning will be equally divided and \ncontrolled, with the Republicans controlling the first half and the \nmajority controlling the final half.\n  At 11:30 the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the \nnomination of Robin Rosenbaum to be a district judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida.\n  At noon there will be a rollcall vote on confirmation of the \nRosenbaum nomination.\n  The Senate will recess today from 12:30 to 2:15, as we normally do on \nTuesdays, for our weekly caucus meetings.\n  At 2:15 there will be 6 hours 15 minutes remaining on the motion to \nconcur in the House message with respect to the FDA bill. We hope that \na significant amount of time can be yielded back and that we can \ncomplete action on the bill today.\n  There is an all-Senators briefing at 5 o'clock. We are going to \ncontinue--that time will run. We are not going to recess during that \nperiod of time. That will be in the classified room down in the Visitor \nCenter.\n  We have accomplished a lot. Everyone knows how grateful I am to \nSenators Stabenow and Roberts for working their way and our way through \nthat very difficult farm bill.\n  We are watching very closely the great work of Senator Boxer, Senator \nInhofe, the Finance Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Banking \nCommittee on helping us work through the highway bill. There is a \npossibility that we can get that bill done. I think the chances today \nare better than 50-50 that we can get a bill done, but we are still \nlooking at Speaker Boehner to help us get that over the finish line. So \nwe will see what happens on that.\n  As I have indicated, the FDA bill--we will complete that tonight. \nThat is a very important accomplishment for us.\n  We have the student loan issue, and we are working on that. We hope \nto get that done soon. I think there is a general feeling that we have \nworked out a compromise on that that is acceptable, with the help of \nSenator Baucus, Senator Harkin, and others. Jack Reed, of course, has \nled the charge on that for some time.\n  I have talked about the highway bill. We need to get that done.\n  The remaining issue is flood insurance, and we are doing fine on \nflood insurance, except I was told last night that one of the \nRepublican Senators wants to offer an amendment--listen to this one--\nwants to offer an amendment on when life begins. I have been very \npatient in working with my Republican colleagues and allowing relevant \namendments on issues, and sometimes we even do nonrelevant amendments \nbut, really, on flood insurance, are we going to have to start dealing \nas we did with the highway bill for weeks and weeks with contraception? \nNow we have another person who wants to deal with when life begins.\n  I don't understand what this is all about, but I want everyone to \nknow that this flood insurance bill is extremely important. The big \npushers of\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\nthis bill are Republican Senators, veteran Republican Senators, and \nthey better work on their side of the aisle because I am not going to \nput up with that on the flood insurance bill.\n\n  I can be condemned by outside sources. My friends can say: Let him \nhave a vote on it. There will not be a vote on that on flood insurance. \nWe will either do flood insurance with amendments that deal with flood \ninsurance or we will not do it. We will have an extension. After all of \nthe work that has been put into this bill, this is ridiculous, that \nsomebody says: I am not going to let this bill go forward unless I have \na vote on when life begins. I am not going to do that, and I think I \nspeak for the majority of Senators.\n  Now, if the Republicans will not stand up to the person who is going \nto do that, I am not going to. I have tried my best to deal with these \nissues that have nothing to do with a piece of legislation, but with \nthe end of the month staring us in the face we have too many important \nthings we have to do. Student loans will be doubled if we do not get \nthat done. Flood insurance will disappear if we do not get it done. The \nhighway program will disappear if we do not get it done. The FDA bill--\nit will create all kinds of problems, if we do not get that done.\n  I think this is outlandish. It somebody feels really moved upon to \ntalk about when life begins, have them come and give a speech.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4602-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Putting America to Work\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, we have had a lot of news in Washington, \nDC, and across the country over the last few days. There was a decision \nfrom the Supreme Court regarding immigration laws in Arizona. We are \nexpecting and anticipating a decision by the Supreme Court later this \nweek regarding the Affordable Care Act. Front and center are issues \nthat are important to the country.\n  We were successful last week in approving on the Senate floor a so-\ncalled farm bill, an agricultural bill that, again, has an impact upon \nmany in our Nation. I want to make certain we don't lose sight of what \nremains and, in my view, what should be front and center.\n  All the things people ask government to do and all the things they \nwant to accomplish in their own lives can only occur if there is a good \nand growing economy in the United States. So while I certainly would \nnot call any of the other issues we are addressing here a distraction--\nthey are all important--I want to make certain my colleagues understand \nwe have to come together to make certain that Americans, individuals \nacross our country, can access a job, can feel secure in the job they \nalready have, and can have a sense that they have a future where they \nare employed or that if there is a need for a change in job, that \nopportunity exists. Job creation is something the Federal Government \ncannot do in and of itself, but the decisions we make here affect very \nmuch whether the private sector can have a level of confidence in the \ngeneral economy, a regulatory environment, and a Tax Code that is \nconducive toward the private sector, creating jobs in the United States \neconomy.\n  This matters, certainly from my point of view as a Member of the \nSenate, in that with job growth, with a growing economy, we are better \nable to pay down our national debt. In my view, if we are going to get \nwhat I consider the most serious circumstance our country faces today--\nthe deficit and the debt--under control, I don't foresee how that \nhappens without a good growing economy, putting Americans to work.\n  Of course, from an individual's point of view, it is important as a \ncomponent of our lives--something that is important to us, which is \nthat we figure out how to earn a living, put food on the table, save \nfor our kids' education, and save for retirement.\n  The issues being addressed in the Senate, across the country, and \nacross the street at the U.S. Supreme Court matter so much. We must not \nand cannot lose sight of the fact that we have to create an environment \nwhere jobs are front and center. We know the economic statistics--the \nunemployment rate is 8.2 percent and has been above 8 percent now for a \nlong time. The Presiding Officer in the Senate this morning and I have \nintroduced legislation the primary function of which is to create an \nentrepreneurial environment where startup companies can grow and \nprosper, and, in the process, they can put people to work. It is growth \nthat we need to continue to focus on. I appreciate the opportunity of \nworking in that manner with the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons, and \nothers, to see that we do that.\n  The topic I want to specifically address this morning is this. I was \nreading the Wall Street Journal last week, and this article caught my \nattention. I am of the view that for economic growth to occur--and \nespecially in communities across Kansas, the State I represent--we are \ngoing to have to have strong and viable community banks. There is a \nregulatory environment that makes that much more difficult. The \nheadline of the article the Wall Street Journal included that I want to \nspeak about--at least briefly--this morning is this: ``Small Banks Put \nUp `For Sale' Sign.''\n  The content of the article is very much about how small banks are now \nselling to other banks. The primary focus of this article is the reason \nthat is happening--``a growing number of tiny community banks are \ndeciding it's time to put out the `for sale' sign . . . many executives \nof these small lenders are frustrated by costly new regulations.''\n  It talks about banks in Iowa, in Ohio, in Texas, and it talks about a \nnumber of banks in which the bank or the individuals who own the bank \nnever had an intention of selling. This was their livelihood and what \nthey expected to pass on to the next generation, the next set of \nstockholders. Because of the regulatory environment, the article quotes \nthem talking about how it is no longer any fun. A 66-year-old CEO is \nquoted as saying:\n\n       I don't run a bank anymore. I run around trying to react to \n     regulation and, frankly, that's no fun. This is certainly \n     important for the people who own and run a bank, but it \n     matters in communities in my State that there is access to a \n     local lender, a relatively small financial institution that \n     knows its customers, and that the farmer, rancher, and small \n     business person have the opportunity\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\n     to develop a personal relationship with the individuals from \n     whom they are borrowing money.\n\n  I know from my own circumstances of growing up and living in rural \nKansas the likelihood of being able to get a loan from the community \nbank, the banker you know, who knows you, your ability, your \ncreditworthiness, and your trustworthiness, is a pretty special \nrelationship we have to be very careful we don't lose. If you are \ntrying to borrow money from somebody you don't know, it is a different \ncircumstance.\n  I want to highlight again this regulatory environment not just for \nbanks but for all businesses in which the decisions are being made that \nthey are not expanding--in this case, they are selling. The reality is \nthat has consequences to every American and every American family. Job \ncreation is going to be improved whenever we have a regulatory \nenvironment that encourages economic growth, not discourages it, and a \nregulatory environment that is certain. So much, particularly in the \nfinancial services industry, with banks and other financial lenders, \nthe uncertainty exists in large part because of the passage of Dodd-\nFrank, and now its implementation, the uncertainty of whether more \nregulations are coming and what they are going to say and do, and they \ncertainly can drive up the costs.\n  We certainly want to protect consumers, and we operate, in many \ninstances, in a regulated environment. But these regulations need \ncommon sense and need to take into account the specific circumstances \nparticularly of a small bank. My small banks in Kansas had virtually \nnothing to do with the financial debacle of 2008. Yet they are burdened \nwith the responsibility of complying with a huge new set of regulations \nthat resulted from the efforts to address the financial crisis of 2008.\n\n  In fact, this article, again, points this out regarding the board \nmeeting at this small bank:\n\n       The binder of information delivered to the bank's board \n     before the last monthly meeting included 419 pages of \n     information to be reviewed.\n\n  Banks more and more are having to put people on the payroll--\ncompliance officers--as compared to those kinds of circumstances in \nwhich the bank is making loans. The cost of doing business and the cost \nof credit increases, and access to credit has diminished, and that is \ndiminishing the chance for job creation.\n  One of the items under Dodd-Frank was the creation of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. This hit me while I was visiting one of my \nbanks in Kansas. They told me the CFPB called and said they were \nsending 12 examiners and lawyers to come spend more than a month in \nthis small bank, examining the bank. Again, these are banks that had \nlittle to do with the financial collapse of 2008. Almost without \nexception our community banks--certainly in Kansas--didn't make loans \nto people who were unlikely to repay the loans, and they didn't make \nloans to people who had no ability to repay the loans or without \ngetting proper documentation and seeking the necessary creditworthiness \nof that borrower before making that decision. Yet the burden of these \nregulations falls directly upon them.\n  And while I guess I am speaking in support of trying to change this \nfor the benefit of the bankers, who this is going to benefit, if we \nwere to change the regulatory environment, is the person who wants to \nborrow money, who wants a buy an automobile or buy a home or who wants \nto buy a piece of commercial property. Yet they go to the banks in \ncommunities across Kansas and are told that because of the new \nregulatory environment, this is a loan we cannot make.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has 12 examiners and \n2 lawyers, is soon to visit a small bank in Kansas and intends to be \nthere for more than a month. The regulations the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau--well, they haven't created their regulations yet. \nThey are auditing a bank before their regulations are in place. My \nreaction, when the banker told me that, was I need to go back to \nWashington and see if I can do something, perhaps through the \nappropriations process. I am the ranking Republican member on the \nAppropriations subcommittee for financial institutions and financial \nservices. I thought we need to rein in the CFPB through the \nappropriations process to get them kind of within their sphere of where \nthey belong, in a much more commonsense, less intrusive way.\n  It occurred to me that I don't have that ability. I can be a member \nof the Appropriations Committee and a Member of the Senate, and I can \nbe the lead Republican on the subcommittee responsible for financial \nservices, but because of the way the CFPB was created, its money is an \nautomatic draft from the Federal Reserve. We, as Members of the Senate \nand Congress in general, have no input into the level of funding of an \nagency that will have a dramatic effect upon the financial institutions \nof this country and, therefore, the individuals, the consumers those \nfinancial institutions serve.\n  In addition to that, there is only one person who administrates the \nprogram, who is the administrator of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. Unlike the CFTC and the SEC, where there is a commission and a \nboard in which there is a collective decision made, there is only an \nadministrator. I have introduced legislation and we have had this \nconversation on the floor before. I encourage my colleagues to look at \nthis legislation that would reformulate the way the CFPB is managed and \ndirected and would once again give Congress the opportunity to have \ninput into how the CFPB functions.\n  I would never try to explain to Americans or to Kansans how great \nCongress does its job, but I do know the fact we are subject to \nelection--the will of the people of America--every 6 years gives us the \nopportunity to have the input of the people into the administration and \ninto the regulatory process that is so burdensome now upon so many \nbusinesses, including our financial institutions.\n  So my effort today is to highlight once again what we do in \nWashington, DC, and in this case particularly what the administration \ndoes today--what the Obama administration does today and what \nadministrations have done in the past in regard to regulations--very \nmuch has a consequence upon whether Americans are going to live in a \ncountry with a growing economy in which there is a sense of security \nand people know what to expect or whether they are going to live in a \ncountry in which a business owner--a small business man or woman in \nKansas or across the country--is holding back from hiring employees \nbecause they do not know what next is going to come from their own \ngovernment in regard to regulations which are costly, drive up the cost \nof being in business, and reduce the chances of expansion in our \neconomy, which reduce the chances that Americans can have good, solid \nemployment opportunities.\n  I have two daughters graduating from college--one a couple of years \nago and one this year--and the job market certainly is important to me \nas a parent and the ability for a young American to find a job and to \npursue that job so they are able to pay back the cost of their \neducation. That is something we need to seriously take into account. \nWhile I assume we are going to have a conversation again in the Senate \nthis week on the cost of borrowing money for students and student loan \ninterest rates, we ought not forget the most important thing we can do \nto help our students once they graduate, which is to make sure the \neconomy is such that employment opportunities are available. It doesn't \nmatter what the interest rate is if they can't find a job.\n  So we need to make certain we fulfill our responsibilities to the \nAmerican people to see that the economy and job creation is front and \ncenter for the benefit of every American and for the benefit of our \ncountry's deficit. It is so important we create a growing economy.\n  I, again, would highlight how important it is for us to get the \nregulations under control and particularly criticize the circumstance \nin which legislation that does not pass Congress somehow takes effect \nbecause the executive branch concludes they can do by Executive order \nor by rule or regulation what we refuse to do. It is time for Congress \nto reassert its role, and it is time to make certain that in pursuing \nthat role we create an environment in which jobs are front and center \nand the\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\nAmerican people can all pursue the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the Senate \ntoday, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I didn't hear all the remarks of my colleague \nfrom Kansas, but I think what I have to say will follow on directly.\n  I saw a prominent news magazine, the cover of which had a likeness of \nPresident Obama, and the title was ``The Imperial Presidency'' or ``The \nImperial President,'' and the theme of it was this President seems to \nbelieve that by Executive order or Executive action he can simply do \nwhat he wants to do irrespective of whether the Congress has passed a \nlaw authorizing it or has in some other way directed the President to \ncarry out a particular policy.\n  When the President takes his oath of office to see that the laws of \nthe country are faithfully executed, that is a requirement of his job. \nOur three-branch government has the legislative branch and the \nPresident jointly deciding what the law is to be, when Congress passes \nthe law and the President signs it into law. It then has the President \nrequired to execute those laws.\n  Now, he doesn't do it personally, of course. He does it with the \nDepartment of Justice. If it is something related to our national \nparks, then it would be the Department of the Interior, and so on. But \nthe Department of Justice has a big role to play in this, as does the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in respect to immigration laws because \nthe Department of Homeland Security has now taken over all of the \nimmigration functions, and that relates to customs, to issuing visas \nand, of course, enforcing the laws against illegal immigration as well.\n  So it is not up to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity or the Attorney General or the President to decide whether to \nenforce a law of the country. That is their responsibility. Then the \nSupreme Court resolves differences about the meanings of the statutes, \ntheir application, and whether they are constitutional.\n  Earlier this week--yesterday--the Supreme Court determined the \nconstitutionality of a law the State of Arizona had passed to deal with \nthe problem of illegal immigration in my State of Arizona. It is a \nserious problem there. About half of all the people who cross the \nborder do so in the Tucson sector, and the results of that on Arizona \nhave been devastating over the years: the damage to the environment, \ncreating forest fires; the problem of the people who try to cross the \nborder in the summer and end up dying in the desert because of its very \nharsh environment; the people who are brought across the border by \nunscrupulous coyotes, they are called--the smugglers--who then badly \nmistreat them, hold them hostage from their families, perhaps in Mexico \nor Central America and brutally mistreat them in many cases; the \nproblems of crime that law enforcement has to deal with, the \nhospitalization and medical treatment they are required to receive \nunder the law. All of these things have had a dramatic negative impact \non my State.\n  As a result, the State legislature said: To the extent the Federal \nGovernment is not enforcing the law in our State, we will try to help \nfill that gap in cooperation and coordination with the Federal \nGovernment. So they passed S.B. 1070. A key feature of that, which was \nthe cooperation between law enforcement, was upheld by the Supreme \nCourt. But what has been the Obama administration's reaction to that? \nThe Obama administration has reacted by saying: Well, we don't like \nyour ruling and, therefore, we are simply not going to cooperate with \nthe State of Arizona as we have been in the past or any other State \nthat has laws like Arizona, even if you, the Supreme Court, say it is \nconstitutional.\n\n  The petulance and the arrogance of this are something the American \npeople have to judge, but from a law enforcement perspective, to me, \nthis suggests the administration is creating some very serious \nproblems. It was one thing for the administration to say, as they did \nlast week, as to the 800,000 or 900,000 students primarily who came \nhere because their parents brought them here illegally, we are going to \nfind a way, in effect, to suspend their deportation so they can go to \nschool or work here; we are just not going to apply the law to them. \nBut it is quite another for it to say: By the way, we are going to \ntreat all the other illegal immigrants here the same way--the 10 \nmillion to 12 million people who have been in the United States for a \nwhile, those who crossed the border some time ago.\n  In effect, that is what the administration has said. Even if local \nlaw enforcement, such as the Phoenix Police Department, has the right \nto stop someone they see weaving down the road in the manner of a drunk \ndriver, and they stop that individual and determine they are driving \nwhile intoxicated and then ask to see their driver's license; and if \nthe individual cannot produce an Arizona driver's license--which is \nalready a violation of Arizona law today--but if, for example, the \nindividual says: Here is my Matricula card from the Mexican Embassy, \nthat may be reason for the officer to believe that individual is not \nhere legally.\n  So in addition to driving while intoxicated and not having a valid \nArizona driver's license, the police officer, who now has reason to \nbelieve that individual may not be an American citizen, ordinarily then \nwould take that individual's name, call it in to a Federal database--I \nthink it is up in Vermont or New Hampshire--and there is verification \nthat either the individual is or is not in the United States legally. \nIf the person is not here legally and hasn't been convicted or accused \nof a major crime, they are turned over to Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, ICE, which is the part of Homeland Security that is \nsupposed to take these illegal immigrants and decide what to do with \nthem. In most cases, they are simply removed from the United States or \ndeported.\n  But now the administration is saying we are not going to do that \nanymore. We don't even want to know whether the individual is an \nillegal immigrant. We are not going to check, and we are not going to \nallow you access to the database to check. Up to now, the Phoenix \nPolice Department or the Maricopa County or Cochise County Sheriff \ncould call up the database and say: We have the name of an individual; \nis this person legal.\n  The administration is now saying it is not even going to allow \nArizona to check. So, Mr. President, this is a condition which cannot \nbe allowed to stand. Where the administration is not enforcing the \nlaws, the Congress is going to have to take what action we need to take \nto ensure the President enforces the laws, as he is sworn to do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                         Answering Allegations\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to answer allegations made by \nthe Washington Post in a front-page story in yesterday's edition. Here \nis the story: ``High-level Talks, then Changes to Holdings.''\n  First, I want to say I have great respect for the Washington Post. In \nmany ways, the Post is a national treasure. But even great newspapers \nmake mistakes, and in yesterday's story they made assumptions that are \nsimply wrong.\n  The story said my wife and I shifted savings in her retirement \naccounts from mutual funds to lower risk money market accounts on \nAugust 14, 2007. That is true. They showed we made those changes a day \nafter a call from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to me. That is also \ntrue. But their suggestion the two are related is absolutely false.\n  They have made the same error in logic we studied in college. The \ncase and faulty logic involved an observer who noted people were \nfainting and street pavement was melting. That led the observer to \nconclude that melting pavement caused people to faint. Of course, that \nwas wrong. It was 106 degrees outside. The proper conclusion was that \nheat was causing the pavement to melt and people to faint. That error \nin logic was about causality, and that is precisely the error the \nWashington Post made in their story with respect to me.\n  What the Washington Post missed in their graphic--and to be fair to \nthem, they largely had the correct context in the story. If you read \nthe whole story, it was fairly balanced. What was not\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nbalanced was the graphics that accompanied that story.\n  Let me show the graphic. This is from the Washington Post of \nyesterday.\n  Here is a picture of me. Quite a nice picture. I appreciate that. It \nsays:\n\n       Senator Conrad, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     was in contact with Paulson about the Nation's economy during \n     the crisis.\n\n  That is true. They then show a timeline with only two points on the \ntimeline. They show that on August 13 Secretary Paulson called me at \n4:30, and they show the next day, August 14, that my wife and I shifted \nfrom her retirement accounts money from mutual funds to lower risk \nmoney market funds. That is true.\n  What they have not shown on the timeline is what was happening in the \nprevious days. So let's go back to the Friday before. Here is what \nhappened on the Friday before.\n  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 200 points within minutes of \nthe opening bell and closed the day down nearly 400 points. That is not \non the timeline of the Washington Post. If they were going to be fair--\nand I don't begrudge them writing the story. I think if I were the \neditor I would certainly have written the story too. It certainly has \nappeal. Here are Members of Congress talking to people in influential \npositions and then changing their holdings. But to be fair, they have \nto provide the context within which those decisions were made.\n  The context within which my wife and I made our decisions were pretty \nclear. The Friday before, the market dropped nearly 400 points.\n  What the Washington Post also didn't put in their timeline is their \nheadline on that Friday. ``Credit Crunch in U.S. Upends Global \nMarkets.'' In that story the Friday before, they showed in the weeks \nleading up to our decision to diversify our investments in my wife's \nretirement account the market had dropped in 2 days more than 500 \npoints, leading up then to the Friday where the markets dropped almost \n400 points.\n  The Washington Post in their story also didn't put on the timeline \nwhat the headlines were in their own paper on the weekend leading up to \nour decision to make these changes.\n  This is just one of the headlines: ``Looking for Footing on Shaky \nGround,'' talking about the turmoil we saw globally. The truth is that \nwhat made my wife and me decide over the weekend to shift some of her \nretirement accounts from mutual funds to less risky money market \naccounts was what was happening in the markets themselves. That is what \nled us to make these decisions.\n  The Paulson call was not about markets. Notes from my staff indicate \nSecretary Paulson was calling a number of members about the importance \nof raising the debt ceiling. The Secretary of Treasury was not calling \nme to give me stock market tips. He wasn't talking to me about the \nstock market. He was talking to me about the need for a debt limit \nincrease.\n  I wish to say clearly and unequivocally, to my friends at the \nWashington Post and anybody who read the story, the call from Secretary \nPaulson had nothing--nothing--do with my wife's and my decision over \nthe weekend to shift some of her assets into less risky money market \naccounts. Those decisions had everything to do with what was happening \nin the marketplace itself, which was widely reported, even on the pages \nof the Washington Post. What was happening in the markets was readily \navailable to every investor. We were not shifting my wife's retirement \naccounts based on some secret inside information.\n  The Washington Post headline: ``Credit Crunch in U.S. Upends Global \nMarkets.'' The stock market in 2 days, and the weeks leading up, \ndropped 500 points. On the Friday before the decisions we made over the \nweekend, the market dropped almost 400 points in 1 day. The Washington \nPost had a big story showing the Dow Jones industrial average dropped \n200 points within minutes of opening and dropped almost 400 points for \nthe day. Why didn't they put that in the timeline if they wanted to be \nfair? I didn't ask them not to run the story. I asked them to put in \nthe context within which the decisions were made. Be fair.\n  The fact is there is nothing Mr. Paulson could have said to me about \nmarket risk that would have been more persuasive than the drop of \nalmost 400 points in the market the previous Friday. That, along with \nthe 500-point drop that had occurred several weeks before, provided all \nthe motivation my wife and I needed to make a decision to move some of \nher retirement assets to lower risked investments.\n  To the Washington Post: I respect you. I have had a very good \nrelationship with you for a long period of time. But your story was \nunfair to my family, it was unfair to me, and fundamentally it was \nunfair to your readers because the graphics you supplied with the story \nfailed to provide a full or fair timeline and the full context that led \nto our decision. In fairness, if you read the whole story, much of the \ncontext is there. But the graphics--which, of course, is what most \npeople are drawn to--have none of the context and don't have a timeline \nthat in any way is fair.\n  Finally, I just wish to say, I am retiring. This is not going to \naffect me for the future. But the notion that Members of Congress \nshould just stick with whatever investment decisions they made when \nthey began investing or be accused of trading on insider information \nis, to me, absurd. Our trades should be public knowledge, and they are. \nHow did the Washington Post know about these trades? Because my wife \nand I reported each and every one of them in our financial disclosure.\n  So trades of Members should be public--absolutely--and they are. The \nWashington Post and others should monitor for evidence of insider \ntrading, and they do. But they should also provide context to their \nreaders so they can fairly judge if any of us have taken action with \nour investments that are dishonorable. I have not, and that is the \ntruth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                       Prescription Drug Epidemic\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, since we first began consideration of the \nFDA bill, I have stood on this floor again and again to highlight the \nimportance of an amendment I offered to this legislation that is very \nsignificant to my fellow West Virginians and all Americans.\n  This amendment would put tighter control on drugs containing a \nsubstance known as hydrocodone, a highly addictive prescription \npainkiller that is destroying communities across this country and \nleaving families devastated by abuse and addiction.\n  It was a proud moment for me when the Senate came together across \nparty lines on May 23 and unanimously adopted my amendment to \nreclassify hydrocodone as a schedule II substance from a schedule III. \nIn practical terms, this means those who are using hydrocodone for \nillegitimate reasons would have a harder time getting their hands on \nit.\n  I cannot tell you how much this amendment means to the people of West \nVirginia and to every law enforcement group fighting the war on drugs \nacross this Nation who believe very strongly that access to hydrocodone \nwould give them a powerful tool in combating prescription drug abuse. \nSo it pains me to stand here following last night's vote to move \nforward with the passage of the FDA bill, which did not contain this \nimportant amendment. That is because the influence of special interest \ngroups suppressed the voices of the people--not just in the State of \nWest Virginia but in Delaware and all across the country--who are \nbegging us to do something about the prescription drug abuse epidemic.\n  According to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, \nprescription drug abuse is the fastest growing drug problem in the \nUnited States, and it is claiming the lives of thousands of Americans \nevery year. Prescription drugs are responsible for about 75 percent of \nall drug-related deaths in the United States and 90 percent in West \nVirginia. These narcotic painkillers claim the lives of more Americans \nthan heroin and cocaine combined.\n  But the groups opposed to my amendment have a huge financial stake in \nkeeping these pills as accessible as possible, and I understand that. \nThat is why my amendment was stripped from the FDA bill we advanced \nlast night.\n  High-powered and well-funded lobbyists may have gotten their victory \nthis time around, but I can assure you I will\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nnot give up this fight. On a daily basis, I am hearing from my \nconstituents in West Virginia and all around this country who are \ncounting on us to do something about the prescription drug epidemic \nravaging their communities.\n  Since I offered this amendment, I have heard from so many West \nVirginians who have seen a ray of hope because we might be able to do \nsomething about this problem. I will not pretend it will solve it \ncompletely, but it is sure a good step in the right direction. So I am \ncoming to the floor to share the stories of the people of West \nVirginia, in the hopes of bringing people together around a solution to \nthis terrible problem.\n  This is from Sheila from Charleston, who sent me this letter in \nsupport of my amendment after losing a close family member:\n\n       Please continue to fight the drug companies and pharmacies \n     regarding this issue. Our family in the last two months lost \n     a beloved family member to prescription drug overdose. He was \n     a promising young man that lost his life because of addiction \n     to pain medication.\n       Our family continues to be devastated, wondering how did \n     this happen. He came from a highly-educated family that was \n     involved in his treatment and cared deeply for him. His \n     family spent $100,000+ in his recovery, but it was all too \n     easy for him to obtain legal prescriptions.\n       What truly makes it more painful is he was showing signs of \n     overcoming his five-year battle.\n       We are not blaming anyone but the system. We know we are \n     each responsible for our own actions. I have thought for \n     years that our health care system is far behind in technology \n     and record keeping for doctor shopping and prescription \n     dispensing. Please understand I am very much opposed to more \n     government in our personal lives, however this is much needed \n     in the medical arena.\n       Please continue to fight this enormous battle for us.\n\n  That letter could have come from our constituents or any \nCongressman's home district from anywhere in this great country. The \nfact is I don't know of a person--whether it be in the Senate, our \ncolleagues in Congress or anywhere in America--who hasn't been affected \nby the abuse of legal prescription drugs used in the wrong way. It \ntouches everyone's life. It is of epidemic proportion.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again. I understand that \nlimiting access to illegitimate uses of hydrocodone pills doesn't \nnecessarily fit into the model of selling more product, but there are \ntimes when even the best business plan can be altered while staying \nsuccessful. Certainly, one of those times is when the health of our \ncountry and the public good is at stake.\n  In fact, the Huntington Herald Dispatch, the second largest newspaper \nin my State, located right on the border between West Virginia and \nOhio, describes why this amendment is so important.\n\n       Congress is missing out on an opportunity to close the \n     spigot at least partway on the large volumes of commonly \n     abused prescription drugs that flood the country and harm so \n     many Americans.\n\n  In 2010, the most recent year for which data is available, a study \nshowed there were 28,310 recorded instances of toxic exposures from \nhydrocodone. The same study showed that 24 million individuals have \nadmitted to abusing hydrocodone drugs for nonmedical purposes--\nunbelievable.\n  A different study, put out by the Centers for Disease Control in \nNovember, showed that more than 40 people die every day from overdoses \ninvolving narcotic pain relievers such as hydrocodone. Isn't it worth \ndoing something to get the pills out of the wrong hands?\n  My amendment may not have gone into this bill yesterday, but it is \nnot going to go away--I think we all know that--and I am determined to \nsee this through to the end.\n  While the people of West Virginia, Delaware, and elsewhere are \ndisappointed in the outcome of the hydrocodone amendment, I do wish to \nhighlight one measure that was included in the legislation that we are \nproud of and is important to me and everybody in this body. It would \nmake the sale and distribution of synthetic marijuana and other \nsynthetic substances, known as bath salts, illegal by placing them on \nthe list of schedule I controlled substances under the Controlled \nSubstances Act. These drugs are also taking a terrible toll on all our \nStates, and I was proud to cosponsor this provision with my friend \nSenator Schumer. I want to thank Senator Schumer for his leadership in \ngetting this passed.\n  Finally, I wish to close with one more story from my home State of \nWest Virginia as a way to remind everyone what I am fighting for and \nwhy. This letter comes from Rebecca, a woman who started a group called \nMothers Against Prescription Drug Abuse as a way to deal with the \nterrible realities that have accompanied her son's 5-year battle with \nprescription drug abuse:\n\n       Jamie was a great kid growing up. He played basketball, \n     football, and baseball. When he was 14 years old his team won \n     the state tournament and went all the way to Wisconsin to \n     play in Regionals. Jamie was always helping others and had \n     such a kind heart. . .\n       When Jamie got out of school he married his high school \n     sweetheart and was employed in the mines.\n       After that he just went downhill. He began abusing \n     prescription drugs. For two years I tried everything to get \n     help for him and tried to get him to stop. Things only got \n     worse. He lost his wife, his home, his truck and then his \n     freedom.\n       My story is typical to so many families out there who are \n     struggling with loved ones that are addicted. They just want \n     someone to listen. They need to be able to reach out to \n     someone who understands the nightmare that they go through \n     daily, and know that they are not alone. The addict is not \n     the only one who suffers. The family members carry around \n     guilt, sadness, shame, anger, hopelessness, fear, anxiety, \n     etc. . . . I could go on and on about how bad this experience \n     has been for me and how it has not stopped.\n       I will continue to fight prescription drug abuse for as \n     long as I have a breath in my body. I will not give up on my \n     son or anyone else who is addicted. Things need to change \n     within our system. We cannot continue to allow just anyone to \n     have access to prescription pain medicine. Parents need to be \n     educated while their children are still at home. Communities \n     need to be aware of crimes (drug dealers) and report them. \n     Doctors need to stop prescribing pain pills to people on the \n     street, and they need to be held accountable.\n       What happened to our medical ethics when people who need \n     pain medicine for a while are given strong addictive pain \n     medicine, only to have to keep coming back to the doctor over \n     and over again for refills? Is it greed that is behind the \n     beginning of this growing epidemic? Doctors definitely profit \n     from the addict's return visits, as well as the \n     pharmaceutical companies that make the medicine. We know \n     there is a problem but what are people going to do about it? \n     I am doing what I can, but is it enough? Will you help?\n\n  For Rebecca and all the other mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers \nout there who are pleading for help, we owe it to them to get this \namendment agreed to.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of FLORIDA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4606-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4606-S4610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF ROBIN S.

Under the previous order, the time until noon \nwill be equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Republican efforts to shutdown Senate \nconfirmations of qualified judicial nominees who have bipartisan \nsupport do not help the American people. This is a shortsighted policy \nat a time when the judicial vacancy rate remains almost twice what it \nwas at this point in the first term of President Bush. Judicial \nvacancies during the last few years have been at historically high \nlevels. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal judgeships is currently \nvacant. Their talk of shutting down confirmations for consensus and \nqualified circuit court nominees is not helping the overburdened \nFederal courts to which Americans turn for justice.\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\n  In a letter dated June 20, 2012, the president of the American Bar \nAssociation urged Senator Reid and Senator McConnell to work together \nto schedule votes on the nominations of William Kayatta, Judge Robert \nBacharach and Richard Taranto, three consensus, qualified circuit court \nnominees awaiting Senate confirmation so that they may serve the \nAmerican people. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of his letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, June 20, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell:  \n     Amid concerns that the judicial confirmation process is about \n     to fall victim to presidential election year politics through \n     the invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule,'' I am writing on \n     behalf of the American Bar Association to reiterate our grave \n     concern for the longstanding number of judicial vacancies on \n     Article III courts and to urge you to schedule floor votes on \n     three pending, noncontroversial circuit court nominees before \n     July and on district court nominees who have strong \n     bipartisan support on a weekly basis thereafter.\n       Three of the four circuit court nominees pending on the \n     Senate floor are consensus nominees who have received \n     overwhelming approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n     Both William Kayatta, Jr. of Maine, nominated to the First \n     Circuit, and Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma, nominated to the \n     Tenth Circuit, have the staunch support of their Republican \n     senators. Richard Taranto, nominated to the Federal Circuit, \n     enjoys strong bipartisan support, including the endorsement \n     of noted conservative legal scholars. All three nominees also \n     have stellar professional qualifications and each has been \n     rated unanimously ``well-qualified'' by the ABA's Standing \n     Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n       As you know, the ``Thurmond Rule'' is neither a rule nor a \n     clearly defined event. While the ABA takes no position on \n     what invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule'' actually means or \n     whether it represents wise policy, recent news stories have \n     cast it as a precedent under which the Senate, after a \n     specified date in a presidential election year, ceases to \n     vote on nominees to the federal circuit courts of appeals. We \n     note that there has been no consistently observed date at \n     which this has occurred during the presidential election \n     years from 1980 to 2008. With regard to the past three \n     election years, the last circuit court nominees were \n     confirmed in June during 2004 and 2008 and in July during \n     2000. In deference to these historical cut-off dates and \n     because of our conviction that the Senate has a continuing \n     constitutional duty to act with due diligence to reduce the \n     dangerously high vacancy rate that is adversely affecting our \n     federal judiciary, we exhort you to schedule votes on these \n     three outstanding circuit court nominees this month.\n       We also urge you to continue to work together to move \n     consensus district court nominees to the floor for a vote \n     throughout the rest of the session, lest the vacancy crisis \n     worsens in the waning months of the 112th Congress. With five \n     new vacancies arising this month and an additional five \n     announced for next month, this is not just a possibility; it \n     is a certainty, absent your continued commitment to the \n     federal judiciary and steady action on nominees.\n       Thank you for your past efforts and for your consideration \n     of our views on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Wm. T. (Bill) Robinson III,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. He writes:\n\n       Amid concerns that the judicial confirmation process is \n     about to fall victim to presidential election year politics \n     through the invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule,'' I am writing \n     on behalf of the American Bar Association to reiterate our \n     grave concern for the longstanding number of judicial \n     vacancies on Article III courts and to urge you to schedule \n     floor votes on three pending, noncontroversial circuit court \n     nominees before July and on district court nominees who have \n     strong bipartisan support on a weekly basis thereafter.\n\n  He observes that ``the Senate has a continuing constitutional duty to \nact with due diligence to reduce the dangerously high vacancy rate that \nis adversely affecting our federal judiciary.''\n  There is no good reason that the Senate should not vote on consensus \ncircuit court nominees thoroughly vetted, considered and voted on by \nthe Judiciary Committee. There is no reason the Senate cannot vote on \nthe nomination of William Kayatta of Maine to the First Circuit, a \nnominee strongly supported by both of Maine's Republican Senators and \nreported nearly unanimously by the Committee 2 months ago. This is the \nsame person who Chief Justice John Roberts recommended to Kenneth Starr \nfor a position in the Justice Department.\n  There is no reason the Senate cannot vote on the nomination of Judge \nRobert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, who was supported by \nSenator Coburn during Committee consideration, and also by the State's \nother Republican Senator, Senator Inhofe. Senator Coburn said that \nJudge Bacharach would make a great nominee for a Republican president. \nSo why is the Republican leadership playing politics with his \nnomination?\n  There is also no reason the Senate cannot vote on Richard Taranto's \nnomination to the Federal Circuit. He was reported almost unanimously \nby voice vote nearly 3 months ago, and is supported by conservatives \nsuch as Robert Bork and Paul Clement.\n  And the one circuit court nominee who was reported out of Committee \nwith a split rollcall vote--Judge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey--should \nnot have been controversial, as seen by the bipartisan support she has \nreceived from New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris Christie.\n  Each of these circuit court nominees has been rated unanimously well \nqualified by the nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \njudiciary, the highest possible rating. These are not controversial \nnominees. They are qualified and should be considered as consensus \nnominees and confirmed. Senate Republicans are blocking consent to vote \non superbly qualified circuit court nominees with strong bipartisan \nsupport. This is a new and damaging application of the Thurmond Rule.\n  It is hard to see how this new application of the Thurmond Rule is \nreally anything more than another name for the stalling tactics we have \nseen for months and years. I have yet to hear any good reason why we \nshould not continue to vote on well-qualified, consensus nominees, just \nas we did up until September of the last two Presidential election \nyears. I have yet to hear a good explanation why we cannot work to \nsolve the problem of high vacancies for the American people. I will \ncontinue to work with the Senate leadership to try to confirm as many \nof President Obama's qualified judicial nominees as possible to fill \nthe many judicial vacancies that burden our courts and the American \npeople across the country.\n  Last week, I spoke about the announcement from Senate Republican \nleadership that they would be shutting down the confirmation process \nfor qualified and consensus circuit court nominees for the rest of the \nyear. As I noted, Senate Republicans have become the party of ``no''--\nno help for the American people, no to jobs, no to economic recovery \nand no to judges to provide Americans with justice in their Federal \ncourts. Although the public announcement that they would be blocking \nqualified and consensus circuit court nominees is recent, the truth is \nthat Senate Republicans have been obstructing President Obama's \njudicial nominees since the beginning of his Presidency, beginning with \ntheir filibuster of his first nominee.\n  Senate Republicans used to insist that filibustering of judicial \nnominations was unconstitutional. The Constitution has not changed but \nas soon as President Obama was elected, they reversed course and \nfilibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination. Judge \nDavid Hamilton of Indiana was a widely respected 15-year veteran of the \nFederal bench nominated to the Seventh Circuit and was supported by \nSenator Dick Lugar, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. They \ndelayed his confirmation for 5 months. Senate Republicans then \nproceeded to obstruct and delay just about every circuit court nominee \nof this President, filibustering nine of them. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina to the Fourth \nCircuit for 11 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Jane Stranch \nof Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit for 10 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Ray Lohier of New York to the Second Circuit for \n7 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Scott Matheson of Utah to \nthe Tenth Circuit and Judge James Wynn, Jr. of North Carolina to the \nFourth Circuit for 6 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Andre \nDavis of Maryland to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Henry Floyd of\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\nSouth Carolina to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Stephanie Thacker of West \nVirginia to the Fourth Circuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia to the Ninth Circuit for 5 months. They delayed confirmation \nof Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge \nBeverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge Mary Murguia \nof Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Bernice Donald of Tennessee to \nthe Sixth Circuit, Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth \nCircuit, Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania to the Third Circuit, \nJudge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, Judge Denny \nChin of New York to the Second Circuit, and Judge Chris Droney of \nConnecticut to the Second Circuit for 4 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Paul Watford of California to the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Morgan \nChristen of Alaska to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Stephen Higginson of \nLouisiana to the Fifth Circuit, Judge Gerard Lynch of New York to the \nSecond Circuit, Judge Susan Carney of Connecticut to the Second \nCircuit, and Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio to the Federal Circuit for \n3 months.\n  As a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService confirms, the median time circuit nominees have had to wait \nbefore a Senate vote has skyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's \nnominees to 132 days for President Obama's circuit court nominees. This \nis the result of Republican foot dragging and obstruction. In most \ncases, Senate Republicans have been delaying and stalling for no good \nreason. How else do you explain the filibuster of the nomination of \nJudge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit who was \nultimately confirmed 99-0? And how else do you explain the needless \nobstruction of Judge Denny Chin of New York to the Second Circuit, who \nwas filibustered for 4 months before he was confirmed 98-0?\n  The only change in their practices is that Senate Republicans have \nfinally acknowledged that they are seeking to shut down the \nconfirmation process for qualified and consensus circuit court \nnominees. Three of the five circuit court judges finally confirmed this \nyear after months of unnecessary delays and a filibuster should have \nbeen confirmed last year. The other two circuit court nominees \nconfirmed this year were both subjected to stalling and partisan \nfilibusters, which were thankfully unsuccessful.\n  The American people need to understand that Senate Republicans are \nstalling and filibustering judicial nominees supported by their home \nState Republican Senators. Just consider the states I have already \nmentioned as having circuit nominees supported by their home State \nRepublican Senators unnecessarily stalled--Indiana, North Carolina, \nUtah, South Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. Just 2 weeks ago we needed \nto overcome a filibuster to confirm Justice Andrew Hurwitz of the \nArizona Supreme Court to the Ninth Circuit despite the strong support \nof Senators Jon Kyl and John McCain.\n  This year started with the Majority Leader having to file cloture to \nget an up-or-down vote on Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the \nEleventh Circuit even though he was strongly supported by his \nRepublican home State Senator. And every single one of these circuit \nnominees for whom the Majority Leader was forced to file cloture this \nyear was rated unanimously well qualified by the nonpartisan ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest possible \nrating. And every one of them was nominated to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy. So when I hear some Senate Republicans say they are \nnow invoking the Thurmond Rule and have decided they are not going to \nallow President Obama's judicial nominees to be considered, I wonder \nhow the American people are supposed to be able to tell the difference \nfrom how they have been obstructing for the last 3\\1/2\\ years.\n\n  Personal attacks on me, taking quotes out of context, trying to \nrepackage their own actions as if following the Thurmond Rule or what \nthey seek to dub the Leahy rule do nothing to help the American people \nwho are seeking justice in our Federal courts. I am willing to defend \nmy record but that is beside the point. The harm to the American people \nis what matters. Republicans are insisting on being the party of no \neven when it comes to judicial nominees who home State Republican \nSenators support.\n  As Chairman and when I served as the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have worked with Senate Republicans to consider judicial \nnominees well into Presidential election years. I have taken steps to \nmake the confirmation process more transparent and fair. I have ensured \nthat the President consults with home State Senators before submitting \na nominee. I have opened up what had been a secretive blue slip process \nto prevent abuses. All the while I have protected the rights of the \nminority, of Republican Senators. If Republicans want to talk about the \nLeahy rules, those are the practices I have followed. And I have been \nconsistent. I hold hearings at the same pace and under the same \nprocedures whether the President nominating is a Democrat or a \nRepublican. Others cannot say that.\n  And what were the results? In the last two Presidential election \nyears, we were able to bring the number of judicial vacancies down to \nthe lowest levels in the past 20 years. In 2004, at end of President \nBush's first term, vacancies were reduced to 28, not the 74 at which \nthey are today. In 2008, in the last year of President Bush's second \nterm, we again worked to fill vacancies and got them down to 34, less \nthan half of what they are today. In 2004, 25 nominees were confirmed \nfrom June 1 to the Presidential election. In 2008, 22 nominees were \nconfirmed between June 1 and the Presidential election. So far, since \nJune 1 of this year, only 4 judges have been confirmed and all required \nthe majority leader to file cloture to end Republican filibusters.\n  In 2004, a Presidential election year, the Senate confirmed five \ncircuit court nominees of a Republican President that had been reported \nby the committee that year. We have confirmed only two circuit court \nnominees that have been reported by the committee this year, and we had \nto overcome Republican filibusters in both cases. By this date in 2004 \nthe Senate had already confirmed 35 of President Bush's circuit court \nnominees. So far, the Senate has only been allowed to consider and \nconfirm 30 of President Obama's circuit court nominees--five fewer, 17 \npercent fewer--while higher numbers of vacancies remain, and yet the \nSenate Republican leadership demands an artificial shutdown on \nconfirmation of qualified, consensus nominees for no good reason.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service recently released a \nreport confirming that judicial nominees continue to be confirmed in \nthe Presidential election years. The exceptions are when Republicans \nshut down the process because the President is a Democrat. In five of \nthe last eight Presidential election years, the Senate has confirmed at \nleast 22 circuit and district court nominees after May 31. The notable \nexceptions were during the last years of President Clinton's two terms \nin 1996 and 2000 when Senate Republicans would not allow confirmations \nto continue. In the 1996 session, Senate Republicans did not allow any \ncircuit court nominees to be confirmed at all. Vacancies at the end of \nthe Clinton years stood at 75 at the end of 1996 and 67 at the end of \n2000. The third exception was in 1988, at the end of President Reagan's \nPresidency, when vacancies were at 28. According to CRS, the Senate \nconfirmed 32 judges after May 31 in 1980; 28 in 1984; 31 in 1992; 28 in \n2004 at the end of President George W. Bush's first term; and 22 after \nMay 31 in 2008 at the end of President Bush's second term. So far since \nMay 31 of this year, only 4 judges have been confirmed and all required \nthe Majority Leader to file cloture to end Republican filibusters.\n  In the past five Presidential election years, Senate Democrats have \nnever denied an up-or-down vote to any circuit court nominee of a \nRepublican President who received bipartisan support in the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is what Senate Republicans are now seeking to do by \nblocking votes on William Kayatta, Judge Bacharach and Richard Taranto. \nIn fact, during the last 20 years, only four circuit nominees reported \nwith bipartisan support have been denied an up-or-down vote during \nPresidential election year by the Senate; all four were nominated by\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\nPresident Clinton and blocked by Senate Republicans. While Senate \nDemocrats have been willing to work with Republican Presidents to \nconfirm circuit court nominees with bipartisan support, Senate \nRepublicans have repeatedly obstructed the nominees of Democratic \nPresidents. In the previous five Presidential election years, a total \nof 13 circuit court nominees have been confirmed after May 31. Not \nsurprisingly, 12 of the 13 were Republican nominees. Clearly, this is a \none-way street in favor of Republican Presidents' nominees.\n  Senate Republicans are fond of taking quotes of things I have said \nout of context. Look at what I have done. I have not filibustered \nnominees with bipartisan support after May of Presidential election \nyears. As chairman of this committee, I have steadfastly protected the \nrights of the minority. I have done so despite criticism from \nDemocrats. I have only proceeded with judicial nominations supported by \nboth home State Senators. That has meant that we are not able to \nproceed on current nominees from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and \nLouisiana. I even stopped proceedings on a circuit court nominee from \nKansas when the Kansas Republican Senators reversed themselves and \nwithdrew their support for the nominee. I had to deny the Majority \nLeader's request to push a Nevada nominee through Committee because she \ndid not have the support of Nevada's Republican Senator. I will put my \nrecord of consistent fairness up against that of any judiciary chairman \nand remind Senate Republicans that it is they who blatantly disregarded \nevenhanded practices when they were ramming through ideological \nnominations of President George W. Bush. They would proceed with \nnominations despite the objection of both home State Senators.\n  So those are the Leahy rules--respect for and protection of minority \nrights, increased transparency, consistency, and allowing for \nconfirmations well into Presidential election years for nominees with \nbipartisan support.\n  Senate Republicans, on the other hand, have repeatedly asserted that \nthe Thurmond Rule does not exist. For example, on July 14, 2008, the \nSenate Republican caucus held a hearing and said that the Thurmond Rule \ndoes not exist. At that hearing, the senior Senator from Kentucky, the \nRepublican leader stated: ``I think it's clear that there is no \nThurmond Rule. And I think the facts demonstrate that.'' Similarly, the \nSenator from Iowa, my friend who is now serving as ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, stated that the Thurmond rule was in his view \n``plain bunk.'' He said: ``The reality is that the Senate has never \nstopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months of a \npresident's term.'' We did not in 2008 when we proceeded to confirm 22 \nnominees over the second half of that year.\n\n  We remain far behind in filling the judicial vacancies to provide the \nFederal judges that American people need to get justice in our Federal \ncourts. A comparison of judicial vacancies during the first terms of \nPresident Bush and President Obama shows a stark contrast to the way in \nwhich we moved to reduce judicial vacancies during the last Republican \npresidency.\n  During President Bush's first term we reduced the number of judicial \nvacancies by almost 75 percent. When I became chairman in the summer of \n2001, there were 110 vacancies. As chairman, I worked with the \nadministration and Senators from both sides of the aisle to confirm 100 \njudicial nominees of a conservative Republican President in 17 months.\n  We continued when in the minority to work with Senate Republicans and \nconfirm President Bush's consensus judicial nominations well into 2004, \na Presidential election year. At the end of that presidential term, the \nSenate had acted to confirm 205 circuit and district court nominees. By \nJune 2004 we had reduced judicial vacancies to 43 on the way to 28 that \nAugust.\n  By comparison, vacancies have long remained near or above 80 and \nwhile little comparative progress has been made during the 4 years of \nPresident Obama's first term. As contrasted to 43 vacancies in June \n2004, there are still 74 vacancies in June 2012. If we could move \nforward to Senate votes on the 17 judicial nominees ready for final \naction, the Senate could reduce vacancies below 60 and make some \nprogress. I noted last week that, compared to our progress under \nPresident Bush, we were 9 months later in confirming the 150th circuit \nor district judge to be appointed by President Obama. Another way to \nlook at our relative lack of progress and the burden the Republican \nobstruction is placing on the American people seeking justice is to \nnote that by mid-November 2002 we had reduced judicial vacancies to \nbelow where we are now with 74 vacancies. We effectively worked twice \nas efficiently and twice as fast. By that measure, the Senate is almost \n20 months behind schedule. This is hardly then the time to be shutting \ndown the process. In fact, when on November 14, 2002, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 18 judicial nominees, vacancies went down to 60 \nthroughout the country.\n  This is a true comparison of similar situations. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service in its recent report likewise compares \nthe first years of Presidential administrations. False comparisons are \nto take the end of a second term of a Presidency, when vacancies have \nalready been significantly reduced and to contend that confirmation \nnumbers for that period can be fairly compared to the beginning of a \nPresidential term when vacancies are high.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Robin Rosenbaum to \nfill a judicial emergency vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of Florida. Judge Rosenbaum has the ``support of her \nhome State Senators, Democratic Senator Bill Nelson and Republican \nSenator Marco Rubio. Her nomination was reported with near unanimous \nvoice vote by the Judiciary Committee nearly 3 months ago, with the \nonly objection coming from Senator Lee's customary protest vote. Judge \nRosenbaum was rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by the ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal judiciary, the highest possible rating.\n  Judge Rosenbaum is currently a United States Magistrate Judge in the \ndistrict in which she has been nominated, and has served in that \nposition for almost 5 years. She previously served for 9 years as a \nFederal prosecutor, including 5 years as a chief of the economic crimes \nsection. After graduating from law school, she spent four years as a \ntrial attorney in the civil division of the U.S. Department of Justice \nbefore serving as staff counsel in the office of the independent \ncounsel for the investigation of former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron \nBrown. Judge Rosenbaum clerked for Judge Stanley Marcus of the Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals. She is a terrific nominee and she has my \nsupport.\n  Last week, the Judiciary Committee also voted Judge Brian Davis out \nof committee favorably for a judicial emergency vacancy in the Middle \nDistrict of Florida. Judge Davis is an exceptional nominee with a \ndistinguished career in public service. He has been a State court judge \nfor 18 years, and has also served as a prosecutor for 9 years. The ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal judiciary has unanimously rated Judge \nDavis well qualified to serve on the district court, its highest \npossible rating. Judge Davis was selected based on a nonpartisan \njudicial selection commission appointed by Senators Nelson and Rubio, \nand both of the home State Senators have supported moving forward with \nconsideration of this nomination. We should move to confirm him without \ndelay so that he can get to work for the people of Florida.\n  After today's vote, we need to continue confirming nominees. At a \ntime when judicial vacancies remained historically high for 3 years, \nwith 30 more vacancies and 30 fewer confirmations than at this point in \nPresident Bush's first term, I would hope the Senate Republican \nleadership would reconsider and work with us on filling these \nlongstanding judicial vacancies to help the American people. We have \nwell-qualified, consensus nominees with bipartisan support who can fill \nthese vacancies. It is only partisan politics and continued tactics of \nobstruction that stand in the way.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nRobin S. Rosenbaum, to be U.S. district judge for the Southern District \nof Florida.\n  Although it is the practice and tradition of the Senate to not \nconfirm circuit nominees in the closing months of\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\na Presidential election year, we continue to confirm consensus district \njudge nominees. We have now confirmed 151 nominees of this President to \nthe district and circuit courts. We also have confirmed two Supreme \nCourt nominees during President Obama's term.\n  I have heard some Members repeatedly ask the question, ``What is \ndifferent about this President that he has to be treated differently \nthan all these other Presidents?'' I won't speculate as to any \ninference that might be intended by that question, but I can tell you \nthat this President is not being treated differently than previous \nPresidents. By any objective measure, this President has been treated \nfairly and consistent with past Senate practices.\n  For example, with regard to the number of confirmations, let me put \nthat in perspective for my colleagues with an apples-to-apples \ncomparison. The last time the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court \nnominees was during President Bush's second term. And during President \nBush's entire second term the Senate confirmed a total of only 119 \ndistrict and circuit court nominees. With Ms. Rosenbaum's confirmation \ntoday, we will have confirmed 32 more district and circuit nominees for \nPresident Obama than we did for President Bush in similar \ncircumstances.\n  During the last Presidential election year, 2008, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. Today, we \nwill exceed that number, as well. We have already confirmed 5 Circuit \nnominees, and this will be the 24th district judge confirmed this year. \nThose who say this President is being treated differently either fail \nto recognize history or want to ignore the facts.\n  After graduating from the University of Miami School of Law in 1991, \nJudge Rosenbaum worked as a trial attorney for the Federal Programs \nBranch of the Department of Justice. Her practice involved defending \nthe constitutionality of Federal statutes and agency programs. In \nSeptember 1995, she joined the Independent Counsel Office's \ninvestigation of former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown. She \nserved as staff counsel, participating in the criminal investigation \nand providing advice to other team members. Upon closure of the \ninvestigation, Judge Rosenbaum joined the law firm of Holland & Knight \nLLP as an associate. While there, from 1996 to 1997, she worked on a \nvariety of civil matters, including Federal employment law. Judge \nRosenbaum then accepted a position as a law clerk for Judge Stanley \nMarcus on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, \nwhere she worked from January to October 1998.\n  After her clerkship, Judge Rosenbaum became an assistant U.S. \nattorney. She specialized in criminal prosecutions such as securities \nfraud, bank fraud, identity theft, tax fraud, telemarketing fraud, \nhealth care fraud, internet fraud, and computer crimes. In 2002, she \nbecame the chief of the Economic Crimes Section for the Central \nDivision, Fort Lauderdale, which gave her supervisory responsibilities \nover 8 to 10 other assistant U.S. attorneys. She held that title until \nher appointment as a magistrate judge in 2007.\n  In 2007, the U.S. district judges for the Southern District of \nFlorida appointed Judge Rosenbaum to be a U.S. magistrate judge. As \nmagistrate judge in the District of Southern District of Florida, she \nmanages all aspects of the pretrial process in civil and criminal \ncases: conducting evidentiary hearings, ruling on nondispositive \nmotions, making reports and recommendations regarding dispositive \nmotions, and issuing criminal complaints, search warrants, and arrest \nwarrants.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nJudge Rosenbaum as ``well qualified.''\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, our Nation faces an alarming \njudicial vacancy rate. I am grateful that today we will be voting to \nconfirm U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Rosenbaum to fill a judicial \nemergency in the Southern District of Florida for a Federal district \njudgeship. She earned her undergraduate degree at Cornell, her law \ndegree from Miami. She began her legal career in the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral's Honors Program where she worked as a trial attorney in the \nFederal Programs Branch of the Civil Division. She has worked in \nprivate practice at Holland & Knight and as a law clerk to Judge \nStanley Marcus, U.S. Circuit Court Judge for the 11th Circuit Court of \nAppeals, and she has worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney down in the \nSouthern District of Florida.\n  Our State has a great tradition of bipartisan support for our Federal \njudicial nominees going back a couple of decades. Of course, through \nthis judicial nominating commission, she has come forth with their \nstamp of approval. The two Senators from Florida agree. I am happy to \nrecommend her to the Senate.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It will ensure that the FDA \nhas the resources to speed market access to drugs and devices while \ncontinuing to ensure patient safety. For the first time, it will make \nnew resources available to allow the FDA to clear its backlog of \napplications for generic drugs, which will help ensure that patients \nhave access to less expensive medications. It will make sure the FDA \nhas the funds to prevent there ever being a backlog in applications for \nbiosimilars. These resources are vital to FDA's ability to do its job, \nto the medical products industry's ability to make these products and, \nmost importantly, to patients who need both access to drugs and \ndevices, and assurances that they are indeed safe.\n  This legislation has benefited from input from a diverse range of \ninterested parties, Senators on both sides of the aisle, our colleagues \nin the House, industry stakeholders, consumer groups, and patient \ngroups.\n  Over 1 year ago the parties started bringing policy ideas to the \ntable. We worked together in bipartisan working groups to reach \nconsensus on these policy measures. Where we could not achieve \nconsensus, we didn't allow those differences to distract us from the \ncritically important goal of producing a bill that could be broadly \nsupported. As a result of this bipartisan process, we have a bill that \nadvances our shared goals of patient safety, patient access, a well-\nfunctioning FDA, and strong and viable American businesses. We \nstreamlined the device approval process while also enhancing patient \nprotections. We modernized FDA's authority to ensure that drugs and \ndrug ingredients coming to the United States from overseas are safe and \nto ensure that our domestic companies compete on a level field with \nforeign ones. We addressed the critical problem of drug shortages. We \nhelped spur innovation and incentivized drug development for life-\nthreatening conditions. We reauthorized and improved the incentives for \nstudying drugs in children.\n  Finally, we increased accountability and transparency at FDA. So the \nbill strikes a balance. It will help keep our regulatory system in pace \nto adapt to technological and scientific advances. It will create the \nconditions to foster innovative advances in medical technologies. \nAgain, it will do all of this without losing sight of the most \nimportant function of the FDA--ensuring patient safety.\n  So it has been a long road leading up to this moment. We have been \nworking on this bill for well over 1 year and 3 or 4 months with the \nhelp of Senators on and off the committee.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, the ranking member of the Health \nCommittee, Senator Enzi, for all of his diligent and hard work and that \nof his staff for helping to bring all the different parties together \nand making sure we had a consensus bill that responded to all of those \ninputs.\n  So we have had a great collaboration. I think we have an excellent \nbill. Again, I am hopeful we can have our comments and discussions this \nafternoon, but I urge all my colleagues to vote today to pass the FDA \nSafety and Innovation Act. It is critically important to the agency, \nthe industry, and to the patients we get this done. This will be the \nfinal step.\n  As I said, the House passed it unanimously. If we pass it today, it \ncan go to the President for his signature as soon as we pass it this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to my good friend \nand colleague and ranking member, Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee. I \nthank him for his kind words, but I also thank him for his leadership \non this issue. We have had a great teamwork effort both between the \nSenators and between the staff. This isn't something that just came \ntogether a couple of weeks ago. This is something that has been worked \non for about 1\\1/2\\ years, with pretty constant meetings on Fridays of \nall of the interested groups and then stakeholders. It takes a \ntremendous amount of work to put something like this together and have \nit be in a bipartisan way like this. It is largely because it came to \ncommittee.\n  In committee we took a look at all of the amendments that were \nsuggested, we got the people together who had very similar amendments, \nand they usually were able to work out something to satisfy everybody \nin that instance, and we came up with a bill. As Senator Harkin \nmentioned, it passed 96 to 1. Anytime we get something to pass, it is \nkind of a landmark success. But when we get something that bipartisan, \nit is even more landmark.\n  We have been trying to get this bill wrapped up before the Supreme \nCourt decision came out on health care. The reason we have been trying \nto do that is, who knows what it is going to say or what kind of ideas \npeople will come up with when that happens. This is a group of 100 idea \ngenerators, so we wanted this cleared up by that time. We are on a path \nto get that done right now and a path that will keep the people \nemployed who are taking a look at new drugs and devices and generics \nand biosimilars and continue to get those on the market so people will \nhave the latest innovations.\n  One of the things we included in the bill was some use of foreign \nclinical trials if they were approved by the FDA, and that should even \nspeed up the process. Of course, when we went to conference there were \na lot of things people wanted to have that they brought up as \namendments. It is very critical in the bill, and we get some of them \nand we don't get others.\n\n  I know Senator Alexander played a huge role; he had seven items in \nthe bill and we got six of them. Senator Burr had 12 items in the bill, \nand we got 11 of them. I have to mention, of course, that the one we \ndid not get is a particularly important but particularly difficult \nissue that is going to take more time to get worked out. It is one that \ndeals with drug distribution security, and that is something we cannot \navoid. We have to do it. But it is going to take longer to work that \nout. It deserves some extra time and some more understanding on both \nsides of the aisle on that one and in a number of different States. It \ndoesn't just involve the Senate; it doesn't just involve the drug \ncompanies; it also involves the whole chain that these things have to \ngo through, including the local pharmacist whom we don't want to \noverload with work, and the people who have to transport these drugs \nwhom we don't want to overload with work or make it extremely \ncomplicated when they cross different State lines and have to do \ndifferent kinds of reporting.\n  Senator Isakson had four amendments, and we were able to get three of \nthem. Senator Paul had two, and we got one. Senator Hatch had six, and \nhe got all of them. Senator McCain had two, and we got one. Senator \nRoberts had two, and we got both of those. Senator Murkowski had two, \nand we got both of those. Senator Kirk had two, and we got one of \nthose. Senator Grassley had two, and we got one of those. Senator \nPortman had two, and we got both of those. And Senator Coburn had two, \nand we got one of those. Senator Corker had two, and we got both of \nthose.\n  So there are a lot of things we did on the Senate side that became \npossible on the House side. There are a number of things they did on \nthe House side that we couldn't agree with on this side either. But we \ndid reach agreement--and we reached it in pretty much record time. We \nnow have a bill that can go ahead and be passed and go to the President \nfor signature to assure that the level of safety we have in our drugs \nnot only continues but improves, and drugs can get on the market faster \nthan they had before by streamlining the process and also making sure \nthere are better foreign inspections so the ingredients that go into \nthe drugs don't cause problems.\n  So this legislation reauthorizes the Food and Drug Administration's \nuser\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nfee program, and it ensures that Americans get better access to safe \ninnovative medicines and medical devices. It will make significant \nchanges. It will improve the FDA's review and approval of new drugs and \ndevices.\n  Unfortunately, FDA's current process for reviewing and approving \nmedical devices too often creates delay and unpredictability. This in \nturn threatens patient access to the best possible treatments for their \nconditions. In some cases, this has forced American patients to travel \noverseas to obtain access to lifesaving new devices that FDA has not \napproved in the United States.\n  The bill goes a long way toward solving these problems and makes the \nmost significant changes to the law of governing FDA's review of \ndevices in decades.\n  This bill will speed the approval of devices by reducing the redtape \nassociated with the ``least burdensome'' standard that FDA uses to \napprove such devices. The bill will also make it easier for FDA to \napprove devices for patients with rare diseases who might not otherwise \nbe able to have their conditions treated most effectively. It will also \nenable FDA to expedite safety determinations, to resolve appeals, and \nto improve their postapproval surveillance activities to detect \nproblems as they occur. It is not good enough to get them approved, we \nalso want them watched after they are approved, and this will do it.\n  The bill also contains important reforms to foster drug innovation \nand patient access to new therapies. It modernizes the accelerated \napproval pathway for drugs to reflect advances in science over the past \n20 years. It formalizes a new process to expedite the development and \napproval of breakthrough therapies. These changes are particularly \nimportant for patients with rare diseases where there are no therapies \navailable, and it is not feasible or ethical to require large \nconventional clinical trials.\n  Nobody wants to be the one who is a test case when there might be \nsomething that would work for them, and there aren't the sizes of the \npopulations to do the conventional clinical trial anyway. The patient \ncommunity strongly supports these improvements because these will save \nlives.\n  The bill also contains important reforms that will help mitigate the \nproblems associated with drug shortages. It will require better \ncoordination within FDA as well as the other Federal agencies such as \nthe DEA. It will also allow FDA to move faster, to take actions, and to \naddress shortages through expedited reviews and approvals.\n  The bill also makes important changes to how FDA uses Risk Evaluation \nand Mitigation Strategies, REMS. REMS play a critical role in \nprotecting patients and public health and this bill includes a \nprovision that clarifies the process for modifying REMS--especially \nwith regard to minor modifications.\n  The provision in the bill being passed today does not change \nCongress' expectation that a non-minor modification will generally be \nbased on the best available science including an assessment \ndemonstrating that the modification is necessary or appropriate. Nor \ndoes the clarification indicate that a modification should be approved \nif it would reduce the REMS' effectiveness in addressing the \ndrug's known risks.\n\n  The bill follows what I call the 80 percent rule. When we focus on 80 \npercent of the issues on which we can reach agreement rather than \nfocusing exclusively on the parts and the issues we can never resolve, \nwe can achieve amazing results. Over 1 year ago staff began to work on \nidentifying the 80 percent. A group of staff from Republican and \nDemocratic offices on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee began a series of standing meetings and proceeded to meet \nevery week for several months. They met with stakeholders and discussed \npolicy solutions that each member thought would solve the problem.\n  After much discussion of the benefits, costs, and possible unintended \nconsequences, members agreed on a list of policy concepts. If there was \nnot a consensus on a particular policy, it wasn't included. This is the \n80 percent rural in action.\n  As this process has progressed, my staff also met with the Republican \nstaff on the Health Committee for at least 2 hours every week to keep \nthem informed and to seek their input. I also personally met with the \nmembers of the committee before markup to ensure I understood their \npriorities.\n  This bill reflects the work of every member of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. All of them have at least one provision \nincluded in this legislation. Many members of the committee worked with \nus to find consensus measures that addressed their priorities as well.\n  As I mentioned, not everyone got everything they wanted. We did, \nhowever, find the 80 percent of each solution that we could all agree \nwould help solve the problem, and the bill passed the committee by a \nvoice vote. This legislation could be a model for how the process can \nand should work regardless of the political environment. We followed \nthis model as we transitioned from the committee process to the Senate \nfloor. We worked with members who filed amendments in committee to \naddress some of the concerns in the manager's amendment. We also worked \nwith Members who filed amendments on the Senate floor.\n\n  We did the same thing in our discussions with the House. You can see \nthat the results are very positive. We preserved and we improved \npolicies to foster drug innovation and patient access, and to promote \naccountability and transparency at the FDA. We also made significant \nimprovements to the Senate's medical device reforms for startup and \nemerging growth companies, and with respect to the 510(k) process.\n  We thank Senator Harkin for his tireless effort on this bill. I know \nhe spent countless hours and attended dozens of meetings, working with \nSenators and stakeholders and advocates to address their concerns. This \nbill would not have had such broad bipartisan support without all of \nhis work.\n  Senator Harkin's staff has also worked tirelessly on this bipartisan \nbill. Their knowledge, professionalism, their graciousness were \ninstrumental in addressing all of the issues in this bill. They worked \nmany late evenings, they worked through weekends, they worked through \ncountless working group discussions to be able to get the bill where it \nis today.\n  Specifically, I want to recognize Elizabeth Jungman, Bill McConagha, \nKathleen Laird, and Kate Wise for all their work. I thank Pam Smith, \nSenator Harkin's staff director, for her leadership getting this bill \nto the finish line. I especially want to recognize Jenelle \nKrishnamoorthy, whose organization and diplomatic skills helped us \nresolve the most difficult challenges and made sure that the priorities \nof all the members of the committee are reflected in the bill.\n  I also wish to thank the staffs of the Legislative Counsel, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and the Federal Drug Administration for \nall of their technical assistance. Again, there are people in those \ngroups who had to work through the weekends when we were finishing up.\n  Finally I would thank my staff--Keith Flanagan, Melissa Pfaff, Grace \nStuntz, Katy Spangler, Rob Walton, and my health policy director, Chuck \nClapton.\n  I would be really remiss if I didn't thank my staff director Frank \nMacchiarola for his work on this bill, especially as the bill \nprogressed through the HELP Committee, the Senate floor, and \ndiscussions with the House. My staff has been working around the clock \nfor many days, for weeks, and for months. I sincerely appreciate their \ndedication to getting this bill passed and for helping to work with the \n80-percent rule.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill that makes \nimportant changes to the FDA and I ask them to support this process \nthat expedites getting the conference done. We will have a real and \nmeaningful impact on millions of American patients.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to start off by thanking the chair \nand the ranking member for the great work they have accomplished with \nwhat has always been a very delicate piece of legislation. Their staffs \nhave been tireless on both sides, trying to work out differences, and \nwe would not be here today if it were not for their commitment to this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\n  Let me say to the chair and the ranking member, I plan to go on for \nsome time. If I were you, I would take the opportunity to leave for a \nwhile because I will go for an hour or two or maybe three. And it is \nnot all going to pertain specifically to this legislation, but I have a \nlot to say because I have heard some of the opening statements. I have \nheard statements such as ``our goal is to finish before the Supreme \nCourt.'' I have a question: Why? Why a crucial piece of legislation \nthat affects so many Americans and so many patients around the world--\nwhy did it have to be done before the Supreme Court? I am not sure \nanybody can give an answer, but somebody started that as a goal and it \nsort of was adopted.\n  I heard the legislation was accomplished at record speed. I don't see \nthat as something to herald. Speed is indicative of something that we \nrushed our way through. I know on behalf of the chairman's staff and \nthe ranking member's staff, they have been working on this for a long \ntime. So has my staff. But from a standpoint of when we marked up the \nlegislation and came to the floor--how fast we went to the floor--we \ndid it because there was an understanding that we were going to try to \nhold the Senate product together.\n  I don't want to take issue with the numbers. I had two amendments \nthat were dropped in conference so I am not sure how I had 12 and got \n11 but, regardless, the question we are here to answer, the purpose of \nthis legislation, is that this is supposed to drive innovation in \nAmerica and bring lifesaving drugs, devices, and biologics to \npatients--here in America first, but around the country, around the \nworld. That is the goal behind this legislation.\n  I have to take issue with my ranking member. I don't think the 80-\npercent rule applies to health care. I can't look at a patient and say: \nIf we can get 80 percent of the right policy, I am going to feel good. \nIf I am in the 20 percent that is left out, I am going to be really \npissed off.\n  One of the reasons our health care costs are so high today is that we \nhave been able to innovate as a country to where we maintain disease \nextremely well. But we are right on the cusp of being able to cure \nthings such as breast cancer and diabetes. It is not going to be cheap. \nIt is not going to be fast. You are not going to find it in the 80-\npercent category. You are going to find it in the 20-percent category. \nIt is going to take a while. It is going to take people investing \ncapital and companies that are committed to their shareholders that \nthey are not going to have the returns because they are invested in \nsomething important and that is the long-term future of our country and \nour country's health.\n  That is what I see in a 5-year PDUFA bill. This is not a 1-year \nreauthorization of something. Granted, this is not a piece of \nlegislation that this committee drafted from scratch. It is important \nthat everybody understands that for this legislation, in the \nnegotiations between drugs, devices, biologics, generics industry with \nthe Federal Drug Administration, there is not a Member of Congress and \nno staff of Congress in the room as they negotiate what fees they are \ngoing to pay to the FDA to actually process their applications. So the \nfocus of this committee was to look at what happened in the \nnegotiations and try to figure out how could we make this bill better--\nhow could we assure ourselves there was a level of transparency we \ncould understand, that the negotiations they had entered into in fact \nbenefited American patients.\n\n  If this doesn't benefit the health care costs and the health care of \nAmericans, then we have missed the mark. The whole objective is to put \nAmerica in a better position after the passage of this bill.\n  I will be boring because some of what I am going to talk about a lot \nof people in this institution know. But I am not sure the American \npeople understand the background that is here. The Federal Drug \nAdministration is responsible for assuring the safety and efficacy and \nthe security of human and animal medical products. One element of FDA's \nstatutory mission is to promote the public health and the FDA \naccomplishes this mission in part by timely--timely--approving \nlifesaving, life-enhancing innovations that make medicine safer, more \neffective and in many cases more affordable.\n  FDA's broad regulatory authority crosses a range of products and has \nresulted in the agency overseeing products that amount to 25 cents of \nevery dollar of the U.S. economy. Let me say that again. The FDA \nregulation extends to 25 cents of every dollar spent in the U.S. \neconomy. Therefore, the FDA's review and decision process not only \nimpacts our Nation's patients and innovators, their work has a \nsignificant impact on many sectors of our Nation's economy. As \nconsumers and patients, the American people have serious interests in \nassuring that the FDA is accountable, transparent, efficient, and \nmaking sound decisions in as timely a fashion as possible.\n  You see, that is why I am on the floor today. If the goal is to have \ntransparent, efficient, sound decisions in a timely fashion, you don't \nrush through it. You make sure that there is a matrix in place--not one \nthat was designed by the agency and not one that was designed by the \nindustry, but one that is designed by the body that is responsible to \ndo oversight over Federal agencies, the Congress of the United States, \nthe HELP Committee. It is our job. That is why concerns about \ntimeliness and predictability of FDA's regulatory process must be taken \nseriously and they must be addressed.\n  Unfortunately, too often Congress is guilty of not paying close \nenough attention to how well things are working or not working at the \nFDA on behalf of the patients, the very people for whom the most is at \nstake. Every 5 years, drug and device industries negotiate their user \nfees that are then sent to Congress with the expectation that we will \nquickly act upon them to ensure the continuity of the agency. Let me \nassure you, this year is no exception. They dropped these agreements on \nCongress's lap and said: Would you pass these as quickly as you can \nwith no changes? And to their credit, the chair and the ranking member \nsaid: No, Congress has a role to play. And staff has had tremendous \ninput into what the final product was.\n  Unfortunately, rushing the bills through the House and the Senate has \nresulted in bipartisan track-and-trace provisions not being included in \nthe bill we have before us today. As the ranking member said, I am very \ndisappointed that these important bipartisan provisions were sacrificed \nas the expense to attain speed. I understand the difficulty of the \nlift. I acknowledge that to my colleagues and to their staff. But I \nalso question how hard we tried, on an issue that we knew going in was \ntough. There is no such thing as spending too much time when it comes \nto getting something as important as drug distribution security right.\n  I assure all my colleagues that my friend from Colorado, Senator \nBennet, and I will continue to work together to get these important \nprovisions done. I might add, I have had the commitment from the chair \nand the ranking member to work with us on other legislation to try to \naddress this.\n  But let me say today, it will not be any easier than it is right now. \nIt may be tougher then because this was a vehicle that had to go, \ntherefore people would have swallowed a lot more that is in this bill.\n  As my colleagues know, FDA and industry tell us not to make any \nchanges because it would ``open up the agreement.'' Think about that. \nThe industry and the FDA told Congress don't put anything else in here \nbecause we would consider that as opening up our agreement.\n  When did Congress become so irrelevant that a Federal agency would \nsuggest that we not get involved? Yet it requires our passage for this \nto go in statute.\n  I have explained before, Congress is told to tiptoe around the \nagreements and we focus our efforts on the belt-and-suspenders policies \nto complement the agreement. This does not make for the most consistent \nand deliberative process in considering how Congress can work with FDA \nand industry to strengthen and improve FDA's drug and device work on \nbehalf of our Nation's patients, but this is the process Members have \nto work within, which is why it is so important to assure that the \nright policy riders, including transparency and accountability, are \nincluded in the final package.\n  One thing that has been made quite clear over the past few years is \nthe importance of FDA reporting on the right\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\nmatrix. I can predict with some confidence, since this is a 5-year \nbill, we will be here 5 years from now and hopefully there will be at \nleast one Member of the Senate who steps up and says: How did the FDA \nhold up against what they said they were going to do in the agreements?\n  That is at the heart of transparency and accountability. If we do not \nhave a matrix established that everyone understands here is where we \nare and here is where we promised we would get to, then how in the \nworld 5 years from now do we measure this? How do you know then that if \nyou raise the user fees, that it is justified, that the beneficiary of \nit is the American patient? I am going to say that is candidly obvious \nto everybody listening. When drug companies, device companies, biologic \ncompanies, generic companies pay more money to get their application \napproved, who pays for it? The consumers. The people who buy the drugs, \nuse the devices, and buy the generics. This is the first time we have \never had a user fee for generic pharmaceuticals. Generics were called \nthat because generics were created after the patent life expired so we \ncould bring low-cost products to the market.\n\n  What are we doing? We are creating generic user fees which will raise \nthe generic price for the American people. It may alter the fact \nwhether it is cheaper for a person to pay for their generic \nprescription or whether it is cheaper to have their copayment do it on \ntheir insurance card. That is the reality of what we are dealing with. \nI am not suggesting it is bad, but why would we rush through it without \nunderstanding what the impact is? That is where we are today.\n  Reporting only on the negotiated user fees performance goals agreed \nto by the industry and the FDA has not provided a complete picture of \nhow well the FDA is working to fulfill its mission on behalf of \npatients. The bottom line is what gets measured gets done. So it has to \nbe measured.\n  In the Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this year, former FDA \nCommissioner Andy von Eschenbach highlighted what is at stake if \nCongress does not get the user fee reauthorization package right and \nfix the underlying problems at the FDA. He writes:\n\n       The stakes couldn't be higher for our health. The U.S. \n     biomedical industry is one of the crown jewels of the \n     American economy. It employs about 1.2 million people \n     directly and over five million throughout its supply chain, \n     with a total output of $519 billion in 2009 . . . Many of the \n     firms are among the world's most innovative: From 2001 to \n     2010, the Milken Institute report shows, U.S.-based companies \n     produced nearly 60% of the world's new medicines, up from 42% \n     the previous decade.\n       But U.S. firms won't continue to lead unless the FDA \n     retains its role as the world's ``gold standard'' for \n     evaluating new medical products.\n\n  Many people establish the gold standard as being the hurdle they have \nto pass in order to be approved. The gold standard is also how \ndifficult the process is that they have to go through, and will the \ncapital be there to finance the research and development so approval is \nsomething they see as a light at the end of the tunnel. These all have \nto be weighed in the policies they put in place, and I will say we have \ncome up somewhat short.\n  Last year the National Venture Capital Association released a report \nthat underscores America's risk of losing its standing as the world \nleader in medical innovation. Their survey clearly showed that the \nFDA's regulatory challenges, the lack of regulatory certainty, the day-\nto-day unpredictability, and unnecessary delays are stifling investment \nin the development of lifesaving drugs and devices. Instead of \ndeterring investment and innovation in lifesaving treatments such as \ncardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, we should accelerate it. \nInstead of deterring that capital to come in, we should be finding \npolicies to accelerate that capital to chase cures in heart disease, \ndiabetes and cancer and work with America's innovators on behalf of \npatients who are depending on the next breakthrough drug or device.\n  Our Nation's health care system is unsustainable. We all agree we \nmust lower health care costs in America. Predictable regulatory \npathways that facilitate innovative medical products that reach \npatients in as timely a manner as possible is key for lowering our \nhealth care costs. This survey is another serious call for the need to \nrestore regulatory certainty and predictability at the FDA.\n  As we comb through this bill, we see the two amendments that were \nvoted and accepted in the Senate markup of the bill were dropped and \ndiscarded because somebody was too concerned with requiring too many \nreports. There is a reason we get granular with what we put in \nlegislation and, more important, what we require an agency to produce. \nPredictable regulatory pathways that facilitate innovative medical \nproducts reaching patients in a timely manner will lower our health \ncare costs.\n  It is clear the FDA's global leadership in innovation is at risk. A \n2011 report by the California Healthcare Institute and the Boston \nConsulting Group highlighted this point. The report found that in \nrecent years the environment for medical innovation has deteriorated \nand the most critical factor has been the FDA, the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Let me repeat that. The report found the environment \nfor medical innovation has deteriorated and the most critical factor \nhas been the Food and Drug Administration. The report states:\n\n     . . . for the Agency's policies and activities exemplify \n     President Obama's critique of a regulatory system whose \n     ``rules have gotten out of balance, placing unreasonable \n     burdens on business--burdens that have stifled innovation and \n     have had a chilling effect on growth and jobs.''\n\n  Now, all of a sudden, we are talking about a piece of legislation we \nhave rushed through the process because we wanted to beat the Supreme \nCourt decision on Thursday. We did it at an accelerated pace, faster \nthan we have ever done through the Senate, and we realize this \nlegislation affects the economy and jobs. It is not just about health \ncare. It is not just about patients. It is about jobs.\n  Dr. David Gollaher, president and CEO of the California Healthcare \nInstitute, raises a clear alarm in his report we should all heed. He \nconcludes:\n\n       The result of uneven performance of the Agency has been to \n     increase the risk associated with regulation, dampening \n     investment in companies whose products face FDA regulation. \n     Meanwhile, as global competition in high-tech industries has \n     intensified, other nations have adapted their regulatory \n     systems to out-compete the FDA. The flight of medical \n     technology product launches to European Union countries \n     should be a serious cause of concern for policymakers and \n     patient advocates alike.\n\n  What does that mean in layman's terms? We are losing them here and \nthe EU is attracting them there. Why? Because their policies are easier \nto understand. It is not that their threshold for safety and efficacy \nis any lower, but they carry on an honest partnership with the \napplicants, and most will say dealing with the FDA is akin to inviting \nyour worst relative to spend the week with you in your house.\n\n  Exporting lifesaving innovation overseas--and the jobs that come with \nit--will not help patients or our economy here at home. It erodes our \nNation's standing as the global leader in medical innovation and \nresults in America's patients having to wait longer for lifesaving \ntherapies or jeopardizing their access to them at all.\n  I am not sure in America we ever thought we would go to another \ncountry where they had approved a new therapy we couldn't get in the \nUnited States, but I would be willing to bet that every family in \nAmerica knows somebody who has gone outside the country to get some \ntype of treatment or some type of dosage of something we haven't \napproved here, and one might think they are not safe or effective. The \nlikelihood is that those products have never even applied for FDA \napproval. Why? Because the process has become so unpredictable and so \nexpensive that a company has to justify the potential sales of a \nproduct to meet the billion-dollar cost just to get through the FDA \napplication process.\n  Exporting lifesaving innovation overseas and the jobs that come with \nit will not help our patients and will not help the economy. It erodes \nthe Nation's economy and results in America's patients having to wait \nlonger. I just said it.\n  The FDA is supported by both user fees and taxpayer dollars, so \nCongress has a critical oversight role in ensuring that the FDA is \nmeeting its requirements under the law. Moreover, as elected \nrepresentatives of the American people, Congress institutionally has a \nduty to ensure that the FDA is\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\nbroadly fulfilling its statutory mission and promoting the public \nhealth through its review and regulation on a range of medical \nproducts.\n  The reauthorization of the drug and device user fees agreement is an \nimportant opportunity for Congress to ensure that the FDA is fulfilling \nits mission. Why would we in any way water down the accountability and \ntransparency if, in fact, we are the ones to ensure the FDA is \nfulfilling its mission? But closely examining these issues once every 5 \nyears is not going to help address the underlying problems at the FDA \nthat we all know must be fixed. The only way that is going to happen is \nwith the FDA, Congress, patients, and innovators consistently working \ntogether with the right data points. The bottom line is we don't know \nwhat we don't measure. If we don't know it, how can we ensure that it \nis right?\n  Another report by the California Healthcare Institute and the Boston \nConsulting Group in 2012 underscores the importance of reliable data at \nthe FDA and how FDA performance is a function of management. The report \nfinds there would be great value in regularly gathering and analyzing \nthe best possible data and updating performance metrics during this \nPDUFA cycle in order to track performance consistently and \nlongitudinally with the goal of the most accurate possible measures of \nagency performance.\n  Do you sense a trend that every outside evaluation--not industry, not \nFDA, not Congress--of the user fee agreement is basically saying: Hey, \nCongress, don't miss this opportunity. If we want to track performance, \nthen we have to set up the metrics and collect the data. Why in the \nworld would we drop from the bill the transparency and accountability \nprovisions that get the granular data we need to make this assessment? \nI guess we will never know.\n  Congressional oversight can help highlight the processes that are \nworking well at the FDA, as well as reveal areas where the FDA needs to \nmake improvements to ensure timely and predictable regulatory decisions \non behalf of America's patients. Recently, the GAO reports over the \npast year have underscored these points and why the right metrics must \nbe reported on to paint a full and complete picture. Now all of a \nsudden we have the General Accounting Office, the GAO, saying the same \nthing that all these third parties have said. Why? Because they are the \nones we turn to when we want to ask them to do an evaluation of the \nFDA, and they are telling Congress: Hey, don't miss this opportunity to \nget this stuff in there. You actually can get the data we can't get \nbecause it is not in the statute.\n  Every 5 years when we pass the final user fee package, FDA's \nauthority and responsibilities grow. Think about that. With more \nemployees and higher costs, it seems like things would be getting \nbetter, but without the metrics, without the accountability, without \ntransparency, we don't know. This bill is no exception. The FDA is \ngoing to get an unprecedented level of user fees and more new \nauthority, billions in user fee dollars. With this unprecedented level \nof user fees, there must be unprecedented transparency, oversight, and \naccountability. It does not exist.\n  Let me be clear. There are good provisions in this bill that should \nhelp to improve transparency, accountability, and regulatory certainty. \nHowever, throughout the committee's work on various issues, I \nrepeatedly raised the point that if we did not fix the underlying \nissues at the FDA, the new responsibilities and expectations we are \ngoing to create with this bill would not achieve the desired outcome. \nQuite simply, that is why I am disappointed that some key transparency \nand accountability provisions included in the Senate bill did not \nsurvive the final bill. While key GAO reporting provisions may have \nbeen removed from the final bill, I wish to take this opportunity to \ninform my colleagues and the FDA that I personally intend to pursue \nthis oversight analysis outside of this bill. Just because it is not in \nthis bill does not mean I am going to go away.\n\n  What has happened is that speed has trumped policy--the attempt to \nspeed through this bill, the attempt to get it done before the Supreme \nCourt announces its decision on ObamaCare. I have yet to have anybody \nexplain to me why we are benefited by moving this before the Supreme \nCourt ruling. If somebody has a concern that there is something in the \nbill that might be affected by what the Supreme Court ruling is, would \nwe not be smart to delay this until after the ruling to see if there is \nsome adverse reaction to what we have done? If I thought there was any \nreason to do that, I would be on the Senate floor pleading with my \ncolleagues today. But the truth is that there is nothing that will come \nout in the Supreme Court decision that will affect the user fee \nrelationship between drugs, devices, biologics, generics, and the Food \nand Drug Administration. But somebody wanted to finish it, and they set \nthat as the goal that everybody could see.\n  (Mr. FRANKEN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BURR. Because of the hard work of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, the final bill includes new incentives intended to help spur \nthe next generation of lifesaving antibiotics. This is a good thing, \nand my colleagues should be commended for their bipartisan work on this \nimportant issue.\n  Unfortunately, the requirement for the FDA to submit a strategy and \nimplementation plan that would have helped to ensure greater regulatory \ncertainty and predictability regarding FDA's work with antibiotics was \nnot included in the final bill. Yet we have all watched stories on TV \nabout a young lady who was attacked by a virus that has eaten her hands \nand her feet--an infection. What does she need? She needs a \nbreakthrough in antibiotic therapy.\n  This was a real opportunity for us to send a message out there that \nnot only are we committed to doing it, we are committed to setting up a \nregulatory structure that allows it to happen.\n  Carefully drafted GAO reporting requirements intended to help FDA and \nCongress identify progress against regulatory challenges in this space \nhave also fallen away. This had nothing to do with Richard Burr or \nMichael Bennet, this was the General Accounting Office. Unfortunately, \nthe reporting requirement that remains is not nearly as robust as the \nlanguage passed by the Senate earlier this year. These requirements \nwere intended to help identify and root out the regulatory challenges \nin this space to ensure that the incentives included in the final bill \nare as meaningful as possible and ultimately do achieve the goal of the \nnext generation of novel antibiotics reaching patients. I cannot think \nof anything more important than for us to make sure.\n  I know the Presiding Officer comes from a State where devices are a \nkey part of the economy.\n  Another reporting requirement that fell away is one my colleagues \nhave heard me talk about a lot over the past year. The medical device \nuser fee agreement includes reporting on the total time to decision in \ncalendar days, not FDA days. This sounds a little bit like Disney \nWorld. What in the heck are FDA days? I know what calendar days are. \nTomorrow is going to be one number higher than today, and yesterday was \none number lower, and every 28 to 31 days, we switch and it becomes a \nnew month and we start counting again. Not at the FDA. That is why it \nwas important that calendar days be substituted for what we call FDA \ndays at the FDA. Patients do not care about FDA days; patients care \nabout how long it takes in calendar days for safe and effective \nproducts to reach them.\n  My colleagues may recall that last year the final Agriculture \nappropriations bill included a requirement for the FDA to report on \ncalendar days because knowing the average number of calendar days it is \ntaking FDA-approved therapies to reach patients is important for \nensuring that we see the full picture of how well the FDA is working in \na metric that the American people understand.\n  Last year, when the Senate considered the issue of counting calendar \ndays for medical products, Dr. Paul Howard, a senior fellow and the \ndirector of the Manhattan Institute's Center for Medical Progress, \ndescribed the importance of counting calendar days. He wrote:\n\n       The PDUFA clock stops when the FDA requests more \n     information from the sponsor . . . so repeated requests for \n     information from the FDA can significantly draw out the time \n     before a product reaches the market, even if the agency \n     completes its review within the specified PDUFA timeframe. . \n     . .\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\n     knowing actual calendar days that elapse from between the \n     time that a sponsor submits an application to the time it is \n     approved should give Congress some sense of how efficient--\n\n  How efficient--\n\n       the review process is. If the FDA is repeatedly asking for \n     more information and lots of time is added to the approval \n     process, it has important implications for patients (who wait \n     longer for new therapies) and investors (who may perceive the \n     regulatory process as arbitrary and time consuming).\n\n  Here again, another independent analysis of what should be important \nto the American health care system and an assessment that calendar days \nare absolutely vital to Congress's ability to understand how long it \nreally takes at the FDA. And we are not even the person trying to \nfinance the breakthrough.\n  I appreciate that the final bill will now require more granular \nreporting with respect to the prescription drug user fee agreement, \nwhich is a good thing, but I am baffled that a reporting requirement \nwhich Congress has supported in the past and which was included for \ngeneric drugs was not included in the final bill.\n  Talking about calendar days, how in the world could calendar days be \nimportant enough to put in the generic bill part and dropped from \neverything else? Why? Because FDA did not want it. FDA has gotten used \nto that little stopwatch they have. When they ask you for a little more \ninformation, they reset it, so they get to start again.\n  My dear colleague Tom Coburn and I both are disappointed that a \nprovision offered by him, and which I supported, was removed from the \nfinal bill.\n  I have talked about a number of things removed from the final bill. I \nam not sure how the ranking member gave me a number at the beginning \nthat I had interest in 12 things and that I had 11 accepted. I cannot \ncount them as I am going through my presentation, but I think I am on \nthree or four that have been dropped.\n\n  The medical device user fee agreement includes the requirement for an \nindependent assessment of FDA's management of devices. Unfortunately, \nthe assessment included in the prescription drug user fee agreement and \nfinal bill will look at only one-third of the FDA's work with drugs. \nLet me say that again. The medical device user fee agreement includes \nthe requirement for an individual assessment of FDA's management of \ndevices. Unfortunately, the assessment included in the prescription \ndrug user fee agreement and final bill will look at only one-third of \nthe FDA's work with drugs. Calendar days apply in one section. Generic \ndrugs do not apply, and devices, drugs, biologics. Now, all of a \nsudden, we have an independent assessment of FDA's management of the \ndevices industry where we are only applying that to one-third of the \narea of drug evaluation and not to generics and not to biologics.\n  Senator Coburn's provision, which was first introduced in a bill \nSenator Coburn and I introduced, the PATIENTS' FDA Act, would have \nensured an independent assessment of all of FDA's drug work. Upon \nintroduction of the PATIENTS' FDA Act, Dr. Paul Howard wrote that this \nprovision was ``perhaps the most important provision'' because ``the \noutcome of that review may or may not be welcome by the FDA--but it \nwill force Congress to pay attention and highlight the FDA's importance \nas the gateway for medical innovation not just in the U.S., but for the \nworld.'' Paul Howard is no relation to me. This is, again, an \nindependent doctor who makes a comment on a provision in an obscure \nbill that was introduced in Congress, and he says ``perhaps the most \nimportant provision.'' Yet it only applies now to one-third of the drug \narea, and all we wanted to do was to apply it to the whole thing. Not \nincluding this independent assessment is a missed opportunity for \nCongress, consumers, and patients to have a complete, independent, and \nobjective look at FDA's management of its mission and resources with \nrespect to drugs.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues are concerned about \noverreporting, but I would come back to the basic point that you do not \nknow what you do not measure. This is about how Congress and the FDA \nprioritize, and, given what is at stake, not including targeted \nreporting requirements that will help FDA to better achieve their \nmission on behalf of patients is a huge, huge missed opportunity. Why? \nSpeed over policy.\n  I would also like to talk about a key provision in the Senate's \nupstream supply chain provisions that is not included in the final \nbill.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the globalization of the drug supply \nchain presents unique challenges in ensuring the safety of the drugs \nAmerican patients receive. Quite a bit of time has understandably been \ndevoted to this issue. Unfortunately, while the bill includes many \nbipartisan provisions that will help FDA better target inspections of \ndrug facilities based on risk, the final bill falls short in addressing \nend-to-end supply chain security. That is sort of important. I think \nthe American people sort of take for granted that we have that in place \nnow.\n  In addition to not including bipartisan downstream provisions, the \nfinal bill does not include the Senate's bipartisan provision to \naccredit third-party auditors to conduct drug safety audits of drug \nestablishments. To be clear, these third-party drug safety audits would \nnot have replaced official FDA inspections, but they would have been an \nimportant risk-based tool for the FDA to leverage in taking steps to \nensure a safer global prescription drug supply chain. I actually \nbelieve that America thinks we have that in place right now. Who could \nbe opposed to such a commonsense solution? It was a bipartisan \ninitiative. Was it the House that kicked it out? Was it the FDA that \nkicked it out? It really does not matter. This was smart to have in the \nbill. The only conclusion I can come to is that speed trumps policy, \nthat our quest to get this done quickly meant we did not look closely \nenough at the things we should have done and could have done and we did \nnot do.\n  Now, the ranking member talked about my disappointment and his \ndisappointment on the downstream drug distribution security. I want to \ntake a brief moment and comment on downstream. I thank Senator Bennet, \nfrom the other side of the aisle. We worked together. And because of \nhis hard work and dedication to this issue, I think I can say that we \nare both disappointed that the final bill does not include bipartisan \nprovisions that we have been working on together for the past few \nmonths.\n  My colleagues all know why this is an important issue. It is \nimportant for America's patients and consumers.\n  I remain committed to establishing a workable and reasonable \ntraceability system that strengthens the integrity of the \npharmaceutical distribution supply chain. It is critical that we \nreplace the current patchwork of inconsistent, inefficient, and costly \nState laws with a predictable, workable, and appropriate Federal \nstandard. I am committed to getting this done.\n  As I said to the ranking member and the chair, it is not going to be \neasy. We knew that when we took this on. You can't do it fast. I did \nnot know we had a stopwatch on how quickly we could get this bill \nthrough the Senate and how quickly we could get through conference and \nhow quickly we could get it passed. I remind my colleagues that the \ncurrent user fee agreement does not expire until later this year. It \ndid not have to be done now, but it was. And for now 45 minutes I have \npointed out things we could have done, should have done, and did not \ndo, and it is embarrassing. This could have been done. This was the \nright vehicle to put this in because it was a must-pass piece of \nlegislation.\n  Now let me, if I could, talk about some of the provisions Senator \nCoburn and I introduced in the PATIENTS' FDA Act. I am pleased we were \nable to find a bipartisan path forward on some of these provisions \nwhich will put in place an unprecedented level of transparency and \naccountability at the FDA.\n  While FDA should have already done many of the things that will now \nbe explicitly required of them, by ensuring that we hold FDA \naccountable to measures and reports on specific requirements, there is \na greater chance that they are going to actually get done. There is no \ncertainty without congressional oversight. Greater transparency and \naccountability provisions included in the package today will help to \nensure greater regulatory certainty and timely decisions on behalf of \nAmerica's patients, which is key to ensuring that America maintains its \nrole as a world leader in medical innovation and that\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\nour patients have access to the most cutting-edge therapies in as \ntimely a fashion as possible.\n  FDA will be required to develop a regulatory science strategy and \nimplementation plan with clear priorities and report on the progress \nmade in achieving these priorities in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year \n2016. The current FDA Commissioner has acknowledged that the FDA is \nrelying on 20th-century regulatory science to evaluate 21st-century \nmedical products.\n  Let me read that again. The current FDA Commissioner has acknowledged \nthat the FDA is relying on 20th-century regulatory science to evaluate \n21st-century medical products. Let's stop. Let's get this right. Even \nthe Commissioner of the FDA is saying: You know what. We are not even \nin the same century in how we do what we are trying to accomplish. In \nother words, the products the FDA is required to regulate are advancing \nfaster than the agency's ability to regulate them. I will be honest. \nThat is a big problem.\n  Former FDA Commissioner von Eschenbach was right when he said that \nthe FDA must be capable of ensuring that its reviewers know just as \nmuch about advances in emerging sciences as the creators of the \nproducts they regulate.\n  Listen, I will be the first to say that at the Food and Drug \nAdministration we have some of the best and the brightest. They are \nsome of the most dedicated Federal workers. They are some of the \nsmartest folks I have ever seen. But they process approvals. They are \nnot on a bench doing research and development. They do not understand \nhow medicine and science have changed since they themselves left the \nbench. There is every reason to believe that people should be required \nto go back and be innovators and not necessarily make a lifetime of \nwork as a reviewer at the FDA.\n  There has been much talk about regulatory science, but it is hard to \ntell if these efforts are targeted and achieving the desired results of \nhelping the FDA to apply the most cutting-edge scientific tools in \ntheir research and their review of medical products. The agency must \nhave clearly defined goals and metrics against which their progress \nwill be tracked. This is the only way to ensure that the advances in \nregulatory science are being applied and that FDA is prepared to \nregulate the most novel and cutting-edge medical products ever created.\n  GAO has well documented FDA's management challenges. The user fee \nagreement included in the final bill will further increase these \nchallenges by adding more than 1,200 new FDA FTEs, or employees, and \nfurther growing the scope of the agency's mission and regulatory \nresponsibilities.\n  Many of the concerns about the lack of predictability and uncertainty \nat the FDA are symptoms of unaddressed, systemic management issues. \nThis is the agency that regulates 25 cents of every dollar of our \neconomy.\n  A February 2010 GAO report found that FDA does not fully use \nestablished practices for effective strategic planning and management. \nFDA agreed with the GAO recommendation to take several actions to \nimprove FDA's strategic planning and management, such as the \ndevelopment of a strategic management plan and working to make FDA's \nperformance measures more results-oriented. I cannot think of a \nbusiness in America that does not do that today. However, 2\\1/2\\ years \nlater, FDA has failed to adopt many of the key recommendations.\n  To address this concern, the final bill requires the FDA to submit to \nCongress a strategic integrated management plan with specific \naccountability metrics as recommended by the GAO. Even though the FDA \nadmitted to the GAO, based on their recommendations, that they needed \nto do this and that they would do it, 2\\1/2\\ years later we are now \nputting it in statute in the user fee bill.\n  GAO has well documented FDA's challenges to sufficiently and \nsuccessfully utilize its information technology process. GAO has also \nnoted how these challenges undermine FDA's ability to use accurate and \ntimely information to augment its regulatory mission. GAO reports in \n2009 and 2012 found that the FDA has made mixed progress in \nestablishing the IT management capabilities essential to supporting the \nFDA's mission. That is the information technology. So an agency that is \non the cutting edge of medical approval in this country in 2009 and \n2012 was found to have made mixed progress in establishing the \nmanagement capabilities essential through technology to complete its \nmission.\n  A comprehensive IT strategy plan is vital for guiding and helping to \ncoordinate the FDA's IT activities. A comprehensive IT strategy plan, \nincluding results-oriented goals and performance measures, is vital for \nguiding and helping to coordinate the FDA's IT activities, especially \nsince the user fee agreement includes specific IT goals. The final bill \nrequires the FDA to report on their progress in developing and \nimplementing the comprehensive IT package called for by the GAO. To \nensure further congressional oversight, GAO will report on the progress \nFDA makes on meeting the results-oriented goals and performance \nmeasures set out in the IT plan they submit to Congress.\n\n  Enhanced reporting requirements with respect to biosimilars and \ngeneric drugs include key reporting on clearing the backlog of generic \napplications and will also provide important transparency in the FDA's \nwork and serve as an early-warning indicator if the agreements are not \nbeing fulfilled.\n  I am also pleased we were able to find a path forward on important \npro-patient provisions from the PATIENTS' FDA Act and provisions that \nwill also reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens for innovators. I wish \nto thank my colleagues, Senators Mikulski, Alexander, and Hagan, for \nworking with us to ensure that the unnecessary redtape does not get in \nthe way of meeting patients' unique medical device needs.\n  The custom device provision in the bill provides an important path \nforward to ensure that doctors are able to meet patients' most unique \nmedical device needs in as timely a manner as possible. The risk-\nbenefit framework included in the user fee agreement and codified by \nthe final bill will facilitate the balanced consideration of benefits \nand the risks of FDA's drug decisionmaking.\n  As innovators have increasingly turned to global markets and \nopportunities overseas, FDA's work with its global peer regulators has \ntaken on an even greater significance. FDA's work with its global \nregulatory counterparts to encourage uniform clinical trials standards \nwill optimize global clinical trials to ensure that the need to conduct \nduplicative clinical trials is minimized while FDA maintains the gold \nstandard for approval.\n  I wish to thank Senator Paul. I thank Senator Paul for working with \nme to ensure that we have optimized global clinical trial work and that \nFDA works with global peer regulators as much as possible to reduce \nunnecessary regulatory hurdles.\n  Senator Paul was a champion in the committee to say: Why don't we \naccept the data we get from trials in Europe for applications that are \nunder review for approval in the United States? And the answer I gave \nhim was that in 1997, when we wrote the food and drug cosmetic \nmodernization bill, we gave FDA the authority to do that. And now some \n15 years later it has never, ever, ever been used. As a matter of fact, \nthe FDA will not even consult with a company that says: Tell us how we \nneed to design our trial in Europe so you will accept our data. That \nhas not happened. But you know what. It has to happen in the future if \nwe want drugs to be cost-effective so people can afford them, if we \nwant innovation to happen here as well as over there. If innovation and \nthe place where it is ultimately approved is determined by whether you \ncan recover the costs of your investment, I will assure you we are all \ngoing to shop somewhere else for our drugs, our devices, our biologics, \nand even our generics. It will not be here unless we learn how to share \nthat data from continent to continent.\n  I wish to highlight some specific medical device regulatory \nimprovements. There may be any number of reasons a sponsor wants to \nconduct certain clinical studies that are not directly to the \nclassification or approval of medical devices by the FDA. However, some \nsponsors have noted the tendency of the FDA to effectively prejudge the \napproval of a medical device by basing its decision related to a \nrequest to conduct clinical investigations of a device on whether the \nFDA\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\nbelieves the clinical study will be adequate to support the ultimate \nclassification or approval of a device. If the FDA approves the \ninvestigational use of a device only using the more narrow regulatory \nstandard of device approval or classification, clinical research in the \nUnited States could be unduly restricted. The final bill would return \nthe investigational device exemption approval process to the standard \nauthorized by the statute, which is a good thing for both patients and \nfor innovators.\n  The final bill will also improve regulatory certainty, transparency, \nand accountability with respect to medical devices by requiring FDA to \nprovide a substantive summary of the scientific or regulatory rationale \nfor significant decisions.\n  As many of my colleagues know, section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act requires device manufacturers to notify FDA of their \nintent to market a medical device at least 90 days in advance.\n  Medical device manufacturers are required to submit a pre-market \nnotification if they intend to introduce a device into commercial \ndistribution for the first time or reintroduce a device that will be \nsignificantly changed or modified to the extent that its safety or \neffectiveness could be affected. Such change or modification could \nrelate to the design, material, chemical composition, energy source, or \nmanufacturing process. There are legitimate concerns about recent \nguidance issued by FDA that could significantly increase the regulatory \nburden related to 510(k) modifications without clear benefit to \npatients. The final bill will go a long way in restoring regulatory \ncertainty and balance with respect to the 510(k) modification process \nby making it clear that the 1997 guidance remains the standard until \nFDA issues new guidance, with appropriate input from stakeholders, on \nthis subject.\n  While I wish that we could have gone further to strengthen and \nimprove the device third-party review and inspection programs, the \nfinal bill does reauthorize these programs and includes a provision \nfrom the PATIENTS' FDA Act to set forth a process for reaccreditation \nand reauthorization of third-party reviews. This is a first and \nimportant step in enhancing the third-party review program.\n  Another thing we placed in the 1997 act is the hope that we would see \nacademia in America actually be approved as third party evaluators--not \nfor heart stints or that class of device, but how about things such as \nBand-Aids? How about those things on which we should not waste an FDA \nreviewer's time? Couldn't the company contract with an academic \ninstitution to reapprove and recredit? FDA chose to do that in-house. \nThis is the first important step to enhance the third party review \nprogram.\n  Next is affirming the ``least burdensome'' requirements.\n  Also, the final bill underscores the importance of the ``least \nburdensome'' requirements we put into the 1997 law to streamline the \nregulatory process and reduce burdens to improve patient access to \nmedical devices.\n  A central purpose of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA as I \nlike to call it, was to ensure the timely availability of safe and \neffective new products that will benefit the public and that our nation \ncontinues to lead the world in new product innovation and development. \nThe goal was to streamline the regulatory process and reduce burden to \nimprove patient access to breakthrough technologies. This law required \nFDA to eliminate unnecessary burdens that may delay the marketing of \nbeneficial new products, but the statutory requirements for clearance \nand approval remained the same. The sections of the statute that \ncapture these provisions are commonly referred to as the ``least \nburdensome'' provisions.\n  For years, FDA included ``least burdensome'' language in guidance \ndocuments and letters. Yet, toward the end of 2009 the ``least \nburdensome'' language disappeared only to reappear after Congress \nexpressed significant concern regarding FDA's failure to consistently \napply these requirements in its work with medical devices.\n  The lack of consistent application of the ``least burdensome'' \nrequirements has added to regulatory uncertainty and unnecessary \nregulatory burden in a manner completely inconsistent with the law. It \nis sad that Congress needs to reaffirm a provision that has been the \nlaw since 1997, but I thank Senators Klobuchar and Bennet for working \nwith me to underscore the importance of affirming the ``least \nburdensome'' requirements in the final bill.\n  The final bill restores a more appropriate balance to FDA's conflicts \nof interest rules. This is an issue on which many patient groups have \nweighed and many members have worked because of its importance to \npatients and, ultimately, overall confidence in FDA's Advisory \nCommittees. Ensuring that the FDA has access to the most qualified \nexperts is vital to ensuring FDA's scientific capabilities and \nconfidence in its regulatory decisions. It is critical that patients \nhave the benefit of the very best expertise when weighing decisions \nthat impact patient access to lifesaving products. Unfortunately, since \n2007, increasingly complex and restrictive conflicts of interest rules \nhave often resulted in the Agency being unable to consult with leading \nexperts and difficulty in filling key advisory committee positions. \nThese challenges are compromising the quality and timeliness of FDA's \ndecision-making. The final bill should help to address these concerns \nand ensure FDA can draw upon the most knowledgeable experts.\n  Lastly, I'd like to highlight the Advancing Breakthrough Therapies \nfor Patients Act, bipartisan legislation I was pleased to join Senators \nBennet and Hatch in supporting because it will ensure patients have \naccess to targeted, life-saving therapies as efficiently as possible. \nAs former FDA Commissioner Von Eschenbach has rightly stated, \n``breakthrough technologies deserve a breakthrough in the way the FDA \nevaluates them.'' This legislation is supported by Friends of Cancer \nResearch and the National Venture Capital Association.\n  Earlier this year, an op-ed penned by former FDA Commissioner, Dr. \nMark McClellan, and Ellen Sigal of Friends of Cancer Research, noted \nhow the sequencing of the human genome has helped to unlock an even \ngreater understanding of disease at the molecular level, helping to \nmake personalized medicine become a reality. They note two main goals \nof the breakthrough legislation: First, to reduce the total development \ntime and cost of the most promising ``breakthrough'' treatments; and \nsecond, to minimize the number of patients that would be given a \n``control'' regimen or a currently available treatment that doesn't \nwork well. They are right to underscore that in order to fulfill the \npromise of ``breakthrough'' therapies and this legislation, the \nregulators at FDA must be fully engaged, working with sponsors early on \nin the development and review process once a product has received the \nbreakthrough designation.\n  More than 45 organizations representing patients, advocates, \nphysicians, caregivers, consumers and researchers have weighed in with \nCongress urging the Advancing Breakthrough Therapies for Patients Act \nto be included in the final user fee package because they recognize \nthat employing such an ``all hands on deck'' approach at FDA for these \ntherapies will ultimately result in the most efficient development \nprogram and help to ensure that the most promising new treatments reach \npatients as safely and efficiently as possible.\n  Many would argue that the modernization of the accelerated approval \nand fast track pathways have been a long time coming since Congress has \nnot significantly updated either pathway since 1997. Earlier this year, \nDr. Paul Howard in writing about the breakthrough legislation noted \nthat, ``the most important section of the legislation may be the clause \nthat requires the Secretary of HHS to commission an independent entity \nto assess the 'quality, efficiency, and predictability' of how FDA has \napplied the directives in the legislation no later than four years \nafter the bill passes.'' He goes on to say ``that may be the best way \nto ensure that we won't have to wait another 15 to 20 years to \nunderstand how well the FDA is utilizing the authority granted to it by \nCongress.'' Unfortunately, this independent assessment did not make it \ninto the final bill. Speed trumps policy.\n  FDA faces unprecedented challenges today--challenges we could not \nhave\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\nenvisioned a generation ago. Yet FDA still regulates a decade ago, \nbased on the commission. The agreements and many of the provisions in \nthe final bill are intended to help address these challenges. \nUnfortunately, the final bill does not bring to bear all of the tools \nthat could have been included to ensure the greatest certainty, \ntransparency, and accountability for patients and taxpayers. This is a \nmissed opportunity.\n  I ask my colleagues where we will be if the provisions enacted as \npart of this bill--like the breakthrough therapy provision--do not \nachieve their stated purposes? Where will we be if Congress does not do \nour part to ensure accountability on the part of the Agency by carrying \nout consistent Congressional oversight?. Where will America's patients \nbe in five years? Will FDA's regulatory standard still be the global \ngold standard?\n  Will America still lead the world in innovation? Will the world's \nleading drug and device innovators choose to innovate in America, or \ncontinue the disturbing trend of exporting great innovation and good \njobs overseas in the continued face of regulatory uncertainty?\n  There are good provisions in this final bill, but more work remains \nto be done. America's patients and innovators are counting on Congress \nto conduct the proper oversight in the months and years ahead to ensure \nthat these user fee agreements, authorities, and new responsibilities \nare implemented and fulfilled consistent with the law. They are also \ncounting on Congress to complete the unfinished business of doing all \nthat we can to ensure that FDA fulfills its mission on behalf of \nAmerica's patients and our Nation's global leadership in medical \ninnovation is restored. I commit to my colleagues, constituents, and \nthe FDA that I intend to complete the unfinished business before us \nhere today.\n  Mr. President, you have been patient. At this time, I will yield to \nmy colleague Senator Paul. When he concludes, I will continue with the \n2\\1/2\\ additional hours I have reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                              Foreign Aid\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I am not a big fan of foreign aid. We have a \nlot of problems in our country. I don't see how we can send billions of \ndollars overseas when we have bridges falling down in our country. Two \nbridges in my State were impassable. One was hit by a boat and has been \nimpassable for 6 months. We have another bridge that is over 50 years \nold that was shut down for emergency repairs, and traffic stacked up \nfor miles. Yet we send billions of dollars overseas when we don't have \nenough to fix our own bridges. It doesn't make any sense. We borrow $1 \ntrillion a year from China to turn around and send it to some other \ncountry. It makes no sense.\n  I am not a big fan of sending our money overseas. But I am even less \nof a fan of sending our money to countries that don't seem to be our \nfriends. Pakistan has worked with us on the war on terror. But recently \nPakistan has chosen not to let any of our supplies--food and military \nsupplies--traverse Pakistan. Recently, Pakistan has said we owe them $3 \nbillion. We are giving them $2 billion a year, and they say we owe them \n$3 billion that is not included in that. Recently, Pakistan also said \nthey want to charge us $5,000 per container of food that goes across \ntheir land.\n  For years bin Laden lived contentedly right in the middle of Pakistan \nunderneath their noses. What is up with that? We are giving them $2 \nbillion a year and bin Laden was twiddling his thumbs there and they \nare not letting our supplies go across and they are demanding a past \npayment of $3 billion for who knows what and we continue to pay them.\n  Recently, it has gotten even worse. Dr. Shakil Afridi is a doctor who \nhelped us get bin Laden. Somehow his name was leaked. I don't know who \nleaked the name or if they were trying to puff themselves up and make \nthemselves look as if they were strongly fighting terrorism, but by \nleaking Dr. Afridi's name, he is now in prison in Pakistan for 33 \nyears.\n  Dr. Shakil Afridi is a Pakistani and they have put him in prison for \n33 years. His life has been threatened. If he is released--which I hope \nhe will be--his life has been threatened because his name is public. \nHow did it become public? Somebody leaked his name. This is \ninexcusable. If this came from within our government, whoever leaked \nhis name or this information should be held accountable. I mean put in \nprison in our country for leaking state secrets.\n  Dr. Afridi's name is now known in public, and he is being threatened, \nand his family is being threatened. Not only that, anybody around the \nworld who wants to help us stop terrorism, who is willing to stand and \nhelp America, is now threatened. Do you think people are going to want \nto help us if they know their names will be printed in the New York \nTimes? We have to have things that we don't divulge about people who \nare helping us. But Dr. Afridi is in prison for 33 years, and I am \ngoing to do what I can to free him.\n  We should not send Pakistan any more money. I say stop immediately. I \nam not saying take a small amount out next year; I say don't send them \none more penny this year or next year. Don't send any of the $3 billion \nthey want. We don't even have it to send to them. We have to borrow it \nfrom China. I would give them one chance. If they release Dr. Afridi, I \nwould stand down.\n  My bill was blocked. I tried to have a vote on it last week, and the \nleadership said: No, you won't have that vote. But we have a process \nwhere if you get enough signatures from Senators, you can ask for a \nvote and get it. That is where we are now. I have enough signatures to \nhave the vote.\n\n  I am going to be meeting with the Pakistani Ambassador, and meeting \nwith President Obama's State Department, and what I will tell them is \nwhat I am telling you. This is not a secret. If Dr. Afridi is not \nsuccessful with his appeal, which is coming up in the next 3 weeks, if \nhe is not released and provided safe passage out of Pakistan, if he \nwishes, then I will have this vote. And I defy anyone in this body to \nstand here and vote to send U.S. taxpayer dollars to Pakistan when they \nare treating us this way. So we will have a vote in this body on ending \nall aid to Pakistan immediately if we don't get some results.\n  This doesn't mean I don't want to have diplomacy with Pakistan. \nPakistan has been a friend over many years, and I see no reason to end \nthat. Pakistan has many elements that are pro-Western and that want to \nengage in the world. I am all for that. But we shouldn't have to buy \nour friends. We shouldn't have to pay a ransom. We shouldn't have to \nlavish them with taxpayer dollars.\n  In fact, I think it encourages a disrespect when you give people so \nmuch money. Let's let them earn our respect. Let's work with them. \nLet's be friends with Pakistan. Let's have diplomatic ties to Pakistan. \nLet's try to help each other. Terrorism doesn't help Pakistan. They are \nthreatened equally by it. I can list four Pakistani leaders who have \nbeen assassinated in the past 15 years. Why were they assassinated? \nBecause of radical elements in their own country. So they should be \nwith us in trying to stop extremism, on trying to stop this radicalism.\n  My words for the Senate today and for the American people are that I \nam watching out for your money. I realize we have needs here at home \nthat must come first, but also that I will force a vote on this. I am \nnot going to send any more of your money or try not to let the Senate \nsend any more of your money to Pakistan unless they are willing to \ncooperate, unless they are willing to be friends with America, unless \nthey are willing to release the man who helped us get bin Laden.\n  I will ask for a vote, it will come in the next few weeks, and I will \nkeep everyone in America up to date on this.\n  I thank the Senate for allowing me this time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Paul for relinquishing the \nmicrophone, and just for the purposes of Members who are planning, I \nthink\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\nwe will be about another hour. We will know shortly, and I will put \nthat word out, if in fact that is going to be the case, but I intend to \nmake sure everybody is able to make a 5 o'clock briefing.\n  I have spent the first hour talking about the FDA user fee agreement \nbill, the history of it, what this bill did, and a lot about how this \nbill came up short. I would like to jog in a few different directions \nover the next period of time.\n  Of great interest to me, and great interest to a lot of Members, is \nthe commitment we owe to our Nation's military heroes. Over four \ndecades ago, at one of the two Marine Corps bases in America--Camp \nLejeune in Jacksonville, NC--they experienced serious contamination of \ntheir water. That contamination is likely the worst environmental \nexposure incident on a domestic military installation in the history of \nthe country, both in the magnitude of the population potentially \nexposed to volatile organic solvents and the duration of the \ncontamination--estimated to be 30 years or longer, with hundreds of \nthousands of veterans, their families, along with civilian workers \nhaving cycled through Camp Lejeune from the busy years of World War II \nthrough the Vietnam conflict and into the mid 1980s as we rebuilt our \nmodern military.\n  During these decades, unbeknownst to the base residents, the wells \nfeeding the water supply on the base were drawing water from an aquifer \ncontaminated with industrial chemicals that were dumped on the base, \nsuch as the degreasing solvent TCE, a known human carcinogen; and \nanother carcinogen, benzene, from leaking underground fuel storage \ntanks; along with the dry cleaning solvent PCE; and a third human \ncarcinogen, vinyl chloride. The Navy and Marine Corps began to test \nsome of the base wells in the 1980s to comply with Federal regulations \nand, apparently, to also locate the source of various contaminations, \nyet it would take several more years and numerous warning signs before \nthe Navy finally decided it should shut the wells down in 1985 through \n1987.\n  As we know now, the Navy and Marine Corps had specific regulations of \ntheir own to maintain safe drinking water and test for contaminants. \nHad they adhered to their regulations, the many years of problems at \nCamp Lejeune might have been avoided. It is also important to note the \nsource of those contaminations should never have been in question, \nsince Lejeune's drinking water was then and is now solely derived from \nthe wells located within the perimeters of Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  In 1989, the EPA designated Camp Lejeune a Superfund site, and in \n1991 the CDC, via its Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease \nRegistry--or ATSDR--began a statutorily mandated study of the \ncontamination. Those studies continue to this day, in large part \nbecause the Navy's records of the contamination were not completely \nturned over to the ATSDR until 2009 and 2010. Scientists at the ATSDR \nand others involved in the review of the Navy's records have stated the \nlevels of certain contaminants recorded in well samples taken by the \nNavy were at such high levels they have never been seen before, and in \nmany cases they far exceed what we now consider to be safe levels for \ndrinking water.\n\n  The Veterans Administration is awarding disability benefits to \nLejeune veterans on a case-by-case basis today, but that is a slow and \nunpredictable process, while many are suffering without adequate health \ncare. It is my hope in the coming weeks we will finally pass critical \nlegislation in this Congress to require the VA to take care of these \nveterans and their family members. Many of them are ill from exposure-\nrelated conditions and have no other means of getting health care. They \nare rightly looking to the VA and to the Congress for help. If we can \nget this legislation passed, it will be a starting point on the road to \ndoing the right thing for those who have sacrificed so much for our \nNation.\n  I think it is absolutely a crime that some 40 years later we haven't \neven completed the studies to understand the severity of the problems \nwe have. I might add that some of the servicemembers and some of the \nfamily members who served at Camp Lejeune during this time are no \nlonger with us. It may be hard to reconstruct exactly why, but I can \nassure you, when some estimate there are 10 times the number of male \nbreast cancer cases from people who lived on that base during that \ntime, one might conclude it was a hotspot based upon its drinking \nwater.\n  My hope is this Congress will move forward with a very small initial \nstep, but also make a commitment to these family members and \nservicemembers to not quit until we do the right thing.\n  This week the Supreme Court is going to rule on the President's \nhealth care law. One would have to live under a rock not to realize it \nis going to happen Thursday morning at 10 o'clock. We have waited \npatiently every time the Supreme Court has rolled out their \nannouncement for the last 3 weeks of cases they have decided as the \nCourt comes to the end of their session this summer.\n  Two years ago, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Americans, ``We have to \npass the bill so that you can find out what's in it.'' Let me repeat \nthat: ``We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what's in \nit.'' It seems fitting that we stop and take stock of what the American \npeople have learned about the President's health care law over the past \n2 years.\n  The American people have found they can't afford the President's \nhealth care law. The Medicare Chief Actuary, in his final estimate of \nthe health care law, projected it will increase health care spending \nacross the economy by $311 billion. That is a 10-year number, but \nunderstand the President promised the health care law would reduce \ncost. It wasn't a goal. He promised it would reduce cost. \nUnfortunately, it has made things worse by increasing health care \ncosts. And I think the estimate given by Medicare's Chief Actuary is \nprobably a very conservative estimate--an increase of $311 billion.\n  Growth in U.S. health care spending will almost double by 2014 due to \nthe President's new law. This is at a time when we already are in a \nsituation where we are on a financially unsustainable path. The \npredictions the President's health care law would increase insurance \npremiums are already being felt by the American people. Depending upon \nwhere you live, who you are an employee of, and whether you buy your \nown insurance depends on how hard you have been hit, but there is \nnobody in America who has not seen their premium go up since Congress \npassed this health care bill that was supposed to reduce the cost of \nhealth care.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated the new law will increase \nhealth insurance premiums by 10 to 13 percent. This means a family \npurchasing coverage on their own will have to pay $2,100 a year more \nbecause of the President's health care law. And by the way, 10 to 13 \npercent is what many Americans have felt as an increase on an annual \nbasis.\n  New taxes. New taxes on lifesaving drugs, devices, and health plans. \nThink about that, with the hour I just finished. I talked about the \nfact Congress needs to be focused on the efficiencies of government, \nand how we bring innovative products, devices, pharmaceuticals, \nbiologics, and generics to the marketplace. Yet embedded into ObamaCare \nare new taxes on drugs, devices, and health plans.\n  The American people haven't felt this yet. At a time we are supposed \nto be passing legislation to bring down health care costs, not only \ndoes the Congressional Budget Office say this is going to increase \npremium cost, not only does the President's Chief Actuary--CMS is under \nthe executive side of government, not under Congress's authority--say \nhealth care spending across the economy, based upon the health care \nlaw, is going to be $311 billion, we have yet to kick in the new taxes \non lifesaving drugs, devices, and health plans, which will drive up \nconsumer cost and additionally drive up premium cost.\n  Just after passage of the new law in May 2010, the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office said:\n\n       Rising health costs will put tremendous pressure on the \n     Federal budget. In CBO's judgment, the health legislation \n     enacted earlier this year does not substantially diminish \n     that pressure.\n\n  The question is what were we thinking? And now we have the Supreme \nCourt that will decide whether this is constitutional. CBO's latest \nlong-term fiscal outlook notes that spending on\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\nhealth care has been growing faster than the economy for many years, \nposing challenges for Medicare, Medicaid, State and local government, \nand the private sector.\n  Sometimes this is missed by Members of Congress and our constituents. \nThere is a tremendous cost that we shift to States and local \ngovernments depending upon how they share in the Medicaid State \nobligations for cost sharing. States are picking up a tremendous amount \nof additional cost because of the passage of the President's health \ncare plan because we are doubling, through legislation, the amount of \npeople who are on Medicaid.\n  So now you are going to get hit by the increase in your insurance \npremium; you are going to get hit by the increase in overall health \ncare costs; you are going to get hit by the new taxes on lifesaving \ndrugs, devices, and health care plans; and, oh, by the way, you are \ngoing to get hit in your State taxes because of the increased burden of \nMedicaid beneficiaries who are in part funded by the State and are \ngoing to now require States to find new ways to raise revenue, which is \ntypically through our State taxes.\n  CBO was right to conclude that such rates of growth cannot continue \nindefinitely because total spending on health care would eventually \naccount for all the country's economic output, which CBO concludes ``is \nan impossible outcome.''\n  We need real reform that actually lowers costs, not increases costs. \nWe need real policy that institutes better outcomes, not rationing of \ncare. The American people need to look at what the President promised \nwhen he created this legislation. He promised: If you like your plan, \nyou get to keep it.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has estimated that up to 69 percent \nof all businesses could lose the ability to keep what they have as a \nresult of the administration's grandfather health plan regulation. The \nformer Director of CBO, Doug Holtz-Eakin, warned that the law \n``provides strong incentive for employers and their employees to drop \nemployer-sponsored health insurance for as many as 35 million \nAmericans.''\n  Well, if employers drop their health care coverage, how can employees \ncash in on the President's promise to keep what they have?\n  Millions of seniors will lose access to their Medicare Advantage \nPlan. I am not quite there, but some of my colleagues have reached that \nmagic number.\n  Do seniors not deserve choice? Is that what it is? Do we just want to \ngive them one thing and no choice? The truth is we allowed--we didn't \ncreate it; the private sector created it, but we allowed the private \nsector to create Medicare choice years ago, and for many seniors they \nchose to take the private sector product. Why? Because it provided more \ncoverage to them. It provided preventive care. They actually got \ncovered physicals every year. In many cases they didn't have \ncopayments. In many cases their prescriptions were covered long before \nwe created Part D Medicare.\n  So what does the President's health care plan do? It tightens the \nrequirements on Medicare Advantage to the point that some seniors who \nare on it today will lose it because it is no longer an option in the \nmarkets they live in. How in the world can someone do that and make the \npromise: If you like it, you get to keep it?\n  Health plans offered by religious-affiliated organizations will be \ncompelled to offer products that violate the tenets of their faith--a \nnew mandate that jeopardizes an employee's existing coverage and \ninfringes on religious liberty. That is going into ground we have never \nentered, and I think there is a reason we have allowed people to hold \nto their moral standards they believe are important.\n  Then-Speaker of the House Pelosi said the health care law will create \n4 million jobs--400,000 jobs almost immediately. Yet the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office testified that the new law will reduce \nemployment over the next decade by 800,000 jobs.\n  Think about that. Then-Speaker Pelosi said 4 million jobs--400,000 \nalmost immediately--and the CBO Director testified we are going to lose \n800,000. That is a difference of 4.8 million jobs in America.\n  The President said he was not going to touch Medicare. We heard that \nover and over. He said to seniors: I am not going to touch Medicare. He \nhad already taken Medicare Advantage away as a choice, but he wasn't \ngoing to touch Medicare. The law took more than $500 billion out of \nMedicare, a health care plan that today is not financially sustainable, \nand the President, in his health care legislation, shifted $500 billion \nout of Medicare--not to put Medicare on a sustainable path but to fund \nnew government programs the American people cannot afford.\n  Arbitrary cuts to providers that jeopardize access to care will not \nput Medicare on a sustainable path for current and future retirees. \nWhat does that mean? Doctor cuts. We cut the reimbursements to doctors, \nwe cut the reimbursements to hospitals. We now have doctors who will \nnot see Medicare beneficiaries. If you are 65 and you move to Raleigh, \nNC, the likelihood is you are not going to find a primary care doctor \nthat is going to take you if you are on Medicare. To that person, to \nthat senior, that is rationing. I don't care how you say it. And the \nreality is this bill caused that.\n  The President promised no family making less than $250,000 a year \nwill see any form of tax increase. I just covered a second ago that the \nnew health care law is riddled with new taxes and penalties that \ndirectly fall on the middle class and will harm small businesses. New \ntaxes on lifesaving drugs, devices, and health plans are all going to \nbe passed on to consumers. It is disingenuous to say everybody in the \nsystem is not going to feel the effects of taxes. They might not be \ndirectly on us, but they are on the products that constitute our health \ncare system. We should be advancing policies that help small business \nto thrive in America, not policies that increase health care costs. We \nshould not be advancing policies that encourage innovators to export \ninnovation and good-paying jobs overseas. We should be advancing \npolicies that focus on helping to get our economy back on track.\n  Unfortunately, the President's health care law does just the \nopposite. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Survey on Small \nBusiness, 74 percent of small businesses said the health care spending \nlaw makes it harder for their firms to hire new workers. Thirty percent \nsaid they are not hiring due to the law.\n  There is only one issue in America: How do we get the American people \nback to work right now? How do we turn this economy around right now? \nWe can have all the cuts we want to have from the standpoint of \nspending. But unless we are willing to put Americans back to work and \nget them productive and participating in the revenue collection of this \ncountry, we are not going to get on a pathway to financial \nsustainability.\n  This country wasn't created because people came here and said: Let's \ncreate a place called America where everything is free. It was created \nas an area of unlimited opportunity. That is why millions a year come \nhere, for unlimited opportunity, not for unlimited handouts.\n  When de Tocqueville left the United States, he talked about ``the \ngreatest country in the world,'' and he defined it this way: the \ncapacity of the American people to give of their time and their \nresources for people who are in need. He never mentioned State or \nFederal Government.\n  He talked about a responsibility of the American people to help \nsomebody that was down on their luck, hungry, homeless. Do you know \nwhat. For those of us who are adults, it is our responsibility to set \nthe example for the next generation to come and assume the same \nindividual responsibility. But now it seems as though all we talk about \nis legislation that inserts the Federal Government or the State \ngovernment or the local government in the place of what historically \nmade this country great, which was our willingness to assume the \nresponsibility ourselves.\n  Let me assure you, we shouldn't be surprised by the results of the \nassessment that the government running health care means job loss and \nincreased costs. We have to make sure we provide more choice, not less \nchoice. We have to get the American people engaged in negotiating their \nhealth care costs, not letting the Federal Government negotiate their \nhealth care costs.\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\n  I came here for the first time 18\\1/2\\ years ago. I worked for a \ncompany of 50 employees. I came to the U.S. House of Representatives \nand chose the same plan I had with that small employer in Winston-\nSalem, NC. The only difference was that when I got here, the Federal \nGovernment paid 75 percent where my employer had paid 75 percent. I \npaid 25 percent here; I paid 25 percent there. I got exactly the same \nplan and the same coverage. Everything was identical.\n  When I left Winston-Salem to become a Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, my cost of that health care plan was $105. When the \nFederal Government got through negotiating my same health care plan, it \nwent up to $160. I knew on day one I did not want the Federal \nGovernment negotiating my health care because it meant higher prices \nand no change in coverage.\n  I think many Americans have realized that about ObamaCare. My hope \nand my plea and my prayers are that Thursday the Supreme Court \nnullifies this bill and this Congress is challenged with going back and \nstep by step or in a comprehensive fashion write a health care bill \nthat includes the participation of the American people and puts \nresponsibility on everybody. Everybody in America should have the \nresponsibility to pay something when they go in to access it. It \ndoesn't matter whether it is private insurance, it doesn't matter \nwhether it is Medicare, it doesn't matter whether it is Medicaid.\n  If we want to solve the financial hole we are in in this country, \nthen we have to income-test everything that comes out of the Federal \nGovernment. It means people who have more pay more. It means people who \nhave less pay something. But we have to be a country of unlimited \nopportunity and not of unlimited handouts.\n  A February 2012 Gallup survey found that 48 percent of small \nbusinesses are not hiring because of the potential cost of health care. \nStudies indicate that the law's innovative tax killing on medical \ndevices could cost an additional 43,000 jobs in America. The \nPresident's health care bill is the wrong prescription for America.\n  Regardless of the Supreme Court's decision this week, it is clear: We \nmust advance commonsense sustainable reforms that actually fulfill the \npromise to lower health care costs. Without that America should be \noutraged and, I believe, will be outraged.\n  Also in the news in the last several weeks is an issue that is \nsomewhat personal to me as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, as a former member of the House Intelligence Committee, as \none who has dealt with the work of the Intelligence Committee since the \nyear 2000, and as one who lived up close and personal with everything \nthat has happened since 9/11. We have seen an incredible spree of \nsecurity leaks--leaks of classified and sensitive information.\n  When I go home on the weekends and there is a news report on \nsomething, my wife will look at me and say: Why is this reported? There \nis no reason for the American people or for anybody in the world to \nknow about that.\n  I can tell you it was not that long ago that even if the press found \nout, they would never print it. Today, routinely there are leaks of \nclassified and sensitive information. Recently there has been a series \nof articles published that have described, in some cases in extreme \ndetail, highly classified unilateral and joint intelligence operations.\n  I am not talking about suggesting that it might be there without \ndetail, I am talking about specifics of what happened. To describe \nthese leaks as troubling and frustrating is an understatement. They are \ninexcusable by whomever. Our intelligence professionals, our allies, \nand, most importantly, the American people, deserve better than what \nthey have seen over the last several weeks. I am personally sick and \ntired of reading articles about sensitive operations based on ``current \nand former U.S. officials--individuals who were briefed on the \ndiscussions--officials speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss \nthe clandestine programs--a senior American officer who received \nclassified intelligence reports--according to participants in the \nprogram--according to officials in the room--and individuals none of \nwhom would allow their names to be used because the evidence remains \nhighly classified and parts of it continue today.''\n  That is the basis on which these front-page stories run. I am not \nconfirming or denying that anything in it is accurate or inaccurate \nbecause as a member of the committee I sign an obligation that says no \ncovert action will I even comment on. Any person who holds a secret \ncompartmentalized clearance has an obligation to never acknowledge the \nexistence of a program.\n  I asked, not long ago, was the drone program still a classified \nprogram? The answer I got is yes. But the White House Press Secretary \nfor the last 3 weeks stood at the podium and talked about drone \nattacks--on a program that I technically cannot go out and acknowledge \neither exists or does not.\n  Our freedom, with understanding that politics trumps security, has \nreached a new level. It has to stop and it has to stop now. The \nunauthorized disclosure of classified intelligence at best violates \ntrust and potentially damages vital liaison relationships and at worst \nit gets people killed. Clandestine operations are often, as I wrote \nwith Senators Coats and Rubio in the Washington Post, ``highly \nperishable and they depend on hundreds of hours of painstaking work and \nthe ability to get foreigners to trust our Government. I strongly \nbelieve that these leakers are also violating the trust of the most \nimportant constituency of all--the American people.''\n  Even more troubling is that there appears to be a pattern to these \nstories and leaks, that they may be designed to make the administration \nlook good on national security. It used to be that the good stuff was \nburied by the media and the worst was run. Not anymore. Truth be told, \nrarely have I seen a story that paints this administration in a bad \nlight. Then, when we are about to, the administration invokes executive \nprivilege. They can do that. That is OK. But there is a big difference \nbetween invoking executive privilege on not producing documents for \nFast and Furious, and releasing classified information that puts at \nrisk individuals who are embedded in terrorist organizations, who are \ndoing their job to keep America safe.\n  This has crossed the line. I wish this administration was as \nconcerned about preventing leaks of classified information as it is \nabout keeping a lid on the information Congress is asking for. As a \nmember of the Senate Intelligence Committee I understand firsthand the \ngrave importance of keeping information secure. The unauthorized and \nreckless disclosure of classified information undermines the hard work \nof our intelligence officers and puts lives at risk, and it jeopardizes \nour relationship with overseas partners. Congress's intelligence \noversight committees will not tolerate it, nor should the American \npeople.\n  Simply, I come to the floor today to deliver a message to those \nindividuals who were briefed on the discussions, who were part of the \nprogram, who were in the room, who are speaking on condition of \nanonymity: Stop talking. Whatever agenda you have, I can assure you it \nis not worth the damage you are causing and the lives you are putting \nat risk. We cannot continue to tolerate leaks at any level or branch of \ngovernment.\n  My colleagues and I are considering every available legislative \noption to ensure the security of the intelligence community operations \nand the people who support them. If you have access to classified \ninformation and are tempted to leak that information for whatever \nreason, I ask you to remind yourself what you may be hurting and what \ntrust you are violating and, more importantly, keep your mouth shut.\n  The Intelligence Committees on both sides of the Hill I think will \ntake action in their authorization bill to try to address a structure \nthat brings a new level of oversight and hopefully prosecution to those \nwho choose to leak secrets. In the interim, I am still considering the \nfact that for any person who openly talks about a program that is \nsecret or compartmentalized, the day they say one word about that \nprogram they lose their top secret clearance. I would love to see them \nlose their pension but I understand how problematic that is. But at \nleast we can stop the bleeding by taking away their access to the \nconversations or the meetings they happen to be a participant in or the \ninformation they happen\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\nto be entrusted with in a fashion that allows them to go out and \npublicly talk about that and jeopardize the lives of Americans, the \nlives of our partners and, more importantly, the security of the \nAmerican people.\n  On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of \nthe United States for the first time in our history and they cited out-\nof-control debt and lack of a serious plan to address it as its main \nreason. Nearly a year later the administration has done nothing to \nremedy this problem. As a matter of fact, sometime at the end of this \nyear we are going to run out of our ability to borrow money. It is \ncalled the debt ceiling. I cannot tell you today, because we are not \ntold, whether that is going to happen in October, November, December, \nJanuary--but it doesn't go much past the end of the first of the year. \nI sort of pity the next President, whoever that is. They are probably \ngoing to get inaugurated one day and the next day they are going to \nhave to come to Congress and ask for a $3 trillion increase in the \nnational debt.\n  As difficult as it is for me to say, we are going to have to do it. \nThe country has to have the capacity, the capabilities to borrow money \nto function. But you would think with this all known we would take the \nopportunity now to begin to change the grotesque spending habits, to \nbegin to prioritize the investments we make, that we would attempt to \nreform the programs that cost us the most and lead to an unsustainable \nfinancial future for the United States--a country that will soon be \n$17.8 trillion in debt, a debt I will not be here to pay back but my \nchildren and my grandchildren will.\n\n  You have to ask yourself as a parent: Is that fair? The answer is it \nis not. Instead of doing anything, last year the debt ceiling needed to \nbe increased by $2.1 trillion. We are about to blow through it. Why? \nBecause we spend $1 trillion more on an annual basis than what we \ncollect. There is no business, no family, no institution in the world \nthat could spend $1 trillion more than they collect and be in \nbusiness--nor can this country. The time is running out.\n  By the way, it is hard to put a calculation on $1 trillion. What is \n$1 trillion? It is 100 percent of the Federal investment in K-12 \neducation, 100 percent of the Federal investment in higher education, \nit is 30 percent of the VA budget, it is 100 percent of the National \nInstitutes of Health; it is 100 percent of the cost of the National \nScience Foundation, it is 100 percent of the Federal partnership with \nStates and localities for infrastructure--bridges, roads, sidewalks. It \nis 100 percent of our national defense, it is all branches of the \nmilitary, active and reserve, all bases of the military, domestic and \nforeign. It comes up to about $942 billion. If you want to balance this \nyear's budget you have to cut everything I just talked about and find \n$60 billion more, just to balance this year's budget.\n  The take-away from this is we are not going to delete our national \nsecurity. We are not going to decrease our investment in the National \nInstitutes of Health, National Science Foundation. We are going to be a \npartner in K-12 and higher education. There are a lot of places we can \ncut and should prioritize and we can do it, but the take-away is we \ncan't get there unless we are willing to reform entitlements, unless we \nare willing to look at where the majority of the money is spent. We \ncannot get there.\n  We have to do something. I tell you it starts with addressing the \nimbalance we have in spending and collection right now--not next year.\n  Consistent with this is the Senate still has not passed a budget. In \nfact, the President's own budget did not receive a single vote in \nCongress when we voted on it. I should not laugh. We are on track for \nanother year with a $1 trillion deficit. How could anyone run their \ncompany on an annual basis without a budget, without a financial \nroadmap as to what they do? But now, for over 1,000 days the U.S. \nSenate has not passed a budget. And the law says we have to do it. That \nis incredible. It is absolutely incredible. Over the last 3\\1/2\\ years \nwe have added $5 trillion to the national debt, more than in the \nprevious 8 years combined, and current estimates by the CBO put Federal \ndebt at 70 percent of our gross domestic product by the end of this \nyear.\n  We are reaching irreversible levels of debt, as it relates to the \nsize of our economy. It is unsustainable and it is dangerous for the \nfiscal health of our country. The status quo needs to change. Congress \nneeds to address the impending fiscal cliff or risk another downgrade \nin the coming months.\n  We can accomplish this by passing a budget that moves us toward \nbalance. We can accomplish this by reforming entitlements and not \nputting Band-Aids on issues for another time. Our debt will begin to \ndecrease when we put the American people back to work and we get \npolicies in place that encourage the investment of capital.\n  How about something novel? Why don't we reform our Tax Code? Give me \nthe ability to go to a small business in North Carolina and tell them \nthey are going to pay exactly the same thing GE pays. It is hard for me \nto explain how they pay 36 percent and GE paid nothing. I am not \nfaulting GE, don't get me wrong. That is exactly what the Tax Code \ncurrently says. That doesn't make it right. It doesn't mean we have an \nobligation to leave it like that in the future. I look at it as an \nopportunity for us to bring equity. But as we bring equity, why don't \nwe bring everybody's obligation--their rates--down. It is time for us \nto reform individual corporate taxes in America, to do away with \nloopholes and deductions, to flatten the rates for everybody, to \nbroaden the participation by more Americans. Guess what. If we do that, \nwe will be like a magnet for global capital. What does it take to \ncreate jobs in the United States? It takes an investment. Reform the \nTax Code, flatten the rates, broaden the base, and we will attract \ncapital that will flee to America and create jobs like we have never \nseen. At a time where the world continues to try to figure out how to \nget out of a hole, we have an option to do it.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBurr have the time until 4:40 p.m.; that I be recognized for up to 5 \nminutes, following the remarks of Senator Burr; further, that after my \nremarks, all remaining time be yielded back, the motion to concur with \nan amendment be withdrawn, and the Senate proceed to vote on adoption \nof the motion to concur in the House amendment to 3187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator from Iowa. So I just gave us a recipe \nfor solving our economic crisis in America. Some might say it will not \nwork. I don't know. I think it will. I can say this. What we are doing \nis not working. We are not putting anybody back to work. We are still \nlosing. My State of North Carolina has 9.4 percent unemployment. How \nlong does it have to continue before we look at it and say this might \nbe a systemic problem? Can we recover from this?\n  How many law school graduates can we look at this year where 60 \npercent of the class of graduates from the first of May to the end of \nJune doesn't have a job? As a parent, I always thought the toughest job \nwas to make sure my kids got in school and that they graduated in 4 \nyears. Now the greatest burden on a parent is to make sure when they \nget out, they get a job that has a paycheck and maybe that check puts \nthem in a situation where they are self-sustainable. That is not the \npromise we made to our kids and that ought to be the driving force \nbehind every adult in this country demanding a change.\n  Most of our kids did exactly what we asked them to do--stay in \nschool, make good grades, go to college, get a major. If they do that, \nthey will be guaranteed a job and an unlimited future. Now the seniors \nwho graduate from college who are not finding a job, their experience \nis being questioned by their little brother or sister at home who is \nstruggling to get through high school and wondering why they want to do \n6 more years of education if their older sibling can't find a job.\n  It doesn't have to be like this. All we have to do is muster up the \nbackbone we need to pass legislation that creates the atmosphere for \ncapital to be invested in job creation.\n  I am not rich, but I am getting tired of us dividing America in as \nmany\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\npieces as we can divide it. We already divide it based on political \nboundaries. Now we are trying to divide it on everything we can find. \nYet for every politician when they give that big speech on TV, they \nboil it down to this is about America. But when we look at the campaign \nrhetoric out there, they slice it and dice it and try to divide it in \nmany ways. Let me assure everyone, we are not going to solve this if \nAmerica doesn't solve it. It is not going to be solved in the Halls of \nCongress unless the American people demand it. It is not just one \nsegment of America; it is all segments of America.\n  I talked about de Tocqueville's definition of the greatness of \nAmerica earlier. He didn't point out some Americans who did it good or \ndid it right. He looked at America as one.\n  As a matter of fact, when we look historically at this country--and I \nrealize I only have a couple minutes left; I will be brief. When the \nCapitol dome was torn off and the new construction started, it was \nbecause of the wing we are currently in, the Senate, and the identical \nwing that was built on the House side. When those wings were added, \narchitecturally, the dome that was on top of the Capitol was out of \nproportion, and that dome was called a Bulfinch dome. In about 1851 or \n1852, they started building the dome we see today, made of 9 million \npounds of cast iron. As that dome was about one-third of the way \nfinished, Abraham Lincoln was President, and they could actually watch \nthe Civil War battles across the Potomac on the other side of the \nriver.\n  Then came the end of the war and Lincoln was President and had every \nright to be punitive to the South because they lost. I challenge \neverybody to go back and read Lincoln's speeches after the Civil War. \nRemember, the first action was to let every southerner go and keep \ntheir gun because he knew they needed to eat. In every speech President \nLincoln gave after the end of that conflict where he could have in his \nremarks been punitive to the South, President Lincoln talked about one \nNation, one people. As the leader of the United States, he understood \nhis single job was to bring this country back together. Even though he \nprobably had the greatest reason to draw division in America, he \nrefrained from that temptation and spent all his time redefining what \nmakes America great; that is, a united country of people.\n  In the temptation to win elections and the temptation to show the \nhighlights or successes of one party over the other, I will conclude \nwith this: As leaders in the country, we have a real opportunity to set \nby example how we go forward. Let's quit the political divisions. Let's \nstart it with the two Presidential candidates. Don't slice and dice \nAmerica to where it is that group against this group and that group. \nLet's realize if we want to change the direction of this country, \nsomebody has to stand and bring America together. My belief is we need \nto do it now or there may not be another opportunity.\n  I can look at my good friend Senator Harkin and myself and we are at \nan age where we are not going to drastically change the future. We made \nthe bed we are going to sleep in. But for our children and our \ngrandchildren, the impact of what we do can drastically change the \nopportunities they have for a lifetime.\n  I would love to leave this institution believing we have had an \nimpact that extends prosperity and opportunity for generations to come. \nBut for a majority of the 2\\1/2\\-plus hours I have taken today, if we \ndon't have the backbone to take it on, it is not going to happen. If we \ndon't do it, nobody else will. Let's demand that the leadership we put \nin place is willing to show the leadership needed to bring this country \nback together for a common purpose. That purpose is to be a country of \nunlimited opportunities, where everybody is being treated fairly.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            New Antibiotics\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask to be recognized to engage in a \ncolloquy with my good friend from Iowa, the Chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Harkin.\n  I want to thank the Chairman for his leadership on this bill, the \nFood and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. This is a \ncritically important piece of legislation and I am proud to support it. \nI wanted to ask the Senator to clarify something for me regarding \nlanguage in the bill dealing with the development of new antibiotics. \nThis bill contains language to incentivize the development of \nantibiotics, both for newly-discovered infections where antibiotics do \nnot yet exist as well as for those resistant infections where currently \navailable antibiotic treatments may no longer work. These incentives \nare available for qualified infectious disease products, that is, \nproducts intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, \nincluding those caused by resistant gram positive pathogens and multi-\ndrug resistant gram negative bacteria. It is my understanding that \nproducts intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections \ncaused by gram negative anaerobic bacteria are also considered \nqualified infectious disease products, and therefore eligible for the \nincentives contained in this provision. Is that the case?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from New Jersey for the opportunity to \nclarify this point. The Senator is correct that this provision aims to \nprovide incentives in the form of extended market exclusivity for \ncertain antibacterial and antifungal drugs that treat serious or life-\nthreatening infections. He is also correct that the list of qualified \npathogens in the legislation is illustrative, and not exhaustive. \nProducts intended to treat serious or life threatening infections \ncaused by gram negative anaerobic bacteria would be qualified \ninfectious disease products and would therefore be eligible for the 5 \nyears of extended market exclusivity.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the Senator clarifying that point. As he \nknows, infections caused by gram negative anaerobic bacteria such as \nBacteroides and Garnerella have a disproportionate impact on women of \ncolor and cause an increased risk of HIV infection and complications of \npre-term labor. I am pleased that this bill takes the steps necessary \nto ensure treatments for these infections can come to market and help \nthose in need. Again, I thank the Senator for his leadership on this \nbill and for clarifying this point today.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about \nantibiotic resistance, a public health threat to Americans across the \ncountry. I have heard first hand from hospitals, health care providers, \npublic health officials, scientists, and life sciences companies in \nMaryland that we need new antibiotics in our arsenal. Bacteria, like \nviruses, are crafty and constantly evolving to thwart existing \ntreatments. Everyday, Americans are infected by multi-drug resistant \nmicrobes.\n  In most instances, antibiotics, much like vaccines, are not meant to \nbe used everyday to treat a condition for months, years, or a lifetime. \nYou use antibiotics sparingly, so you do not build up resistance. Yet, \ndrug development for these infectious pathogens can take just as long \nas developing any other drug whether it is for HIV, heart disease, or \ncancer. Because antibiotics are used for a short period of time, they \nare not really profitable to the companies investing the time and money \nto develop the product. There are not many small start-up companies or \nbig pharma companies that want to take the risk. Research and \ndevelopment costs hundreds of millions of dollars, so these companies \nare reluctant to invest in a safe and effective drug that doctors are \ntold to use sparingly. Bottom line, developing a next generation Viagra \npill is far more profitable for shareholders.\n  So, House and Senate Republicans and Democrats came together and \nworked on a bipartisan bicameral solution to incent development of \ndrugs to treat serious or life-threatening bacterial infections. We \nneed to get more antibiotics in the drug development pipeline. We are \nrunning out of antibiotics to treat MRSA, tuberculosis, acute pelvic \ninfections, complicated urinary tract infections, or complicated intra-\nabdominal infections. There are many anaerobic gram negative and \nanaerobic gram positive bacteria that are fatal, cause lifelong \ninjuries, increase the transmission of HIV and other sexually \ntransmitted diseases, or affect the reproductive and gastrointestinal \ntracts.\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\n  Title VIII of our bill, provides incentives for the development of \nantibiotics to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including \ninfections where tolerance and resistance to existing antibiotics make \nthem ineffective. We need to clear up infections that can cause poor \noutcomes for patients or negatively impact the public's health.\n  This bill will increase exclusivity for manufacturers that invest the \ntime as well as the research and development dollars to bring new \nantibiotics to the market that knock out infections that cause pre-term \nlabor or target bacterial infections in patients with unmet needs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased that Congress will finally \nsend to the President the bipartisan Food and Drug Administration \nSafety and Innovation Act, FDASIA. This legislation previously received \noverwhelming support in the Senate and was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives by a voice vote just last week. This final action by \nthe Senate will reauthorize the prescription drug user fee program and \nmedical device user fee which are set to expire on October 1, 2012. It \nwill also authorize two new provisions to allow the FDA to review and \napprove generic drugs and biosimilar drugs in a timely manner. \nImportantly, this bill includes several provisions that I have \nsupported to prevent access to dangerous drugs.\n  Passage of the FDASIA will help stop drug shortages that affect \nthousands of Americans. I have heard from a number of Vermonters \nconcerned about the uncertainty of availability of lifesaving drugs and \ndevices. While the FDASIA will not stop all drug shortages, I hope it \nwill give Vermonters who depend on these medications relief knowing \nmore steps are being taken to ensure these shortages don't happen.\n  This legislation also includes an important provision I have been \nproud to author to address the problem of counterfeit drugs. In March, \nthe Senate passed by unanimous consent bipartisan legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Grassley to deter the sale of counterfeit \ndrugs. The Counterfeit Drug Penalty Enhancement Act, S. 1886, has the \nsupport of groups such as the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies, the \nEaster Seals, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The legislation is \nconsistent with recommendations from the Intellectual Property \nEnforcement Coordinator and the administration's Counterfeit \nPharmaceutical Interagency Working Group. I am pleased that a \ncompromise version of this legislation will become law as part of S. \n3187.\n  I am also glad that the final bill includes important provisions \naddressing the issue of synthetic drugs. These provisions correspond to \nthree bills that the Senate Judiciary Committee passed last year--the \nCombating Dangerous Synthetic Stimulants Act, S. 409; the Combating \nDesigner Drugs Act, S. 839; and the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control \nAct, S. 605. I was glad to move these bills through the committee last \nyear and to work to try to pass them in the full Senate. They address \nsubstances commonly known as ``bath salts'' and other synthetic drugs \nthat have no legitimate use and can too easily be obtained under \ncurrent law. Bath salts have resulted in a number of reports of \nindividuals acting violently in the United States, including in \nVermont, and have led to injuries to those using them and to others.\n  I thank Senators Klobuchar, Grassley, Portman, and Schumer for their \nleadership on this issue. I was glad to be able to work with them and \nwith Senator Harkin to support including these important provisions in \nthe FDA bill and keeping them there in negotiations with the House. It \nis good that we are able to make real progress in this area.\n  I am also glad that we are moving forward on this issue in a \nresponsible way after appropriate consideration. Adding chemicals to \nschedule I of the Controlled Substances Act has serious consequences \nand is not a step that we should undertake without careful \nconsideration. We will continue to study this issue and consult with \nthe DEA, FDA, and others going forward.\n  I note also that Senator Paul has expressed serious concerns about \nthe mandatory minimum sentences contained in the Controlled Substances \nAct, mandatory sentences that are expanded every time we schedule new \nsubstances. I appreciate those concerns. As more and more of our \ncriminal justice budget goes to housing more and more people in prison \nfor ever longer periods of time, rather than supporting prevention \nprograms and law enforcement which can more efficiently and effectively \nreduce crime, we have to rethink our reliance on mandatory minimum \nsentences, particularly for nonviolent drug offenses. In the future, I \nintend to work with Senator Paul and others on this vital issue.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the final FDASIA includes language to \nprotect the public's ability to access information under the Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA. This bill will allow the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, to obtain important information about drug \ninspections and drug investigations undertaken by foreign governments, \nwhile at the same time ensuring that the American public has access to \ninformation about potential health and safety dangers. This provision \ncarefully balances the need for the government to keep some information \nconfidential, with the need to ensure free flow of information in our \ndemocratic society. A number of Senators, including Senator Harkin and \nSenator Enzi, and a number of open government and consumer groups, \nincluding OpenTheGovernment.org and Public Citizen, worked with me to \nprotect the public's access to FDA information in this bill.\n  Sending this legislation to the President's desk will save lives. The \nSenate's action will also mitigate the uncertainty facing the FDA \nshould these user fees expire. I am pleased to support this legislation \nand urge other Senators to do so as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we are about to move to a vote on the \nFDA reauthorization bill, a bill which I have said earlier we spent \nmore than 1 year working on in committee. It has had a lot of input \nfrom Senators on all sides, including industry stakeholders and \nconsumer groups. This is the result of a wide collaboration on all \nthese issues.\n  I wish to respond to a couple things my friend from North Carolina--\nand he is my friend--said earlier about the amendment he was concerned \nabout on the track-and-trace amendment. The Senator from North Carolina \ntalked about speed. He said we were rushing this through. The vote in \nthe Senate was 96 to 1. The House vote was unanimous. That doesn't \nhappen if a bill is being rushed through. Anybody who tries to rush a \nbill is not going to get 96 votes in the Senate or a unanimous vote in \nthe House.\n  Again, my friend questioned how hard we tried to get the track-and-\ntrace provision included in the conference report. I might turn the \nquestion around and question how hard the Senator from North Carolina \nand the Senator from Colorado worked to get this included. We have been \nworking on this bill for over 1 year. My friend, a good member of the \ncommittee, and his staff has been very much involved in many aspects of \nthis bill. So I wonder why the amendment was dropped on our staff 1 day \nbefore filing the bill at the midnight hour. I might also point out \nthat on September 14, 2011, our committee had a hearing on the supply \nchain issue. The record will show that I, the chairman, was the only \none to raise the issue of track and trace at that hearing.\n  Two weeks before markup, Senator Burr and Senator Coburn introduced \nan FDA bill. Senator Enzi's staff and my staff worked for 2 weeks to \nincorporate elements of this bill into the reauthorization. These are \nelements of the bill that were introduced 2 weeks before by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, Mr. Burr, and Senator Coburn. So our staff spent 2 \nweeks trying to incorporate elements into the bill, and they did. We \ndid incorporate a lot of elements. I would point out there was nothing \nthat mentioned track or trace that was in that bill that was introduced \n2 weeks before.\n  Again, I just say, if this was so important, why wasn't it in their \nbill? If it was so important, why did they wait until Sunday evening at \n6:20 p.m., the day before filing, to get the language? Again, who is \ntrying to rush what? We did not try to rush anything, but when we get \nsomething dropped in our lap at\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\n6:20 p.m. the night before the filing, it is hard to build a consensus, \nand that is what this bill is. We did go to conference on this, but \nthis issue involves a lot of different players, and we could not get \nthat consensus.\n  So I say to my friend from North Carolina, we are still working on \nthis. We will work on it in good faith, but we have the State of \nCalifornia, we have the pharmaceutical manufacturers, we have \ndrugstores, we have consumers, we have a lot of people out there who \nhave something to say about this, and we have to build that coalition \nin order to get a good track-and-trace bill through.\n  We are now about to vote on the critical FDA bill reauthorizing user \nfees, modernizing FDA's authority in several meaningful and targeted \nways, addressing the drug shortage problem, streamlining the device \napproval process, enhancing our global drug supply chain authority and \nall the while maintaining and improving patient safety. Because this \nbill will directly benefit patients and the U.S. biomedical industry, \nit is critically important to the agency, industry, and most important \nto patients that we get this done.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for final passage and pass this bill. It \nis the same bill the House passed unanimously. Once it is done here, we \ncan send it to the President and get it signed and move ahead with a \ngood reauthorization of the Federal Food and Drug Administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to concur \nwith amendment No. 2461 is withdrawn.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to concur in the House \namendment to S. 3187.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today, with final passage of the FDA \nSafety and Innovation Act and the reauthorization of the FDA user fee \nagreements, we have helped both the FDA and the biomedical industry \nensure that they can get needed medical products to patients quickly. \nThis legislation, now headed to the President for his signature, will \nensure that the FDA can swiftly approve drugs and medical devices, save \nbiomedical industry jobs, protect patient access to new therapies, and \npreserve America's global leadership in biomedical innovation. It will \nkeep patients safer by modernizing the FDA's inspection process for \nforeign manufacturing facilities, while also improving access to new \nand innovative medicines and devices. It will reduce drug costs for \nconsumers by speeding the approval of lower cost generic drugs and help \nprevent and mitigate drug shortages.\n  Finally, by improving the way FDA does business, increasing \naccountability and transparency, U.S. companies will be better able to \ninnovate and compete in the global marketplace.\n  With the FDA Safety and Innovation Act ready to be signed into law, \nwe have taken an important step to improve American families' access to \nlifesaving drugs and medical devices.\n  As I have said throughout this debate, the bipartisan process that \nproduced this excellent bill has been a shining example of what can be \nachieved when we all work together in good faith. I worked very closely \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as industry \nstakeholders, patient groups, and consumer groups, to solicit ideas and \nimprovements on the critical provisions in this bill. We have a better \nproduct thanks to everyone's input.\n  My colleague, Ranking Member Enzi, deserves special recognition, and \nI extend my sincerest gratitude to him. Without his strong leadership \nand cooperation in this open bipartisan process, we would not have the \nexceptional consensus measure we have today. So I thank Senator Enzi \nfor his partnership and collaboration throughout the past almost year \nand a half.\n  I wish to specifically thank the staff of Ranking Member Enzi, as \nthey have devoted countless hours to working with my staff and others \nthroughout this process to build consensus for this legislation.\n  I thank Frank Macchiarola, Chuck Clapton, Keith Flanagan, Melissa \nPfaff, Grace Stuntz, Katy Spangler, and Roley Swinehart. I sincerely \nthank them for their tireless efforts and loyal commitment to this \ncause.\n  I also thank all of the HELP Committee members as well as other \nSenate Members and their staffs who were thoroughly engaged with this \nprocess from the beginning as part of the bipartisan working groups. \nEach of you has contributed significantly to this legislation, and I am \nsincerely grateful for your contribution.\n  I also recognize Chairman Upton and Representative Waxman, as well as \ntheir staffs, who worked tirelessly to reconcile the differences \nbetween the Senate and House legislation.\n  Of course, I thank my own staff on the HELP Committee, who have spent \nmany a night and weekend with Senator Enzi's staff, other Members' \noffices, and our colleagues in the House working to come to consensus \non the critical policy issues in this legislation.\n  First of all, I thank our staff director Pam Smith, and I especially \nwant to note the tremendous work done by Jenelle Krishnamoorthy through \nthis last almost 15 months or more, for pulling people together and \nworking on weekends. I don't know how she does it, and she still has \ntime for the twins. It is remarkable, but she does it, and it is done \nremarkably well, and I thank Jenelle especially for her great \nleadership.\n  I also thank Elizabeth Jungman, Bill McConagha, Kathleen Laird, Dan \nGoldberg, Justine Sessions, Kate Frischmann, Elizabeth Donovan, Frank \nZhang, and Evan Griffis.\n  I also thank our former staff director Dan Smith, who left the \ncommittee as staff director a couple of months ago, but he was very \nmuch involved in this until the time of his departure.\n  I also thank the Congressional Budget Office for their knowledgeable \nand capable team that was willing to work around the clock sometimes to \nestimate the budgetary effect of the legislation.\n  We also owe our gratitude to the staff members in the Legislative \nCounsel's Office--specifically Stacy Kern-Scheerer and Kim Tambor. This \nbill is a result of tremendous effort by their team to draft and \nredraft provisions in this measure, as well as address technical issues \nwell into the nights and over weekends. I thank them profusely for \ntheir dedication.\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\n  This bill's final passage is a victory for millions of Americans who \nneed medicines or medical devices, a victory that would not have been \npossible without the dedicated work of our Senate family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 341, \nS. 2237.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 341, S. 2237, a bill to \n     provide a temporary income tax credit for increased payroll \n     and extend bonus depreciation for an additional year, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I made a commitment to proceed to a 5-year \nflood insurance bill following the farm bill. We have done that. It is \nthe right thing to do. It is an extremely important piece of \nlegislation. So I have lived up to that commitment. I had hoped the \nbroad support we have for this extremely important bill would allow us \nto reach an agreement and finish the bill in a relatively short period \nof time.\n  As everyone knows, the senior Senator from Arkansas has had some \nissues with the bill. I have suggested that he have a vote. From \ntalking to my Republican friends, they do not have a problem with that, \ngiving him a vote. Unfortunately, as happens around here more often \nthan I would like, we have not been able to reach agreement because a \nsmall group of Republicans is stopping us from doing this.\n  So my options are really very limited at this stage. I can file \ncloture and put at risk our ability to complete action on student loans \nand the Transportation bill. That is what it would do because if I file \ncloture, we will have to have a cloture vote on this on Thursday. And I \nwould have to file cloture twice because there is the bill and there is \nthe substitute, which everybody agreed was the right thing to do to \nmove forward on the substitute. That is two votes, so at least 60 \nhours. The flood bill is a very important piece of legislation. It is \nnot something we have to complete the day after tomorrow, but it is \nsomething we have to complete a month from now. So do I file cloture \nand put at risk these important pieces of legislation, meaning the \nTransportation bill, the student loans--put everything at risk--or I \ncan give supporters of this bill time to try to come to an agreement on \nlimiting the number of amendments.\n  I really believe the right thing to do is to give the people who want \nthis bill passed, Democrats and Republicans, people who support this \nextremely important piece of legislation, a day or two to figure out if \nthey can get something done. I hope they can. I honestly do. So I am \nnot filing cloture on this bill as I had really actually contemplated. \nI hope my Republican friends will work with us to get this bill done.\n  This is a bill that deals with flood insurance. I have spoken to a \nnumber of Republican Senators, including Senator Vitter, who is the \nperson who has spoken out on this more than anyone else, and he \nacknowledges that there may be a few relevant amendments that we should \nhave on this bill. I do not care. That is fine with me. Let's set up a \nlist of amendments and finish this bill. So I hope we can get that \ndone. I really do. We should not get in a legislative morass on a bill \nthat is extremely important for the country no matter what part of the \ncountry you live in. The dry deserts of Nevada, this is an important \npiece of legislation; the wetlands of Florida and Louisiana, very \nimportant piece of legislation. So I hope we can get this done.\n  Let me just say another word or two. I am very pleased to say that we \nare close to an agreement to prevent student loan rates from doubling \nfor 7 million young men and women. That would happen at the end of the \nweek. So I appreciate the leadership of President Obama. He has pushed \nforward on this for a long time. He has given many public statements in \nthis regard. He has been talking to students around the country. He was \nin New Hampshire yesterday talking to students. They waited in the rain \nto hear him talk. He has been working with leaders in Congress to \nensure that students will not pay the extra $1,000 to get a degree.\n  I would remind my colleagues, the Republicans, including the Speaker, \nmy friend, were willing to give up on this issue a few weeks ago. We \nare not willing to give up on this issue. I am glad my Republican \ncolleagues have agreed we should not give up on this issue. We do not \nwant to let the rates double. Leader Cantor even said Republicans were \ndone legislating. Remember that? But with the President's leadership \nand our persistence and the help of my valiant Republican friends, we \nare going to be able, with a little bit of good luck, to protect 7 \nmillion students. I hope that is, in fact, the case.\n  I appreciate the diligent work of the chairman of our committee, \nSenator Harkin. Senator Jack Reed has worked very hard on this, as have \nother Senators. I am leaving a few out, but I am certainly not doing \nthat intentionally.\n  I hope everyone understands the legislative issues we have to work to \ntoward the end of this week. I hope we can get it done. I hope we do \nnot get trapped in one of these Senate procedural bogs where we are \ngoing to have to be here Friday, Saturday. You know, I hope we do not \nhave to do that. There is no reason to. We can get all of our work \ndone, but we do need a little bit of cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n         Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate Senators Harkin and \nEnzi, their staffs, and all who worked for 15 months on this important \npiece of legislation. I have watched the Senate for a long time--first \nas a staff member and then as a Senator--and it has always been a \nlittle messy and complicated. There are always disagreements. That is \nthe purpose of the Senate, to work out arguments. But over the last few \nmonths, this Senate has done a much better job of operating in the way \nthe American people expect us to operate. We are all here to try to get \nresults after we state our positions. This bill especially affects the \nhealth and safety of millions of Americans. Almost every American \nfamily buys the prescription drugs and medical devices we are talking \nabout in this legislation. I am glad to see this happen for two \nreasons--one, because of the result, and two, because of the way the \nSenate has worked. It is a fine example of what I hope to see happen \nmore often.\n  I also thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the minority \nleader, Senator McConnell, for creating an environment in which we \ncould have a large number of amendments, debate, and discussion. I \nthink we all appreciate that very much and want to create an \nenvironment in which they can provide that kind of leadership.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Land Grant Universities\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on Monday, at the Library of Congress, \nwas the 150th anniversary celebration of the creation of land-grant \nuniversities and the National Academy of Sciences. The assemblage also \ntook a moment to throw a bouquet to Andrew Carnegie for founding so \nmany free public libraries.\n  I am on the floor to ask this question: What was in the water in \nWashington, DC, 150 years ago, in 1862 and 1863? During the 2 years \nafter the telegraph dispatched the Pony Express in 1861, Congress and \nPresident Lincoln enacted the Morrill Act creating land-grant colleges, \nauthorized the Transcontinental Railroad--reducing the time for getting \nfrom New York to San Francisco from 6 months to 6 days--as well as the \nNational Academy of Sciences, and enacted the Homestead Act. They also \nagreed on a conscription law with teeth, a National Banking Act, \nestablishing a national currency, a new internal revenue law, and \ncreated the Department of Agriculture. To top it off, on December 2, \n1863 the last section of the Statute of Freedom was put in place on top \nof the Capitol dome, with a great celebration.\n  Mr. President, if I were the Republican national chairman, I might \nsuggest that this transforming burst of governing was simply a matter \nof turning the government completely over to\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\nRepublicans and sending home half of the Democrats. By the end of the \n37th Congress in 1863, southern Democratic U.S. Senators could not \nobstruct any of these laws because their States had seceded from the \nUnion and they could not to vote. According to the Senate Historian, \nthat left 48 Senators voting at the end of that session--27 \nRepublicans, 12 Democrats, and 9 Unionists, oppositionists, or Senators \nwho called themselves the ``know nothings.''\n  Perhaps this burst of governing came from the energy of a new \npolitical party or the brilliance of the new President, Abraham \nLincoln, or maybe a Congress that was simply more efficient in those \ndays. The Morrill Act that created land-grant colleges passed both the \nSenate and House in the same week, in June 1862. The President signed \nthe bill into law 2 weeks later. The National Academy of Sciences was \nintroduced on February 20, 1863. It passed the Senate and the House and \nwas signed by the President all on the same day, March 3. Back in those \ndays, the President would obligingly travel down Pennsylvania Avenue \nand sit in an office in the Capitol waiting for bills to be brought to \nhim for signature.\n  Maybe it was a result of the state of the American condition at the \ntime--the absence of a 24-hour media, special interest groups, and \ninstant communication on the Internet. Or maybe it was that Members of \nCongress had more time to think great thoughts while traveling to the \nsessions. It would take Senator Sam Houston 6 weeks to travel from his \nhome in Texas to occupy his Senate desk in Washington, DC.\n  There is no doubt it helped that there was a crisis, the Civil War. \nAmericans have always risen to our best in the midst of a crisis. \nMaking the crisis worse, many thought the new President was \nincompetent. In January 1863, former Supreme Court Justice Benjamin R. \nCurtis ``reported general agreement on the utter incompetence of the \nPresident. He is shattered, dazed and utterly foolish.'' This is from \nDavid Herbert Donald's book ``Lincoln.'' The editor of the Cincinnati \nCommercial was more explicit when he wrote that President Lincoln was \n``an awful, woeful ass. If Lincoln was not a damn fool, we could get \nalong yet.'' The President, in turn, considered many of his generals \nincompetent. And he and Mrs. Lincoln were suffering a personal crisis \nat the time, grieving the death of their son, Willie. The war crisis \nclearly helped to enact transforming legislation in 1862 and 1863. One \nimpetus for passage of the law creating land-grant colleges was to \nprovide military training.\n  Among the first assignments of the National Academy of Sciences was \nto find some way to protect the iron hulls of the Union Navy warships \nfrom corrosion.\n  GEN Grenville Dodge told President Lincoln that the Transcontinental \nRailroad was a ``military necessity,'' even though Representative \nJustin Morrill, a visionary in other matters, said he saw no need for \nthe railroad to go further than the silver mines in Nevada because it \nwould only be traveling through uninhabited territories.\n  The war caused the bickering Republicans, who remained in Congress, \nto pull together. The editor of the Chicago Tribune explained:\n\n       [If we fail], then all is lost. Union, party cause, freedom \n     and abolition of slavery . . . let us first get the ship out \n     of the breakers, then court martial the officers if they \n     deserve it.\n\n  Mr. President, it helped to have a crisis.\n  Unfortunately, the formula for the passage of transforming \nlegislation 150 years ago is not neatly explained as a crisis, plus a \nbrilliant President, plus a high-minded Congress efficiently enacting \nbig ideas developed in Washington, DC. The real story is much more \nAmerican than that. As has usually been the case, these big American \nideas came from outside Washington, they took a long time in coming, \nand enacting them into law was a long and messy process.\n  Jonathan Baldwin Turner's address before the Illinois Teachers \nInstitute in 1850 proposed the creation of an ``industrial university'' \n12 years before enactment of the Morrill Act. Representative Morrill \nfirst introduced the idea in 1857. After much struggle, it passed in \n1959, but President Buchanan vetoed it. Two years later, Morrill \nsucceeded. And even though the obstructionist Southerners were gone, \neastern and western Republicans argued vigorously over land grants, as \nwell as where the new Transcontinental Railroad should go.\n  The roots of the National Academy of Sciences can be traced to a \ngroup of Cambridge scientists meeting in the 1850s or to earlier \nphilosophical organizations before that or even all the way back to \nBenjamin Franklin. California entrepreneurs and speculators and \npoliticians--some of them were all three--were the ones who persisted \nin the 1850s until, in 1862, the Pacific Railroad Act became law.\n  So the formula for success for these transforming laws 150 years ago \nwas typically American: big ideas bubbling up from around the country, \nplus entrepreneurial persistence, plus a crisis equals transforming \nresults.\n  How does that formula apply today to improving the American \ncondition? Well, to begin with, we have a handy crisis. Washington is \nborrowing 40 cents of every dollar it spends. By this rate, by 2025, \nevery penny of tax revenue will go for Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, and interest on the national debt, leaving nothing left--\nunless we borrow more--for national defense, national laboratories, \nnational parks, research, or education. A second crisis, many fear, is \nthat our country will be unable to compete in the future with the \nemerging Asian economies. So what transforming steps should the United \nStates take to meet these new challenges?\n  My own view is that rather than creating new institutions, as America \ndid in the 1850s and 1860s, it would be wiser for us to spend our time \nmaking the institutions we already have work.\n  Let me discuss just two examples--first, our basic governmental \ninstitutions. The new Foreign Minister of Australia, Bob Carr, a great \nfriend of the United States, expressed recently in Washington, DC, that \nthe United States is one budget deal away from reasserting its \npreeminence in the world. He means, of course, that the world is \nwatching, actually hoping, that at the end of the year the United \nStates will demonstrate that we actually can govern ourselves by \nresolving the fiscal mess we have in a way that reforms taxes, controls \nspending, and reduces debt. We do not need a new government to do this. \nWe need for our newly elected President, whether his name be Romney or \nObama, to lead.\n  President Lyndon B. Johnson's Press Secretary, George Reedy, once \ndefined Presidential leadership as seeing an urgent need, developing a \nstrategy to meet that need, and persuading at least half the people \nthat you are right.\n  We don't need to change the rules of the United States Senate; we \nsimply need a change in behavior--one that focuses less on playing \ngames and more on getting results. The new Congress, next year's \nCongress, whether it be Republican or Democratic, must make its goal to \ndispute, amend, debate, vote upon the President's proposed agenda, and \nthen help the President succeed, because if he succeeds our country \nsucceeds.\n  We might well remember the words of that Chicago Tribune editorial \nwriter in 1862 who said:\n\n       Let us first get the ship out of the breakers . . . then \n     court martial the officers if they deserve it.\n\n  The second institutions we should refurbish and make work are our \ncolleges and universities--all 6,000 of them, not just the land-grant \nuniversities that we celebrate this week. Again, we do not need new \ninstitutions; we need to reassert the greatness of the ones we have. \nOur universities, along with our national labs, are our secret weapons \nfor innovation, and innovation is our secret weapon for producing 25 \npercent of all the money in the world for just 5 percent of the world's \npopulation. The list of what it would take to strengthen our colleges \nand universities is short and mostly agreed upon. First, stop sending \nhome every year 17,000 of the 50,000 international students who \ngraduate from U.S. universities with advanced degrees in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics. Give them a green card and \nlet them stay here to create jobs in the United States.\n\n  Next, double funding for advanced research, as the America COMPETES \nAct, which passed with huge bipartisan\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\nsupport in the Senate, has already authorized.\n  Third, repeal the Federal Medicaid mandates that force States to \nspend money on Medicaid that otherwise would go to higher education. \nThis has resulted in dramatic decreases in State support and increases \nin tuition to try to maintain quality.\n  Next, while Congress is repealing the Medicaid mandates, it should \nliterally cut in half the stack of regulations that hampers \ninstitutional autonomy and wastes dollars that should be spent on \nstudents and research.\n  Finally, the institutions themselves should look for ways to save \nmoney, such as full utilization of facilities during the summer, 3-year \ndegrees for some students, and reforms to teacher tenure.\n  In the 1960s, Mitt Romney's father, George Romney, offered this \nadvice to the big three Detroit automobile manufacturers:\n\n       Nothing is more vulnerable than entrenched success.\n\n  The big three did not pay attention to that advice, and we see what \nhappened. It is good advice for universities today.\n  In conclusion, I wish to say a word about the Carnegie libraries. My \nexperience is that most ideas fail for lack of the idea; or to put it \npositively, that a great idea eventually carries itself into reality. \nAndrew Carnegie's great idea was building public libraries. All of us \nknow of their importance.\n  I remember when the New York Times wrote an article about me. They \nsaid, Mr. Alexander grew up in a lower middle-class family at the edge \nof the Tennessee mountains. When I called home later that week to talk \nwith my mother, she was reading Thessalonians to gather strength for \nwhat she considered to be a slur on the family. She said to me: Son, we \nnever thought of ourselves that way. You had a library card from the \nday you were 3 and a music lesson from the day you were 4. You had \neverything you needed that was important.\n  Andrew Carnegie's gift and the Federal laws 150 years ago creating \nland grant universities and the National Academy of Sciences and the \ntranscontinental railroad and the Homestead Act all have this in \ncommon. They were not command-and-control Federal Government actions \nfrom Washington, DC. They were big ideas that, when implemented, \nempowered Americans to do things for themselves--to travel, to own a \nhome, to educate themselves, and to learn by using a library.\n  For example, my empowered mother took me to the A. K. Harper Memorial \nLibrary in Maryville, TN, when I was 3 years old in order to get my \nlibrary card. ``Mrs. Alexander,'' the librarian said to her, ``we don't \ngive library cards to 3-year-olds.'' ``Well, you should,'' she said to \nthem. And they did.\n  So on this anniversary for the congressional enactment of \ntransforming and empowering ideas, there should be more hope than \ndespair. We still have most of the world's great universities. They \nstill attract most of the brightest students from everywhere, \ninsourcing brainpower and creating wealth.\n  According to a recent Harvard School of Business survey of 10,000 of \nits alumni on U.S. competitiveness, if you are in business in this \ncountry, it is still hard to beat America's entrepreneurial \nenvironment, proximity to customers, low levels of corruption, access \nto skilled labor, safety for people and property, and protection of \nintellectual property.\n  We have a remarkable system of government created by geniuses that \nmany countries struggle to emulate. So why not celebrate this \nanniversary by taking steps to ensure that 25 or 50 or 100 years from \nnow we have even more of the greatest universities in the world?\n  Let me read exactly what Australia's Foreign Minister, Bob Carr, a \nfriend of the United States, said in his speech in April:\n  America could be one budget deal away, in the context of economic \nrecovery, one budget deal away from banishing the notion of American \ndeclinism. Think about that, one budget deal, an exercise of \nstatesmanship up the road, in the context of an economic bounce-back \nand all of a sudden, with energy independence crystallizing, with \ntechnological innovation, resurgence of American manufacturing, people \nwho spoke about American decline could be revising their thesis.\n  So as we celebrate the transforming legislation of 150 years ago, why \nnot take the advice of our friend from Australia? Why not take \nadvantage of our opportunity at the end of this year to enact a budget \nthat will reassert Americans' preeminence in the world?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                  Army Master Sergeant Gregory Childs\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, as the son of a master sergeant in the \nAir Force, I grew up in a family that had values rooted in military \ntradition and patriotism. But you certainly don't have to be from a \nmilitary family to love our country. We are encouraged to have a sense \nof American pride in our daily lives.\n  I remember reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singing patriotic \nsongs that reflect the love of our country. Students continue to do \nthis and to learn these values passed down from generations of \nAmericans before them. We have special days that recognize the people \nand symbols important to our country.\n  Two weeks ago, we celebrated Flag Day and next week we celebrate \nIndependence Day. The 3 weeks between these patriotic holidays is known \nas Honor America Days. You most likely won't find these on your \ncalendar, but Congress established these days and adopted it into the \nU.S. Code to encourage gatherings and activities that celebrate and \nhonor our country.\n  While these days are not widely recognized, one of the ways Americans \ndemonstrate our devotion to our country is by supporting our men and \nwomen in uniform. These troops have made enormous sacrifices to defend \nour country and our interests across the globe. These heroes are \nshining examples of the spirit, commitment, and bravery of our Nation.\n  During my time in Congress, I have had the opportunity to travel and \nmeet with our troops across the globe and thank them personally for \ntheir sacrifices to make our world a better place. These men and women \nare always in my thoughts and prayers. I thank our military personnel \nand our veterans for their valued service and offer my sympathy to \nthose families whose loved ones have given their all in defense of our \nNation.\n\n  This includes the family of Arkansas soldier Army MSG Gregory Childs. \nMaster Sergeant Childs died on May 4, 2012, while serving in \nAfghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. His family and \nthe community of Warren, AR, paid their respects to Master Sergeant \nChilds, a father, a son, a brother and a friend, in a very moving \nceremony.\n  Master Sergeant Childs graduated from Warren High School in 1992. He \nconsidered it an honor to serve his country in the military. For 20 \nyears he served his country in locations around the globe, from Bosnia, \nGermany, Colombia, and two tours in Afghanistan. He excelled through \nthe ranks of the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps and earned one of the \nhighest ranks he could attain.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep his family--especially his young daughter \nKourtlan--and his friends in their thoughts and prayers during these \ndifficult times. I humbly offer my appreciation and gratitude to this \npatriot for his selfless sacrifice.\n  As the home to literally thousands of active-duty military personnel \nand even more veterans, Arkansas has experienced more than its share of \ngrief and sacrifice for loved ones who serve our country. Our State has \na rich history of service to our Nation. Troops stationed in Arkansas \nhave served our country honorably even before it was admitted to the \nUnion. Our men and women have always been willing to do their part to \nserve and to protect. Our troops stationed in Arkansas and our military \nfacilities at the Little Rock Air Force Base and the 188th Fighter Wing \nare some of the best assets in our military. Arkansans' active-duty \npersonnel and National Guardsmen have time and again proven their \ndedication, perseverance, and commitment to excellence in defending \nthis country.\n  As we plan our Independence Day celebrations, let us remember the \nservice men and women who embody the\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\nideals that make our country great. I know my fellow Arkansans share my \ngratitude and appreciation for our military personnel and their \nfamilies who sacrifice at home while their loved ones are away.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                   Synthetic Drug and PDMP Amendments\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a couple of \namendments that were included in the legislation we voted on here this \nafternoon in the Senate. I am speaking of the Food and Drug \nAdministration legislation. That legislation included two very \nimportant amendments that deal with combating legal drug abuse here in \nthis country.\n  I want to start by thanking my colleagues, Senators Schumer, \nKlobuchar, Grassley, and Enzi, for helping to develop and promote this \nlegislation over many months. The legislation addresses what is called \nsynthetic drugs. I also want to thank them for helping see it through \nto passage as an amendment today.\n  Senator Grassley actually shared with me a story a few weeks ago of a \nyoung man from Iowa, David Mitchell Rozga, an 18-year-old, who sadly \ntook his life after using this synthetic drug known as K2, or spice. It \nis synthetic marijuana. He had purchased it legally at a local shopping \nmall.\n  In recent weeks, we have seen lots of news accounts of some of the \nsavage acts committed by people high on these synthetic drugs, such as \nthe widely reported cannibalism in Miami, FL. I saw today another \nhorrible story about another man in Waco, TX. We have seen lots of \ndeaths reported in my home State of Ohio due to synthetic drugs. Very \nrecently we had a report of the Columbus, OH, police having to shoot \ntwo men who were high on what are called bath salts. One was shot \nfatally. There is synthetic marijuana out there, but also synthetic \nstimulants and synthetic hallucinogens. Unfortunately, people don't \nknow they are dangerous because they are not illegal. So we need to act \nand act now, and we are doing so through this legislation today.\n  As I said, one of the drugs is called spice. It sounds like an \ningredient you would find in a kitchen, something benign you would find \non a shelf somewhere. The same with bath salts. Unfortunately, they are \nnot benign at all. They are not what you think they are. They are \ndangerous compounds that can cause tremendous devastation, and we need \nto be sure we get the word out.\n  Users are led to believe they are getting a legal version of \nsomething that mimics marijuana, cocaine, LSD, or any other illegal \nstreet drug that is under what is called Schedule I of the Federal Food \nand Drug Administration. This means they are illegal drugs. But because \nthese synthetic drugs are legal, again, users think they are safe. But \nthey produce adverse reactions that are truly unexpected and sometimes \nbizarre. And like the street versions that are on Schedule I at the \nFederal level, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the FDA have both \nconcluded none of these drugs has any currently accepted medical use in \ntreatment in the United States.\n  It seems to me it is appropriate for us to list them under Schedule \nI. And again, that is what the Senate did today, following the House of \nRepresentatives. Because they are legal, they are accessible, \nparticularly on the Internet. I have Googled a number of them, \nincluding K2, and it is alarming to see how easy it is to purchase them \nand how they are advertised. It is time to put them on Schedule I, just \nlike street drugs, and by doing so we give the DEA the ability to \nprevent these drugs from being distributed or imported into the United \nStates, and also allows them to pursue the manufacturers of these \ndrugs.\n  A lot of families have suffered from synthetic drugs, and sometimes \nthose families come to me. I have done a lot of work over the years in \nprevention and education of substance abuse. I started a coalition back \nhome that continues to do great work in the greater Cincinnati area. I \nhave been involved in encouraging community coalitions around the \ncountry, and I am hearing more and more about these synthetic drugs. \nFamilies come to me because they are hoping something positive will \ncome out of the tragedies they have experienced; that the word will get \nout through these tragedies and other young people and adults won't \nlose their lives.\n  I heard one such story in the Senate about the family of Caleb Tanner \nHixson in Riceville, TN.\n  Tanner was a student at Lee University in Cleveland, TN, majoring in \nexercise and health science. After graduating, he wanted to study for \nan advanced degree in physical therapy. Besides studying in that field, \nhe was an avid athlete and outdoorsman. He had played competitive \nbaseball his whole life, and he was also into hiking and canoeing. But \nall that promise was cut off on March 8 of this year when Tanner died \nas a result of a cardiac arrest after ingesting alcohol and a synthetic \ndrug at a party in Chattanooga, TN. He was 22 years old. That drug is \neasily purchased on the Internet. In fact, it is identified on the \nInternet as being a ``research chemical.''\n  His cousin, Brandi White, was the one who told me about this incident \non the Senate floor. Brandi actually works in the leadership office. I \nappreciated her sharing this story with me, and my heart goes out to \nher family. She said she called Tanner's mom to tell her about the \nlegislation when we got it onto the bill, and she called her again \ntoday to tell her the legislation had passed. Although it is little \ncomfort when you have lost a son, it is some comfort. I appreciate the \nfact that her family was willing to share that story so that other \nyoung people will not make that same mistake.\n  This legislation puts these dangerous drugs on what is called \nschedule I. We don't want one more young person to make one more bad \ndecision and to die or have a serious health problem as a result of \nthinking these synthetic drugs are safe because Washington hasn't put \nthem on the list to tell people they are unsafe.\n  If we want to do right by the safety and health of our children as \nwell as our communities, closing this loophole, of course, was just \nsomething commonsense--and, by the way, something bipartisan, along the \nlines of what my colleague said earlier about how we ought to be \noperating in the Senate.\n  I am also proud to see bipartisan support for passage of another \namendment today. This is legislation that I introduced with Senator \nWhitehouse along with Congressman Hal Rogers from Kentucky. This deals \nwith the prescription drug problem we have. There is a prescription \ndrug abuse problem throughout the country, but in Ohio we have been hit \nhard. One of the issues I found in going to a townhall in southern Ohio \nwas the fact that the State prescription drug monitoring programs \ncouldn't communicate and operate across State lines.\n  I did a townhall where Director Gil Kerlikowse of the Office of \nNational Drug Policy kindly came to Portsmouth, OH, about 1 year ago in \nJuly 2011, which is in southern Ohio on the banks of the Ohio River, an \narea that has been in the center of prescription drug abuse and \ninterstate drug trafficking. It is also right across the river from \nKentucky and right near West Virginia, so it is an interstate area.\n  Prescription drug abuse has devastated the county in which Portsmouth \nsits, Scioto County, as well as other counties in the area. But because \nof the hard work of family members, community leaders, and Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement, there has been some momentum and we \nare beginning to turn things around. Pill shops are being closed. One \ncritical tool they told me they needed was prescription drug monitoring \nprograms that could work across State lines. This is a database that a \nlot of States use to monitor prescription drug abuse so when someone \ngoes to ask for a prescription, the person responsible for implementing \nthe program or someone at a pharmacy or a doctor knows what \nprescriptions this person has already received. These are very \neffective programs.\n  Forty-eight States have them, one territory has it, and they work \nwell within the State but they don't communicate well within the \nStates, between each other. Again, in a place such as Scioto County, \nwhere we have interstate traffic, this legislation will now protect our \ncommunity and ensure that if someone gets a prescription in Ohio and \nthen goes across to Kentucky to fill it once they have reached their\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nlimit in Ohio, that there will be a monitoring program and a database \navailable. So it succeeds by getting States' different programs to work \ntogether securely, reliably, and efficiently.\n  I would also like to thank the Alliance of States with Prescription \nMonitoring Programs, which has played a pivotal role in promoting \nnational interoperability standards.\n  These are examples where the Senate acted to try to make our \ncommunities safer and to help ensure that young people can achieve \ntheir God-given potential. Working together, we have been able today to \nhelp ensure the health and well-being of our communities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet).

Mr. President, on July 4, the Nation will celebrate the \n46th anniversary of the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act, \nFOIA. The ``right to know'' is a cornerstone of our Democracy. For five \ndecades, Americans have counted on FOIA to help shed light on the \nactivities of their government.\n  As we reach this important milestone, there are many victories to \ncelebrate. This week the Senate will enact the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act, which includes important \nlanguage that I helped craft to protect the public's ability to access \ninformation under FOIA. Section 710 of that bill will allow the Food \nand Drug Administration, FDA, to obtain information about drug \ninspections and drug investigations undertaken by foreign governments, \nwhile at the same time ensuring that the American public has access to \ninformation about potential health and safety dangers. I thank Senators \nHarkin and Enzi and the many open-government and consumer groups--\nincluding OpenTheGovernment.org and Public Citizen--who worked with me \nto enact this FOIA provision.\n  Last year the Senate unanimously passed the Faster FOIA Act, a bill \nthat I cosponsored with Republican Senator John Cornyn. This \nlegislation would create a bipartisan panel of government and outside \nexperts to make recommendations on improving the FOIA process. Sadly, \ndespite the overwhelming and bipartisan support for this good-\ngovernment legislation, this bill has been languishing in the House of \nRepresentatives for almost a year.\n  During the 3 years since President Obama made a historic commitment \nto restoring the presumption of openness in our government, the Obama \nadministration has also taken steps to strengthen FOIA. I especially \nwant to commend the Office of Government Information Services--and the \ninaugural Director of the OGIS, Miriam Nisbet--for working with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Department of Commerce to \ndevelop an online FOIA Module designed to help agencies better meet \ntheir requirements under the FOIA. This new FOIA program reaffirms the \nPresident's commitment to transparency in our government and will make \ngovernment information more accessible to the American people.\n  While these and other FOIA accomplishments give us good reasons to \ncelebrate, many other threats to the public's right to access \ninformation under FOIA remain. In the coming weeks the Senate is \nexpected to consider several legislative exemptions to FOIA in relation \nto cybersecurity legislation. As this legislative process unfolds, I \nintend to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that \nthe American public's ability to access information about threats to \ntheir health and safety in cyberspace is protected.\n  Securing our Nation's critical infrastructure information is a \npressing national priority. So, too, is protecting the rights of \nAmericans to know what their government is doing. We must strike a \ncareful balance between security and openness in our cybersecurity \npolicies. The anniversary of FOIA's enactment provides a timely \nreminder of just how important it is for the Congress to get that \nbalance right.\n  As I have said many time before, open government is neither a \nDemocratic issue, nor a Republican issue--it is truly an American value \nand virtue that we all must uphold. It is in this bipartisan spirit \nthat I will continue to work to fulfill FOIA's promise of openness in \nour government and that I join all Americans in celebrating the 46th \nanniversary of the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4631-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4631-S4632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my distinct privilege to honor the \noutstanding men and women who have made lasting contributions to U.S. \nArmy Intelligence over the years. On July 1, 2012, MG Gregg C. Potter, \ncommanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence \nand Fort Huachuca, will officially recognize the 50th anniversary of \nthe founding of the Military Intelligence Branch and the 25th \nanniversary of the Military Intelligence Corps at Fort Huachuca, AZ. \nThis is a momentous occasion, and I congratulate all Army intelligence \nprofessionals--soldiers and civilians alike--on these distinguished \nachievements.\n  Timely and accurate intelligence information has always been critical \nto the success of our Armed Forces on the battlefield. Across all \nintelligence disciplines, Army intelligence professionals have \ncollected, analyzed, and supplied this vital information to commanders \nat all levels--from the tactical to the strategic. The intelligence \ninformation they supplied has directly contributed to winning our \nNation's wars and to saving lives. Army Intelligence professionals have \ncarried out this mission with great courage, devotion, and skill since \nwe declared our independence 236 years ago. We recognize this legacy \nand look forward to Army intelligence's continued success and service \nto our country in the future.\n  Two critical events shaped the Military Intelligence Corps into the \norganization that exists today.\n  On July 1, 1962, the Secretary of the Army signed a general order \nauthorizing the creation of the Army Intelligence and Security Branch. \nWith this authorization, all Army intelligence soldiers, including \nregular Army and Reserve officers, were placed into a distinct branch. \nIt ended the practice of detailing officers from other branches into \nintelligence positions and facilitated the professionalization of the \nintelligence field. By establishing a branch equal to all others, the \nArmy recognized the critical importance of military intelligence.\n  On July 1, 1987, the Military Intelligence Corps was activated at \nFort Huachuca. With the activation of the Corps, all Army intelligence \nprofessionals, regardless of their discipline, were symbolically bound \ntogether into one unified organization under the U.S. Army Regimental \nSystem. Since its activation, the unity of purpose and mission of the \nMilitary Intelligence Corps has remained vital to the success of the \nArmy.\n  Today, the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence at Fort \nHuachuca is the home of military intelligence. Every year, the center \ntrains approximately 20,000 students in the intelligence field, \nincluding initial military training, professional military education \ncourses for all ranks and intelligence specialties, mobile training \nteams, and foreign military students.\n  I am immensely proud of the men and women in the U.S. Army \nintelligence community. They work tirelessly to protect our Nation and \ndeserve our deepest gratitude for the sacrifices they have made. As \nindicated by their motto ``Always Out Front,'' Military intelligence \nwill remain a critical element of the readiness of our Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\n  Again, congratulations on this proud occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4632-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GUN SAFETY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Nation reached an important milestone \nover the past few years. In 2010, according to a recent report by the \nViolence Policy Center, motor-vehicle-related fatalities dropped to \ntheir lowest level in decades, a 72 percent decrease in deaths per \nmiles traveled from 1966 levels. But not all of the report's findings \nare encouraging. While our roads have become safer, other aspects of \nAmerican life have become more dangerous. Over that same period, \nfirearm-related deaths steadily increased around the country. In fact, \nin 2009, firearm-related fatalities exceeded motor vehicle fatalities \nin 10 States, and current trends indicate that firearm violence \nstatistics are only getting worse. Congress has the ability to protect \nlives with commonsense safety legislation, just as it did with motor \nvehicle safety measures. But it has recently lacked the will.\n  In the 1960s, this Nation confronted a public health crisis on its \nstreets and highways. Over 40,000 people died from motor vehicle \ncrashes in 1960 alone. A 1999 study by the Journal of the American \nMedical Association found that from 1960 to 1966 this crash death rate \nballooned from 49.2 to 55 deaths per billion miles of travel. In \nresponse, Congress took action by creating the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, NHTSA, which it charged with the responsibility \nof developing and implementing vehicle safety initiatives.\n  In the decades since, the NHTSA has spearheaded numerous efforts that \nhave saved and will continue to save countless lives. Today, we take \nthings like vehicle head rests, energy-absorbing steering wheels, \nshatter-resistant windshields, and seat belts for granted. We expect \nour roads to have clearly delineated lanes, guardrails, and adequate \nlighting. But many of these things would not exist if Congress hadn't \ntaken action to protect the public from the dangers of unregulated \nmotorways.\n  Just like congressional action made our roads safer, countless \nstudies have shown that commonsense gun safety legislation would \nprotect our homes, our schools, and our families from violence. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2009, guns killed more \nthan 30,000 Americans and injured over 65,000. But despite these \nstatistics, Congress has done little to address this public health \ncrisis. Today, almost anyone, including convicted felons or the \nmentally ill, can walk into a gun show and buy a firearm from a private \ndealer without any background check. Others can walk into a gun shop \nand walk out with military-style assault weapons and high-capacity \nammunition magazines, weapons with no sporting purposes.\n  Legislation has been introduced in this Congress that would address \nboth of these issues and would make our society safer. I am a cosponsor \nof the Gun Show Background Check Act of 2011, S.35, and the Large \nCapacity Ammunition Feeding Devices Act, S.32, bills that would close \nthis gun show loophole and prevent the sale of military-style \nammunition cartridges. Congress should take up and pass these measures. \nWe should act, like we did in the 1960s, to protect American lives with \ncommonsense safety legislation. The price of doing nothing is just too \nhigh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4632-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4632-S4633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BRINGING JUSTICE TO UGANDA\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, the war crimes of Joseph Kony and the \nLord's Resistance Army, LRA, are well documented. For two decades, they \nhave terrorized Uganda and its neighbors in central Africa, tearing \napart families and demolishing whole villages. Their war crimes are \nunspeakable, and Joseph Kony and other leaders of the LRA must be held \naccountable.\n  As chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African \nAffairs, I partnered with Senator Jim Inhofe to introduce S. Res. 402, \na bipartisan resolution condemning the crimes against humanity \ncommitted by Joseph Kony and the LRA, supporting ongoing international \nefforts to remove Kony from the battlefield, and calling for the United \nStates to continue to enhance its mobility, intelligence, and \nlogistical support of regional forces protecting civilians and pursuing \nthe LRA.\n  The most important thing about this resolution is not that it has \nearned the support of 46 Senators of both political parties nearly half \nthe Senate. What is most important is that this resolution has earned \nthe support of 215 citizen cosponsors, individual Americans who felt \ncompelled to speak out against Joseph Kony and stand with the President \nand the international community in their work to bring Kony and his top \nlieutenants to justice.\n  In an unprecedented wave of grassroots engagement, thousands of young \nAmericans were inspired to take action by a powerful video released \nearlier this year by Invisible Children, a California-based nonprofit \norganization. This video was viewed more than 100 million times in just \nunder a week, making it the most viral video in history. Yet young \npeople all over this country did more than just watch they took action. \nThey called and wrote their elected officials, they posted on Facebook \nand Twitter, and their voices were heard.\n  Although many of us in the Senate have been working on issues related \nto Joseph Kony and the LRA for years, hearing directly from so many of \nour constituents has renewed our focus and our commitment. It has been \ndecades since we have seen such intense engagement from young Americans \non a humanitarian situation in Africa, making this a critical moment to \nrecognize and sustain.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Congressional Record reflect the names \nof each of the 215 Americans who have signed on to S. Res. 402 as \ncitizen cosponsors and thank each of them for standing with members of \nCongress, the President, and the international community as we work \ntoward bringing Joseph Kony and his top commanders to justice.\n  List of names: The List follows:\n  Eugene Kim, Diane Delaney, Richard Behenna, Joann O'Reilly, Wanda \nMiller, Michelle Comfort, Rachel Breaux, Kourtney Harper, Daimian Dunn, \nMary Claire Smith, Shea Grubbs, Tamara Kaiser, Shannon Wheeler, Sheila \nJanca, Laura Cordovano, Kenny Allen, Maureen Strazdus, Karen Gillis, \nKatie Nuber, Alex Gernert, Lucas Chizek, Susan Tuberville, Danielle \nNeuman, Greg Simpson, Lindsey Williams, Cydnie Daniel, Jan Carr, Sarah \nLanglois, Christine Turo-Shields, Heidi Nelson, Erin Kenna, Spenser \nHooks, Emily Gneiser, John Parkhurst, Paul Claus, Diane Adams, Lindsay \nKatai, Andrew Towarnicky, Phillip Teel, Debra Niederschulte, Elana \nKatz, Priscilla Brown, Rachel Whisenant, Austin Martino, Cheree Miller, \nBriana Arensberg, Tiffany Luu, Mike Boucher, Abigail Rings, Nicholas \nBlake, Melanie Lopez, Emily Poley, Mary Louise Bannerman, Leah Schult, \nSandi Jean, Stephanie Carroll, Gwyn Seltzer, Lillian Grace Walton, \nJayme Collings, Angus Dupee, Karl Nielsen, G.

Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \n250th anniversary of the City of Saco, ME, one of the oldest \ncommunities in New England and one that exemplifies the determination \nand resiliency of its people. In 1617, 3 years before the Pilgrims \nlanded at Plymouth, the English explorer Richard Vines established a \ntest winter settlement along a sheltered cove on the coast of Maine. \nThat settlement where the Saco River meets the sea, grew, prospered, \nand eventually was incorporated in 1762.\n  The name ``Saco'' is derived from the Abenaki word for ``mouth of the \ntidal stream,'' and the sheltered cove, known today as Biddeford Pool, \nhad been a thriving center of Native American villages and cultivated \nfields dating back to prehistoric times. Although some 37 English \nfamilies--fishermen, traders, lumberjacks, and farmers--relocated there \nwithin 20 years of Mr. Vine's exploration, growth was stifled by \nfrequent armed conflicts with the French during those early colonial \ntimes.\n  The conflicts subsided and in 1716 a young merchant named William \nPepperrell purchased 5,000 acres along the Saco River for a lumber \noperation. The small village began to prosper. In 1752, Sir William \nPepperrell, by then a war hero and the first person born in America to \nbe made an English baronet, donated a parcel to be a village common, \nburial ground, and site for a meetinghouse. Ten years later, the \nsettlers incorporated as the town of Pepperrellborough, in honor of \ntheir benefactor.\n  In 1805, the long name was replaced with the much shorter Abenaki \nword, but the vision and energy of William Pepperrell lived on. First \nwith water power and then with steam, Saco and its sister city across \nthe river, Biddeford, became leading manufacturing centers of the \nindustrial age in North America. At Saco Falls, 17 sawmills supplied \nMaine's shipbuilders. On Factory Island, Saco Iron Works opened in \n1811, followed shortly by foundries, harness makers, and machine shops. \nWith the arrival of the railroad came the great engine of the \ncommunity's economy--vast, bustling textile mills.\n  That Saco is a city built by the skilled hands of past generations is \nevident in the fine architecture cherished by the residents of today. \nNine properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, \nincluding the First parish Congregational Church, City Hall, and many \nhomes in the Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, and Victorian styles.\n  The decline of American manufacturing in the late 20th century \npresented Saco with one of the greatest challenge in its history. It is \na challenge that is being met with the same strength demonstrated by \nits early settlers. The abandoned mills on Factory Island are \nundergoing a transformation with residential, educational, and business \nuses, bringing an economic renessaince to the downtown. Today, Saco is \na center for tourism, education, and the arts. Its skilled workers keep \nthe city on the forefront of high-tech manufacturing, including \ninvaluable contributions to our Nation's security in the defense \nindustry. A community that once used waterfalls to power sawmills now \nuses clean, renewable wind energy to light its beautiful passenger rail \nstation.\n  Mr. President, the yearlong celebration now underway is not merely \nabout the passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We \ncelebrate the people who for more than 2\\1/2\\ centuries have pulled \ntogether, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to \nthose who came before, Saco, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to \nthose here today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4633-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE GEORGIA PEANUT COMMISSION\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor in the \nRecord the 50th anniversary of the Georgia Peanut Commission.\n  In 1961, the Georgia Agricultural Commodity Commission for Peanuts \nwas established under the Commodities Promotion Act. The Commission \nconducts programs in the areas of promotion, research and education, \nand it is funded by peanut producers.\n  Today, the Commission represents over 3,500 peanut farmers in our \ngreat State of Georgia who produce nearly half of our nation's peanuts. \nThe Georgia peanut industry contributes an estimated $2 billion to our \nState's economy and provides more than 50,000 jobs, making it a vital \ncomponent to the citizens of our State.\n  Georgia peanuts are simply delicious, and the Georgia Peanut \nCommission sends my Senate office and other Georgia congressional \noffices lots of its signature little red bags of Georgia peanuts to \ngive out to our constituents. In fact, the Georgia Peanut Commission \ndistributes an impressive 2 million bags of Georgia peanuts far and \nwide each year.\n  I am proud to honor the Georgia peanut industry, which is critically \nimportant to our State and Nation, and I congratulate the Georgia \nPeanut Commission on its 50th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4633-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4633-S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EUREKA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of Eureka, SD. Eureka \nis a town with a remarkable history deeply intertwined with the State \nof South Dakota and the country at large.\n  At its founding in 1887, Eureka was merely the end of the line for \none section of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad, but its \nbountiful water supply and strategic location between Bismark, ND and \nPierre, SD assured that within just 5 years it would become the largest \nprimary wheat shipping point in the entire world. It also became a \nhaven for ethnic Germans who fled the oppression of Czarist Russia, a \ncultural heritage which is proudly maintained today. During World War \nII, Eureka again proved its worth to the country, as its proud farmers \nworked hard to make sure America's Armed Forces overseas were well fed.\n  More modern town heroes include Kathryn Schulkoski, who served as the \ntown's librarian for 42 years, and whose name is now borne by the \nlibrary she dedicated her life to. The town has produced nationally \nknown figures as well, including Al Neuharth, founder of USA Today, and \nMarlene Hagge, a founding member of the LPGA and inductee to the World \nGolf Hall of Fame.\n  Today, Eureka keeps its heritage alive with events such as the annual \nSchmeckfest, first started by the town's Germans from Russia chapter in \n1987, which continues to be a major draw for visitors; the Eureka \nPioneer Museum, which gives visitors a wonderful look at the town's \nhistory and features a famous 37 foot tall wheat stalk statue; and of \ncourse kuchen, the delicious pastry dish which, after successful \nlobbying by the town, became the official dessert of the State of South \nDakota.\n  Eureka will celebrate its quasquicentennial with carnivals, a parade, \nconcerts, and a fireworks display\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\nover Lake Eureka. These events will bring the town's residents together \nand remind them of their long and rich history.\n  Once again, I congratulate Eureka on reaching this milestone and all \nit has accomplished in the process. I also join its residents in \nbelieving that the town's best days lie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4634-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ORIENT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of Orient, SD. \nOrient is a warm and tight knit community, and residents are proud of \ntheir town's legacy of accomplishment. The people of Orient will be \ncelebrating the quasquicentennial anniversary of their community on the \nweekend of July 6-8.\n  Orient was founded when a small group of Civil War veterans moved \nwestward in hopes of establishing their own town in the Dakota \nTerritory. Having fought in the Battle of Gettysburg, they originally \nhoped to name their new home Gettysburg, but soon realized that a town \nby that name was located less than three miles east. Although the exact \norigins of the name Orient are unknown, it is believed that Donald \nMcKary and L. J. Jones decided on the final name for the nascent town. \nOrient was officially recognized as a town on October 3, 1887.\n  Orient flourished as a result of the railroad that ran through the \ntown at the time of its founding. In its first years as a small, \nvibrant community, it rightfully earned the nickname, ``The Metropolis \nof the Great Ree Valley.'' Early Orient was home to its own literary \nsociety, singing school, attorney, drug store, and many other small \nbusinesses, including the town newspaper, ``The Weekly Pioneer.'' The \nhardy community weathered many challenges, including fires, tornadoes, \nand some of the most severe blizzards in American history, but through \nthese obstacles, Orient remained optimistic and determined.\n  Residents of Orient plan to commemorate their town's anniversary with \na weekend of events, including a school reunion, parade, softball \ntournament, and dance. The celebration will also include digging up the \n1987 Time Capsule, buried on the centennial anniversary of Orient's \nfounding, as well as a reflection of ``Life in Orient,'' which will \nbring together residents of the town from 25, 50, and 75 years ago.\n  Orient was founded by a coalition of veterans, dreaming of a friendly \nand energetic community they could call home. To this day, that legacy \nlives on, and towns like Orient represent the foundation of South \nDakota, embodying the values our State holds dear. I am proud to \ncongratulate the people of Orient on reaching this historic \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4634-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING OLIVER BROWN WOLF\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize Oliver Phillip Brown Wolf, a World War II veteran of the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. Brown Wolf passed away on \nMay 28, 2012. The community of Eagle Butte, SD and the Cheyenne River \nIndian Reservation has lost a war hero and friend.\n  Oliver Brown Wolf was born on February 4, 1924 in Ziebach County, SD. \nAt the age of 18 years old, Oliver enlisted in the United States Army \nin 1943 and served during World War II. Brown Wolf was a part of the \nU.S. Army 42nd Infantry Division and served as infantry scout and was \ninvolved in the liberation of the Dachau Concentration Camp. Oliver \nreceived three Bronze Stars for his service in World War II and was \nhonorably discharged in March of 1946.\n  Oliver Brown Wolf continued his service as an appointed tribal \nveterans service officer for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, which he \nheld for more than 25 years. Brown Wolf also was a member of the \nAmerican Legion Post #308 and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Oliver \ndedicated his life to ensuring that veterans received the honor and \nrecognition that they deserved for their military service.\n  Throughout his life, Oliver was also committed to his culture and his \nfamily. Oliver was a member of many cultural organizations on the \nCheyenne River Indian Reservation. He enjoyed sharing his Lakota way of \nlife with the community. Oliver played a vital role in starting a \ncultural center and the International Sundance for the community.\n  Oliver Brown Wolf's family is very proud of his service to his \ncountry, tribe, and fellow veterans. This untiring service will surely \nbe missed by those who had the opportunity to meet and work with \nOliver. At the center of each Tribal community, strong leaders are \npresent to provide guidance and advice, and the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe certainly benefited from Oliver's contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4634-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GARY AND MARSHA TANKENOFF\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \ntruly remarkable couple from my home State of Minnesota, a husband and \nwife who have gone above and beyond in their dedication to the causes \nof justice, equality and opportunity.\n  Over the years, Gary and Marsha Tankenoff have poured their time and \nenergy into a wide range of community-oriented causes, from religious \norganizations to educational institutions. The strength of their \ncommitment to Tzedakah is matched only by the depth of their devotion \nto one another.\n  Through the Tankenoff Families Foundation, Gary and Marsha have \ntouched the lives of countless Minnesotans. They are a shining example \nof the way we in Minnesota have always come together to lift up our \nneighbors in need.\n  As a family of strong Jewish faith, the Tankenoffs have been a \ndriving force behind the Minneapolis Jewish Federation, the Jewish \nCommunity Relations Council and Herzl Camp. They are active members of \nMinnesota's Jewish community and tireless advocates for the core causes \nand values of their faith.\n  Minnesota is a more decent, inclusive, and forward thinking State \nbecause of people like Gary and Marsha Tankenoff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4634-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EUREKA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Eureka, \nSD. The town of Eureka will commemorate the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding this year.\n  Platted on October 3, 1887, at the ``end of the track,'' Eureka began \nas a railroad town. As was common in the area, Eureka was founded \nprimarily by Russian-German immigrants, who learned to adapt and \nsurvive in the harsh and unsettled State of South Dakota. These \nsteadfast settlers dealt with severe weather from blizzards to \ndroughts.\n  With determination, the settlers built a strong agricultural economy. \nIn the late 1890s, it was often called the Wheat Capital as it was one \nof the world's largest inland wheat centers. In 1892, more than 3,300 \ntrain cars of wheat from 35 elevators and warehouses were exported from \nEureka. In 1977, a strain of wheat was even named Eureka in honor of \nthe town. Today Eureka takes pride in its beautiful recreational \nopportunities and its active and engaged community.\n  Eureka has been a successful community for the past 125 years, and I \nam confident it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota \nvalues and traditions. I would like to offer my congratulations to the \ncitizens of Eureka on this landmark occasion and wish them continued \nprosperity in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4634-5", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4634-S4635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FULTON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Originally part of the Great American Desert, \nFulton began as a railroad town during the early days of Dakota \nTerritory. The first settlers in Fulton withstood numerous hardships \nsuch as troublesome horse thieves, prairie fires, and the devastating \nblizzard of October 14, 1880, whose sudden and devastating force tied \nup the railroad service and marooned every settlement in the area.\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\nFulton prides itself on its excellent pheasant hunting and fertile \nfarmland.

The town of Monroe will commemorate the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding this year.\n  First known as Warrington, Monroe was named after the fifth President \nof the United States, James Monroe. The first settlers, predominantly \nGerman and Dutch, came to Monroe to build a community for their \nchildren and future generations.\n  Most settlers lived in sod houses and relied on agriculture because \nthe land was fertile. As did many young communities during that time, \nMonroe felt more than its fair share of hardships, including a fire \nthat destroyed many businesses on Main Street in 1915. With hardships, \nthere also came success.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona opposing sections of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act as being in violation of the limits \n     of federal power; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1011\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States passed the \n     National Defense Authorization Act, 2011 Public Law 112-81, \n     (``2012 NDAA'') for fiscal year 2012 on December 15, 2011; \n     and\n       Whereas, the President of the United States signed the 2012 \n     NDAA into law on December 31, 2011; and\n       Whereas, section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA purports to \n     authorize, but does not require, the President of the United \n     States to use the armed forces of the United States to detain \n     persons the President suspects were part of, or substantially \n     supported, Al-Oaeda, the Taliban or associated forces; and\n       Whereas, section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA purports to \n     authorize, but does not require, the President of the United \n     States, through the armed forces of the United States, to \n     dispose of such detained persons according to the Law of War, \n     which may include: (1) indefinite detention without charge or \n     trial until the end of hostilities authorized by the 2001 \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, \n     2001 Public Law 107-40:\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\n     (2) prosecution through a military commission; or (3) \n     transfer to a foreign country or foreign entity; and\n       Whereas, section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA seeks to preserve \n     existing law and authorities pertaining to the detention of \n     United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United \n     States and any other person captured in the United States, \n     but does not specify what such existing law or authorities \n     are; and\n       Whereas, section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA purports to enlarge \n     the scope of the persons the Office of the President may \n     indefinitely detain beyond those responsible for the \n     September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and those who harbored \n     them, as purportedly authorized by the 2001 Authorization for \n     Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, to now include \n     ``[a] person who was a part of or substantially supported Al-\n     Oaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in \n     hostilities against the United States or its coalition \n     partners, including any person who has committed a \n     belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in \n     aid of such enemy forces''; and\n       Whereas, section 1022 of the 2012 NDAA requires the armed \n     forces of the United States to detain, pending disposition \n     according to the Law of War, any person involved in, or who \n     provided substantial support to, terrorism or belligerent \n     acts against the United States, and who is a member of Al-\n     Qaeda or an associated force; and\n       Whereas, the exemption for citizens of the United States in \n     section 1022 of the 2012 NDAA only exempts them from a \n     requirement to detain and reads as follows, ``The requirement \n     to detain a person in military custody under this section \n     does not extend to citizens of the United States''; and\n       Whereas, unlike section 1022 of the 2012 NDAA, section 1021 \n     makes no specific exclusion for United States citizens and \n     lawful resident aliens for conduct occurring within the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, the specific exclusion of application to United \n     States citizens and lawful resident aliens contained in \n     section 1022 of the 2012 NDAA, and the absence of such an \n     exclusion in section 1021 of the NDAA, strongly implies that \n     the provisions of section 1021 are intended to apply to all \n     people, including United States citizens and lawful resident \n     aliens. whether or not they are captured in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, the Office of the President of the United States, \n     under the administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack \n     Obama, has asserted that the 2001 Authorization for the Use \n     of Military Force Against Terrorists allows the Office of the \n     President to indefinitely detain without charge persons, \n     including United States citizens and lawful resident aliens, \n     who are captured in the United States; and\n       Whereas, United States Senator Carl Levin declared on the \n     floor of the United States Senate that the original 2012 NDAA \n     provided that section 1021 (then section 1031 prior to final \n     drafting) specifically would not apply to United States \n     citizens, but that the Office of the President of the United \n     States had requested that such a restriction be removed from \n     the 2012 NDAA; and\n       Whereas, during debate in the Senate and before the passage \n     of the 2012 NDAA, United States Senator Mark Udall introduced \n     an amendment intended to forbid the indefinite detention of \n     United States citizens, which was rejected by a vote of 38-\n     60; and\n       Whereas, United States Senator John McCain and United \n     States Senator Lindsey Graham declared on the floor of the \n     United States Senate that section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA \n     authorized the indefinite detention of United States citizens \n     captured within the United States by the armed forces of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, United States Senator Lindsey Graham declared on \n     the floor of the United States Senate that the United States \n     homeland is now part of ``the battlefield''; and\n       Whereas, policing the United States by the armed forces of \n     the United States, as purportedly authorized by the 2012 \n     NDAA, overturns the posse comitatus doctrine and is repugnant \n     to a free society; and\n       Whereas, sections 1021 and 1022 of the 2012 NDAA, as they \n     purport to authorize the detainment of persons captured \n     within the United States without charge or trial, military \n     tribunals for persons captured within the United States and \n     the transfer of persons captured within the United States to \n     foreign jurisdictions, violate the following rights enshrined \n     in the Constitution of the United States:\n       Article I, section 9, clause 2 right to seek a writ of \n     habeas corpus.\n       The First Amendment right to petition the government for a \n     redress of grievances.\n       The Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable \n     searches and seizures.\n       The Fifth Amendment right to be free from charge for an \n     infamous or capitol crime until presentment or indictment by \n     a grand jury.\n       The Fifth Amendment right to be free from deprivation of \n     life, liberty or property without due process of law.\n       The Sixth Amendment right in criminal prosecutions to enjoy \n     a speedy trial by an impartial jury in the state and district \n     where the crime was allegedly committed.\n       The Sixth Amendment right to be informed of the nature and \n     cause of the accusation.\n       The Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses.\n       The Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n       The Eighth Amendment right to be free from excessive bail \n     and fines, and cruel and unusual punishment.\n       The Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from deprivation \n     of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\n       Whereas, the members of the Legislature of Arizona have \n     taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States \n     and the Constitution of the State of Arizona; and\n       Whereas, this Legislature opposes any and all rules, laws, \n     regulations, bill language or executive orders that amount to \n     an overreach of the federal government and that effectively \n     take away civil liberties; and\n       Whereas, it is indisputable that the threat of terrorism is \n     real and that the full force of appropriate and \n     constitutional law must be used to defeat this threat, yet \n     winning the war against terror cannot come at the great \n     expense of mitigating basic, fundamental constitutional \n     rights; and\n       Whereas, undermining our own constitutional rights serves \n     only to concede to the terrorists' demands of changing the \n     fabric of what made the United States of America a country of \n     freedom, liberty and opportunity; therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House \n     of Representatives concurring: \n       1. That the Members of the Legislature condemn sections \n     1021 and 1022 of the 2012 NDAA as they purport to repeal \n     posse comitatus and authorize the President of the United \n     States to use the armed forces of the United States to police \n     American citizens, to indefinitely detain persons captured \n     within the United States without charge until the end of \n     hostilities as purportedly authorized by the 2001 \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force, to subject persons \n     captured within the United States to military tribunals, and \n     to transfer persons captured within the United States to a \n     foreign country or foreign entity.\n       2. That the Members of the Legislature find that the \n     enactment into law by the United States Congress of sections \n     1021 and 1022 of the National Defense Authorization Act of \n     2012 is inimical to the liberty, security and well-being of \n     the people of Arizona and that those sections were adopted by \n     Congress in violation of the limits of federal power in the \n     United States Constitution.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and \n     each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-105.

A bill to require a quadrennial diplomacy and development \nreview, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues from \nFlorida and Maryland, Senator Rubio and Senator Cardin, to introduce \nthe Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review Act of 2012.\n  This legislation demonstrates Congress's commitment to strengthening \nthe accountability and effectiveness of our foreign aid programs. With \nthe United States facing critical foreign policy and development \npriorities worldwide, it is vital that we update our foreign aid \nprograms to reflect the new challenges of the 21st century.\n  The first-ever quadrennial review on diplomacy and development \nprovided an important roadmap for increasing the effectiveness and \nefficiency of our diplomatic and development agencies. I applaud \nSecretary Clinton for her leadership in bringing this valuable planning \ntool to the State Department.\n  The purpose of our bill is straightforward: In keeping with the \npractice of undertaking quadrennial reviews by various departments, \nincluding the Department of Defense, it creates the statutory basis for \nconducting periodically scheduled reviews to guide the mission of the \nState Department and USAID.\n  The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review Act will strengthen \nour diplomacy and development efforts in several key ways. Let me cite \njust a few specifically:\n  First, this bill clarifies the measures by which we assess and \nevaluate our diplomacy and development efforts. Developing clear \nmetrics will further the effective and results-oriented diplomacy and \ndevelopment efforts that I view as essential for protecting and \nadvancing our national security interests.\n  Second, this bill will focus our diplomacy and development efforts in \nthe most effective ways possible, getting the biggest bang for our \nscarce foreign assistance dollars.\n  Third, it will help ensure that Congress and the Administration, \nworking together, can set clear priorities for diplomacy and \ndevelopment. As we face multiple crises and major challenges, setting \npriorities will be absolutely critical to our shared success going \nforward. We must continue to foster inclusive and sustainable economic \ngrowth and vibrant civil societies. We must also focus on areas where \nwe have comparative strengths, including public health, humanitarian \naid and food security.\n  Fourth, this bill will put our diplomacy and development efforts on a \nsustainable path. It streamlines the process for working with the \nDepartment of Defense and it will help us bring all the tools of the \nUnited States government to bear in meeting the complex challenges of \nthis new century.\n  Finally, we all know that we need to strengthen our professional \ndiplomatic expertise and capacity, target our investments and untie the \nhands of our aid workers. The QDDR process and our bill provides the \nSecretary and President with a comprehensive and analytically sound \nbasis for doing just that.\n  Returning diplomacy and development to their rightful place cannot be \nachieved through words alone. This legislation translates words into \ndeeds. And if that helps promote U.S. national security interests and \nkeeps us safe, as I believe it will, then it's time and effort well \nspent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4638-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4638-S4639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 505--CONGRATULATING HIS HOLINESS DORJE CHANG BUDDHA \n  III AND THE HONORABLE BENJAMIN A.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 473) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 473\n\n       Whereas polio is a highly infectious disease that primarily \n     affects children and for which there is no known cure;\n       Whereas polio can leave survivors permanently disabled from \n     muscle paralysis of the limbs and occasionally leads to a \n     particularly difficult death through the paralysis of \n     respiratory muscles;\n       Whereas polio was once one of the most dreaded diseases in \n     the United States, killing thousands annually in the late \n     19th and early 20th centuries and leaving thousands more with \n     permanent disability, including the 32nd President of the \n     United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt;\n       Whereas severe polio outbreaks in the 1940s and 1950s \n     caused panic in the United States, as parents kept children \n     indoors, public health officials quarantined infected \n     individuals, and the Federal Government restricted commerce \n     and travel;\n       Whereas 1952 was the peak of the polio epidemic in the \n     United States, with more than 57,000 people affected, 21,000 \n     of whom were paralyzed and 3,000 of whom died;\n       Whereas safe and effective polio vaccines, including the \n     Inactivated Polio Vaccine (commonly known as ``IPV''), \n     developed in 1952 by Jonas Salk, and the Oral Polio Vaccine \n     (commonly known as ``OPV''), developed in 1957 by Albert \n     Sabin, rendered polio preventable and contributed to the \n     rapid decline of polio incidence in the United States;\n       Whereas polio, a preventable disease that the United States \n     has been free from since 1979, still needlessly lays victim \n     to children and adults in several countries where challenges \n     such as active conflict and lack of infrastructure hamper \n     access to vaccines;\n       Whereas the eradication of polio is the highest priority of \n     Rotary International, a global association that was founded \n     in 1905 in Chicago, Illinois, is currently headquartered in \n     Evanston, Illinois, and has 1,200,000 members in more than \n     170 countries;\n       Whereas Rotary International and its members (commonly \n     known as ``Rotarians'') have contributed more than \n     $1,000,000,000 and volunteered countless hours in the global \n     fight against polio;\n       Whereas the Federal Government is the leading public sector \n     donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and provides \n     technical and operational leadership to this global effort \n     through the work of the Centers for Disease Control and the \n     United States Agency for International Development;\n       Whereas Rotary International, the World Health \n     Organization, the United States Government, the United \n     Nations Children's Fund (commonly known as ``UNICEF''), and \n     the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have joined together \n     with national governments to successfully reduce cases of \n     polio by more than 99 percent since 1988, from 350,000 \n     reported cases in 1988 to fewer than 700 reported cases in \n     2011;\n       Whereas polio was recently eliminated in India and is now \n     endemic only in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas the eradication of polio is imminently achievable \n     and will be a victory shared by all of humanity: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends Rotary International and others for their \n     efforts in vaccinating children around the world against \n     polio and for the tremendous strides made toward eradicating \n     the disease once and for all;\n       (2) encourages the international community of governments \n     and non-governmental organizations to remain committed to the \n     elimination of polio; and\n       (3) encourages continued commitment and funding by the \n     United States Government to the global effort to rid the \n     world of polio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/26/senate-section/article/S4642-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4642-S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. \n509, and S. Res. 510.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution, S. Res. 506, on behalf of \nmyself and the distinguished Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, concerns \na request for representation in a pro se civil action pending in \nIndiana small claims court. In this action, the plaintiff seeks damages \nfrom a former Member of the Indiana House of Representatives arising \nout of plaintiff's efforts to obtain Social Security benefits. \nPlaintiff has issued trial subpoenas to former Senator Evan Bayh and an \nunnamed employee of his former Senate office for testimony arising out \nof their Senate duties.\n  This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent \nSenator Bayh and employees of his former Senate office in this case to \nseek to quash the subpoenas on the ground that the Senator and his \nformer staff lack personal knowledge of the relevant events and other \nlegal bases. The resolution would also authorize the former constituent \nservices director for Senator Bayh to submit a declaration in support \nof the motion to quash attesting that she has no knowledge of anyone in \nthe former Senator's office who has any information relevant to this \ncase.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed \nto, the preambles be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table en bloc, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 506\n\n         To authorize legal representation in Bilbrey v. Tyler\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Bilbrey v. Tyler, No. 18C04-1111-\n     SC-2209, pending in Delaware Circuit Court No. 4, Small \n     Claims Division, in Muncie, Indiana, the plaintiff has sought \n     testimony from former Senator Evan Bayh and an unnamed \n     employee of his former Senate office;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent former Members and former employees of the Senate \n     with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony \n     relating to their official responsibilities;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from \n     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate may promote the \n     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action \n     as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the \n     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to \n     represent Senator Bayh and former employees of his Senate \n     office in Bilbrey v.

Senator Bayh's former director of constituent \n     services, Karen Railing, is authorized to submit a \n     declaration in this case.\n\n                              S.
