Madam President, the headline news for the last many weeks \nhas been the fiscal cliff. In speaking to the President 6 months before \nthe election, a few weeks before the election, a few days before the \nelection and immediately after the election, he indicated we needed to \nget our financial house in order, and that his goal--to do just that.\n  But to do that, and because of past experiences, he laid out what he \nwanted, and it is very simple: The rates for those who have been \nblessed with economic security in this country will have to be a little \nhigher and middle-class Americans will keep the same tax structure they \nhave had for the last many years. He will not raise taxes on the middle \nclass, but those people who have done well will have to pay a little \nbit more. The American people think this is the way it should be.\n  Now just a little bit of history. I have said this before, but I will \ngo into a little more detail today. When I first became the leader, I \ntook a trip with a number of Senators to South America, countries that \nwe American Senators had never been to, such as Bolivia. It was a \nwonderful trip. It was great for our country and good for the Senators \nto learn more about that most important part of the world to America.\n  I was very fixed on who I wanted to go on that trip with me, but the \ntwo I asked to go were Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who had been \nchairman of the Budget Committee, and Kent Conrad, who was the chairman \nof the Budget Committee at the time. Those two fine Senators spent \nabout 18 hours seated side by side, both having tablets to write on, \nand they were working on the No. 1 issue they thought important for \nthis country, which was what we should do about the future of our \ncountry economically. They came up with an idea that was very good. It \nhad worked before on closing military bases.\n  We had military bases that we had been trying to close since World \nWar I, and we couldn't do it. We didn't have the political will to do \nit. So we had a base closing commission. With the base closing \ncommission we said: OK, we are going to have a commission that will \nwork on this and they will report back to us. There will be no \nfilibusters, no amendments, just an up-or-down vote. We did that. We \nhad two rounds of those, and we closed scores of bases and saved the \ncountry hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  That is what Judd Gregg and Kent Conrad patterned their legislation \non. They would have an appointed commission that would report back to \nus, no\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\namendments, no filibusters. I thought it was novel, a great idea. So \nthe legislation was drafted and I brought it to the Senate floor. Seven \nRepublicans who had cosponsored the legislation wouldn't vote for it. \nWe couldn't get 60 votes to bring it to the floor. So a number of us \nasked President Obama if he would do a commission and he did. It was \nthe Bowles-Simpson Commission.\n  The Bowles-Simpson Commission didn't have the potential the Judd \nGregg-Kent Conrad work had, because although they would send us \nsomething here, we could amend it and filibuster it. But we didn't have \nto worry about that, because we couldn't get enough votes from the \ncommissioners to do that. So that was a failure.\n\n  Then President Obama entered into negotiations with the Speaker and \nthey had talks that went on for weeks. They failed. They had another \nround of talks. That failed. Joe Biden, our Vice President, met with \nthe majority leader of the House of Representatives, the Republican \nEric Cantor. Cantor walked out of those meetings.\n  After all that, there was an agreement made here that we would have a \nsupercommittee. It would work under the same terms and conditions as \nthe program Judd Gregg and Kent Conrad came up with. The supercommittee \nwould have 3 members appointed by me, Senator McConnell, the Speaker, \nand Leader Pelosi--12 in all. Then we would bring their work to the \nfloor, with no amendments, no filibusters. About a week before they \nwere ready--they had to report by statute--I got a letter signed by \nvirtually every Republican Senator saying: No revenue.\n  So the President is not going to fall for that again. Because every \ntime we have done this--and I just went over what has happened, and we \ncan add to that the Gang of Six, the Gang of Eight, and other well-\nintentioned Senators--never, ever could they agree on revenue. So the \nPresident is not going to fall for that again. He is not going to do \nthat again.\n  It is as though we are going to have a card game and they say, you \nshow us all your cards and then we will show you ours. But when it \ncomes time to show the cards of the person you are playing against--\nnope. It reminds me of the ``Charlie Brown'' cartoon. How many times is \nCharlie Brown going to try to kick that football? Because we know every \ntime he approaches that football it will be taken away from him. He \ncan't do it. That is what has happened here, and we are not going to \nfall for that again.\n  The American people aren't going to be under the illusion the \nRepublicans will, sometime in the future, come up with revenue. They \nare either going to agree to raising the rates or we are going over the \ncliff. How many times do we have to go through this drill to know it is \nan unfair game? So President Obama is not going to fall for that again. \nHe has been very, very clear.\n  I heard Leader Pelosi say on the news this morning she has hopes \nSpeaker Boehner will come around. I hope that, in fact, is the case. \nBut to this point there hasn't been a lot of progress, and I am very \ndisappointed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7754-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want to talk this morning about Joe \nLieberman.\n  The very modest apartment, with no hot water, where Joseph Lieberman \nwas raised has long since been demolished, but the values he learned in \nthat little apartment--in the flat above his grandparents' house--are \nstill there. They are the same values of devotion and public service \nthat have driven him not only to overcome humble beginnings but to \nserve the country for 24 years here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Two years ago, on the day he announced his retirement from the \nSenate, Joe Lieberman described his rise from cold-water flat to \nCongress as follows:\n\n       My four grandparents . . . came to America seeking freedom \n     and they found it. They came to America hoping for \n     opportunities and they got them. But even they could not have \n     dreamed that their grandson would end up a U.S. Senator.\n\n  Joe was always a natural-born leader. He was president of his high \nschool graduating class. He got undergraduate and law degrees from \nYale--one of the most prestigious universities in the world--where he \nwas chairman of the Yale Daily News.\n  He was a civil rights activist early on as a young man. He was \ninspired, as many of us were, by the words of John Kennedy. Joe \ndefeated an incumbent to win a seat in the Connecticut State Senate, \nwhere he served for 10 years, including 6 as the majority leader of the \nConnecticut State Legislature.\n  After returning to private practice for 2 years, he served as the \nfirst full-time Connecticut attorney general. It was during his years \nas attorney general that he met the love of his life, Hadassah. Today, \nthey have 4 children and 12 grandchildren.\n  In 1988, he again took on one of the giants of politics in the State \nof Connecticut in a race no one thought he could win, but he did. He \ndefeated an incumbent U.S. Senator, and for the last 24 years he has \nserved the people of Connecticut and this country with honor and \ndistinction.\n  I was pleased to have had an opportunity to support Senator \nLieberman's historic candidacy for Vice President in 2000. Joe was the \nfirst Jewish major party candidate for Vice President.\n  Senator Lieberman is a devout and observant Jew. He has even written \na book about the importance of keeping the Sabbath as a day of rest. I \nread the book. I was so impressed with that book. Our Sabbaths may be \non different days, but the solemnity of the Sabbath is important to \nboth of us. I was so impressed by that book I bought 20 of them and \nsent them to my friends and my family, who I thought would gain a great \ndeal by learning from this book that Joe had written.\n  Joe Lieberman says his faith is the basis for his strong desire to \nserve the State of Connecticut and our country. During his four terms \nrepresenting Connecticut in the Senate, Joe Lieberman played a key role \nin drafting and passing many different pieces of legislation, including \nthe 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, which have literally saved lives by \neliminating harmful smog, acid rain, and other toxins in our air and \nwater. He has been chairman of the very important Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. He is a powerful voice on security \nissues, and he has been exemplary in working on a bipartisan basis with \nSenator Susan Collins, who has been the ranking member of that \ncommittee.\n  Joe led the charge to create the 9/11 commission and to implement its \nrecommendations. He was a leading voice for the creation of that \ndepartment, Homeland Security, which we now look to for keeping this \ncountry safe.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Lieberman \nwas a strong advocate for repeal of the discriminatory don't ask, don't \ntell policy that unjustly forced gay and lesbian servicemembers into \nthe closet. He fought to ensure our military is the best prepared and \nbest equipped fighting force in the world. We have much in common. We \ndon't always agree on policy issues, but we do 90 percent of the time. \nRegardless of the few differences we have, I have never, ever doubted \nJoe Lieberman's principles or his patriotism, and I respect his \nindependent streak as it stems from strong convictions. Joe said it \nbest himself:\n\n       I have not always fit comfortably into conventional \n     political boxes. Maybe you've noticed that. Democrat, \n     Republican, liberal, conservative. Because I've always \n     thought my first responsibility is not to serve a political \n     party, but to serve my constituents, my state and my country. \n     . . . Whatever the partisan or policy differences that divide \n     us, they are much less important than the shared values and \n     dreams that unite us.\n\n  I have watched up close. He has been a wonderful Member of the \nDemocratic caucus. I so admire and respect him. I agree with Senator \nLieberman's values. He has been an asset to the Democratic caucus and \nour country. I am pleased to have shared the dream of serving in the \nSenate with such an extraordinary man and exceptional Senator. I \ncongratulate Joe and Hadassah on their years of dedicated service \nbecause they have worked together. I wish them both happiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7754-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7754-S7756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FISCAL CLIFF\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday I came to the floor to \npoint out something that shouldn't need repeating but does: Any \nagreement on\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\ndebt and deficit reduction has to include cuts on government spending.\n  The reason I shouldn't have to repeat this is because the President \nhimself has been running around the country for 2 years saying any \nagreement has to be balanced--meaning both revenue and cuts. This was \nthe message he ran on, and it also happens to be one that the \noverwhelming majority of Americans actually support, especially the \npart about cuts, which more than three-fourths say they support. If you \nheard some of the wasteful projects I detailed yesterday, you would see \nwhy.\n  I don't think there is a single person outside of Washington who \ndoesn't think we waste massive amounts of money in this town and who \ndoesn't wonder why it is so hard for us to agree to cut back. Yet now, \nwith the election behind him, President Obama is suddenly silent on the \nneed for spending cuts. He keeps talking about balance. That polls \nwell, but when it comes to specific cuts he is largely silent. All of a \nsudden it is all tax hikes all the time. Forget balance. Just raise \ntaxes and spend even more.\n  The President and his allies have taken so many things off the table, \nthe only thing left is the varnish. The President now seems to think, \nafter his reelection, if all he talks about is the need for tax hikes \nand that is all reporters write about, we will all magically forget the \npart about needing balance. It is a classic bait-and-switch, and we are \nseeing new versions of it nearly every day now.\n  Democrats campaigned for 2 years saying we needed to take a balanced \napproach to our problems. Yet now that the President has been \nreelected, they are walking back, and the only thing left are the \ntaxes. What the President should be doing after his reelection is \nbringing people together and showing that he has the desire and the \nability to lead the two parties to an agreement that is good for the \neconomy and good for the country.\n  So far, at least, he has chosen a different path--a path aimed at \npleasing the most partisan elements of his base. A month after his \nreelection and weeks before the fiscal cliff, he would still rather \ncampaign than cooperate. We will find out this week if he has the will \nto change paths and get something done or just double down on the \ncampaigning.\n  Look, the election is over. The President may enjoy these political \nrallies, but it is time to get serious. The American people are gravely \nconcerned about the Nation's future. They are counting on us to prevent \nthe kind of crisis that we have seen unfolding all across Europe.\n  Republicans have engaged in these discussions in good faith. We have \nagreed to make tough choices. The question is, Where is the President? \nWhere is the President? Where is the only man in the country who can \nmake it happen?\n  Well, it appears that with just a couple weeks left to resolve this \ncrisis, he is busy moving the goal posts. Instead of leading as he was \nelected to do, he is out campaigning and playing games with the \nNation's future.\n  So my sincere plea this morning is that the President get serious; \nthat he put the campaign behind him and lead. If he does, he will have \nwilling partners. The first sign is seriousness--seriousness about \nspending cuts.\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Madam President, yesterday I began the difficult task of saying an \nearly good-bye to now six Members of our conference who will be leaving \nthe Senate at the end of the year. This morning I would like to say a \nfew words about my friend and longtime colleague, Senator Snowe.\n  She has devoted the last 40 years of her life to serving the people \nof Maine. It has been an honor to work alongside this remarkable woman \nfor the last 18 years and to see up close her tenacity and tough-\nmindedness in the service of her constituents. Some have described \nSenator Snowe's advocacy for Mainers as ferocious, and I think there \nare few better examples of that than the fight she waged on behalf of \nMaine after the BRAC recommendations of 2005.\n  When the list of targeted facilities came out, Senator Snowe mounted \nwhat has been described as a relentless months-long campaign akin to a \ndefense at a trial. She marshaled all the data and the best arguments. \nWhen decision day finally arrived, not only were two of the three Maine \nfacilities told to remain open, one of them was actually expanded. It \nis stories such as this that help explain why Olympia's constituents \nkeep sending her back to Washington by such wide margins and why so \nmany were shocked to hear that she would be leaving at the end of the \nyear.\n  As one shipyard worker in Portsmouth whose job she helped save put \nit:\n\n       We love her, and she loves us. [And] I can't recall ever \n     saying that publicly about a U.S. Senator, but truly she's \n     such a wonderful person.\n\n  As Senator Snowe will tell you, many of her political views \nsolidified during her modest Maine upbringing. Her parents ran a diner \nnear Augusta. While they didn't have much, her father was adamant she \nreceive a good education. So much so that he was dismayed to learn her \nkindergarten only lasted half the day. ``He was convinced,'' she once \nsaid, ``that I was getting off on the wrong foot.''\n\n  It was at school that Olympia first discovered her passion for \npolitics. At St. Basil's Academy, a Greek Orthodox girls' school she \nattended until she was 15, she won her first election--as dorm \npresident. She later graduated from Edward Little High School in \nAuburn, ME, and subsequently attended the University of Maine where, in \n1969, she earned a degree in political science. It was also in college \nthat she met Peter Snowe. Peter shared Olympia's passion for politics. \nThey married shortly after graduation. In 1972, Peter was elected to \nthe State legislature, while Olympia went to work as a legislative \nstaffer for Maine Congressman Bill Cohen.\n  The young couple seemed well on their way to building a life \ntogether, but in 1973, in the midst of a winter snowstorm, tragedy \nstruck. Peter was killed in a car crash, and at a still young age \nOlympia was left to build a life for herself.\n  What could have marked the end of her political aspirations became a \nnew beginning instead. As Olympia once put it, she resolved to ``make a \npositive out of a terrible negative.'' She ran for office in the \nspecial election held to fill her late husband's seat, and she won. It \nwas the start of a long and distinguished career in public service.\n  Olympia was subsequently reelected to the Maine House in 1974 and \nelected to the Maine Senate in 1976. In 1978, when Bill Cohen, her \nfriend and former boss, ran for the U.S. Senate, she ran for his seat \nin the House of Representatives and won again.\n  At the age of 31, she was at the time the youngest Republican woman \never elected to Congress and 1 of just 16 women in the House. Olympia \nserved eight terms in the House. She was a member of the House Budget \nCommittee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the former House \nSelect Committee on Aging. Working with an Arizona lawyer named Jon Kyl \nand a Mississippi whip named Trent Lott, she helped turn minority \nRepublicans into a potent legislative force, ensuring some of the \nbiggest legislative victories of the Reagan era.\n  It was while serving in the House that Olympia met Jock McKernan, who \nwas a rising political star in his own right. Elected as Maine's second \nCongressman in 1982, Jock served alongside Olympia in the House and was \nlater elected Governor of Maine. The two were married in 1989, and they \nhave been a great team since. As Olympia puts it:\n\n       I have a wonderful partner in life. We've been able to ride \n     the waves together.\n\n  When George Mitchell announced his retirement in 1994, Olympia threw \nher hat into the ring and won by a landslide with 60 percent of the \nvote against her opponent's 36 percent and carrying every county in the \nState. Believe it or not, it was the smallest margin of victory she has \nenjoyed in three Senate races. With this victory, Olympia became the \nonly woman in history to serve in both houses of her State legislature \nand both Houses of Congress.\n  In the Senate, Olympia has worked tirelessly as a member of the \nFinance Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, and as chair of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  A lot of people like to focus on Olympia's independent streak, but my \nexperience is that she herself has always\n\n[[Page S7756]]\n\ncared most deeply about the people of Maine. She has gone through great \nefforts over the years to talk to her constituents directly. She once \nsaid:\n\n       I've made main street tours across this state a hallmark of \n     my tenure in public office. They are like my secret poll.\n\n  It is through these tours that Olympia decides which problems to \nfix--whether it was storm relief after the 1998 ice storm, the fight I \nalready mentioned to keep Maine's military facilities open, or \nreauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact on behalf of Maine's \ndairy farmers.\n  Of course, this isn't to downplay Olympia's penchant for independence \nor for joining gangs. Senator Snowe's maternal grandparents immigrated \nto the United States from Sparta, which may help explain her fighting \nspirit. Just like the Spartan King Leonidas, she has never been afraid \nof a fight--even with members of her own party.\n  She headed the Centrist Coalition with Senator Breaux. She cochaired \nthe Common Ground Coalition with Senator Landrieu. In 1999 she was one \nof five Republicans to vote to acquit President Clinton of both \narticles of impeachment. And in 2005 she joined the bipartisan Gang of \n14, which helped defuse an earlier dispute about threats to change the \nSenate rules.\n  Yet what many fail to mention is that despite her vaunted \nindependence, Olympia has always been a very proud Republican. She \nrecently said:\n\n       We believe as Republicans that the individual is more \n     important than the state. We believe that the great days of \n     our past can be a stepping stone to an even greater future. \n     We believe a job is preferential to a handout and \n     independence is better than dependence. We believe that the \n     private sector is more productive than big government will \n     ever be.\n\n  When it comes to a balanced budget--a top priority for the party--\nSenator Snowe has been a true leader. She has been a long-time \nsupporter of a balanced budget amendment. As far back as 1993, when she \nwas still serving in the House, she was one of four initial sponsors of \nthe legislation that would have mandated a balanced budget. One of her \nfirst acts as a Senator was to deliver a speech before a Senate \ncommittee in support of a balanced budget amendment.\n  Olympia's many accomplishments have attracted broad notice outside of \nWashington. In 2004 Forbes named her ``one of 100 most powerful women \nin the world,'' rating her even more influential than J.K. Rowling or \nOprah. In 2006 Time named her one of the ``ten best senators,'' noting \nthat she is ``in the center of every policy debate in Washington.''\n  I do not think anything compares with the honor that was bestowed on \nSenator Snowe by the townspeople of Bethel, ME, who, in 1999, created \nthe ``Olympia SnowWoman,'' a 122-foot tall snowman that still ranks as \nthe tallest snowman--or woman--ever built. It required 13 million \npounds of snow, took more than 1 month to build, wore a 100-foot-long \nscarf, had two entire 27-foot evergreen trees for arms, and required 16 \npairs of skis for eyelashes.\n  ``It's just my luck,'' Senator Snowe said of the monument, ``I'd have \na world record breaking monument named after me, and it will be gone by \nsummer.''\n  Olympia, you have had a truly remarkable career. We thank you for \nyour service to this Chamber and most especially to the people of the \ngreat State of Maine. We wish you all the best in the next phase of \nyour life and, as you think of what to put in your memoir, I would only \nask one thing: Please, go easy on us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7756-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to give my \nclosing floor speech for this session of the Senate.\n  From the date of my swearing in on February 4, 2010, until the last \nday I serve in this great Chamber, which is 1 month shy of 3 years \nserving, I still say and believe that, aside from my marriage to my \nwife Gail of 26 years and the birth of my two children, Ayla and \nArianna, serving in the greatest deliberative body for the Commonwealth \nof the Massachusetts, in the people's seat, has been the greatest honor \nI ever had in my life. I thank the people of Massachusetts for that \nopportunity. To think that someone such as myself, whose parents were \nmarried and divorced 4 times each, who lived in 17 houses by the time \nhe was 18 and was subjected to various forms of abuse growing up, still \nhas the honor to serve in one of the greatest deliberative bodies, as I \nsaid, in the world is something I will not soon forget.\n  To the young people sitting here and who may be watching, take it \nfrom me that in this country, even when it seems that you are fighting \nagainst all odds, anything is possible for you. There are no obstacles \nthat cannot be overcome so do not give up and always follow your \ndreams.\n  As I have said before, people have no business in politics unless \nthey respect the judgment of the voters. If you run for office, you \nhave to be able to take victory or defeat in a gracious manner. I do \nrespect the judgment of the voters. I accept their decision in this \nelection with the same attitude and sense of appreciation I held when I \narrived in this Chamber almost 3 years ago.\n  When I was sworn in, I was the 1,914th Senator accepting the oath of \noffice by signing the book right up at the clerk's table. There were \nmany Senators who served before me and there will be many Senators who \nserve after my service is over. That my name is listed amongst them is \nvery humbling.\n  To all the people of Massachusetts, I greatly appreciate the \nconfidence you placed in me for the past 3 years in allowing me to \nrepresent them in the Senate. To my colleagues, I thank them for the \ncourtesy and friendship they afforded me during my time here. When I \narrived, I promised I would read the bills, see how they affected \nMassachusetts, see how they affected our country, our debt and our \ndeficit and I would vote in an independent manner based on the merits \nof that issue rather than political partisan politics. I am proud I did \nkeep that promise to be independent. I am proud my voting record has \nidentified me as the second most bipartisan Senator in the Senate, as \nreferenced by Congressional Quarterly, and that I was named as the \nleast partisan Senator in the Senate by Washingtonian magazine.\n  It was that independent and bipartisan approach that provided me with \nan opportunity to stand with the President at the White House on three \nseparate occasions in the past 2 years to see bills I had either \nsponsored or played a key role in securing their passage signed into \nlaw. I was honored to work with my colleagues--many who are here today \nand many who are listening--on both sides of the aisle on legislation \nthat was signed into law to move our country forward, including the \nSTOCK Act to ban insider trading by Members of Congress--I know the \nPresiding Officer played a key role in that as well--the hire a hero \nveterans bill to help our veterans who are fighting for jobs actually \nhave opportunities to be hired by employers who are looking for those \nheroes; the crowdfunding legislation which will help young \nentrepreneurs get access to new capital and create jobs, something I \nhope the SEC will immediately come up with a rule on so these people \ncan start creating jobs and raising money; legislation to reform Wall \nStreet, where I was the deciding vote to strengthen our country's \nfinancial system; legislation to eliminate an onerous 3-percent \nwithholding tax; eliminating a stealth tax that would have affected \ngovernment contractors--that is also gone; legislation to ensure our \nfallen heroes receive the dignity and respect they deserve at the \nArlington National Cemetery, that\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\nis something now that is also fixed; and many other congressional \nactions that have made a difference not only in Massachusetts but in \nthis great country. These are all shared successes, and I was proud to \nbe part of each and every one of them.\n  I have always said in order to do our business as our country's \nleaders we must do our work in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to ensure \nthe actions taken by Congress benefit all Americans, not just those of \none political party or one political ideology. During my time here and \nnow as I am leaving, I have been and still am deeply concerned about \nthe lack of bipartisan efforts to solve our country's most pressing \neconomic challenges and in turn move our country forward. Many times \npolitical party and personal gain is put before the needs of our \ncountry. I know we can do it better. The American people expect us to \ndo it better. As I leave, I challenge the leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle to make the process more open and transparent. I challenge \nMembers to work with each other in a more open and honest manner, and I \nchallenge the President and the congressional leadership to also work \ntogether immediately to address the concerns and needs of our country \nbecause, after all, we are Americans first and our country deserves \nbetter.\n\n  In closing, I see my staff here. Many of them were here from the \nbeginning. They came from applicants, over 4,000, for a very select few \njobs. I thank Vanessa Sinders, my chief of staff, and each and every \none of the staff for the amazing work they have done in very \ninteresting times. To come here as the 41st or the 60th Senator and \nhave the media scrutiny and all the commentary from every special \ninterest group around the country, in the middle of a Senate that was \ngridlocked--to come here and have an opportunity to make a difference \nand do it well without making any mistakes is something I think \nbenefited Massachusetts but also benefited this great country. It \nallowed for the debate to resume once again to eliminate a \nsupermajority so one side could ram through things in which the other \nside had no play or no involvement.\n  That is not what our country is about. That is not what this Chamber \nis about. We deserve better. The people of Massachusetts and the people \nof this country deserve better. They deserve to have their voices \nheard. Every person in this Chamber has one vote. To think that one \nside or the other, depending on who is in charge, is going to stifle \nthat one Senator, from whatever part of the country, not to let him or \nher have their moment to express their views on something that is \nimportant to them and their constituency, to shut that off and put your \nthumb on it is not the way we should be doing it.\n  I am deeply concerned about any changes in the rules that are being \nproposed to eliminate the ability for both sides to do battle in a \nthoughtful, respectful manner. If you see the movie ``Lincoln,'' you \nsee that even back then they were battling most of the time to convince \neach other to go one way or the other. Since when has it been a problem \nto have vibrant debate in the Senate, in this great Chamber? Since \nwhen? What is everybody scared about? I don't understand that. I am \nhopeful the leaders will come together and recognize we need to have \nthat vibrant debate. That is what makes this Chamber unique among any \nother form of government around the world. To take that away and limit \nit I think is a big mistake.\n  I wish to say thank you, obviously, to the people of Massachusetts \nfor entrusting me to sit in the people's seat for the past 3 years. I \nthank my colleagues who are here, with whom I have had some great \nfriendships and opportunities to work together. As I said many times \nbefore, victory and defeat is temporary depending on what happens and \nwhere we go. All of us, obviously, may meet again, but I am looking \nforward to continuing on with those friendships, continuing on working \nwith my staff.\n  I thank you for this opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague, \nSenator Scott Brown, who will leave the Senate at the conclusion of the \n112th Congress. Senator Brown won a special election in 2010 to fill \nthe seat of the late Senator Edward Kennedy, but his service to the \nState of Massachusetts began many years ago.\n  Senator Brown began his career in public service in 1992, working as \na real estate assessor for the town of Wrentham, MA. In 1998, he was \nelected to the Massachusetts House. Six years later, he was elected to \nthe State senate, where he was known as a strong advocate for veterans \nissues. As a State senator, he championed legislation that created a \ncheck-off box on State income tax forms for veterans to indicate \nservice in Iraq or Afghanistan so that they could be efficiently \nnotified of benefits.\n  His work on behalf of veterans is not surprising considering Senator \nBrown has proudly served in the Army National Guard since enlisting at \nage 19 when he attended college at Tufts University. Once elected to \nthe U.S. Senate, his commitment to military and veterans issues \ncontinued as he served on the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, \nArmed Services, and the Veteran's Affairs Committees.\n  Although his time in the Senate was short, Senator Brown advanced \nseveral initiatives, including several that assist servicemembers and \ntheir families. He successfully included a provision in the 2012 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, which made certain that members of \nthe National Guard and their families receive a fair housing allowance \nwhen deployed overseas. Senator Brown also worked across the aisle on \nlegislation that demonstrated his commitment to our troops. He fought \nto provide greater oversight at Arlington National Cemetery, ensuring \nproper burials of America's fallen heroes and secured a provision to \ncreate the Office of Service Member Affairs at the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau to help returning servicemembers avoid financial \nfraud.\n  The hard work and dedication that Senator Brown has shown during his \nyears of public service will surely bring him continued success in the \nfuture. I thank Senator Brown for his service in the Senate and wish \nhim the best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7757-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7757-S7758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MIDDLE-CLASS TAX RATES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the House of Representatives is back, \nand we welcome them. It is good to have them back in business in \nWashington. I hope the first order of business this week is to pass a \nbill that we enacted in July of this year which would protect 98 \npercent of American families from any increase in income taxes because \nof the fiscal cliff. I hope both Democrats and Republicans in the House \nagree these working families don't need a tax increase. Those who \nshould pay an additional amount are those in the highest income \ncategories. That is what President Obama said.\n  When we voted in the Senate, we said those families making $250,000 \nor less should have no increase in income tax. I appeal to Speaker \nBoehner--before he takes another recess in the House--please call this \nmeasure and pass it. It will give peace of mind to literally millions \nof American families who are wondering what is going to happen January \n1. These are many families who struggle from paycheck to paycheck. I \nhave several letters.\n  From Lansing, IL, Linda wrote:\n\n       Please vote to keep middle class taxes from rising. $2,000 \n     will help me to keep food on the table and gas in my car. It \n     could even help me help someone else. Please vote for the \n     middle class.\n\n  I will.\n  This letter is from Jeremy in Princeville, IL:\n\n       I am reaching out to you to ask you to continue to push for \n     extensions of middle class tax cuts. We are a family of four \n     making one hundred thousand annually. A two thousand dollar \n     increase will hurt our family in many ways. Our family is \n     trying to better ourselves but a $2,000 tax increase will \n     hurt our bottom line and the chances of enhancing our \n     children's lives.\n\n  Joan from Naperville writes:\n\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\n\n       Very high earners should pay more in taxes. And as a former \n     small business owner, I know this will not hurt small \n     businesses--very, very few of us make over $250,000 a year . \n     . . I know the gap between the rich and everyone is the \n     greatest it's been since the Gilded Age. Smart, brave \n     politicians helped give the middle class a chance--and we \n     need that from you now.\n\n  She wrote that to my office. I support her, and I think she and the \nPresident are right. I am waiting for Speaker Boehner to finally break \nout of this back-and-forth as to whether the wealthy in America should \npay a little bit more in taxes. For goodness' sake, that is obvious to \neverybody in America but the Speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, get back to Ohio and ask some of those families about \nwhether middle-income families should pay higher taxes come January 1. \nThe answer is clear: They should not. It is within the power of Speaker \nBoehner to bring to the floor of the House today a measure that passed \nthe Senate in July that will protect families making $250,000 a year or \nless.\n  What I hear from the Speaker is, We won't protect middle-income \nfamilies until you agree to raise the eligibility age for Medicare.\n  I have said to all who have asked, I believe in entitlement reform. I \nbelieve Medicare going broke in 12 years is a serious challenge to all \nof us, but I am loathe to see us make a policy change in Medicare in \nthe closing days of this month that we have to live with and cannot \nexplain.\n  Here is the part we cannot explain: If we increase the eligibility \nage for Medicare from 65 to 67, what is a person to do who retires at \n63 or 64 with a medical condition? Where are they going to go for \nhealth insurance, the insurance exchanges created by health care \nreform? Remember the Republicans and their blood oath to kill that the \nfirst chance they got? Is that going to be the only rescue, the only \noption for a senior waiting for Medicare eligibility? Are the \nRepublicans prepared to say they will now stand behind the insurance \nexchanges and make sure there is an affordable, accessible health \ninsurance plan that covers seniors until they are Medicare eligible? \nThat is the key question. Until they answer that, I basically think the \nproposal of raising that Medicare retirement age is one that cannot be \nsupported in good conscience.\n  Let's get down to business. Let's protect the middle-income families \nin America. Let's do it now. Let's do it before January 1. Let's make \nsure they have the confidence of knowing their income taxes are not \ngoing up. One person has the power to do it, and that is Speaker John \nBoehner. If he calls the bill that passed the Senate, as he is being \nurged to even by Members of his own party, we can give a good holiday \ngift--if not a gift, at least a holiday reference--to families all \nacross America who are looking for some help not only in this holiday \nseason but beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7758-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7758-S7759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VOTING RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, after a prolonged debate, a lot of \ntelevision commercials, robo-calls, and literally tons of political \nliterature, the 2012 campaign is finally over. America can breathe a \nsigh of political relief. When it was all said and done, more than 120 \nmillion Americans participated.\n  As we know, the American people have returned a divided government to \nWashington. We have a Democratic Senate with an increased majority, a \nDemocratic President, and a Republican House of Representatives. Yet by \na margin of 3.4 million popular votes and 126 electoral votes, \nPresident Obama was reelected.\n  Now that the dust has settled, we begin the time-honored tradition of \ninaugurating the President, swearing in new Members of Congress, and \nbeginning a new session. The peaceful transfer of power and start of a \nnew legislative session are what we are all about in a democracy. We \ndon't anticipate any new obstacles with new Members of Congress \nassuming power. However, we can't say the same about many citizens who \ntried to vote in this election. Unfortunately, we know there were far \ntoo many voters who ran into obstacles and obstruction and unreasonable \ndelays at the polls.\n  In his address to the Nation on the night of the election, President \nObama said: ``We have to fix that.'' He is right. As we move forward, \nwe must look back and thoroughly examine the problems so many Americans \nhave encountered when they tried to exercise their legal, \nconstitutional right to vote. Many of these problems were traceable to \nnew voting laws enacted by Republican-controlled legislatures across \nthe country who were trying to make it harder for Americans to vote.\n\n  The ALEC, American Legislative Exchange Council, is a group of \nbusinesses that put millions of dollars together to create obstacles \nand obstructions for people to vote. Their idea was to diminish the \nvote among the poor, minorities, and the elderly because they believed \nthose groups leaned Democratic. So if they could keep them away from \nthe polls and discourage them from voting, it would help the Republican \ncandidates.\n  It didn't work, but they sure tried, and they made life miserable on \nelection day for millions of Americans who were just trying to do their \ncivic duty. Too many people stood in long lines. Too many people were \nunable to vote because they could not wait in long lines.\n  For example, in Florida published reports indicate some voters waited \nin line for as long as 7 hours. They could not cast their ballots until \n2:30 in the morning. Why would a voter hang in there? Some of them were \njust mad. They were mad that the State of Florida and this Republican-\ninspired organization, ALEC, were doing everything they could to deny \ntheir right to vote. They were darned determined to vote even if it \nmeant staying there 7 hours to vote.\n  Too many people were required to cast provisional ballots when they \nwere, in fact, eligible and should have received a regular ballot. For \nexample, Pennsylvania issued double the number of provisional ballots \nthan it did in 2008. The provisional ballot is given to a voter when \nthere is some question as to their eligibility. In many cases that \nquestion was raised because voters showed up at their polling place \nonly to find their name missing from the registration books.\n  In Arizona more than 174,000 provisional ballots were cast. That is \n7.4 percent of all ballots. That is higher than any previous election. \nAccording to a recent analysis by a leading Arizona paper, minority \nprecincts--those with African Americans and Hispanics--submitted a \ndisproportionately high number of provisional ballots. Arizona has \ndeclared war on those minorities who were voting, and they saw it when \nmany of them could not get their ballot counted on election day. It was \nput in a separate box to be looked at later.\n  Across the States with new voter ID requirements, hundreds of \nthousands of people could not vote because they didn't have or could \nnot obtain the required ID.\n  In Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wisconsin many voters were \nconfused by these new ID requirements and the extent they were enforced \non election day.\n  In Pennsylvania, for example, even though a court ruled that the \nState's voter ID law could not be enforced during this election, some \nvoters were still asked for an ID, and in some cases they were denied \nthe right to vote.\n  Too many eligible voters were unable to register. On election day too \nmany voters who thought they were registered learned that their names \nwere not actually on the voter rolls. For example, Florida imposed \nowners' requirements on third-party groups, such as the League of Women \nVoters and individuals who traditionally have conducted voter \nregistration drives. Those penalties were so awful, the League of Women \nVoters in Florida stopped registering voters for the first time in more \nthan 70 years.\n  High school teachers faced fines of $1,000 under the law if they \nhelped their students to register for the first time and didn't follow \nthe exact letter of their new statutory law. As a result, new voter \nregistration in Florida actually dropped 14 percent. That is bad news. \nOverall voter turnout was down compared to 2008.\n  If this is going to be a healthy, growing, vibrant democracy, people \nwho are eligible to vote should be given that opportunity, not \npenalized and denied. These problems--and other problems--encountered \nby voters at the polls were not limited to one State or region. These \nproblems were experienced by voters across the country. Many of the \nproblems that voters encountered on\n\n[[Page S7759]]\n\nelection day were foreseeable and could have been prevented.\n  Last year I started raising concerns about these new State voting \nlaws and what they were going to do. As chairman of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights, I chaired \nthe first hearing to examine the potential impact of these laws in both \nFlorida and Ohio. In both States we heard from experts and election \nadministrators who warned that these new State laws would result in \nfewer registered voters, long delays on election day, confusion about \nID requirements, and an increase in provisional ballots. This is just \nplain wrong.\n  In a country where we want every eligible American to get out and \nvote and we want higher percentages of participation, we have State \nlegislatures inspired by ALEC dreaming up obstacles and ways to \ndiscourage voters. It is sickening to think of how many lives have been \nlost by patriotic Americans to protect our right to vote, and then to \nhave these lobbyists, for their own political purposes, denying that \nright over and over to thousands of eligible American voters.\n  One of the strongest tools we have to ensure the right to vote and to \nmake sure it is not denied on account of a voter's race, sex, or any \nother discriminatory basis is the Voting Rights Act. As we work to \ncontinue to perfect our Union, the importance of this law cannot be \noverstated. That is why the Voting Rights Act enjoys a broad spectrum \nof support.\n  In 2006 the Senate voted unanimously, 98 to 0, to reauthorize it. \nJust this year the Department of Justice used its authority under \nsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act to object to new voter \nidentification laws that threaten to disenfranchise hundreds of \nthousands of voters.\n  In Texas, according to the State's own data, more than 795,000 \nregistered voters did not have the ID required under their brand-new \nlaw. In South Carolina the State's data indicated 240,000 registered \nvoters were without the required ID and would not be able to vote under \nthe State's law. In those two States alone, over 1 million people were \ngoing to be denied the right to vote, even though they were registered \nvoters, because they didn't possess the newly defined voter ID in each \nof those States. That is more than 1 million registered voters, I \nrepeat, who would have been turned away. Well, thanks to the Justice \nDepartment and court decisions, that didn't happen, but it would have. \nThat was the plan.\n\n  Since the civil rights movement, women's suffrage movement, and other \nhistoric fights to expand the right to vote are now in the history \nbooks, some people think our generation's responsibility to protect the \nright to vote is over. They are just plain wrong. When groups such as \nthe ALEC, with businesses, corporations, and conservative groups behind \nthem, have an all-out effort to deny and discourage the right to vote, \nwe have a job ahead of us. We shouldn't be surprised that people all \nacross America are angry about what happened in this election. These \nState legislatures, instead of encouraging people to exercise their \ncivic duty, were doing their best to discourage them. It is time for us \nto get serious about this. So next Congress, after the first of the \nyear, I am going to hold additional hearings on voting rights in my \nJudiciary subcommittee.\n  I am committed to thoroughly examining this issue. There is no excuse \nin America for standing in line 7 hours to vote, for goodness sake. \nOther countries that do this by paper ballot don't make people stand in \nlines that long and they calculate the results the same night. We \nshould be embarrassed by what is going on, and the States should grow \nup and pay attention to what they are doing to this great democracy in \nAmerica. They are undermining the right to vote just as surely as if \nthey attacked it openly, by using these new obstacles they are \ncreating--these IDs, limiting the early voting.\n  Listen, States such as Oregon and others have figured out people can \nvote by mail without fraud, people can have opportunities to vote \nextended through early voting and absentee voting and give people their \nvoice in this democracy. If we want to restore the confidence of the \nAmerican people in our government, we have to give them their voice on \nelection day. Standing in line 7 hours is an embarrassment in every \nState where it happened, and we have to make sure it doesn't occur when \nit applies to Federal elections.\n  I know the tradition. State laws determine election standards. That \nis the way it goes. But when it comes to Federal elections, we have a \nvoice in the process and we have to make sure we come together on a \nbipartisan basis to deal with it. I am pleased Chairman Leahy and I are \ngoing to be able to work together to hold a hearing of the full \nJudiciary Committee next Wednesday, December 19, to continue to explore \nthis issue, and then into the new Congress we will be proposing \nspecific legislation to deal with this issue.

Madam President, I rise today to first \nrecognize the life of a very unique and remarkable Coloradan, and then \nI will speak to a cause that is near and dear to me, as it is I think \nto the Presiding Officer as well, and that is our wind energy industry \nand the threat it faces.\n  I wish to speak about a man by the name of Randy Atkinson whom we \nlost this year on October 9, 2012, at the way-too-young age of 60. He \nwas a firefighter. He dedicated himself to serving his community and, \nas he put it, brothers and sisters in Colorado's fire departments.\n  Randy was an example to all of us because he dedicated his entire \nadult life to helping others. He started at the age of 19, in 1972, by \njoining the Denver Fire Department and Denver Firefighters Local 858. \nNot long after that, he took a more active role in representing his \nfellow firefighters as an advocate and a legislative consultant for the \nColorado Professional Firefighters and Denver Local 858. He was held in \nhigh esteem not just by his fellow firefighters but by Colorado \nlegislators on both sides of the aisle. Why was that? He was \nintelligent. He was caring. He had a great sense of humor. We all \nappreciated that when we came into contact with him, whether we were \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  He was a leader and because of that he kept rising through the ranks. \nIn 1995, he was elected president of the Colorado Professional \nFirefighters. In 2007, he was elected as vice president for the \nInternational Association of Firefighters in the 9th District. When he \ndied, he was serving in both of those positions.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has a phenomenal crew of firefighters in \nher home State. We know what they did on 9/11 and what they do every \nday. Randy was a man who served in that spirit. While he represented \nfirefighters, he always was fighting for fair pay and making sure those \nwho stand up for us in times of hazard and emergency have the best \npossible safety equipment to carry out their dangerous and often unsung \nresponsibilities. While at times Randy had to be pretty hard-nosed when \nit came to negotiating and standing up for firefighters, he always had \na positive relationship with policymakers, even when he was tangling \nwith them. I have to say I am glad we agreed more often than we \ndisagreed.\n  Randy Atkinson was truly an admired figure. As I think about him, I \nwish we had more people such as Randy right here in Washington, DC. We \nwould certainly get more done and we would have stronger relationships \nwith one another.\n  Late this fall more than 500 of us gathered to celebrate his life, \nincluding family members, friends, and work associates. We laughed and \nwe cried and showed our appreciation for his life and service. I was \nhonored that day to be a part of that celebration.\n  I want to extend my sincerest condolences to his family, including \nhis son Randy, Jr., and his two daughters, Brenda and Denisa. We all \nloved him, as I have said. I hope the viewers all understand how much I \nadmired him, how hard he worked, and how grateful we are to have known \nhim. I am honored to be able to stand here on the floor of the Senate, \nremembering Randy smiling, to recognize his life and his \naccomplishments and, above all, his\n\n[[Page S7760]]\n\nenduring spirit and his strong character. I think we have to keep his \nspirit alive in our attitudes and in our actions.\n  I thank the Chair for her interest in another firefighter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7760-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WIND ENERGY TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I now wish to turn to the \nwind production tax credit. The Presiding Officer has been in the chair \nlistening on a number of occasions and she has been gracious in her \ninterest and support of what we are trying to do.\n  This is my 26th speech urging all of us to extend the wind production \ntax credit. It is known simply as the PTC in the abbreviated form. It \nis going to expire in 4 weeks--less than 4 weeks, actually--if we don't \nextend it. I am so worried about what is going to happen to this \nimportant industry.\n  The PTC has created good-paying middle-class jobs in the wind energy \nindustry not only in my own State--I have a bias about my own State--\nbut all across the Nation. Almost every State has a stake in the wind \nenergy industry. When we think about what the PTC has done, we realize \nit has also stimulated the growth of our clean energy economy as well \nas promoted clean energy security. The Presiding Officer serves on the \nArmed Services Committee so she knows the importance of energy to \nnational security.\n  We have 75,000 jobs in the wind industry right now in Colorado. We \nare on track to produce 20 percent of our electricity through the wind, \nby harvesting the wind, by 2030. But if we let the PTC expire, \nestimates suggest we will lose half of those jobs. We would be down to \n37,000 jobs. We also undermine our Nation's pursuit of true energy \nsecurity.\n  Our inaction, although the tax credit hasn't expired, has halted \nfurther development in the wind energy industry because that set of \nleaders can't in good faith bring that capital to bear and make those \ninvestments if they think the wind energy credit will truly expire. We \nhave had hundreds of layoffs in Colorado. The business has nearly \nground to a halt, and we see that all over the country. Then we get a \nripple effect in those communities because tax receipts go down, people \naren't as upbeat about the future, and it is a downward spiral we have \nto end. We should be doing everything we can coming out of this tough \neconomic recession--the great recession--to make strategic investments \nin our economy and in our energy portfolio.\n  So with that general outline of what we face, I wish to turn to the \nState of Maine today. The Presiding Officer and I have great respect \nfor both of our Maine Senators. We are going to miss Senator Snowe, and \nSenator Collins has been a strong supporter as well.\n  Maine is well positioned to become a major player in the wind energy \nindustry going forward. Maine has the potential for significant \neconomic development and environmental benefits. In 2011, wind energy \nprovided 2.9 percent of the Pine Tree State's power and Maine's wind \nfarms power the equivalent of about 100,000 homes. The outlook for \ntheir wind energy industry is bright. The State has another 34 \nmegawatts of wind power under construction and enough untapped \npotential to power three times the State's current electricity needs. \nThree times their needs will be powered by harvesting all the wind \nresources there. So I will say the PTC is crucial to their continued \ngrowth and the capacity they have to tap into their available wind \nresources.\n  Maine, of course, has a vast interior, but it also is on the coast. \nRight now Maine is New England's leading land-based wind producer, and \nexperts predict it could become the leading offshore wind producer in \nthe coming years. The University of Maine has a center called the \nAdvanced Structures and Composites Center, and their research and \ndevelopment is paving the way for this additional offshore development.\n  There is also an expiring tax credit called the investment tax \ncredit--the ITC--and that provides additional incentives. The ITC will \nbe vital to the growth of offshore and distributed wind power \ndevelopment as well. It is also at risk. We need to include a \ndiscussion of the ITC as we consider the extenders package.\n  I have mentioned that what the wind projects do is to lift local \neconomies. The Presiding Officer has a lot of rural economies in the \nnorth and the west of New York, a lot of agricultural-based economic \nactivity. Wind power, when it is properly developed, is a cash crop \nthat always comes in. As we face the consequences of this economic \nslowdown, wind power has helped a lot of local economies have \nadditional revenue, economic activity, and jobs.\n  In that context, I wanted to talk about the Bull Hill Wind Project in \nMaine. It is in Hancock County, down here on the coast. I think it is \ncalled down east if one is from Maine. That project was just completed. \nIt will generate $100,000 annually in tax revenue, and it has supported \nabout 100 jobs during the peak of the construction. That is a \nsignificant number of jobs in a rural county in a State such as Maine.\n  I have to put a pitch in for Colorado. This project uses wind \nturbines which are made by Vestas which manufactures blades, nacelles, \nand towers in Colorado.\n  Much like in Colorado, the production tax credit creates and sustains \nmanufacturing jobs, and it is creating growth in Maine. I know we have \nsome job numbers in the manufacturing sector that I will share with my \ncolleagues. There are four facilities in Maine that produce components \nfor the wind energy industry and the installed wind projects across the \nState to which I have alluded. Those jobs number about 500--500 being \nactual jobs. Speaking of tax payments, property tax payments, about $6 \nmillion comes in from those wind projects to local governments. That \nmoney helps infrastructure improvements and other vital services for \nlocal Maine communities.\n  So it is obvious that the growth of our domestic wind energy \nindustry, aided by the wind production tax credit, has helped create \njobs, encouraged energy security, and grown a clean energy economy in \nMaine and all across our country. It is really that simple. The wind \nenergy PTC powers good-paying middle-class jobs. However, if we do not \nextend it--it is a bipartisan policy, by the way, and the father of the \nwind PTC is our own Senator Grassley from Iowa--if we do not extend \nthis, we are going to lose thousands of jobs. At a time when our \neconomy is still in imbalance, that is not acceptable. It cannot happen \nin Maine, it cannot happen in Colorado, and it should not be happening \nto thousands of families across our country. So it is simple.\n  The PTC equals jobs. We need to pass it ASAP. Let's work together. \nOur inaction is stunting the growth of a 21st-century clean energy \neconomic opportunity for us. Those jobs are not necessarily going to be \nlost if we do not do what we should do, but they are going to go to \nplaces such as China, Europe. The world is investing in big numbers in \nwind energy because of all the possibilities for economic development.\n  So let's, in sum, remember that the production tax credit equals \njobs. The PTC equals jobs. Let's pass it as soon as possible. Time is \nrunning out. The clock is ticking.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore for her interest and for her \nsupport. New York has great wind energy potential.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I notice the Chamber is empty today, and \nI guess most of us are waiting to see if there is going to be an \narrangement made between the President and Speaker Boehner on our \nfiscal cliff that is coming up in just a few weeks. I know all of us \nwant to see that happen. I think each of us knows the very best thing \nthat can happen for the economy in New York or Tennessee or any other \nplace is for us to get this behind us and for businesses to begin this \nnext year knowing that Congress and the White House have worked out an \narrangement to put this fiscal issue in\n\n[[Page S7761]]\n\nthe rearview mirror. I know we are moving, hopefully--what we would \nlike to do is move not just beyond the fiscal cliff but have a fiscal \nreform bill in place that is in the $4, $4.5 trillion range so we can \nat least for a period of time put this issue in the rearview mirror.\n  So, Madam President, I want to tell you that I am hopeful that is \ngoing to occur. I know there have been a lot of discussions in our \ncaucus, in the Acting President pro tempore's caucus about that \nhappening. On the other hand, it is my understanding that these \nnegotiations really are not moving along very rapidly. We only have a \nfew weeks left in this year, and it is beginning to look as though, at \na minimum, if there is an arrangement made, it is not going to be one \nof the size that all of us would like to see happen.\n  I know one of the issues all of us have talked about is the middle-\nincome citizens in our country. I know at some point both Chambers will \ncome to the rescue of 98 percent of the people in our country and pass \nsome resolution dealing with the tax issues for 98 percent of our \npeople. I would say, the sooner we do that, the better. Actually, that \nalone would move us beyond this fiscal cliff at year end. Again, I know \nthere are a lot of discussions taking place in both Chambers about the \nbest way for that to happen.\n  But what I guess I am leading to is that it looks as though, based on \nwhere the negotiations are right now, this issue is going to move into \nnext year and that we are still not going to be at the dollar amount I \nknow the Acting President pro tempore has talked about and I have \ntalked about and that we are still going to have this issue to deal \nwith. As a matter of fact, what it looks like may well happen is that \nall we do this year is, hopefully, move beyond the fiscal cliff.\n  I know over in the House there are discussions about, when do you do \nthis? Do you do it on January the 3rd or do you do that in this \ncalendar year?\n  I would argue the very best way for us to deal with this would be to \ndeal with it prior to year end and go ahead and take our responsibility \nseriously, make sure we rescue the 98 percent of the people in our \ncountry before year end so they go into the new year knowing that has \nbeen dealt with, and then there are other ways we can deal with the \nother 2 percent.\n  I know in New York, for instance, $250,000 a year is not considered \nto be extremely wealthy. So it may be that we deal with the other \nmachinations other than what has been laid out in public by the \nPresident. But I think we are going to deal with this issue.\n  I wish to come to the debt ceiling. Everyone in this country knows \nwhat damage was done to our country when we pressed right up against \nthe debt ceiling two Augusts ago. I do not want to see that happen \nagain. I do think the arrangement that has been created between the \nWhite House and Congress during this fiscal dilemma, where we raised \nthe debt ceiling by $1 for every $1 in cuts that are made--I think that \nis an appropriate arrangement for us until we get through this fiscal \nissue.\n  Again, what I would rather see happen is that we just deal with that \nall right now, and we start off next year with people knowing that is \ndone. Since it looks like every day that goes by, it looks like it is \nincreasingly unlikely that is going to happen, I wanted to offer a \nproposal for the leadership of the Senate; that is, since it looks like \nthe debt ceiling could be coming up early next year--as a matter of \nfact, it may coincide very closely with the continuing resolution. \nThere are two, if you will, moments in time where we have to make big \ndecisions for our country.\n  I would offer that we go ahead and begin the process of the debt \nceiling. I would make the proposal that the first roughly $1 trillion--\n$900 billion to $1 trillion in raises in the debt ceiling are \naccompanied by $900 billion to $1 trillion in cuts in entitlement \nspending to actually cause those programs to be solvent. I think all of \nus want to make sure seniors in this country are protected. We know we \nhave to make some adjustments to Medicare, Social Security, and \nMedicaid, which deal with the poor, to make sure these programs over \ntime are solvent, are not a huge drain on the States that support them \nin the case of Medicaid.\n  What I am saying is why do we not go ahead and get started. I know \nmost of us did not particularly like the process last time, where \nbasically these discussions took place in private and at the last \nmoment we understood what the deal was. Then, after that, if you \nremember, we had a process, a supercommittee that was put in place, six \nRepublicans, six Democrats, highly qualified folks. But they did not \ncome to a resolution so we have ended up with sequestration.\n  What I would propose is instead of doing things in private such, \nlet's go ahead and address the issue now in regular order. What I would \nlike to propose to the leadership of the Senate and offer to the House \nalso is that since we know the debt ceiling is coming up and since none \nof us--none of us wants to jeopardize the credit rating of this \ncountry, I would propose we finish our work at least 1 month in advance \nof the debt ceiling needing to be raised.\n  That way everyone in the world knows we have solved this problem. I \nwould also propose we do it through regular order in the committee \nprocess so people can see how we are moving along. Are we making \nprogress? Are we doing the things that are necessary to be able to \nraise the debt ceiling during this period of time when we have so many \nfiscal issues?\n  My third suggestion is that 100 percent of the first raise all be \noriented toward entitlements. We all are taught to lead by example. My \ndaddy used to tell me: Son, never ask someone to do something you would \nnot do yourself. What I plan to do over the next couple days is to \noffer a piece of legislation that would cut and reform Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and Medicaid by $900 billion to $1 trillion. I hope to do \nthat over the next couple days, offer that as one suggestion as to how \nwe raise the debt ceiling by $900 billion to $1 trillion.\n  I know that again is going to be coming up in February or March. I \nknow we are going to have the issue of the CR coming up. But if the \nPresident and Speaker Boehner are unable to come to an arrangement, I \ndo not think there is any question that people around here are going to \nbecome very focused on the debt ceiling and certainly the continuing \nresolution.\n  What I would say is let's get busy. Let's not wait until the last \nminute. Let's not have closed-door meetings. Let's work this through \nthe committee process. Then, when the Senate passes their bill and the \nHouse passes their bill, let's have a conference and let's deal with \nthe legislation that is necessary to make sure we continue the \nprecedent that, by the way, the President set this last time with \nCongress; that is, for every $1 we raise the debt ceiling, we reduce \nspending by $1.\n  We know this precedent is not going to continue forever. But I think \nthat where we are in the country, we know we have tremendous fiscal \nissues. We have $16 trillion of debt right now, and it is rising. I \nknow all of us know that is the No. 1 threat to our Nation. In fact, \nevery developed country in the world knows the greatest threat to \nAmerica and, candidly, to the world right now is our solvency. \nEconomists on both sides of the aisle have said the greatest threat to \nour country is solvency.\n  Let's face it. We are probably going to deal with the revenue at year \nend. We all know that. We can kid around, we can put our heads in the \nsand, but we know we are going to be dealing with a portion of the \nrevenue issue at year end. At some point we have to rescue the 98 \npercent. What I would say to my friends in the House is that, candidly, \nif we are able to rescue the 98 percent and then we dealt with the \nother 2 percent either with rates or by tax deductions--I am open to \nboth, and we even protect the small businesses as so many people on \nboth sides of the aisle have suggested--I would say to my friends in \nthe House that the revenue figure that would accompany these changes is \nmuch smaller, candidly, than maybe the first offer that was made from \nthe House to the President.\n  This is actually a better way for those of us who believe spending is \nthe issue. There is a better way to cause revenue to be at the \nappropriate mix level, if you will, in solving our fiscal issues. We \nhave had a lot of talk about entitlement reform. Let me stop for a \nminute before I go there.\n  People all over the world know this is the No. 1 threat to our \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S7762]]\n\nEconomists on both sides of the aisle know it is the No. 1 threat to \nour country. I think for that reason, what we have been doing is saying \nwe are not going to voice vote debt ceilings any more. I know we have a \nlot of people on Wall Street and other places who talk about how the \ncredit rating of our country is so important. Believe me, I know that \nwell. I could not agree more. So the last thing we need to do again is \nto get in a situation where we wait until the last minute and the whole \nworld is wondering whether we are going to default on our debt and \npeople are all shaken up about where America is.\n  I would say, since we know that if the President and the Speaker do \nnot agree to a large deal, since we know the debt ceiling is likely to \nbe the next event, if you will, the next forcing event that causes us \nto come to terms with the solvency of this Nation--the way I know the \nWhite House has said certain things about the debt ceiling, what we may \nwant to do is make sure the CR and the debt ceiling stay tied together \nand working along together at the same time so we have both those \nforcing moments happening together.\n  But in order to make sure we do not threaten the credit of this great \nNation, let's go ahead and work now. As a matter of fact, what I am \ngoing to do in the next couple days is I am going to offer a bill to \nraise the debt ceiling of our Nation. Think about that. A Republican, I \nam going to offer a bill to raise the debt ceiling of our Nation. I am \ngoing to offer a bill that is going to raise the debt ceiling by $900 \nbillion to $1 trillion. I am going to offer that bill in December.\n  The debt ceiling is probably not coming until maybe February or \nMarch. In order to raise that debt ceiling by that amount, it is going \nto be accompanied by entitlement changes in equal amounts. It is the \nsame precedent the President and the Speaker agreed to last year and \nthis body agreed to. I think we are going to follow that formula likely \ninto this next year, unless there is a large deal announced soon.\n  What I would say to other Members in the House: Look, I am just one \nSenator. I am just one Senator. There are other Senators here who \ncertainly have as good or better ideas. So why do we not start the \nprocess of formally offering on the floor entitlement reforms. I would \nsuggest that is the place we start. I mean, what we have done around \nhere is we have done discretionary cuts. We created sequestration.\n  At the end of this year, in some form or fashion, whether we \nembarrass ourselves and wait and go over the cliff in the next year or \nbefore this year ends, we are going to offer revenues. I do not know \nhow anybody can believe revenues are not coming. What I would say to \neveryone here: Let's move to entitlement reform. That is the only \nthing, candidly, that has not been talked about in this debate.\n  No one--no one--has offered publicly concrete entitlement reform in \nlegislative language in the Senate. Nobody has done that in the House. \nThat is what has been missing in this debate. In order to kick off this \ndebate in what I consider to be an appropriate way, I am going to offer \na debt ceiling increase bill. I am going to offer it in the next 24 to \n48 hours. I may offer it today.\n  It is going to have dollar-for-dollar entitlement reforms. That will \nsave this Nation from catastrophe and make sure seniors have these \nbenefits down the road. What I would ask the leaders to do is to \nconsider putting in place a process through regular order to consider \nthese bills, to deal with the debt ceiling so we can do it way in \nadvance and everybody can see the process and see the debate and watch \nour Nation function in an appropriate way so we get this done well in \nadvance of the Treasury Secretary telling us the debt ceiling needs to \nbe raised.\n  Let me close by saying, the best thing that can happen to this \nNation, even though it is odd, I have to tell you it is odd, is we turn \non the television at night or we read the paper in the morning, we see \nwhere the President called Speaker Boehner or maybe Speaker Boehner \ncalled the President, and there is drama. None of us knows what is \nsaid. I have a pretty good idea.\n  But our Nation is sitting here while this silly debate--here is the \nSenate, the greatest deliberative body in the world. What are we doing? \nWe are hearing about the discussions on the telephone. By the way, if \nthat solves the problem, I am all for it. I am all for a solution that \ncomes that way. Candidly, I hope it is a big solution. I hope it is a \n$4\\1/2\\-trillion solution that they come to. But I am doubtful that is \ngoing to happen based on where we are today on December 12.\n  So I am going to offer a debt ceiling bill to move us on. It will \nmove us toward fiscal solvency. It will keep us from jeopardizing the \ncredit of this Nation. We can move those things through regular order. \nI ask the leadership of the Senate, Majority Leader Reid, to hopefully \nset up a process soon. Because, candidly, we are probably going to need \nto drop debt ceiling bills soon, probably January 3, to make the dates \nthat are necessary to actually raise our debt ceiling and not have the \ncredit implications we had last August.\n  I have been a little bit despondent about this process because it \njust feels as though things are not moving ahead in a way that we are \ngoing to be able to put this in the rearview mirror and start this \nyear--this next year with tremendous economic growth because people \nknow we have solved this problem. I have been despondent about that.\n  But I woke this morning with almost a eureka moment thinking that, \nyou know what, if they are not going to deal with this issue, we know \nwe have to deal with the debt ceiling, we know we have to deal with the \nCR, there is great opportunity for all of us to put out entitlement \nreforms on the floor, for all of us to debate in committee and to pass \nlegislation so, dollar for dollar, we can raise the debt ceiling way in \nadvance of any time to cause any kind of credit problems for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Although they were \non the other side of the aisle, there was no great divide between us. \nWe have known each other for many years.\n  I would like to say a few words about my very dear friend, Senator \nOlympia Snowe. I served with Senator Olympia Snowe in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and then in the U.S. Senate. Wow.

She is deeply, in her DNA, a public \nservant.\n  Senator Snowe has served her State of Maine and our Nation so well. \nShe is one of our most respected Members of Congress, known for her \ncivility, her sensibility, and her mastery of the issues. I might add \nthat she brings that New England sense of a more frugal government but \nat the same time shows that you can do it in a compassionate, smart \nway.\n  I know her as a cherished friend, a dear colleague, and a crucial \npartner on so many issues. As I said, we served in the House and the \nSenate together. We worked on those issues I talk about, the macro \nissues and the macaroni-and-cheese issues. We fought for a better \neconomy, particularly in the area of small business; a safer country, \nas we worked on the Intelligence Committee together; and a more \nefficient government. Also, we worked together on many issues \npertaining to women. In the area of small business, she is\n\n[[Page S7763]]\n\ncurrently the ranking member on the Small Business Committee, with our \nother colleague, Senator Mary Landrieu. She knows the backbone of \nMaine's economy is small business, and she also knows it is the \nbackbone of the American economy.\n  I have watched her day in and day out being concerned about her \nfishermen who were out there working in the cold waters off of Georges \nBank for lobsters and the small shop owner on Main Street. From the \npotato fields and lumber yards to L.L. Bean, Olympia Snowe has stood \nfor them but also for the big issues in terms of jobs in the Bath \nshipyards.\n  In national security, we have worked together to look out for our \ntroops over there and to protect our communities from predators back \nhere. She has been steadfast and true. It is a committee that meets \noften behind closed doors, but I will tell you, this is a Senator who \ncontinually looks after the safety of the American people.\n  One of the areas in which I have worked the closest with her is the \narea of women's health. You might be interested to know that Senator \nSnowe and I received the Good Housekeeping Outstanding Achievement \nAward for what we did to advance the cause of finding a cure for breast \ncancer. Now, when I called my sister and told her I was getting a Good \nHousekeeping award, she thought it was the funniest thing she had ever \nheard. When I told her I was getting it with Olympia Snowe, she knew it \nhad credibility. I say that because what we did in working together was \nin medical research and in clinical trials.\n  You might be interested to know that when I came to the Senate, the \nonly other woman Senator was Nancy Kassebaum--another wonderful person \nacross the aisle. Women were not included in the protocols at NIH. Can \nyou believe that? That famous study--take an aspirin a day, keep a \nheart attack away--was done with 10,000 male medical students. Not one \nwoman was there. They regarded including women in research as \npresenting deviant results. We were known as the deviant results. Well, \nPat Schroeder; Olympia Snowe; another Republican Congresswoman, Connie \nMorella from Maryland--we said this couldn't continue. So we organized \nacross the dome, across the aisle, and we went across the beltway to \nNIH. We pulled up and we demanded answers, scientific answers, on why \nwe weren't included.\n  The day we pulled up in our cars on a bipartisan basis, George Bush \nthe elder appointed Bernadine Healey to head NIH. Then, again working \ntogether across the aisle and across the dome, working with Senators \nKennedy and Harkin, we established the Office of Research on Women's \nHealth at NIH. The famous hormonal replacement therapy study was done. \nIt resulted in massive change in the way doctors treated women, and it \nhas reduced breast cancer rates 15 percent.\n  So I say to all, when you ask, what did Olympia Snowe do, she would \nsay: I worked on a bipartisan basis. And because of what she did, we \ndid, we all did working together, men and women, House and Senate, we \nhave saved the lives of women 1 million at a time. I think that is a \nterrific accomplishment. And no matter what Senator Snowe does, she can \ncherish in her heart that she did that.\n  But while we were busy doing the big picture, she helped me with an \nindividual picture. We went to the refugee camps of Cambodia together, \nalong with the Congresswomen. It was when the killing fields were at \nthat time the highest. We saw the horrible consequences of war. We \nworked together to feed the children. We worked together to feed the \nchildren and care for the children.\n  I met a young girl in a refugee camp, in the Catholic Relief feeding \ncamp. Working with Senator Snowe, we brought that little girl to the \nUnited States of America. She is alive here today, married and living \nas an American citizen.\n  So what did Olympia Snowe do? She saved jobs and she saved lives. I \nam proud to work with her, and we are going to miss her.\n  Then there is my good friend Kay Bailey Hutchison, who has just come \nto the floor. I am glad she is going to be here to hear what I am going \nto say about her. I hold her in such enormously high esteem.\n  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is known for her competence, her strong \ncharacter, and being an outstanding champion for Texas, an advocate for \nwomen, and a real patriot dedicated to serving our Nation. I too know \nher as a dear friend, someone deeply committed to creating that zone of \ncivility among the women in the Senate.\n  When Senator Hutchison arrived in the Senate in 1983, there were \nprickly politics beginning to emerge. She came from the Texas \nLegislature and knew the dynamics of a rough-and-tumble legislative \nbody. But as we worked together on something called the homemaker IRA, \nwe said: Why don't we just get together to see if we can create a zone \nof civility? That was when we brought the women together for those \nmonthly dinners. The rules were no staff, no leaks, and no memos. We \ntalked about everything from hairdos to the hair-raising and how we \ncould stop the global war on terror and fight the deadly scourge \nagainst breast cancer. We worked together, again across the aisle.\n\n  In 1992 we also worked to hold these power workshops to make sure \nevery woman would know how to get started in the Senate, and we worked \ntogether on that.\n  The other thing Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and I helped establish \nwas that we could disagree without being disagreeable. We, the women of \nthe Senate, do not have a caucus because we represent States. That is \nwhat the Constitution says is our job--we are here to represent States. \nWe also have different philosophies and viewpoints on governance. But \nwe also know we can disagree without being disagreeable.\n  A story I like to tell is that during debate on the Lilly Ledbetter \nFair Pay Act, Senator Hutchison and I agreed on absolutely the same \ngoal: equal pay for equal or comparable work for women. However, we \ndisagreed on the means. Senator Hutchison had about nine amendments, \nand we duked it out here. We went earring-to-earring in terms of our \ndebate, and the Senate commented on what intellectual rigor it had, \nwhat a sense of comity and exchanging of ideas. At the end of the day, \nwe not only passed the legislation, but we did it in a way where \neverybody could feel proud of the process. Why can't we do that every \nday? Gee, I wish we could.\n  Then working with Senator Hutchison--and this is how we got started, \nwas on the homemaker IRA. This was Senator Hutchison's idea. She came \nto me and she said: You know, Senator Barb, they are stay-at-home moms, \nand they are limited to only $500 that they can contribute to an IRA. \nIf they have the money and if they have the will and the wallet, we \nshould give them the same tax opportunities as if they were working in \nthe marketplace because their work at home should be valued as well.\n  Absolutely. We changed that legislation. I have pending here \nlegislation to permanently change the name of that homemaker IRA to the \nHutchison IRA because she really did lead the way. I was an able ally, \nand we made a difference.\n  So I could go through item after item--the way we have worked on \nbreast cancer together, the way we have worked on appropriations. She \nwas my ranking member on Commerce-Justice-Science. We have worked \ntogether on the space program. We have worked together to keep our \nareas safe. From the start, we shared a personal commitment that \ntechnology and space could help America remain exceptional, a belief in \nsupporting research and science, leading to new ideas that would be not \nonly new areas that we would explore but new technologies for new \nproducts and new jobs. Yes, I visited her down at mission control, and \nI have been there during the great research we were able to see being \ndone in that area.\n  Remember, the home of the Komen foundation is in Texas. Senator \nHutchison was very clear that she wanted to be sure that she too was an \nadvocate for women's health. We worked together on mammogram quality \nstandards. Were you aware that in the early days--and I know that \nsometimes we sound like we built the Pyramids together when I tell \nthese stories; it is both ancient history and a recent reality. If you \nwent into a doctor's office 10, 12 years ago for a mammogram,\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\nyou might have gotten a chest X ray and they would have called it a \nmammogram. It was often given by untrained technicians. There were no \nstandards for the equipment that it would really work the way it was \nsupposed to work, and it was often uncalibrated and ineffectual.\n  Senator Hutchison and I worked using sound science, thorough \nhearings, working with the Institute of Medicine, FDA, and the National \nInstitute of Standards. Now if you go into your doctor's office for \nthat mammogram, you will see a certificate from your government that \nsays this is a place where you know the technology will work and the \npeople who will be giving it will be trained. You know, once again, \nthis is early detection and screening, saving lives a million at a \ntime. Isn't that fantastic? Again, across the aisle, we were able to do \nthat.\n  We also did a book together. She was the leader in helping us publish \nour famous book, ``Nine and Counting.'' Maybe there will be time for \nanother book, but when the chapter of the history of the Senate is \nwritten, we want to be sure that the chapter really includes a big \nstatement to the work of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  Again, in this institution it is the personal relationships built \noften on policy. I went to Texas to tour the space program with Senator \nHutchison. That is where we heard about the National Space Biomedical \nResearch Institute at Baylor. When I was there, I met Senator \nHutchison's brother, who faced the same blood cancer disease Geraldine \nFerraro faced. Gerry and her brother became fast friends, so Kay and \nBarb teamed up. Again we pushed research at NIH. You know, cancer knows \nno party. It knows no ZIP Code. It knows no ideology. But it knows that \nwe need to work together to be able to do it. On that wonderful day of \nfriendship, where we learned the best ideas that will come out of our \nwork in the space program to deal with the dread cancer word, the kinds \nof things that we study in space will help us be more effective here on \nEarth.\n  Kay invited me to the Houston livestock show and rodeo. Now, I grew \nup in Baltimore, and you have been there many times yourself. You know \nit is a city known for its row houses, not for its rodeos.\n  Kay invited me to come to the rodeo in the Astrodome. Well, I showed \nup, to her surprise. I had little boots, a cowboy hat, and a vest. She \nput me in a buckboard, and, to ``Deep in the Heart of Texas,'' we \ncircled the Astrodome together. I was in a buckboard, and she was on a \npalomino next to me. The American flags were waving, and so was I, \nyelling ``giddy up, little doggie.'' At the end of the evening, I was \nthere munching on barbecue, affectionately called Buckboard Barb--and I \nhave the pictures to show it. They are locked up. I don't widely \ndistribute them. But it was a heck of an evening.\n\n  I say that because, again, out of that comes great friendships that \nalso lead to paving the way to where we put our heads together to solve \nour national problems and to do it in a way where we get the best ideas \nfrom a variety of government approaches. And at the end of the day, we \nfeel better, but America is better off.\n  I am pretty emotional, actually, when I think about Olympia and Kay. \nWe have been together a long time. We welcome the Acting President pro \ntempore and your generation, but for those of us who maybe didn't build \nthe pyramids--and I hope Senator Hutchison can say the same--there is a \nlot of meaning in a Latin phrase I learned in Catholic girls school \nmany years ago: Exegi aere perennius: We will build a monument more \nlasting than bronze.\n  When Senator Hutchison returns to Texas again to find a new way to \nserve the people of this country, she will know that here in this \ninstitution, along with Senator Olympia Snowe, they built monuments to \nlast far longer than any statues made of bronze. They made a difference \nin the lives of people, and they have done it in a way they can be \nproud of and for which we can all be grateful.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am so touched by the comments of my colleague \nSenator Mikulski about myself and Olympia. I appreciate so much that \nshe has singled us out because Senator Mikulski is a pioneer. She \ndidn't build the pyramids, I might say, but it was close. She was in \nthe House first and then came to the Senate. She is our longest serving \nwoman Senator and she will probably be dean of all the Senate at some \npoint because she is a legend. She is a legend in the Senate, she is a \nlegend in Maryland, and she is a legend in our country.\n  I think back now on the things we have been able to accomplish--and \nit was not just because we were women--here in this deliberative body \nwhere we have 100 people representing 50 very different States. It is \nnot that the men were against anything we have teamed up to do, but it \nis because of our experiences that we brought to the table. Sometimes \nit wasn't thought of before, before Senator Mikulski and other women \ncame.\n  I will point out a couple of things and embellish a little on what \nthe Senator said. When we wrote the book ``Nine and Counting,'' there \nwere nine women in the Senate at the time. But it came from something \nmuch bigger. It came from a meeting Senator Mikulski pulled together of \nthe women of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It was the Catholics and the \nProtestants who were trying to probe the women Senators, the nine of us \nwho were here, about how they could be effective in making peace in \nNorthern Ireland.\n  When we started telling our stories to them, to encourage them that \nthey could make a difference in Northern Ireland, Barbara Mikulski and \nI looked at each other and we said: You know, there is a book here. \nThere is a book about the obstacles women have faced getting to the \nU.S. Senate and a book that can encourage our girls and young women to \nplay a part in settling the major issues of our country.\n  From that background, we contacted Bob Barnett, who was an agent of \nSenators and House Members who write books, and also Cabinet members \nand Presidents, and we said we would like to get together and write a \nbook. He immediately got to work. It was Claire Wachtel at \nHarperCollins who said: ``Oh, I love this. I love it.'' She got a \nwriter who went to each of us and interviewed us and then wrote our \nstories, which were in our own words.\n  Afterward, we got together and decided to give all of the proceeds to \nthe Girl Scouts of America, which was a common organization that had \naffected almost every one of the women at the time. The Girl Scouts \nwere giving leadership capabilities to the girls in our country. I had \nbeen a Girl Scout and so had Barbara. Our book is still in print and it \nhas raised tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars \nfor the Girl Scouts to continue their leadership programs. And it all \ncame from something we learned about each other.\n  I think the multiple myeloma disease, which my brother has, and which \nGeraldine Ferraro had, was another area where Barbara and I bonded. I \nbonded with Geraldine Ferraro too, who was a champion for women up and \ncoming in our political system. She encouraged me a lot.\n  But together with Barbara Mikulski, who was a dear friend of \nGeraldine Ferraro's, and who spoke at her funeral--we both went to that \nfuneral--we were able to pass legislation that provided funding for \nresearch and education for multiple myeloma. We named it the Geraldine \nFerraro Multiple Myeloma Education Program so that more could be \nlearned about this very rare disease.\n\n  Gerri was a fighter and she only died a year and a half ago. My \nbrother is a fighter and he is still doing great. And now, because of \nour research, we are maintaining and we are letting people live a \nquality life because we teamed up.\n  Barbara told the story, but I will tell the other side--the rest of \nthe story--about the Houston rodeo, because they still talk about \nBuckboard Barb. She came to the rodeo from her ethnic background in \nBaltimore, and she was such a great sport. I was riding my horse in the \ngrand entry and Barb was in the buckboard. She was waving and having \nthe best time, and of course all of us were in our rodeo attire, which \nwas sort of foreign to Barb, I have to say. But she was right in there \nwith her boots and her big cowgirl hairdo. And Barbara leaned over to \nme at one of the rodeo events and she said: OK,\n\n[[Page S7765]]\n\nKay, if we were here Monday morning and we went to a chamber of \ncommerce meeting, would these people look like this?\n  I still tell that story in Houston, TX, which they love, and, of \ncourse, I said: Oh, yeah. Which wasn't true. But I loved it. She was \nthe best sport, and they still talk about her. They did give her a \ncowboy hat that was to die for.\n  Let me mention one other thing. I know Senator Akaka is here, so I \nwon't take up much more time. We teamed up on the issue of single-sex \nschools. The Senator from Maryland mentioned her Catholic girls school \nupbringing. Well, Hillary Clinton, Barbara Mikulski, Susan Collins, and \nmyself teamed up to ensure that every girl in this country has the \nopportunity, if their school board decides to offer it as an option, to \ngo to a girls school. And likewise for every boy whose school board \ndecides that it would be better for boys--in middle school especially \nand high school. We teamed up after about 15 years of trying, starting \nwith Jack Danforth from Missouri. He started the effort to allow \nsingle-sex schools in our public entities in America. When I came here \nin 1993, we finally passed it with our coalition saying: We know this \ncan be better for some girls and some boys. Not all.\n  I will say to the distinguished Acting President pro tempore that it \nwas the Young Women's Leadership Academy in Harlem, NY, that gave us \nthe courage to say this can be done, because they fought all the \nefforts to not allow it; all the lawsuits. They stood up. Hillary \nClinton went to visit the Young Women's Leadership Academy, and I took \nRod Paige, the Secretary of Education, right there to New York and I \nsaid: Secretary Paige, we can do this for all Americans. We can. \nHillary and I and Barbara and Susan said: We are going to do it. We \ndid, and it was a great accomplishment.\n  I just want to end by saying that I so appreciate Barbara Mikulski \nand John Cornyn introducing the bill to name the Homemaker IRA for me. \nIt means so much to me, because I experienced as a young single woman \nstarting an IRA, getting married, and being told I couldn't provide any \nmore for my own retirement security. And I knew there were so many \nwomen who, through divorce or the death of a husband, had gone in and \nout of the workforce or never been in the outside workforce, couldn't \nsave for their own retirement security. When I went to Barbara, I said: \nBarbara, it is a Democratic Senate, so I will make this bill the \nMikulski-Hutchison bill to get it passed. Senator Mikulski said: Not on \nyour life, it will be Hutchison-Mikulski because it is your idea. And \nshe worked just as hard as if it were the reverse. That says more about \nthe Senator from Maryland than anything I could say. So thank you, \nBarbara, for introducing the bill that would name it for me because I \nknow it will help women long after I leave.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague, \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who will be leaving the Senate at the end \nof this term. Senator Hutchison has represented the State of Texas in \nthe Senate since her election in 1993.\n  Senator Hutchison has deep Texas roots, with her great-great-\ngrandfather signing Texas Declaration of Independence in 1836. Growing \nup in La Marque, TX, Senator Hutchison has represented her State as \nonly a true Texan could. Senator Hutchison attended the University of \nTexas at Austin, graduating with bachelor of arts degree. She then went \non to earn her J. D. from the University of Texas Law School in 1967. \nSenator Hutchison began her career as a political and legal reporter \nfor KPRC in Houston.\n  In 1972, Senator Hutchison began her long career of public service by \ntwice being elected to represent Houston in the Texas House of \nRepresentatives. In 1990, Senator Hutchison was elected Texas State \ntreasurer. In 1993, Senator Hutchison won a special election, becoming \nthe first and only woman to date to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate. \nShe has continued to represent Texas for almost 20 years in the Senate, \nrepeatedly winning her seat by overwhelming margins, including her \nreelection in 2000 with more votes than any statewide candidate in \nTexas history.\n  Throughout her Senate career, Senator Hutchison has been known as a \nstrong leader on defense issues. In 1993, Senator Hutchison became the \nfirst woman to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee since 1974. \nIn 2003, Senator Hutchison introduced the legislation creating an \noverseas basing commission, which ensured our forces were capable of \nmeeting the threats we face in the 21st century. Following the \nSeptember 11 attacks, Senator Hutchison was instrumental in securing \nprovisions to increase air cargo screening as part of the National \nIntelligence Reform Act.\n  Senator Hutchison has also been a champion of education during her \ntime in the Senate. She has used her firm belief that every child is \ndeserving of a quality education to advocate for increased investments \nin science, technology, and education.\n  Senator Hutchison has served the people of the State of Texas with \nintegrity. I wish her success in whatever she chooses to do in the next \nchapter of her life.\n\n\n                               Dan Akaka\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I would like to honor the \nlegacy and service of my colleague and dear friend, Senator Daniel K. \nAkaka.\n  My brother, Senator Daniel Akaka, has been my friend and partner in \nWashington for 36 years.\n  During that time, he has fought hard for Native Hawaiians, veterans, \nand the needs of Hawaii.\n  I am sad at the thought of the Senate without him and I am sorry I am \nunable to join him on the floor today.\n  Dan Akaka is the spirit of Aloha.\n  I have always relied on his even keel and hard work to help me \nrepresent the people of Hawaii. And I have never, ever heard him utter \na harsh word or do anything to harm another person.\n  There are few words to describe a kind man of his stature, but I \nassure you, Hawaii and this Nation are better because of his work.\n  On behalf of the people of Hawaii, thank you Danny. There will never \nbe another like you.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and recognize \nthe accomplishments of a colleague and dear friend who will be retiring \nfrom the U.S. Senate at the end of the term. Senator Akaka has \nrepresented the State of Hawaii with distinction for 36 years. He has \nbeen a firm advocate for his constituents, especially for Native \nHawaiians.\n  I have had the honor and privilege to work alongside Senator Akaka on \nthe Indian Affairs Committee. During this time and throughout his \ntenure as chairman, I have witnessed his commitment to improving the \noverall well-being of Native Hawaiians as well as all indigenous \npeople. He has been a tireless advocate for their rights, and, with his \nleadership and bipartisan dedication, he has brought many issues they \nconfront to the forefront. For more than a decade, Senator Akaka has \nchampioned the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, which \nestablishes a process for Native Hawaiians to gain Federal recognition. \nHe has also been the driving force in advancing the Native Hawaiian \nlanguage movement. His dedication and leadership has ensured survival \nof the language.\n  As part of the greatest generation and a veteran, Senator Akaka also \nused his time as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to \nchampion laws to improve health care and benefits for countless \nveterans, servicemembers, and their families.\n  Known for breaking down barriers and building relationships, Senator \nAkaka has served the people of Hawaii with integrity and humility. He \nis a true statesman, gentleman, and patriot, and our country is better \nfor his service. He leaves a distinguished legacy and will be greatly \nmissed by us all. I thank Senator Akaka for his friendship and service \nto our Nation, and I wish him and his wife Millie all the best for the \nfuture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7765-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7765-S7766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise to give my remarks and my aloha to \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to wish my good friend, \nmy colleague of 36 years, my brother, Dan\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\nInouye, Hawaii's senior Senator, a speedy recovery and return to the \nSenate.\n  I rise today to say aloha to this institution. I have been honored to \nbe a Member of the U.S. Senate for 22 years. It has been an incredible \njourney that I never imagined.\n\n  As a senior in high school going to Kamehameha School for Boys, which \nwas noted as a military school, my life was changed forever when I saw \nJapanese fighter planes attacking Pearl Harbor. Like most men in my \ngeneration, I joined the war effort. My path was forever altered.\n  When the war ended, I believe I was suffering from PTSD. It was an \nact of Congress that allowed me, and the veterans of my generation, to \nbuild a successful new life. Congress passed the GI bill, and I say \nwith certainty that I would not be standing before you today without \nthe opportunity the GI bill gave me, not only to get an education but \nto have structure and a path forward--and the feeling that there was a \nway for me to help people. This proved to me that when Congress acts \nresponsibly, it can build a better America.\n  That is why, when I was blessed with the opportunity to lead the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I dedicated myself to helping \nour servicemembers and veterans and their families, and worked with my \ncolleagues to expand VA services and pass a new 21st-century GI bill.\n  So I want to take this moment to urge all of my colleagues and all of \nthe incoming Senators and Representatives to do everything they can for \nour veterans and their families because we ask them to sacrifice so \nmuch for us. They put their lives on the line while their wives and \nhusbands watch over their families. Caring for them is one of our most \nsacred obligations as a nation.\n  Not everyone on the front lines making our Nation stronger wears a \nuniform. In many critical fields the Federal Government struggles to \ncompete with the private sector to recruit and retain the skilled \npeople our Nation needs: experts in cyber security and intelligence \nanalysis, doctors and nurses to care for our wounded warriors, and \naccountants to protect taxpayers during billion-dollar defense \nacquisitions. These are just a few examples. After I leave the Senate, \nit is my hope other Members will continue to focus on making the \nFederal Government an employer of choice. We need the best and \nbrightest working for our Nation.\n  The work of the Congress will never end, but careers come to a close. \nLike the great men whose names are etched in this desk, I am humbled to \nknow I have left my mark on this institution. I am proud to be the \nfirst Native Hawaiian ever to serve in the Senate, just as I am so \nproud to be one of the three U.S. Army World War II veterans who remain \nin the Senate today.\n  The United States is a great country. One of the things that makes us \nso great is that though we have made mistakes, we change, we correct \nthem, we right past wrongs. It is our responsibility as a nation to do \nright by America's native people, those who exercised sovereignty on \nlands that later became part of the United States. While we can never \nchange the past, we have the power to change the future.\n  Throughout my career I have worked to ensure that my colleagues \nunderstand the Federal relationship with native peoples and its origins \nin the Constitution. The U.S. policy of supporting self-determination \nand self-governance for indigenous peoples leads to native self-\nsufficiency, resulting in our continued ability to be productive and to \ncontribute to the well-being of our families, our communities, and our \ngreat Nation. That is why I worked to secure parity in Federal policy \nfor my people--the Native Hawaiians.\n  The United States has recognized hundreds of Alaska Native and \nAmerican Indian communities. It is long past time for the Native \nHawaiian people to have the same rights, same privileges, and same \nopportunities as every other federally recognized native people.\n  For more than 12 years now, I have worked with the Native Hawaiian \ncommunity and many others to develop the Native Hawaiian \nReauthorization Act, which has the strong support of Hawaii's \nLegislature and Governor as the best path forward toward \nreconciliation.\n  My bill has encountered many challenges, but it is pono--it is \nright--and it is long overdue. Although I will not be the bill's \nsponsor in the 113th Congress, it will forever bear my highest \naspirations and heartfelt commitment to the Native Hawaiian people, the \nState of Hawaii, and the United States of America.\n  I know I am just one in a long line working to ensure that our \nlanguage, our culture, and our people continue to thrive for \ngenerations to come. I believe Hawaii has so much to teach the world \nand this institution. In Congress and in our Nation, we are truly all \ntogether, in the same canoe. If we paddle together in unison, we can \ntravel great distances. If the two sides of the canoe paddle in \nopposite directions, we will only go in circles.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this traditional Hawaiian symbol to \nheart and put the American people first--by working together.\n  I want to say mahalo nui loa--thank you very much--to my incredible \nstaff. After 36 years there are far too many individuals to name, so I \nwill just thank all of my current and former staff members in my Senate \nand House offices and on my committees, including Indian Affairs, \nVeterans' Affairs, and the Subcommittees on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia.\n  I want to thank the hundreds of employees who work for the Architect \nof the Capitol and the Sergeant-at-Arms. Without the hard work they do \nevery day, we could not do what we do in the Senate. Mahalo. Thank you \nto the floor and leadership staff as well.\n  I also want to thank Senate Chaplain Barry Black, who has provided me \nso much guidance and strength and has done more to bring the two sides \nof the Chamber together and find common ground than just about anyone. \nI want to thank our colleagues who join together every week for the \nPrayer Breakfast and Bible study as well. All of these have helped to \nshape me and the things I do here.\n  There is no one I owe more to than my lovely wife of 65 years, \nMillie. She is literally there for me whenever I need her. Nearly every \nday that I have served in the Senate for the past 22 years, Millie has \ncome to the office with me. She helps me greet constituents, she makes \nme lunch, she keeps me focused, and she makes sure I know what is \nhappening back home. She means the world to me. Every honor I have \nreceived belongs to her and to my family, my children, my \ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren. This speech is their farewell \nspeech too. So mahalo, Millie and my ohana, my family.\n  In life there are seasons. While leaving Congress is bittersweet, I \nam looking forward to spending more time with our five children and \ngetting to know our 15 great-grandchildren, and--can you believe this--\nwe are expecting our 16th great-grandchild next year, and I will be \nhome to see it.\n  I am looking forward to speaking with students and mentoring up and \ncoming leaders and visiting places in Hawaii that I have worked for \nover my career. My goal was to bring the spirit of aloha to our \nNation's Capital in everything I do. In Hawaii, we look out for one \nanother, we work together, and we treat each other with respect. I hope \nI succeeded in sharing a little bit of Hawaii with all of you.\n  As I come to the end of 22 years in this Chamber, and a total of 36 \nyears serving in Congress, I offer my profound gratitude and humble \nthanks to the people of Hawaii for giving me the opportunity to serve \nthem for so many years. It truly was an experience of a lifetime. All I \never wanted was to be able to help people, and you gave me that \nopportunity. So mahalo nui loa. Thank you very much.\n  In Hawaii, when we part, we don't say goodbye. Instead, we say a hui \nhou, which means until we meet again.\n  Although I am retiring, I see this as the start of a new chapter, a \nnew season. And I am blessed to have made friendships and partnerships \nthat will last forever.\n  God bless Hawaii, and God bless the United States of America with the \nspirit of aloha. A hui hou.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7766-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7766-S7774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today to address my colleagues on \na\n\n[[Page S7767]]\n\nnumber of issues important to the future of the United States and to \noffer some perspective on Senate service.\n  In a few weeks, I will leave the Senate for new pursuits that will \nallow me to devote much deeper attention to a number of issues that \nhave been a part of my Senate service. Among these are preventing the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and developing more \nefficient ways to feed the world. I am especially pleased that I will \nbe serving on the faculty of the University of Indianapolis and helping \nthat institution establish a Washington internship program. I look \nforward to announcing additional endeavors of service in coming weeks.\n  My service in the Senate would not have been possible without the \nencouragement and constant support of my loving wife Char, our four \nsons--Mark, Bob, John, and David--and the entire Lugar family. Their \nstrength and sacrifices have been indispensable to my public service. I \nalso am indebted to a great number of talented and loyal friends who \nhave served with me in the Senate, including more than 300 Senators, \nhundreds of personal and committee staff members, and more than a \nthousand interns. In my experience, it is difficult to conceive of a \nbetter platform from which to devote oneself to public service and the \nsearch for solutions to national and international problems. At its \nbest, the Senate is one of the Founders' most important creations.\n  A great deal has been written recently about political discord in the \nUnited States, with some commentators judging that partisanship is at \nan all-time high. Having seen quite a few periods in the Congress when \npolitical struggles were portrayed this way, I hesitate to describe our \ncurrent state as the most partisan ever. But I do believe that as an \ninstitution we have not lived up to the expectations of our \nconstituents to make excellence in governance our top priority.\n  Many of us have had some type of executive experience as Governors, \nmayors, corporation chiefs, and cabinet officials. I had the good \nfortune of serving two terms as the Mayor of Indianapolis prior to my \nSenate service. For the last 36 years, I have attempted to apply \nlessons learned during those early governing experiences to my work in \nthe Senate. As mayor, my responsibility for what happened in my city \nwas comprehensive and inescapable. Citizens held the mayor's office \naccountable for the prosaic tasks of daily life, like trash collection \nand snow removal, but also for executing strategies for the economic \nand social advancement of the city.\n  In legislative life, by contrast, we are responsible for positions \nexpressed through votes, cosponsorships, interviews, and other means. \nIt takes courage to declare dozens or even hundreds of positions and \nstand for office, knowing that with each position, you are displeasing \nsome group of voters. But we do our country a disservice if we mistake \nthe act of taking positions for governance. They are not the same \nthing. Governance requires adaptation to shifting circumstances. It \noften requires finding common ground with Americans who have a \ndifferent vision than your own. It requires leaders who believe, like \nEdmund Burke, that their first responsibility to their constituents is \nto apply their best judgment.\n  It is possible to be elected and re-elected, again and again and gain \nprominence in the Senate while giving very little thought to \ngovernance. One even can gain considerable notoriety by devoting one's \ncareer to the political aspects of a Senator's job--promoting the party \nline, raising money, and focusing on public relations. Responsibility \nfor legislative shortcomings can be pinned on the other party or even \nintractable members of one's own party. None of us are above politics, \nnor did the Founders expect us to be. But, obviously, we should be \naspiring to something greater than this.\n  Too often in recent years, Members of Congress have locked themselves \ninto a slate of inflexible positions, many of which have no hope of \nbeing implemented in a divided government. Some of these positions have \nbeen further calcified by pledges signed for political purposes. Too \noften we have failed to listen to one another and question whether the \northodox views being promulgated by our parties make strategic sense \nfor America's future. The result has been intractably negative public \nperceptions of Congress. A Rasmussen Reports poll conducted this month \nfound that only 10 percent of likely voters gave Congress a rating of \n``excellent'' or ``good.''\n  For me, the irony is that having seen several generations of \nlawmakers pass through this body, I can attest that the vast majority \nare hardworking, genuinely interested in public service, and eager to \ncontribute to the welfare of our country. Often, the public does not \nbelieve that. It is easier to assume that Congressional failings arise \nfrom the incompetence or even the malfeasance of individual \nlegislators. Or perhaps, as some believe, Washington, D.C. itself is \ncorrupting. It is far more disconcerting to think that our democracy's \nshortcomings are complex and defy simple solutions, but the Founders \nwere realists who understood the power of factionalism, parochialism, \nand personal ambition. They understood that good intentions would not \nalways prevail. Accordingly, they designed a system to check abuse and \nprevent power from accumulating in a few hands. But they knew that the \nefficient operation of such a republic would require a great deal of \ncooperation. They knew that it would require most elected officials to \nhave a dedication to governance, and they trusted that leaders would \narise in every era to make their vision work.\n  The Senate has a unique role to play in good governance. We have \nattributes not possessed by the executive branch, including staying \npower. Administrations turn over every 4 or 8 years. But Senators can \nhave careers spanning decades that allow them to apply expertise and \npolitical understanding to problems over many years, even as \nadministrations come and go. We also can confer a bipartisan framework \non a policy. Even a small bipartisan group of Senators cooperating on a \ndifficult problem is a powerful signal of the possibility for a \nunifying solution.\n  My hope is that Senators will devote much more of their energies to \ngovernance. In a perfect world, we would not only govern, we would \nexecute a coherent strategy. That is a very high bar for any \nlegislative body to clear. But we must aspire to it in cooperation with \nthe President because we are facing fundamental changes in the world \norder that will deeply affect America's security and standard of \nliving.\n  The list of such changes is long, but it starts in Asia with the rise \nof China and India as economic, political, and military powers. The \nObama administration has conspicuously announced a ``pivot'' to Asia. \nAt the center of this pivot is China, which exists as both an adversary \nto certain U.S. interests, and a fellow traveler sharing mutual goals \nand vulnerabilities on others. The ongoing challenge will be for the \nUnited States to discern, sometimes issue by issue, whether China is an \nadversary or a partner. This calibration will impact America's \nrelations with the rest of Asia and may ultimately determine prospects \nfor war or peace in this world.\n  While visiting Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines in October, I \nwas reminded of the economic vitality of Southeast Asia and the fact \nthat the ten countries comprising ASEAN represent the fourth largest \nexport market of the United States. These countries are center stage to \nthe circumstances with China. We must stand firm with our friends \nthroughout Asia and actively pursue prospects for free trade with open \nsea lanes and other policies that will strengthen America's economic \ngrowth.\n  More broadly, we face the specter of global resource constraints, \nespecially deficiencies of energy and food that could stimulate \nconflict and deepen poverty. We have made startling gains in domestic \nenergy production, but we remain highly vulnerable to our dependency on \noil. Perhaps equally important, even if we are able to produce more \nenergy at home, we cannot insulate ourselves from energy-driven shocks \nto the global economy. In other words, we have to cooperate with other \nnations in improving the global system of manufacturing and moving \nenergy supplies. Currently, a key to this is helping to ensure the \ncompletion of the southern energy corridor serving Central and \nSoutheastern Europe and unleashing our own liquified natural gas \nexports to address the energy vulnerabilities of our closest allies.\n  The potential global crisis over food production is less well \nunderstood.\n\n[[Page S7768]]\n\nWhereas research is opening many new frontiers in the energy sphere, \nthe productivity of global agriculture will not keep up with projected \nfood demand unless many countries change their policies. This starts \nwith a much wider embrace of agriculture technology, including \ngenetically modified techniques. The risks of climate change intensify \nthis imperative.\n  Even as we deal with potential resource constraints, our country \nremains vulnerable to terrorism and asymmetric warfare. Access to the \ninternet and social media has deeply altered international politics, in \nmost cases for the better. But it also has contributed to instability \nthrough sudden upheavals like the Arab Spring; it has allowed \ndestructive terrorist movements like al Qaida to franchise themselves; \nand it has intensified risks of cyber-attacks, espionage, and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The potential catastrophe \nremains of a major terrorist attack on American soil employing weapons \nof mass destruction. If that happens, in addition to the lives lost, \nour expectations for economic growth and budget balancing could be set \nback by a decade or more. Having devoted considerable time to this \nproblem, my experience is that there are no silver bullets. Protecting \nthe United States from weapons of mass destruction is a painstaking \nprocess that every day must employ our best technological, diplomatic, \nand military tools.\n  Amidst all these security risks, we must maintain the competitiveness \nof the United States in the international economy. We should see \neducation, energy efficiency, access to global markets, the attraction \nof immigrant entrepreneurs, and other factors as national security \nissues. My own view is that the fundamentals of American society still \noffer us the best hand to play in global competitiveness. No other \ncountry can match the quality and variety of our post-secondary \neducation. We have the broadest scientific and technological base and \nthe most advanced agricultural system. Our population is younger and \nmore mobile than most other industrialized nations. We still can \nflourish in this global marketplace if we nurture the competitive \ngenius of the American people that has allowed us time and again to \nreinvent our economy.\n  But we must deal with failures of governance that have delayed \nresolutions to obvious problems. No rational strategy for our long term \ngrowth and security, for example, should fail to restrain current \nentitlement spending. And no attempt to gain the maximum strategic \nadvantage from our human resource potential should fail to enact \ncomprehensive immigration reform that resolves the status of \nundocumented immigrants and encourages the most talented immigrants to \ncontribute to America's future.\n  Faced with immense responsibilities, there is a need to elevate our \nSenate debate. It is vital that the President and Congress establish a \ncloser working relationship, especially on national security. This is \nnot just a matter of process. It is necessary to undergird national \nunity in the event of severe crises, such as war with Iran or another \ncatastrophic terrorist attack.\n  This cooperation depends both on Congressional leaders who are \nwilling to set aside partisan advantage and on administration officials \nwho understand that the benefits of having the support of Congress is \nworth the effort it takes to secure it. Currently, the national \nsecurity dialog between the President and Congress is one of the least \nconstructive that I have ever witnessed. There is little foundation for \nresolving national security disputes or even the expectation that this \ncan occur. Before the next 9/11, the President must be willing to call \nRepublicans to the Oval Office to establish the basis for a working \npartnership in foreign policy. And Republicans must be willing to \nsuspend reflexive opposition that serves no purpose but to limit their \nown role in strategic questions and render cooperation impossible. All \nparties should recognize the need for unity in the coming year when \nevents in Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, North Korea, and other locations \nmay test American national security in extreme ways.\n  I commend each of you, my Senate colleagues, for the commitment that \nled you to stand for election to the United States Senate. Running for \noffice is a difficult endeavor that is usually accompanied by great \npersonal risk and cost. Each one of you is capable of being a positive \nforce for changing the tone of debate in our country. Each one of you \nhas a responsibility not only to act with integrity and represent your \nconstituents, but also to make the informed and imaginative choices on \nwhich good governance for our country depends.\n  I am optimistic about our country's future. I believe that both \ninternal divisions and external threats can be overcome. The United \nStates will continue to serve as the inspiration for peoples seeking \npeace, freedom and economic prosperity. And the United States Senate \nshould and will be at the forefront of this advancement.\n  May we seek each day from God our creator, the wisdom and the will to \ndo our best in the governance of our country. And may God continue to \nbless the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service of \nSenator Richard Lugar and to pay tribute to his legacy. I served \nalongside Senator Lugar as the junior Senator of Indiana during my two \ntours of service in the Senate. All of us who seek public service want \nto make a difference, and most certainly Senator Lugar has done that.\n  At an early age Dick Lugar developed a passion for knowledge. A \nnative of Indianapolis, he was valedictorian at Shortridge High School. \nIt was then and is still a distinguished institution where knowledge is \nat the forefront of everything done in that school. One of our former \nMembers, Ted Stevens, was also a graduate of Shortridge High School.\n  Dick Lugar went on then to become valedictorian in college when he \ngraduated from Denison University with a bachelor's degree in \neconomics. He went on to attend Pembroke College at Oxford University \nas a Rhodes Scholar and obtained a second bachelor's degree and \nmaster's degree in politics, philosophy, and economics. Today he is one \nof the most decorated scholars in the Senate with 46 honorary degrees \nfrom 15 States and the District of Columbia.\n  Following these most impressive academic achievements, Senator Lugar \nspent several years in the U.S. Navy ultimately serving as an \nintelligence briefer for ADM Arleigh Burke, Chief of Naval Operations. \nThe Navy and Admiral Burke chose the best person they could for that \nparticular job. Dick Lugar quickly became well known for not only his \nhard work but his leadership ability and his intellectual prowess. \nSenator Lugar then returned to Indiana where at the young age of 35 he \nbecame the mayor of Indianapolis, serving two terms from 1968 to 1975. \nThere is no question that Dick Lugar is recognized as one of the most \ninfluential and visionary mayors Indiana has ever seen, and maybe the \ncountry has ever seen.\n  Having just left military service myself, I was working full time \nattending Indiana Law School at night. That didn't leave much time for \nMarsha and me to enjoy the amenities of Indianapolis but, frankly, \nthere were very few amenities to enjoy at that particular time. It was \nthen that our newly elected mayor began a remarkable transformation of \nIndianapolis into now what has become one of the most attractive and \nlivable cities in America.\n  As mayor, Dick Lugar worked carefully with the Indiana General \nAssembly and then-Governor Ed Whitcomb to extend the boundaries of the \ncity and merge the governments of Indianapolis and Marion County to \nprovide common essential services more efficiently--a concept then \ncalled Unigov. Unigov wasn't without controversy, but because of Dick \nLugar's vision, careful negotiations, and decisive action, Indianapolis \nbecame a model for other cities across the Nation.\n  When the law took effect in 1970, Indianapolis's population rose from \n476,000 to 793,000. Indianapolis moved from the 26th largest city to \none of the Nation's largest dozen cities literally overnight. When I \nthink of the numerous positive changes in Indianapolis over the past 40 \nyears, I see the fulfillment of the vision of then-Mayor Dick Lugar.\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\n  The Midwest has a way of producing men and women of sense and \ndecency. However, not all of us fall into that category. Sometimes that \nsense is questioned, but we do have individuals who have the ability to \nsee to the heart of the matter and to find a way to resolve a problem. \nSuch skill is extremely valuable in the U.S. Senate, a body that by its \nvery design is supposed to foster compromise between legislators on \nissues before the Nation. So it was a natural progression that \nfollowing his success as mayor, Dick Lugar's next job would be serving \nHoosiers as a U.S. Senator.\n  Since 1977, Senator Lugar has represented Hoosiers and served our \nNation admirably. Without question, Senator Lugar is the type of \nlawmaker and leader who works hard to bring both parties together, find \ncommon ground, and pass needed legislation. Although his contributions \nare many--including his long and valued service on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee--Senator Lugar's most important role in the \nSenate has to be his leadership on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. As a two-time chairman of this committee, he has been one of \nthe most influential minds on foreign policy in the Senate's history. \nHe has worked tirelessly on policies and legislation to promote arms \ncontrol, control and dismantle nuclear arms, and to address the global \nfood crisis.\n  Among his many accomplishments in the field of foreign relations, his \nsignature piece of legislation, no doubt, is the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, more commonly known as Nunn-Lugar. When Senator \nLugar joined the Foreign Relations Committee in 1979, he traveled to \nthe former Soviet Union on multiple occasions to gain a better \nunderstanding of how the United States could secure and dismantle \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  His experiences led him to champion the landmark legislation that \nsuccessfully resulted in the deactivation of nuclear warheads, making \nthis world a safer place. To date, the Nunn-Lugar program has \ndeactivated more than 7,500 nuclear warheads that were once aimed at \nthe United States. It is a contribution to which Americans can never \ngive enough thanks.\n  Over his 36 years in this institution, Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle have considered Dick Lugar a trusted resource when it comes \nto foreign policy and many other important issues. He has been a \nconsistent resource for those who seek thoughtful answers to difficult \npolitical questions.\n  When I first arrived here in 1989, Senator Lugar and I operated a \nunique joint office arrangement in Indiana. We shared office space and \nstaff in our State. Many of our colleagues were surprised by this \narrangement, but Dick Lugar and I like to tell Hoosiers that they are \ngetting twice the service for half the price. All those who work in \nthis Chamber can learn from Dick Lugar's passion for public service. \nHis sincere desire to reach across the aisle and find common ground \ncomplements his unique talent for forging coalitions and bringing \npeople together to accomplish big things.\n  A tribute to Senator Lugar would be incomplete without recognizing \nthe support of his wife Charlene, his four sons, and his extended \nfamily. Public service places unique demands on our families, and their \nsacrifice and support plays an important role in any Senator's success.\n  It has been an honor for me to work with Senator Lugar. I am thankful \nfor his service to Indiana and to our country.\n  My wife Marsha and I wish Senator Lugar, Char, and his family nothing \nbut the best as my dear friend begins this next chapter of his life. \nSenator Lugar has dedicated so much of his service to our country. He \nhas outlined many other ways in which he will be continuing to do that \nand that is a great benefit to our Nation and to our State. I am \ncertain we will continue to learn and benefit from the Senator's \nlifetime of public service.\n  I know my colleagues join me in thanking Senator Lugar for his many \nyears of dedicated and distinguished service. It has been a pleasure to \nserve as a junior Senator from Indiana under the Senator's leadership.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me add my words of commendation to \nthose of Senator Coats for Senator Lugar. I have often joked with him \nthat he has been my Secretary of State while I have served here in the \nSenate. We could count on Senator Lugar to give good, unbiased advice \non complicated foreign relations issues, and we will very much miss \nSenator Lugar's voice here in the Senate, and also his better half, \nChar Lugar, who I think we all know is a bright light. It has been an \nhonor and a privilege to serve with Senator Lugar, and I know his voice \nwill continue to be heard on the important issues of the day.\n  In both Indiana and North Dakota, agriculture is a pillar of the \neconomy. Senator Lugar fully understands the importance of farming, and \nit has always been near his heart. He still manages a 600-acre corn, \nsoybean, and tree operation back home. Here in the Senate, he has been \na champion for his State's farmers, serving on the Agriculture \nCommittee since his first term. I have worked with him as a member of \nthat committee since I joined the Senate a decade later. He twice \nserved as chairman, most notably during the passage of the 1996 farm \nbill.\n  I had the privilege to work with Senator Lugar in crafting numerous \nfarm bills. During the Agriculture Committee's debate of the last farm \nbill, Senator Lugar and I teamed up to fund rural energy programs. We \nboth understand the importance of getting more energy from the Midwest \ninstead of the Middle East. Rather than sending our dollars outside of \nthe country to buy oil, we can invest in renewable energy that is \nproduced at home. Without Dick's support, the Senate's version of the \nfarm bill would have lacked these important provisions.\n  When the history books are written about our era, Senator Lugar will \nbe remembered as one of the Senate's leading voices on foreign policy. \nA proven leader, Dick has been recognized by his colleagues for his \nclear-eyed analysis and practical solutions to global problems. His \nexpertise has been invaluable to the Senate, whether it was regarding \nthe threats of the Soviet Union during the Cold War or Islamic \nterrorism today. One of Senator Lugar's brightest achievements was the \ncreation of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, commonly known as \nNunn-Lugar. Through this program, the United States helps partner \ncountries destroy and secure weapons of mass destruction. It has \ndeactivated over 7,600 nuclear warheads that once threatened our \nNation. Our world is undoubtedly a safer place because of Senator \nLugar's unwavering commitment to secure nuclear material.\n  Dick has been one of the most pragmatic Members of the Senate. He \nunderstood that compromising with others does not mean betraying one's \nbeliefs. He was willing to work with Members on both sides of the aisle \nto achieve sensible solutions to our Nation's problems. At a time when \nour country desperately needs to set aside inflexible partisan rigidity \nin order to advance the common good, Senator Lugar will be greatly \nmissed.\n  I thank Senator Lugar for his service in the Senate, to his State and \nthe country. I thank him for being a friend to me, and I wish him and \nhis family the very best in the future.\n\n\n                         Farewell To The Senate\n\n  Mr. President, we have this long tradition in the Senate of Senators \ngiving farewell remarks. I want to alert colleagues that mine will be \nespecially long, so they might want to go have lunch and then come \nback. I don't consider this my final speech because I am still hopeful \nwe will reach an agreement on the farm bill. The distinguished Chair is \nhere. I hope we can reach agreement on averting the fiscal cliff \nbecause that is important to the country. I hope we will have \nadditional chances to communicate with colleagues and the public before \nwe are done.\n  These are my farewell remarks and observations of 26 years of service \nhere, and it has been an incredible experience.\n  The first thing I want to do is say thank you to the people of North \nDakota for having confidence in me when I was only 38 years old in \nsending me to represent them in the Senate. I was 38, but I looked \nabout 25, and the people of North Dakota elected me in a stunning upset \nof a long-established incumbent. I treasure the confidence they have \nhad in me.\n\n[[Page S7770]]\n\n  I also want to thank my colleagues for the responsibilities they have \ngiven me. I also want to thank the leadership team of Senator Reid, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Schumer, and Senator Murray and the confidence \nthey have had in me. I have been so blessed to have people who have \nbeen with me on my staff in many cases for more than 20 years. My \nchiefs of staff, include Jim Margolis, who is one of the top media \ngurus in the country. He has done much of the advertising for the \nPresident in this last campaign. Also, my thanks to David Herring and \nMary Wakefield, as well as Kent Hall, who died an untimely death while \nworking for me.\n  Thank you to Sara Garland, Bob Van Heuvelen, and Wally Rustad. Thanks \nalso to Tom Mahr, who was my legislative director for than 20 years.\n  I also wish to thank my executive assistant, who has been with me \nmore than 20 years; Geri Gaginis, who we all fondly call Mom in my \noffice because she cracks the whip and makes sure the trains run on \ntime; Mary Naylor, my long-time director on the Budget Committee and \nwho has also been with me more than 20 years.\n  My Budget Committee deputies John Righter and Joel Friedman have done \nextraordinary work on behalf of the people of this country. Stu Nagurka \nis here with me today and is going to help me with charts and has been \nmy long-time communications director.\n  There are so many more people I want to thank. Most of all, I want to \nthank my family. My wife Lucy, who has been my great partner through \nall of this. She was my campaign manager when I first ran for the \nSenate. My daughter Jessie, who has in many ways, perhaps, sacrificed \nthe most, because when a person is in this job they miss birthdays and \nother important events. She has been a great daughter. She was here \nlast night for our farewell party and we had a lovely time. Our son \nIvan and his wife Kendra, who are in Oregon where they have a small \nfarm called Tipping Tree Farm. We wish they could be here today. Our \ngrandson Carter, who is a proud member of the University of Oregon \nmarching band, The Ducks, and who served as an intern for me--not at \ngovernment expense, by the way, it was at our expense; and our little \ndog Dakota who has become sort of a mascot of the U.S. Senate. Brian \nWilliams, when he did a show on ``A Day in the Life of the Senate,'' \nconcluded that program by calling Dakota the ``101st Senator.'' I think \nhe will be missed perhaps more than I am as I leave the Senate.\n\n  In 1964, I came here. I sat up in the gallery--in fact, it was the \ngallery right up there--I was 16 years old, and I watched a debate on \ncivil rights. Hubert Humphrey was leading that debate. It so inspired \nme that I thought, you know, someday I would like to be down on that \nfloor and I would like to debate the great issues of the day and I \nwould like to represent the people of North Dakota. So I went home and \nwrote out on the back of an envelope that I would run for the U.S. \nSenate in 1986 or 1988, and I ran in 1986 and was successful. That is \nthe power of a plan. To the young pages who are here, if any of you \nseeks to be in the U.S. Senate someday, have a plan, because there are \nso many people who sort of drift through life without one. If you have \na plan, you will be light years ahead.\n  In that race, as I indicated, my now-wife Lucy was my campaign \nmanager. We won what was then believed to be the biggest political \nupset in the history of our State. I was proud of that victory and \nproud to have a chance to represent North Dakota here.\n  I think we all know our country needs a plan now, and we know plans \nhave worked before. I was here in 1993 when we had just come off the \nlargest deficit in the history of the United States. The country was in \nthe doldrums. The economy was just plugging along, not doing very well, \nwe had a weak recovery from a deep recession, and we passed a plan to \nget the country back on track. We did it the old-fashioned way. We made \ntough decisions, some that were unpopular, but it was the right thing \nto do and it worked. We balanced the budget. We had the longest period \nof uninterrupted economic growth in the Nation's history. Twenty-three \nmillion jobs were created, and we were actually paying down the debt of \nthe United States at the end of the Clinton administration.\n  We did it again when disaster struck my State in 1997. We had one of \nthe worst disasters ever in North Dakota, a 500-year flood that \nfollowed the worst winter storm in 50 years. Many of my colleagues may \nrecall the images from that disaster when firemen were fighting an \nenormous conflagration in downtown Grand Forks in the middle of a \nblizzard and there was also a massive flood. Grand Forks was \ndevastated.\n  Again, we had a plan, a $500 million disaster recovery plan that \nbecame a $1 billion plan, and it worked, and we did it the old-\nfashioned way. We made tough decisions, some that were unpopular, but \nit was the right thing to do and it worked. The community held a \nrecognition event for me last weekend. The leadership of the community \nwas there, and many people from of the community reported on the \nremarkable recovery in Grand Forks. It is, I think, an example of what \ncan be done when government responds and does so intelligently and \neffectively.\n  Now we face a new challenge. We have a fiscal cliff or a fiscal curb \nor whatever one terms it, but what we know is that if we fail to act, \nwe could be pushed back into recession. Our country needs a plan--a \nplan to get us back on track, to revitalize economic growth, to secure \nour long-term economic future, and to get the country moving again, and \nwe can do it. We have done much tougher work in the past.\n  Sometimes I hear people being critical of this institution when they \nleave here. Let me say I am not in their ranks. I leave this \ninstitution with enormous respect. The U.S. Senate is the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, and I sincerely believe the vast \nmajority of my colleagues are serious-minded and have the best \ninterests of the country at heart. I believe the vast majority of my \ncolleagues want to do what is right for the country. We have \ndifferences--enormous differences--about what is the right thing to do, \nbut I have no doubt most of our colleagues are well intentioned.\n  In many circles it is fashionable now to bash government and play \ndown its importance. I personally think we would do well to remember \nwhat it has accomplished. I can remember so clearly being called to an \nemergency meeting in this building in the fall of 2008. I was handed a \nnote saying I was urgently requested to come here. It was about 6 \no'clock in the evening. I was the last one to arrive. When I walked \ninto the leader's office, there were the leaders of the House and the \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats, the Secretary of the Treasury from \nthe Bush administration, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I \ninstantly understood something very serious was afoot. They closed the \ndoor and told us they were going to take over AIG, the large insurance \ncompany, the next day. They weren't there to ask for our approval or \nseek our agreement; they were there to tell us they were taking this \nstep and they told us they were taking this step because they believed \nif they did not, there would be a financial collapse in this country \nwithin days, and they gave great specificity as to what would happen if \nthere was a failure to take the action they were about to take.\n  The public reaction was harshly negative. The notion of the \nGovernment of the United States bailing out a large private insurance \ncompany created controversy and criticism from almost every corner. \nUltimately, the rescue of that company cost $180 billion--a staggering \nsum. But do my colleagues know what. We have learned this week that the \ntaxpayers will make money on the deal. Yes, it cost us $180 billion, \nbut the taxpayers are going to make $22 billion on the transaction. If \nwe hadn't done it, we would have risked going into a depression.\n  So when people say there is no role for government or it should be a \nlimited, shrunken roll, I say, Really? Would we have wanted to stand by \nand risk this country going into another Great Depression? Let's recall \nwhat that was like. More than 20 percent of the people in this country \nwere out of work. I know my own grandfather, who refused to take \nbankruptcy, owned stock in the local bank. In those days people had \nunlimited liability if they owned stock in a bank. So when there was a \nrun on the bank, as there was, he was called to bring money to the \nbank,\n\n[[Page S7771]]\n\nwhich he did. He did it over and over, and it took him 9 years to \nrecover. People were hungry. People were desperate. That is what a \ndepression is about.\n  So when I reflect back to those decisions, I believe they were the \nright decisions to make. It is not just my view; that is the view of \ntwo of the most distinguished economists in this country, Mark Zandi, \nwho was a key economic adviser to Senator John McCain in his \nPresidential race, and Alan Blinder, the former Deputy Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve. Here is what they say: Without that Federal response, \nwe would have had 8 million fewer jobs and a 16-percent level of \nunemployment in this country, and we would have been in the second \nGreat Depression. They call it ``Depression 2.0.''\n\n  So let's remember where we were when President Obama came to office. \nThe Nation was facing the worst economic catastrophe since the Great \nDepression. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the economy shrank at a rate \nof almost 9 percent. After the Federal actions, positive economic \ngrowth returned in the third quarter of 2009 and we have now had 13 \nconsecutive quarters of economic growth. We have come a long way. This \nis a remarkable turnaround in a very short time, measured against \nprevious financial crises. In fact, there has been an academic study \njust completed that suggests typically it takes 8 to 10 years to \nrecover from a financial crisis. So the recovery here, while not \neverything we would have hoped, is a dramatic turnaround.\n  At the same time, our constituents know, and we know, the price has \nbeen high. We know we are currently borrowing 31 cents of every dollar \nwe spend. That is somewhat of an improvement, because we were borrowing \n40 cents of every dollar we spend. So this is an improvement, but we \nhave a long way to go. And the public understands we face both a \nspending and a revenue problem. Spending is near a 60-year high, as \nthis chart shows. The red line is the spending line; the green line is \nthe revenue line. But for those who say it is just a spending problem, \nI don't think the facts bear that out, because the revenue is near a \n60-year low. I think most logical people would say we have to work both \nsides of this equation.\n  When we look at our debt, we see that our gross debt has now \nsurpassed 100 percent of our gross domestic product. There was a \nlandmark work done a couple of years ago by Rogoff and Reinhart. They \nlooked at 200 years of economic history and they concluded that once \nour debt exceeds 90 percent of GDP, our future economic prospects are \nreduced, and reduced quite significantly: future economic growth \nreduced by 25 to 33 percent. So this is not just numbers on a page; \nthis is a question of future economic opportunity.\n  This growing debt is why many of us called for action a long time \nago. In fact, it was 6 years ago this month that Senator Gregg and I \ncame up with the idea of a commission to tackle the debt. That idea \nultimately led to the President appointing the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission. Its bipartisan report recommended $4 trillion in deficit \nreduction in a balanced way, and I think in a fair way. It protected \nlow-income programs, it actually improved the progressivity of the tax \nsystem quite significantly, and it was balanced between revenue and \nspending. Other bipartisan groups have concluded the same, that we need \nspending restraint and we need revenue. So there is a critical role for \ngovernment here. We have seen it in the past and we will find it in the \nfuture.\n  But I think we also have to acknowledge there are problems here. \nThere are problems in this Chamber. As proud as I am of this \ninstitution, and I will forever be, I have detected over the 26 years I \nhave been here, a change. It has happened kind of gradually, but it has \nclearly happened. We now spend too much of our time seeking partisan \nadvantage, and it happens on both sides, and it is all understandable. \nI understand it. I am not being critical of individuals. We spend too \nlittle time trying to solve problems. We spend too little time in our \ncaucuses, in our meetings, focused on how to solve the problems facing \nthe country. I deeply believe this observation is true.\n  I believe we can do better than this. The institutions of our \ngovernment have a proud history. The genius of our Founding Fathers can \nbe found in every part of our history. Whether it was conquering the \nlast Great Depression or winning World War I and World War II or \nlaunching a man into space or conquering dread diseases, over and over \nour country has organized to better the plight of mankind. We need that \nsame kind of focus and effort now to address our challenges. I am \nconfident we can do this, but it is not enough to be confident. It is \nnot enough to be hopeful. It requires a plan, and I would like to take \nthe next few minutes to lay out my belief of what that plan should \ninclude.\n  Much of what I will talk about reflects the work of the Bowles-\nSimpson Commission, the Group of 6 that I have been a part of, and the \nGroup of 8.\n  It starts by looking at what both sides have laid down. Republicans \nhave laid down the spending cut plan; the President has laid down a \nrevenue plan. My own belief is we should take them both. We should take \nwhat the Republicans have proposed on spending, with some modest \nmodifications which I will discuss, and we should take the President's \nplan on revenue.\n  The President laid down a plan that said we ought to raise $1.6 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. Boy, that sounds like an awful lot of \nmoney, doesn't it--$1.6 trillion. Not billion, not million, trillion. \nAnd people will be quick to say: Oh, my God, that is the biggest tax \nincrease in the history of mankind. Terrible. We cannot do that.\n  Well, we need to put it in perspective. The first thing we should \nrecognize is this will take us to a revenue level that is 19.9 percent \nof our GDP. The last five times we have balanced the budget in this \ncountry, going back to 1969, we have been at 19.7 percent, 19.9 \npercent, 19.8 percent, 20.6 percent, and 19.5 percent. Does 19.9 \npercent fit in? These are the only times we balanced the budget going \nback to 1969.\n  To put it in even more perspective, how much revenue are we going to \nraise over the next 10 years without any change? Well, here is the \nnumber: $37.4 trillion. Nobody ever puts these things in perspective. \nThese big numbers are in relationship to what; $1.6 trillion is what in \nrelationship to $37.4 trillion? As a percentage that is an increase of \n4.3 percent. My goodness, we cannot increase the revenue by 4.3 percent \nin this country over the next 10 years? Of course we can. Of course we \ncan, especially if it means we get our house in order and put the \ncountry on a more firm fiscal footing.\n  It does not just matter how much money we raise; it also matters how \nwe raise it. We have a Tax Code now which I cannot defend. I cannot \ndefend it. I took a study that was done by a man named Martin Sullivan \nlast year. He did a very interesting thing. He looked at one building \non Park Avenue in New York, and he was able to do it because they \nhappened to have the statistics that isolated that one building. Do you \nknow what he found? The average income in that building was $1,167,000 \nfor the year--$1,167,000. The average tax rate of the people in that \nbuilding was 14.7 percent.\n  The janitor in that building had an income of $33,000. He paid a tax \nrate of 24.9 percent. Is this fair? Is it fair that people making $1.1 \nmillion paid a tax rate of 14.7 percent, and the janitor who served \nthem earning $33,000 a year paid a tax rate of 24.9 percent? Well, I \npersonally do not think so.\n  I know all of the arguments. I have served on the Finance Committee. \nI have heard it all. The biggest reason for this differential, by the \nway, is not the earned-income tax rate, which has had almost all of the \nattention in this national discussion. Almost all of the attention has \nbeen on the earned-income tax rate and raising it from 35 percent to \n39.6 percent.\n  Almost no attention has been paid to the unearned-income tax rate on \ncapital gains and dividends. The unearned rate is currently at 15 \npercent. That is what allows very wealthy people to pay a tax rate that \nis a fraction of those who work full time and are paying rates of 25 \npercent.\n  So I hope as we move to conclusion we will pay a little more \nattention to the unearned rates. The truth is, we would not have to \nhave as much of an increase as is being proposed on the earned-income \nside and have more of an increase on the unearned-income side, and we \nwould make the Tax Code fairer and we could raise the same\n\n[[Page S7772]]\n\namount of revenue. That is the revenue side.\n  But the spending side Republicans have down. They have put out a \nproposal that asks for savings out of entitlements and other \ndiscretionary spending. And if we look at their proposal and break it \ndown--again, let's look at health care. We are going to spend $11 \ntrillion over the next 10 years on health care. Republicans are \nproposing saving $600 million. If we had a compromise between \nRepublicans and Democrats let's say at $500 million, that would be a \nsavings of, again the magic, 4 percent.\n  We are going to increase revenue 4 percent. If we had savings in \nhealth care of 4\\1/2\\ percent, we would save $500 billion. Now, I have \nhad conversations with colleagues who tell me we cannot possibly save \n$500 billion out of health care, just like people say, well, we cannot \npossibly increase revenue $1.6 trillion.\n  Really, we cannot save $500 billion out of a pot of money where we \nare going to spend $11 trillion? I do not think that is true. I think \nwe can save $500 billion. And I will tell you, there is someone sitting \non this floor who has a pretty good idea of how to do it. Senator \nSheldon Whitehouse has said to us over and over and over: We are \nspending more than any other country in the world as a share of our \nnational income on health care. We are spending 18 percent of our GDP \non health care. No other country spends more than 11\\1/2\\ percent.\n  The best minds in this country have told us we are wasting hundreds \nof billions of dollars in health care that do not improve health care \noutcomes at all. If we would save money in overall health care, 40 \npercent of that savings would flow through to the Federal Government. \nSenator Whitehouse is right about this. We ought to focus like a laser \non where the waste is.\n  We do not need to increase the eligibility age for Medicare. We \nabsolutely do not have to do it to save $500 billion. But what it would \ndo, if we save $500 billion, is it would keep the growth in health care \nspending about equal to the growth in the overall economy. That would \nstabilize the growth of health care spending. That would be a huge \ncontribution to the economic competitive position of the United States.\n  Republicans have also said: Hey, let's save $300 billion on domestic \ndiscretionary savings. Now, I will be the first to say we have already \nhad lots of savings on the discretionary accounts. We have saved over \n$1 trillion in the discretionary accounts. But they say, ok, let's save \nanother $300 billion. I think we should say we will do it if they go \nwith us on the revenue. We will do it because that represents a savings \nof 2.6 percent of the $11.6 trillion we are going to spend in the \ndiscretionary accounts over the next 10 years.\n\n  Now, I think we have gotten into a situation where we use numbers \nthat are absolutely big numbers, but we do not put them in perspective. \nWe cannot save 2.6 percent out of discretionary accounts. Well, I \nbelieve we can. I absolutely believe we can. I believe we can save more \nout of defense.\n  I have supported every penny--I did not vote for going to war in \nIraq. I thought that was a huge mistake. But I have supported every \ndollar of spending for our troops in the field. I can tell you as the \nBudget Committee chairman, we can save more money in defense. There are \nlots of Republicans who know we can do it too.\n  Other mandatory. That is another category the Republicans said to \nsave $300 billion there. I think they are $100 billion too high because \nwe are already saving over $100 billion out of other mandatory programs \nto offset the cost of extending certain policies just last year. So \nlet's save $200 billion. That would represent, again, 4 percent of what \nwe are projected to spend over the next 10 years in other mandatory \nspending; $5.1 trillion is what we are programmed to spend. Two hundred \nbillion dollars of savings there would represent 4 percent.\n  Again, I have had colleagues tell me we cannot possibly save $200 \nbillion. I have had staff people tell me we cannot save $200 billion. \nSo I say, how much are we going to spend? How much are we going to \nspend? That $200 billion represents 4 percent of what we are going to \nspend. We cannot save 4 percent? Yes, we can. Yes, we can.\n  I was elected on the slogan, in 1986, of ``Yes We Can.'' And somebody \nelse used that slogan a few years later. President Obama used that \nslogan, ``Yes We Can.'' He called me up.\n  He said: Do I owe you royalties?\n  I said: No, I am glad you are using it.\n  But, yes we can. We need more of a yes-we-can attitude around here.\n  So when I rack it all up and I look at what we have already done, we \nhave saved $1 trillion in the Budget Control Act of last year. Here is \nother mandatory savings I just talked about: more than $100 billion \nthat we have already done to offset the cost of extending certain \npolicies, $900 billion of other discretionary savings already done. So \nwe put that in the bank. We use that as the base.\n  We put it all together and here is what we have: We save another $200 \nbillion on defense; we have revenue of $1.6 trillion, which is the \nPresident's proposal; we have $100 billion of nondefense. That gets us \nthe $300 billion the Republicans have asked for.\n  On health care we do $500 billion. That is close to what they have \nasked for, $100 billion less. Other mandatory, $200 billion; that is \nclose to what they asked for. The $100 billion difference reflects what \nwe have already done.\n  Interest savings. Because we are spending less and we have more \nrevenue, we save interest, $400 billion. That gives us a total of \nspending cuts of $1.4 trillion. We add in what has already been done \n$1.050 trillion, and we have a total of $2.450 trillion. We add that to \nthe $1.6 trillion of revenue, we have $4.050 trillion of savings.\n  Then I personally would extend the payroll tax holiday because CBO \ntells us, on the tax side, that holiday is the biggest bang for the \nbuck in giving a lift to the economy. It will cost us $200 billion, for \na net deficit reduction of $3.850 trillion. For those wondering what \nhappens to AMT and what happens to the doc fix, we have those in the \nbaseline so they are covered in this proposal. We can correct the \nalternative minimum tax. We can eliminate the doc fix and be done with \nthem.\n  This magnitude of package is precisely what was called for in the \nfiscal commission. In The Moment of Truth report, this is what they \ncalled for. I think they were right to call for it. I was proud to be \npart of that effort. I believe this is precisely what we need to do \nnow. So that is the plan. Now we need action. We should do it the old-\nfashioned way. We should make tough decisions, even some that will be \nunpopular.\n  It will be the right thing to do, and it will work. It will stabilize \nour debt and begin to bring it down. It will provide certainty to our \neconomy. I believe it will unleash the $1.7 trillion that is in the \nbalance sheets of our corporations, and it will unlock the investment \npotential that lies all across this country.\n  Let me end as I began by simply saying thank you. Thank you to the \npeople of North Dakota, thank you to my colleagues, thank you to my \nstaff and, most of all, thanks to my family--to my wife Lucy, to my \ndaughter Jessie, to our son Ivan and his wife Kendra, and to our \ngrandson Carter. To all my family members, my cousins, who have been \nwith me in every campaign, I will never forget your support and your \nhelp. I will always consider serving here the honor of my life.\n  I also thank my colleague Senator Hoeven, who, in the 2 years he and \nI have overlapped, has been a good colleague. I have enjoyed working \nwith him very much.\n  I just close by noting, because as many of you know, I am sort of a \nnumbers guy, that I started these remarks in the 12th hour of the 12th \nday of the 12th month of 2012. I am sure numerologists will make much \nof those relationships. I began this speech in the 12th hour of the \n12th day of the 12th month of 2012, and I leave here forever grateful \nfor the opportunity to serve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I wish to take a moment to thank our distinguished \ncolleague and my dear friend for his wonderful service. We serve on \nthree committees together. It has been my honor to serve on the \ncommittee Senator Conrad chairs, the Budget Committee, and to have him \nserve as a senior member of the Agriculture Committee, which I chair. \nBoth of us sit on the Finance Committee together.\n\n[[Page S7773]]\n\n  Today he has done what he has always done for us, which is to provide \nvision, common sense, intelligence, and a lot of numbers. They add up, \nand they make sense. In listening to Senator Conrad's farewell speech, \nI want to thank him again for giving us a path forward. He is someone \nwho will forever be in Senate history as one of the great statesmen of \nour country, someone with intelligence, respect on both sides, \ncompassion, and a fighter from North Dakota like I have never seen. He \nis someone who serves in the best tradition of what it means to be an \nhonorable public servant.\n  He has been a role model for me all the way through to this point and \na dear friend. I wish him, Lucy, and Dakota--he is, in fact, the 101st \nSenator--wonderful opportunities going forward in the future. The \nSenator from North Dakota will be greatly missed, but his contributions \nwill forever be a part of the positive tradition of this great body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield to the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator. I will be speaking later on to the \nsenior Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I have had the privilege to serve with several hundred \nSenators since coming here. I have put in a very small list those who \nare extraordinary both for their talents and for our personal \nfriendship, and Kent Conrad is in that short list very easily. In fact, \nhe defines it in many ways. Because of what we heard here, as I \nwhispered to him a minute ago, it was nice to hear a grownup speak on \nthe floor.\n  I have seen him reach across the aisle. We have been privileged, both \nof us have been privileged to serve with fine Senators from both \nparties. But Kent Conrad is unique. Marcelle and I value more than I \ncould possibly say here our friendship with Kent and his wife Lucy and \nthe 101st Senator, Dakota.\n  As I said, I will speak later about this Senator, but what we heard \ntoday was a real giant of the Senate speaking, and I hope all Americans \nwill listen to the lesson he gave us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Before the junior Senator from North Dakota speaks--\nand I appreciate his courtesy in allowing us to make a few brief, \npersonal remarks before he speaks--I wanted to say to my friend and my \nchairman, the senior Senator from North Dakota, that, yes, in the most \nobvious respect, he is leaving the Senate, and we will be a smaller \nSenate for his departure. But in some very important ways, Kent Conrad \nis not leaving the Senate. I can assure him that for as long as I \nremain a U.S. Senator and have the privilege to serve in this body, \nKent Conrad will remain in this Senate as an example that I will never \nforget as a young Senator tutored by him in the Budget Committee. I can \nspeak for myself when I say that, and I will only speak for myself when \nI say that, but I am absolutely confident there are dozens of other \nMembers of this body who can say exactly the same thing. In that sense, \nKent Conrad will continue to be an important part of this Senate, and \nthe effect he will have in those years through the example he has set, \nechoed down the hallways of time by people who had the opportunity to \nserve with him, is going to be an immensely valuable one.\n  He displays the characteristics of diligence--an underrated attribute \nbut an important one--of courtesy, of determination. It is an \ninteresting combination, courtesy and determination, but Chairman \nConrad knows very well when to yield and when to fight. There was a \npolitician hundreds of years ago in another country who said, ``One \nought not to be obstinate,'' and then he continued, ``unless one ought \nto be, and then one ought to be unshakable.'' On the things that count, \nSenator Conrad has always been unshakable. Where progress can be made, \nhe has never been obstinate. It has been my honor to serve with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I rise to speak on behalf of the senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota and to thank him for his dedicated service on behalf of \nthe people of North Dakota and on behalf of the people of this great \nNation.\n  I think this is 26 years that he has served in the Senate, and he has \nalways served with great distinction and great commitment. He has been \na leader in agriculture, in energy, and in fiscal efforts and many \nother areas.\n  I have to say on a personal note that since I came to the Senate last \nyear, he has reached out to me and to my family in a very warm and \npositive way, both personally and professionally, and I would say the \nsame about his wife Lucy. I think this is in the finest tradition of \nthe Senate, in the tradition of bipartisanship, in the tradition of \nworking together, and in the tradition of truly caring and being \ncommitted to getting things done. It wasn't just that he reached out on \na personal level and said: All right, how can I be helpful, how can we \nwork together; when I had questions or needed assistance, he was there. \nHe was more than helpful.\n  In terms of working on legislation that matters, a farm bill, working \ntogether on the Agriculture Committee--Senator Conrad has an amazing \nknowledge of agriculture and obviously incredible experience over the \npast 26 years building good farm policy for this Nation. So to work \nwith him on the Agriculture Committee was not only rewarding but really \nan opportunity to craft good long-term policy for this country that \nwill make a difference.\n  I start with that example because when you look at it, here we are at \na time when we need good policy for our country, but at the same time \nwe need to find savings, real savings that will help us address the \ndeficit and the debt. So we went to work on a farm bill--a farm bill \nthat is not only responsive to the farmers, the ranchers, and the \nproducers of this country who produce the highest quality of food \nsupply in the world at the lowest cost--every American benefits from \nthat. They wanted more crop insurance, and we went to work. We improved \nthe farm bill in terms of the kind of crop insurance it provides, but \nat the same time we saved $23 billion to help with the deficit and the \ndebt. That is doing it the right way.\n  If you think about it and you went across all aspects of what we are \ndoing here, all of the different types of policies that we have, if we \ncould do the same--craft good policy and find real, meaningful savings \non a bipartisan basis that empowers the very people who are impacted by \nthat policy, the farmers and the ranchers who do such a great job \nproducing food, fuel, and fiber, but at the same time grow our economy, \ncreate a favorable balance of trade and an incredible number of jobs--\nthat is what we have to do, whether it is agriculture, whether it is \nenergy, whether it is disaster assistance when we have floods and \nhurricanes, whether it is our military.\n  I am very pleased and honored to have had the opportunity to work \nwith Senator Conrad on those types of issues to try to make a real \ndifference for the people of this country. As Senator Conrad departs \nthe Senate after 26 years--think about it: 26 years here, conducting \nhimself in a professional manner with respect to this institution. He \nbuilt relationships with Senators on both sides of the aisle but always \nwith a commitment to the people of North Dakota and this country.\n  As I look at the legacy he leaves, I think one of the most important \nright now is his willingness to work in a bipartisan way to get things \ndone. He brings a practical, pragmatic approach that recognizes \nsolutions are imperfect but that we have an obligation in a bipartisan \nway to come together and find real solutions for the people of the \ngreatest Nation on Earth. It is that legacy, that willingness to be \nbipartisan and work together that I saw up close and personal here \nevery day. I believe it is that legacy, as well as many others, that \nwill continue here in this body when we think about Senator Kent Conrad \nand his service to North Dakota and his service to this great country.\n  I rise to say thank you on behalf of the people of North Dakota and \nthis country to my distinguished colleague for 26 years of dedicated \nservice. Thank you, good luck, and God bless in your future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to thank Senator Hoeven, my colleague, for his\n\n[[Page S7774]]\n\nkind words. I have really enjoyed the relationship. I think you can \ntell we worked together very well, and I hope that serves as an example \nto others of our colleagues. Even if you are on other side of the \npolitical aisle, you can work together, and you can get things done.\n  I also thank Senator Leahy, my dear friend. He and his wife are very \nclose friends of mine and my wife's.\n  To Senator Stabenow, the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, and Senator Whitehouse, who served with me on the Budget \nCommittee, I want to take special note of the friendships we have \nenjoyed. Senator Stabenow and Senator Whitehouse will be friends of \nours for as long as we are on this Earth.\n  I look forward to our continuing relationship with the Leahys, who, \nas I have indicated, have become very dear personal friends.\n  In closing, to Senator Hoeven, the best part of service here is \ngetting things done. And Senator Hoeven has come with that attitude to \nthis Chamber--to get results for the people we represent--and I \nappreciate that attitude, and I appreciate the friendship.\n\n  Finally, I say to the distinguished occupant of the chair, we have \nhad a very good relationship as well. I thank him for his service and \nfor this opportunity to have my farewell remarks before the Senate on \nthis the 12th day of the 12th month of 2012. That is a remarkable set \nof coincidences.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7774-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7774-S7776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, my fourth and final term as a U.S. \nSenator will soon come to an end. As I reflect on that reality, I am, \nof course, filled with many emotions, but the one I feel most is \ngratitude--gratitude first to God, creator of life and law, without \nwhose loving kindness nothing would be possible; gratitude to America, \nthe extraordinary land of opportunity which has given someone like me \nso many opportunities; gratitude to the people of Connecticut, who have \nentrusted me with the privilege of public service for 40 years, the \nlast 24 in the Senate; gratitude to my Senate colleagues, whom I have \ncome to know as friends and with whom it has been such an honor to \nserve; gratitude to all the people without whose help, hard work, and \nsupport I never would have made it to the Senate or stayed here, the \ngifted and hard-working staff in Connecticut and Washington who \nsupported, informed, and enriched my service here, and the volunteers \nin my campaigns who gave so much and asked for nothing in return except \nthat I do what I believed was right; gratitude to all those who labor \nout of view in the corridors of this Capitol Building, from the \nmaintenance crews to the Capitol Police and everybody else anywhere in \nthis building--thank you for keeping our Capitol running and keeping us \nsafe; and gratitude most of all, of course, to my family for the love, \nsupport, and inspiration they have given me every day of my life--my \nparents, grandparents, and siblings, my children and grandchildren, and \nHadassah, my wife of almost 30 years now, the love of my life, who has \nbeen my constant companion, supporter, and partner through this amazing \nadventure.\n  So I want to begin this farewell speech by simply saying thank you \nall. I have a lot to be grateful for. But, Mr. President, being a \nSenator, and since this is my farewell speech, I do have a few more \nthings I would like to say.\n  I am leaving the Senate at a moment in our history when America faces \ndaunting challenges both domestic and foreign and when too often our \nproblems seem greater than our government's ability to solve them. But \nI can tell you I remain deeply optimistic about America's future and \nconstantly inspired by the special destiny I am convinced is ours as \nAmericans.\n\n  My optimism is based not in theory or hope but in American history \nand in personal experience. I think particularly about my time in \npublic life and especially the changes I have witnessed since I took \nthe oath of office as a Senator on January 3, 1989. The fact is that \nover the past quarter century, America and the world have become freer \nand more prosperous. The Iron Curtain was peacefully torn down, and the \nSoviet empire defeated. The eternal values of freedom and opportunity, \non which America was founded and for which we still stand, have made \nglobal gains that were once unimaginable. We have seen the spread of \ndemocracy from Central Europe to Southeast Asia and from Latin America \nto the Middle East. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out \nof poverty in places such as China, India, and just about every other \ncorner of the globe, and technological advances have transformed almost \nevery aspect of our daily lives.\n  When I started in the Senate, a BlackBerry was a fruit and tweeting \nwas something only birds did. No more. None of these extraordinary \ndevelopments happened by accident. In fact, to a significant degree, I \nwould say they were made possible by the principled leadership of the \nUnited States, by the global economy and international system America \ncreated with our diplomacy and protected with our military and by the \nunique culture of freedom, innovation, and entrepreneurship that \nflourishes in our country and that remains the model and inspiration \nfor the rest of the modernizing world.\n  We have every reason to be proud of the progress of humanity that has \nhappened on America's watch and here at home to be grateful for the \ncountless ways in which our own country has been benefited in the \nprocess. We live in a world whose shape and trajectory the United \nStates, more than any other nation, is responsible for. It is certainly \nnot a perfect world. I know that. But it is a better world than the one \nwe inherited. In my opinion, it is actually in so many ways a better \nworld than has ever existed before.\n  Here at home, over the past quarter century, we have moved closer to \nthe more perfect union our Founders sought--becoming a more free and \nopen society, in ways I would guess those same Founders never could \nhave imagined.\n  Barriers of discrimination and bigotry that just a few decades ago \nseemed immoveable have been broken, and the doors of opportunity have \nbeen opened wider for all Americans--regardless of race, religion, \ngender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or disability.\n  During my time in Washington, we have had our first female Secretary \nof State nominated and confirmed and our first African-American \nPresident elected and reelected. It will forever remain one of my \ndeepest honors that--thanks to Vice President Gore--I was given the \nopportunity to be the first Jewish American nominated by a major \npolitical party for national office--and, incidentally, thanks to the \nAmerican people, grateful to have received one-half million more votes \nthan my opponent on the other side. But that is a longer story.\n  While there is still much work to do and many problems to be solved, \nI believe we can and should approach our future with a confidence that \nis based on the real and substantial progress we have made together. \nWhat is required now to solve the real urgent problems we still have is \nleadership--leadership of the kind that is never easy or common but \nwhich we as Americans know we can summon in times of need because we \nhave summoned it before.\n  Today, I regret to say, as I leave the Senate, the greatest obstacle \nI see standing between us and the brighter American future we all want \nis right here in Washington. It is the partisan polarization of our \npolitics which prevents us from making the principled compromises on \nwhich progress in a democracy depends and which right now prevents us \nfrom restoring our fiscal solvency as a nation.\n  We need bipartisan leadership to break the gridlock in Washington \nthat will unleash all the potential that is in the American people. So \nI would respectfully make this appeal to my colleagues--especially the \n12 new Senators who will take the oath of office for the first time \nnext month. I know how hard each of you has worked to get elected to \nthe Senate, and I know you worked so hard because you wanted to\n\n[[Page S7775]]\n\ncome here to make a difference for the better. There is no magic or \nmystery about the way to do so in the Senate. It requires reaching \nacross the aisle and finding partners from the opposite party. It means \nultimately putting the interests of country and constituents ahead of \nthe dictates of party and ideology.\n  When I look back at my own career, the legislative achievements I am \nproudest to have been part of--such as passing the Clean Air Act of \n1990, stopping the genocide in the Balkans, creating the 9/11 \nCommission and the Department of Homeland Security, reforming the \nintelligence community, reorganizing FEMA, and repealing don't ask, \ndon't tell--all were achieved only because a critical mass of Democrats \nand Republicans found common ground. That is what is desperately needed \nin Washington now to solve our Nation's biggest problems and address \nour biggest challenges before they become crises or catastrophes.\n  Our future also depends on our Nation continuing to exercise another \nkind of leadership; that is, leadership beyond our borders. This too \nhas never been easy or popular. Americans have rarely been eager to \nentangle ourselves abroad, especially at times when we have faced \neconomic difficulties at home, as we do now. There has been the \ntemptation to turn inward, to tell ourselves that the problems of the \nworld are not our responsibility or that we cannot afford to do \nanything about them. In fact, the prosperity, security, and freedom of \nthe American people depend more than ever before on what is happening \nin the rest of the world--and so, too, does the rest of the world \ndepend especially on us.\n  I know we can't solve all the planet's problems by ourselves, nor \nshould we try. But the fact is that none of the biggest problems facing \nthe world can or will be solved in the absence of American leadership. \nHere, too, I appeal to my Senate colleagues--and, again, especially \nthose who will take the oath of office for the first time early in \nJanuary--do not listen to the political consultants or others who tell \nyou that you shouldn't spend time on foreign affairs or national \nsecurity. They are wrong. The American people need us, the Senate, to \nstay engaged economically, diplomatically, and militarily in an ever \nsmaller world. Do not underestimate the impact you can have by getting \ninvolved in matters of foreign policy and national security, whether by \nusing your voice to stand in solidarity with those who are struggling \nfor the American ideal of freedom in their own countries across the \nglobe or working to strengthen the foreign policy and national security \ninstitutions of our own country or by rallying our citizens to embrace \nthe role that we as a country must play on the world stage, as both our \ninterests and our values demand.\n\n  None of the challenges we face in a still dangerous world is beyond \nour ability to meet. Just as we ended the ethnic cleansing in the \nBalkans, we can stop the slaughter in Syria. Just as we nurtured the \ndemocratic transitions after communism fell in Central and Eastern \nEurope, we can support the forces of freedom in the Middle East today. \nJust as we were able to prevail in the long struggle against the Soviet \nUnion during the Cold War, we can prevail in the global conflict with \nIslamist extremism and terrorism we were forced into by the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001.\n  But all that too will require leadership in the Senate. It will \nrequire leaders who will stand against the siren song of isolationism, \nwho will defend our defense and foreign assistance budgets, who will \nsupport, when necessary, the use of America's military power against \nour enemies in the world, and who will have the patience and \ndetermination when the public grows weary to see our battles through \nuntil they are won.\n  I first set foot in this Chamber almost exactly 50 years ago, in the \nsummer of 1963, inspired like so many of my generation by President \nJohn F. Kennedy and his call to service. I spent that summer right here \nin the Senate as an intern for my home State Senator, Abe Ribicoff. He \nwas and remains another personal hero of mine. Although I never would \nhave admitted so publicly back then, because it was so presumptuous, I \ncame away from that experience with the dream that I might someday, \nsomehow return to serve in this place.\n  I have been blessed to live that dream, and that is what America is \nall about. We have always been a nation of dreamers whose destiny is \ndetermined only by the bounds of our own imagination and by our \nwillingness to work hard to realize what we have imagined. Indeed, long \nbefore the United States came into being as a government of \ninstitutions and laws, it was a dream--a dream, an implausible, \nincredible dream, animated by faith of a country defined not by its \nborders nor by its rulers nor by the ethnicity of its Founders but by a \nset of eternal and universal principles--that life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness are God's endowment to each of us.\n  That was the dream that gave us our existence and our purpose as a \nnation, and it is the dream that for more than 200 years, through every \npassing generation, has been reinventing, renewing, enthralling, and \nsurprising us--the very dreamers who are living that dream.\n  I leave this Chamber as full of faith in the dream called America as \nwhen I stood here nearly one quarter century ago to take the oath of \noffice for the first time--and as when I first came here nearly one-\nhalf century ago as a 21-year-old, the grandchild of four immigrants to \nAmerica, the son of wonderful parents who never had the opportunity \neven to go to college but made sure my sisters and I did and gave us \nthe confidence to pursue our dreams, which was their American dream for \nus.\n  America remains a land of dreams and a nation of dreamers. I know my \nown story repeats itself today in millions of American families and \ntheir children. As long as that is so, I know our best days as a \ncountry are still ahead of us.\n  So I will end my remarks where our country began a long time ago--\nwith a dream and a prayer that God will continue to bless the United \nStates of America.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will have a lot more to say about my \nfriend from Connecticut in the next few days. In the meantime, I wish \nto thank him for a very important, a very visionary, and very wonderful \nstatement. We thank him for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague and \nfriend from Connecticut on behalf of all the people of our State for \nhis lifetime of public service.\n  Our lives have been intertwined personally and professionally for \nalmost 40 years.\n  I had the privilege of coming to know Senator Lieberman's family, his \nparents who gave him the values and ideals he has expressed so \neloquently and powerfully repeatedly throughout America as he did today \non the floor of the Senate. That dream, which they inspired, is indeed \na uniquely American dream, but it is rooted also in the Stamford and \nConnecticut community that we share, those ideals of faith, education \nand intellect and those qualities of independence and courage and \nperseverance in the face of adversity which he has embodied and taught \nto so many young people and others around our State and around the \ncountry and, of course, the ideals and goals of civility and, maybe \nmost important for this body, the ideal of public service, which he has \nexemplified through all of these years, an unremitting, unstinting, and \nunwavering commitment to making the world a better place, person by \nperson, individual by individual, helping make America equal to that \ngreat ideal and dream he has articulated so eloquently.\n  I have been privileged, also, to know Joe's wife Hadassah, who has \nadded so extraordinarily to his life and made possible so many of his \nachievements. This tribute is to her and his family as well as to him.\n  For the past 2 years I have had the privilege of working with Senator \nLieberman, it has been a real honor, and I look forward to continuing \nmy work with him, although it will no longer be in this Chamber, just \nas I worked with him before reaching here. In a sense, I\n\n[[Page S7776]]\n\nfollowed his professional path as a State senator, as attorney general, \nand now here.\n  Many of our colleagues will come to the floor in these remaining days \nof this session to commemorate the tremendous legacy he leaves. It is a \nlegacy of action, not just of words as we have heard today, but action \nand achievement. He has been a steadfast supporter of family planning \nand a woman's right to choose, raising awareness and garnering \ncommitment of congressional colleagues for that cause. He has been a \nchampion of equality and justice, exemplified, for example, in his \nadvocacy of the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. He has been a leader \non environmental conservation as attorney general of our State, as well \nas in this body, especially in the fight to protect Long Island Sound, \na treasure of Connecticut and the entire Nation.\n  He was a leader in bringing to the floor of this Chamber one of the \nfirst bills on climate change. His legacy will live on in these \nefforts: the clean air and water he has helped to protect, the urgency \nwith which he has fought to protect our natural treasures in \nConnecticut and around the country. His spirit of environmental \nstewardship will inspire generations to come. That ideal of stewardship \nis also articulated by his remarks here, the stewardship of democracy, \nof our Republic.\n  One of Senator Lieberman's signature accomplishments has been the \ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security in which he aimed to \nconsolidate disparate agencies to facilitate interagency communication. \nIn the wake of 9/11, he made that a mission and achieved it as chairman \nof the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs as well as \na leader on the Armed Services Committee. And on that committee, Armed \nServices, he has championed a strong and vital national defense. That \nremains essential now as it has been throughout his career.\n  I am grateful to Senator Lieberman's support for a bill I recently \nintroduced, the End Trafficking in Government Contracting Act, which \naddresses the serious problem of human trafficking by Federal \ncontractors and subcontractors. I think his support for that measure \ndemonstrates, again, his commitment not only to equality but helping \nand working with others in this body on a bipartisan basis who share \nhis goals, as that measure has been and was and will be, as is the \ncause of ending human trafficking and achieving human rights.\n  Most recently, in a very personal way I observed Senator Lieberman's \ndeep empathy for people who are victims of natural catastrophes. When \nthe recent spate of storms struck Connecticut, Irene and Sandy, I \ntoured with him stricken places, seeing in his eyes and hearing in his \nvoice his sense of how individuals and their families are affected by \nany kind of natural disaster. He is a person of heart and of soul--a \nbig heart and a soul that reaches out to people.\n  I thank him for his great work, his contribution, his unstinting \ngenerosity to the people of our State, Connecticut, through all of his \nyears of service in many different positions, in many different ways, \nin a myriad of places throughout the State and throughout our Nation.\n  I thank my Connecticut colleague for dedicating his life to public \nservice. I look forward to being with him, if not in this Chamber, in \nmany other places around the country. I continue to admire his great \ncontributions to our country as well as to our State. Thank you, \nSenator Lieberman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague, \nSenator Joe Lieberman, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of \nthis term. Senator Lieberman's long career in public service began in \nthe Connecticut State Senate, where he served for 10 years, including \nthree terms as the majority leader. Joe then put his Yale law degree to \ngood use as the attorney general for the State before winning his bid \nfor the U.S. Senate in 1988. He has served in this esteemed body for 24 \nyears, and I am grateful for his dedication and service to our country.\n  Joe is a true patriot. As Senator, he has made ensuring the security \nand safety of our Nation his priority. He spearheaded the creation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security in 2002 and has served honorably as \nthe chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. In this position, Senator Lieberman promoted a forward-\nthinking security strategy of preparing our military to respond to the \nunique security threats posed in the 21st century. In particular, he \nhas worked to address cyber security issues and prepare our military to \nrespond to evolving warfare tactics.\n  Senator Lieberman has also worked to ensure that our Nation can stand \nstrong in the face of natural disasters. In 2006, he worked with \nSenator Collins to make the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, \nmore effective and responsive to communities suffering from the effects \nof natural disasters. He insisted that FEMA centralize and upgrade its \ninformation technology, IT, system to better respond to disasters and \nthe needs of the public.\n  Joe and I have worked together as members of the Anti-Meth Caucus to \nfight the methamphetamine epidemic. Senator Lieberman recognizes the \nthreat drugs like methamphetamine pose to the security of our borders, \nthe health of our citizens, and the economic prosperity of our Nation. \nI was proud to work with him on this important issue.\n  In 2000, Senator Lieberman ran as the Vice Presidential candidate, \nbecoming the first person of the Jewish faith to represent a major \npolitical party on a national ticket. Despite rising to the top of the \nticket as a representative of the Democratic Party, Senator Lieberman \nhas frequently demonstrated his willingness to work across the aisle to \nachieve his vision.\n  I respect Joe's commitment to his personal convictions and his hard \nwork on behalf of the people of Connecticut. I thank him for his \nservice to our country and wish him all the best.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7776-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7776-S7778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the \npeople of Nebraska. It is a tremendous honor to have had the \nopportunity to serve the state for 20 years--8 as Governor and 12 as \nSenator. The people of Nebraska are generous and hardworking and it has \nbeen a true privilege to represent them.\n  I also want to thank my parents--Birdella and Benjamin. Raising me in \nMcCook, NE they instilled in me the values I have tried to embrace and \nwhich serve as guiding principles for me in both public and private.\n  I especially want to thank my family for their unwavering love and \nsupport. As my colleagues know, public service requires our families to \nsacrifice--sacrifice privacy and sacrifice the ability to determine \ntheir own schedule among many other things. And so I sincerely thank my \nwife Diane, our four kids and five grandkids for their patience and \nunderstanding. While it is hard to walk away from this body, I look \nforward to getting to spend a lot more time together.\n  As a public official the lens through which I have always tried to \nview decisions is: how will this policy, this vote or this decision \nimpact my community, my State and my country? This focus and advocacy \nfor my home State has resulted in both praise and criticism at various \ntimes but I stand before you today proud of the accomplishments \nachieved over the last 12 years and grateful for the opportunities \nafforded to me by the people of Nebraska. Arriving in the Senate in \n2001 I recall thinking about what one of my predecessors in this body, \nEd Zorinsky, used to say. Senator Zorinsky said that the biggest \nproblem in Washington, D.C. is there are too many Democratic Senators \nand there are too many Republican Senators. There are not enough U.S. \nSenators. Unquestionably my proudest moments in the Senate are those \nefforts that were bipartisan and pursued by a collective motive to get \nthe best possible result while maintaining the dignity of this \ninstitution.\n\n[[Page S7777]]\n\n  Probably the most straightforward example of this work is the \ncompromise achieved by the Gang of 14. As many of my colleagues will \nrecall, in 2005 there were several judicial nominees presented to the \nSenate for its consideration but which had not yet received an up or \ndown vote. The majority leader at that time, Senator Frist of \nTennessee, was considering what became known as the so-called ``nuclear \noption'' which would have changed the Senate's rules so that the \nminority party couldn't filibuster a judicial nominee.\n  There was a great deal of concern about how this would impact the \nSenate's longstanding tradition of majority rule while recognizing \nminority rights--and what this would mean to the way the Senate \nconducted its business in the future. At that time, myself and Senator \nLott convened 12 of our colleagues--6 additional Democrats and 6 \nadditional Republicans. Together we met and exchanged ideas about how \nto find a sensible way forward that would satisfy all 14 Senators such \nthat each would agree the Senate was dutifully carrying out its \n``advise and consent'' responsibility without unduly restraining the \nability of the minority to assert itself in instances when it found a \nnominee truly and substantively objectionable or unfit to serve.\n  Ultimately an agreement was reached by this bipartisan group, there \nwas not a rules change and in the midst of a highly partisan \nenvironment, the Senate moved forward in a positive way and I believe \nwe did the right thing. Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia was a \ncritical member of the Gang of 14. In addition to his many, many, many \naccomplishments--everyone knew then and knows now that there is not \nanyone more well versed in the history of the Senate or who was more \nprotective of it as an institution. I will never forget after the \nagreement was finalized Senator Byrd said that he was proud of the work \naccomplished and that we had ``saved the Senate.''\n  Hearing those words from Senator Byrd was undoubtedly one of the \nproudest moments of my career. Besides Senator Byrd, I have had the \nopportunity to serve with so many public servants in this body, and I \nthank all of them. I would start naming names, but I know I will leave \nsomeone out. So I want to thank all present and past Members of the \nSenate that I have worked with for the occasions we have had to work \ntogether so closely.\n\n  I also share the sentiment that many of my colleagues have noted in \ntheir farewell addresses, and that is the appreciation for the efforts \nof staff. Over the last 12 years I have worked with an incredibly \ndedicated and talented collection of individuals. We call on our staff \nto do a lot of work, often in a very stressful environment. I thank \neveryone in my office back home and at the office in DC for the work \nthey have done on behalf of the State of Nebraska.\n  If I were to leave this body with one thought and hope for the \nfuture, it would be this: Congress needs to change its math, and by \nthat I mean the Members of Congress should be more concerned about \naddition and multiplication and less involved in division and \nsubtraction which seems to overtake this institution at times. My hope \nis that in the process of doing this, Congress and our Nation will have \na stronger desire to find solutions for the country's greatest \nchallenges more so than any effort to try to drive our citizenry apart.\n  With that, I will say one more time: Thank you to my family, my \nstaff, my colleagues, and most especially to the people of Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ncolleague Ben Nelson. In fact, when we visited with each other last \nnight, I said to Senator Nelson that I have spent a significant part of \nmy career following jobs he had done. I was the mayor of Lincoln when \nBen Nelson was the Governor of Nebraska, I became the Governor of \nNebraska as he was completing his two terms, and then I joined him in \nthe U.S. Senate. Before all of that, I worked with Ben as the Secretary \nof Agriculture.\n  I can say from first-hand experience that Ben Nelson always had the \nbest interests of our State at heart. He was enormously hardworking. In \nfact, I don't hesitate to admit for a second that when I came to the \nGovernor's office, I found the State to be in excellent shape. He often \njoked about how he was tighter than three coats of paint, and I think \nthat is absolutely true.\n  He tended to business, balanced the budget, and made sure that money \nwas set aside in the rainy day fund because we in Nebraska know there \nare going to be days where it might rain. He did a great job as \nGovernor. We worked hand in hand on a number of issues when I was \nGovernor and he was a U.S. Senator. When we became colleagues in the \nSenate, that working relationship continued.\n  I am very pleased to rise today and say to the people of Nebraska \nthat there was never a time where partisan differences ever impacted or \ninterfered with our ability to work together. Senator Nelson was always \nlooking for a way to move the State forward and move our country \nforward.\n  I just wanted to come to the floor today and thank my colleague Ben \nNelson for his service. We appreciate everything he has done. We wish \nthe Senator the very best, and I have a sense we are going to have an \nopportunity to work together in future years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and \nrecognize the achievements of Senator Ben Nelson, who, like me, will be \nleaving the Senate at the end of this year. I consider Senator Nelson, \nwho has represented Nebraska in the Senate since 2000, a friend and an \nexcellent colleague.\n  Senator Nelson has had a long and impressive career, spanning both \nthe private sector as well as State and Federal Government service. \nAfter graduating from law school at the University of Nebraska, Senator \nNelson spent roughly two decades working in the insurance industry, \nboth as a legal practitioner and in leadership roles at the Central \nNational Insurance Group, the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners, and the Nebraska Department of Insurance.\n  It was upon this impressive background that Senator Nelson launched \nhis career in public service when, in 1990, as a moderate Democrat, he \nwas elected Governor of Nebraska. As a testament to his dedicated \nservice and popularity, he was reelected to a second term in 1994 after \ngarnering nearly three-quarters of the vote. Nebraskans then sent him \nto the U.S. Senate in 2000. Senator Nelson was reelected in 2006 in a \nlandslide.\n  Nebraska and my State of North Dakota share a great deal in common. \nBoth States are populated by residents who value hard work and who \npossess an independent streak that places pragmatism above partisan \npolitics. Senator Nelson is a product of his Nebraska roots--he brought \nthose same characteristics to Washington and, as a direct result, was \nable to work across the aisle and within his party to benefit his State \nin ways more partisan legislators likely never could have done.\n  Rural States such as ours also face unique challenges, particularly \nthose involving the agriculture industry, which often go unnoticed by \nthose who live in densely populated areas. I have worked closely with \nSenator Nelson over the years on farm legislation and know firsthand \nhis passion for the industry and his drive to see family farmers \nsucceed. Nebraskans should be very proud of Senator Nelson's hard work \non the Agriculture, Appropriations, and Armed Services Committees.\n  I will greatly miss having Senator Nelson as a colleague, but I also \nknow that his wife Diane as well as his children and grandchildren will \nbe excited to have him back home in Nebraska. My wife Lucy and I wish \nBen and his family many happy years ahead.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are many signs of the \nfundamental, measurable changes we are causing in the Earth's climate, \nmainly through our large-scale emission of carbon dioxide from fossil \nfuels. These are irreversible changes, at least in the short run, so we \nshould take them very seriously.\n  Over the last 250 years, the global annual average concentration of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per \nmillion to 390 parts per million. That is a 30-percent increase. We \nhave recent direct measurements that the carbon dioxide concentration \nincreased by 15 percent since 1980 when it was 339. In 1980 it was 339 \nand now it is 390. That is just a dozen years in which the \nconcentration of CO2 in our atmosphere has increased by more \nthan 50 parts per million. Fifty parts per million is a big shift if \none is not aware of the scales we are talking about here. For 8,000 \ncenturies--800,000 years--longer than homo sapiens have existed on the \nface of the Earth, we can measure that the carbon concentration in the \natmosphere has fluctuated between 170 and 300 parts per million. A \ntotal range of 130 parts per million has been the total range for 8,000 \ncenturies. We are now outside of that range up to 390, and we have \nmoved 50 points since 1980, in a number of decades. So the consequences \nare going to be profound, and perhaps no consequence of that carbon \npollution will be as profound as the increasing acidification of the \nworld's oceans.\n  Science, of course, has known since the Civil War era, and most of us \nunderstand, that excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere creates a \nwarmer atmosphere known as the greenhouse effect. There is nothing new \nabout that. But not all of the carbon dioxide emitted by human \nactivity--by our use of fossil fuels--stays in the atmosphere. Carbon \ndioxide is soluble in water and the oceans cover 70 percent of the \nEarth. Where the atmosphere is in contact with the oceans, a portion of \nthe carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves into the oceans, reacts \nwith the sea water to form carbonic acid and increases the overall \nacidity of the oceans.\n  There is sometimes quarrel and debate about complex modeling of \nclimate and atmospheric projections, but evidence of ocean \nacidification is simple to measure and understand. Indeed, even the \nsmall noisy chorus of climate change deniers and corporate polluters is \nnoticeably quiet on the issue of ocean acidification because they \nsimply cannot explain away the facts.\n  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists gauge that \nover the past 200 years, hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide \nhave been absorbed into the oceans. NASA, which is able to put, for \ninstance, a man on the Moon and a Rover on Mars and has reasonably good \nscientists working there who can accomplish those achievements, reports \nthat:\n\n       The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of \n     the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year.\n\n  NOAA scientists say the oceans are taking up about 1 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide per hour. So in more or less the time my remarks are \nconcluded, the equivalent of more than the weight of the Washington \nMonument of carbon will have been dumped into our oceans. All of the \nextra carbon dioxide humans have pumped into the oceans has caused the \nglobal pH of the upper ocean water to change--a nearly 30-percent \nincrease in the acidity of the oceans.\n  As my colleagues can see, the curve is not only moving upward but is \nsteepening. Where is it headed? By the end of this century, it is \nprojected we will have a 160-percent rise in ocean acidity. As we can \nsee, not only are the oceans becoming more acidic, but they are \nbecoming more acidic at a very rapid pace. The rate of change in ocean \nacidity is already thought to be faster than at any time in the past 50 \nmillion years.\n  I talk, when I give this weekly speech from time to time, about the \n800,000 years our planet has had a carbon dioxide concentration between \n170 and 300 parts per million and how long a time period that is \ncompared to say humankind having the mastery of fire, humankind having \nengaged in agriculture, humankind even existing as homo sapiens. It is \nlonger than all of those things. But that is just measuring in the \nhundreds of thousands of years. We are talking about a rate of \nincreased carbon concentration and ocean acidity climbing faster than \nat any time in the past 50 million years.\n  What does that mean? Well, a paper published in the journal Science, \nwhich is a mainstream, noncrank publication, earlier this year \nconcluded that the current rate of carbon dioxide emission could drive \nchemical changes in our oceans that are unparalleled in at least the \nlast 300 million years. We are back into geologic time now since we saw \nthat kind of an effect. The authors warn that we may be ``entering an \nunknown territory of marine ecosystem change.'' Well, when our range of \nreview is in the hundreds of millions of years and the authors are \ntalking about entering unknown territory, that is really saying \nsomething.\n\n  Here is what Dr. Peter Brewer, the senior scientist at the Monterey \nBay Aquarium Research Institute, has to say. Let me quote him:\n\n       The outcome is very clear that we are in uncharted \n     territory in the entire span of Earth history. The primary \n     cause of this is simply the rate of CO2 change; we \n     are changing Earth far, far faster than any recorded geologic \n     shift ever.\n\n  Repeat: ``We are changing Earth far, far faster than any recorded \ngeologic shift ever.''\n  What does this mean for marine life? Well, as the pH of sea water \ndrops, so does the saturation of calcium carbonate, which is the \ncompound found in the sea water that aquatic animals use for the \nconstruction of their shells and of their skeletons. Some sea creatures \nabsorb calcium carbonate directly from the water; others ingest it as \nfood and then through their bodies it works out to build their shells. \nAt lower saturations of calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate is not as \navailable to these species, and it becomes more difficult for them to \nmake their shells; species such as oysters, crabs, lobsters, corals, \nand the plankton that comprises the very base of the oceanic food web. \nWe have seen this happen in real life already with the disaster that \nbefell the Pacific Northwest oyster hatcheries when acidic water came \nin and killed off all the juveniles that were being grown.\n  Over 1 billion people on this planet rely on marine protein as their \nprimary source of protein, and then, of course, there are the countless \njobs that depend on fisheries, on tourism, on restaurants, boat \nbuilding, maintenance, shipping, and the list goes on. The Presiding \nOfficer is from Maryland, which is another ocean State. He is clearly \naware of the importance of that ocean economy.\n  As things get harder for the species to survive and thrive, sooner or \nlater it will get harder for the economies they support. Let me give my \ncolleagues a specific example: the tiny pteropod, a type of snail, \nwhich is about the size of a very small pea. It is also known as the \nsea butterfly because its foot has adapted into two butterfly-like \nwings which allows it to propel itself around in the ocean. These \nimages show what can happen to the pteropod's shell when the creature's \nunderwater environment is lacking in those compounds and becomes more \nacidic. That is not good for the pteropods.\n  Another study compared pteropods incubated in sea water with today's \npH to pteropods incubated in water with the acidity and chemical \nconditions projected for the year 2100. The study found a 28-percent \ndecrease in shell growth. Maintaining their shells against that acidity \nrequires energy--energy that would otherwise go into other biologic \nprocesses such as growth or reproduction. So increasing ocean acidity \nis an external stress that makes it harder for species such as the \npteropod to survive.\n  Who cares about the lowly pteropod? Well, salmon do. Forty-seven \npercent\n\n[[Page S7779]]\n\nof the diet of some salmon species in the Pacific is pteropods. The \nsalmon fisheries that support coastal jobs and economies also care \nabout the salmon. Ocean fishing in the United States overall is a \nmultibillion-dollar industry connected to hundreds of thousands of \nlivelihoods, and we should care about our fisheries industry, even if \none doesn't care about the salmon or the lowly pteropod.\n  These unprecedented changes in ocean acidity are not happening alone, \nunfortunately.\n  These changes come along with dramatically changing ocean \ntemperature, which is also driven by the same carbon pollution. Just \nrecently, NOAA proposed listing 66 species of coral as endangered or \nthreatened, citing climate change as the driver of those species' three \nkey threats: disease, warmer seas, and greater ocean acidification. \nWhen you add to those three conditions the preexisting stressors, such \nas nutrient pollution and destructive fishing practices, well, 35 \npercent of the world's reefs are classified as in a critical or \nthreatened stage.\n  Scientific projections indicate that coral reef ecosystems could be \neliminated in 30 to 50 years. The young pages who are on the floor of \nthe Senate listening to this speech may very well live into a time when \ncoral reefs and the ecosystems surrounding them are extinct. The death \nand decline of coral reefs, which are the most diverse ecosystems on \nthe planet, in turn wounds hundreds of other species that call the \nreefs home. When a reef ecosystem collapses and does not recover, it \nquickly becomes dominated by algae, and the rich mix of species \ndeveloped over hundreds of millions of years that was once present \nthere then disappears.\n  Scientists think the coral reefs off the coast of Papua, New Guinea \noffer a window into future effects of ocean acidification because there \nare natural emissions of carbon dioxide which bubble up from the sea \nfloor through the ocean and raise the concentration making the sea \nwater more acidic. Researchers have found that many species, especially \nthe more complex framework-building corals, which provide shelter to \nother organisms, do not thrive where the pH is lower.\n  These are two photographs taken in the same reef. We see how rich and \nvibrant this reef looks away from the carbon dioxide. Here, near the \ncarbon, where the acidification is higher, it is a shadow of the \nhealthy reef. The human-driven acidification of the ocean is capable of \ncausing--indeed is destined to cause if we do nothing--a serious \nimbalance in the ocean's complex ecology. The external stress of carbon \npollution will result in a new equilibrium in ocean ecosystems.\n  When we consider what this portends for our food security, for our \nplanet's biodiversity and economically for ocean-based industries, we \ncannot afford to ignore these changes that are happening, that are \nmeasurable in our oceans.\n  Unfortunately, ignoring it is exactly what we are doing by failing to \ncurb carbon pollution. There are high stakes involved. Our oceans cover \n70 percent of the planet. We cannot change their chemistry without \nexpecting profound consequences. It is time we realize we are, in fact, \npart of the very food chain being disrupted by the mounting \nacidification of the ocean.\n  The disruption of international fishing due to climate change and \nacidification threatens to destabilize local and global economies and \ncompromise a major basic food source. How much? How much are we willing \nto sacrifice for the luxury of letting corporate polluters foul our \nplanet with unchecked CO2 emissions? Carbon pollution from \nfossil fuels is depleting the health of the oceans as well as affecting \nthe atmosphere. Unless we take serious action to reverse course, the \nconsequences may be dire. We are sleepwalking through history. I \nimplore my colleagues to heed the clear and persistent warnings that \nnature is giving us: to acknowledge the responsibility presented to us \nin this moment and to respond appropriately before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a week ago I visited with my colleagues \nabout the necessity of taking a closer look at the problems of Medicare \nand taking advantage of the opportunity we have now with the fiscal \ncliff debate, to bring attention to it because I do not think it was \ngetting enough attention.\n  There is no greater threat to America's growth and prosperity than \nour uncontrolled national debt. Currently, the country's debt exceeds \n$16 trillion. We face the so-called fiscal cliff that could send our \neconomy into another recession. In these difficult times, we are \nchallenged by the people we represent to find real solutions, not \nshort-term bandaids.\n  As we move forward, it is clear that we must discuss spending. I \nemphasize that word, ``spending.'' I know President Obama is \nhyperfocused on increasing taxes as part of his deficit reduction \nproposal. I think the election shows he is legitimate in doing that, \nbut he could have declared victory about 3 weeks ago. And in the 3 \nweeks since then he could have spent time talking about the expenditure \nside of the ledger because if we are going to be serious about reducing \nour debt, we must talk about spending--not sometime next year, not only \nafter we talk about taxes, we must talk about spending and talk about \nit now.\n  We need to have a thoughtful conversation that focuses on where \nFederal spending most calls for control and containment. That is the \npurpose of my charts today. That is the purpose of my remarks. We must \nhave a thoughtful conversation about where our Federal spending is \ntaking us. It is past time for the President to engage on health care \nentitlements with proposals that affect the long-term growth of health \ncare costs. I am going to try to dissect this issue into 3 divisions \nand point out where the problems are.\n\n  The first division I will do, as shown in this chart, is the total \ngovernment spending with everything except the interest on the national \ndebt. By the way, this chart is from the Congressional Budget Office. \nIt is not something I put together. It details, as I said, noninterest \nspending as a percentage of the gross domestic product.\n  We can see the percentages of GDP of health care, Social Security, \nand other noninterest spending. So we can see over the period of the \nnext 25 years fairly level noninterest spending. We can see that Social \nSecurity, even though it has funding problems over the next 25 years, \nis going to be fairly constant as well. But when we get to health care \ncosts, we can see a very dramatic rise. I suppose I should have had \nthis on bigger charts so it would be more dramatic than it shows.\n  So this is the problem I want to address today. The driver of the \ncost is health care. And even though this chart only goes out 25 years, \nthe board of trustees focuses 75 years ahead on Social Security and \nMedicare. So if this chart went out 75 years on Medicare, it would show \nabout a $40 trillion deficit.\n  So it is a very dramatic increase compared to other parts of Federal \nGovernment spending. I want you to look closely at these longer term \nprojections as I proceed with some other divisions of this problem and \nsegmenting the issue of health care, Medicare and Medicaid.\n  It is pretty clear that we must address the growth of health care as \nwell as entitlements. I do not think my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle can walk away from the issue. We should start by looking at \nwhere we are spending the most money in our health care entitlements.\n  This next chart that we will put up divides this into three \ncategories: Medicare-only health care costs, Medicaid-only health care \ncosts, and then what we call the duals. The duals are people who \nqualify for both Medicaid and Medicare.\n  The middle group, as I said dual eligible, account for just over 10 \npercent of the entire Medicare-Medicaid population. But we can see by \nthe chart that the amount of money that is spent on that 10 percent is \nmuch greater than either Medicare only or Medicaid only. When we talk \nabout the need to find ways to control spending for these dual \neligibles, it is for a good reason. They are poorer, they are sicker, \nand more often they are in need of more extensive, as well as \nexpensive, coordinated care.\n\n[[Page S7780]]\n\n  The inefficiency created in the misaligned incentives of Medicare and \nMedicaid is frequently cited as one of the areas in health care in the \ngreatest need of improvement, not only for the quality of health care \nbut also maybe a better caretaker of the taxpayers' money.\n  ObamaCare created an office in CMS charged with creating \ndemonstration projects to allow for greater coordination of dual \neligibles. Those demonstration projects have been moving forward at \nbreakneck pace, with nearly half of the States looking to participate. \nEssentially, all demonstrations under ObamaCare seek to give States \ngreater control of the acute care of the dual eligibles--in other \nwords, of this group here. CMS has the incredibly broad legal authority \nunder ObamaCare to take these demonstrations nationally if they are \nsuccessful.\n  No one argues that the way Medicare and Medicaid coordinate the dual \neligibles works very well. The coordination today is akin to asking me \nand somebody else to compose a letter with the other person writing the \nconsonants and my writing the vowels. Giving the States greater control \nover duals may be a good answer. Some States might do a good job.\n  But when we consider the fiscal challenges faced by the States, this \nshould be a decision considered by Congress examining all possible \nalternatives and in consultation with States rather than something \noccurring through this regulatory action that we are seeing under \nObamaCare and what CMS is doing with those demonstration projects.\n  Furthermore, moving more responsibility to the States may miss a real \nopportunity to address an even larger cost problem. While some dual \neligibles are expensive and need extensive long-term support and \nservices, there are dual eligibles who, in fact, are relatively low \ncost. More importantly, though, is that not all the expensive Medicare \nbeneficiaries are dually eligible.\n  Take a look at this chart. In this chart we see the most expensive \nindividuals in the Medicare Program.\n  These are beneficiaries who have multiple, chronic conditions and \nfunctional impairments. Fifty-seven percent of them are eligible for \nMedicare only, and 43 percent of them are dually eligible for Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  We have numerous studies showing that the care for high-cost, \nMedicare-only beneficiaries is just as complex, and the quality of care \ncalls for as much attention as that of the dual-eligibles.\n  So, then, legitimately ask the question of, Why are we splitting \nthese two groups? These are two groups of similarly situated \nindividuals. They all have need for improved care. They all have \nmultiple conditions that are very expensive. Why do we tell some \npeople: You get Medicare solely because you have income--income that \ndoesn't qualify for Medicaid--and then we tell some people: You should \nget Medicaid solely because you don't have enough income. Why is it a \ngood idea to give States control of poor beneficiaries? Why should low-\nincome beneficiaries get one of 50 different models to coordinate their \ncare and people with higher incomes get Medicare only? Why is CMS \npushing States to take a greater role with a complex, expensive \npopulation when they are also being asked to find the resources to \ncover poor individuals in Medicaid and develop exchanges to cover \npeople in the private market?\n  Congress should consider what States should do in health care and \nwhat are reasonable expectations in those States. Congress should \ninvolve States in this conversation. If Congress wants States to \nadminister benefits for the aged, the blind, the disabled, and low-\nincome individuals, along with managing the exchanges for individuals \nwith incomes over or up to 400 percent of poverty, Congress can do so.\n  If health care is the primary responsibility of States, it is because \nof decisions made by this Congress. States are being asked to do so \nmuch in health care while also overseeing education, public safety, \nroads, bridges, and meet, in most cases, a balanced budget requirement.\n  So I think Congress needs to step back and ask where the States are \nbest able to focus on health care. We should ask States.\n  When we look at the long-term spending growth of our health care \nentitlement, we should use this as an opportunity to reconsider the \nrole of the States in providing health care coverage. What we ask of \nthe States should be thoughtfully considered in any discussion.\n  I know there are people telling us we shouldn't talk about health \ncare entitlements now. President Obama hasn't come to the table yet on \nthis issue. We don't have a choice. All you have to do is look at the \nnumbers I have given you. Look at the spending. We only make the \nproblem worse by putting it off.\n  We can save Federal dollars by extracting more from beneficiaries, \nproviders, and States, but that is not going to do the same thing we \nneed to do when we talk about health care changes. It is the very same \nthing we went through when Obamacare was being considered by a \nbipartisan group.\n  We need to do things to change the long-term growth curve of Medicare \nand Medicaid costs generally. That needs to be done right now. We need \nto talk about solutions to actually lower the growth curve and do it \nsooner than later.\n  We are $16 trillion in debt. One of every $4 we will spend in this \nnext decade will be on Medicare and Medicaid. When you get further down \nthe road than 10 years, it is going to grow even more dramatically. We \nwill see health care entitlements double as a percentage of GDP in the \nnext 25 years. I said the trustees look ahead 75 years, and it is even \na bigger problem 75 years out.\n  If we want Medicare and Medicaid to not only survive--and I do--but \nalso to thrive for the next generation, we need to be willing to ask \nfundamental questions and seek solutions that can affect the growth \ncurve. I sincerely hope we are able to look for solutions that can make \na real difference.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take this time to share the views of \nmany people who I have talked to in Maryland, and I am sure the same \nhas been said in Oregon and around the Nation. People are frustrated by \nthe inability of Congress to come together on solving the so-called \nfiscal cliff. We understand this needs to be avoided. Going off the \nfiscal cliff could cause major damage to our economy.\n  If we take no action by January 1, as I am sure most people are now \naware, tax rates will revert back to the pre-Bush tax rates. The \nalternative minimum tax that shields tens of millions of Americans from \npaying extra income taxes will expire and tens of millions of Americans \nwill be subject to extra taxes. The unemployment insurance program, the \nextended benefit program, will come to a halt. The payroll tax holiday \nwill end, and individuals' take-home pay will be reduced. We would have \na serious problem on Medicare reimbursement to our physicians. They \nwould be subjected to a significant cut, close to 30 percent, which \nwould have an impact on seniors and our disabled population having \naccess to physician care, and we would go through what is known as \nsequestration, which is across-the-board cuts to almost all Federal \nprograms, ranging from 8 percent to about 10 percent. That would have a \nmajor impact on our entire country. We have looked at the numbers in \nMaryland, and it could mean as many as 60,000 jobs lost in our own \nState of Maryland. We have a large Federal workforce, with 5.6 percent \nof our workers working for the Federal Government. That type of across-\nthe-board cut would have an incredibly negative impact on the people of \nMaryland and throughout the entire country.\n  We have to avoid that. The impact on our economy is estimated to be \nabout 3 percent. We would go from a positive growth to a negative \ngrowth, throwing us into a recession. I understand the\n\n[[Page S7781]]\n\nfrustration of why so close to the end of the year we haven't resolved \nthese issues. We should have resolved them. We should come together, \nwork together to get it done. But I want to point out to the people I \nrepresent in Maryland and to the people of this Nation that we have to \nget this done right. There is a lot at stake.\n  We have to make sure our country can grow, that we can create the \njobs we need to be competitive in the future. We must make sure we deal \nwith this budget crisis in a way that allows us to invest in education, \nin job training and in rebuilding our highways, our bridges, and our \nenergy grids. We have to make sure we can compete as a nation. That is \nwhy so many of us have said we have to have a balanced approach to \ndealing with the fiscal cliff.\n  This morning, I listened to Speaker Boehner say the ball is in the \nPresident's court. I couldn't disagree more with the Speaker of the \nHouse. I think it is important to point out that since we have been \nworking on trying to deal with this deficit issue, we have already \nagreed to over $1 trillion in spending cuts--in discretionary domestic \nspending--in some of the most challenging areas that affect our most \nvulnerable people. We have implemented that, and this is since the \nrecommendations of the Simpson-Bowles Commission came out. We took \naction and we imposed caps on discretionary domestic spending.\n  Our Federal workforce has been through years, a couple years of pay \nfreezes. We have seen programs that have been cut back and the support \nthey give to people who need help. We have already contributed on the \nspending side. Is it enough? No. Do we need to do more? Absolutely. But \nwe have done that.\n  The next piece that must be done is the revenue piece. We can't have \na balanced approach unless we have the revenues. So many of my \ncolleagues have talked about this. Historically, our revenues are \naround 20 percent of our economy. They are now in the 15-percent range.\n  We have a way to do this. The Senate has come together on a way to do \nthis. The Senate passed legislation that has been in the House of \nRepresentatives where Speaker Boehner is the Speaker of the House. It \nhas been in the House now for months. What that legislation does, \nfirst, it gives predictability to the taxpayers of this country. It \nsays the first $250,000 of taxable income will be subject to the \ncurrent tax rates and will not go back to the pre-Bush tax rates. That \ngives certainty to the taxpayers in this country.\n  I have heard people say: That affects 98 percent of the taxpayers in \nthis country. You know what. It affects 100 percent of the taxpayers of \nthis country. I wish to stress that. If we pass the bill that was sent \nby the Senate to the House that continues in January the current tax \nrates for those with taxable incomes up to $250,000; yes, for the \ntypical taxpayer in Baltimore City earning $20,000 to $30,000 of \nincome, they will save $1,400 in taxes; and, yes, for a taxpayer \nearning $40,000 to $65,000 of taxable income, they will save $2,000. \nBut guess what. A person with $250,000 of taxable income will save \nabout $7,000; and if they earn $500,000 in taxable income, they will \nsave that same $7,000. If they earn $1 million of taxable income, they \nwill get that tax break also. It affects 100 percent of the taxpayers \nof this country.\n  What we are saying is we have to have some revenue in this equation. \nWe understand that. Those who are the most well off, do they truly \ndeserve larger tax breaks than that? I would suggest not.\n  It is not just the tax rates we sent over to the House of \nRepresentatives, we also corrected the marriage penalty so that \nwouldn't change on January 1, the child tax credit, and the AMT--the \nalternative minimum tax I mentioned earlier. As to the alternative \nminimum tax, if we don't correct that, tens of millions of Americans \nwill pay extra taxes in the thousands of dollars starting January 1.\n  I have heard many debates on the floor of the Senate and in the House \nwhere no one wants that to happen. Then pass the bill we sent over from \nthe Senate. If we do that, taxpayers don't have to worry about those \nrates going up and it gives them a little bit of confidence, hopefully, \nbefore Christmas, which would make the season a happier season for all.\n  This is a balanced approach. As I said before, we started with \nspending cuts. We have done that. The next step, Speaker Boehner has to \ndeal with the revenue side. If the House passes the Senate bill, it \nprovides about $850 billion in revenue from not extending additional \ntax relief for those whose incomes are above $250,000. I mentioned we \nalready did over $1 trillion of discretionary domestic spending cuts, \nwhich would give us $850 billion of revenue, and that is not enough. We \nare going to need more revenue. It is not going to be easy to find. But \nby closing loopholes, we can get some additional revenues. We have all \ntalked about tax reform. We can get some additional revenue from tax \nreform.\n\n  That brings us to additional savings, and we agree we can get \nadditional savings. I have taken to the floor and talked about the fact \nthat we are bringing our troops home from Afghanistan. I applaud the \nefforts of the chair to try to get those troops home sooner, and I \nagree with him. But our troops are coming home and our baseline budget \nreflects a much higher Active troop level than we need. It is called \nthe overseas contingency accounts. We know there are savings there that \ncan be achieved and we can use in that balanced approach to bring our \nbudget under better control.\n  Just as we have gone through base realignment and closures in the \nUnited States, we believe we can do that throughout the world and that \ncan also save us some money in the military budget. So there are \nmilitary savings that can be achieved.\n  Yes, we can and must achieve savings on the entitlement side. I was \nlistening to my friend from Iowa talking about the cost of health care. \nI agree with him. Health care costs have gone up too dramatically in \nthis country. We have to bring down the cost of health care. We started \ndoing that with the Affordable Care Act by investing in prevention--\npreventing readmissions to hospitals and dealing with high-cost \ninterventions. That will help us bring down the cost of health care. We \nhave to do more in that regard. If we bring down the cost of health \ncare, we save money in Medicare and Medicaid, and we save taxpayer \ncosts, but we also help our economy. What a lot of us are concerned \nabout is just trying to shift the cost to beneficiaries. That doesn't \nhelp our economy and that doesn't help solve the problem.\n  I take the floor now just to challenge Speaker Boehner and say to him \nit is time to act on the bill we sent over months ago. Let us take the \nnext step and let us work together and develop a framework so our \ncommittees can work and achieve policy changes that can bring in the \nadditional revenues we are going to need and the additional savings we \nknow we can achieve. We can do that working together.\n  I started by saying there are many people in our communities who are \nfrustrated we haven't gotten this done by now. I share that \nfrustration. We should have gotten this done a long time ago. I agree \nwith them. But let's now move this week with the House passing the \nSenate bill we sent them providing predictability for the taxpayers of \nthis country going into this holiday season. Let's reassure them that \nnext year their rates will not be increased, particularly in this \nfragile economy. Let's set up a framework where we can responsibly work \nto reduce health care costs--in greater amounts, I agree--reduce some \nmilitary spending, and do what is right in a real balanced approach to \nget our budget in better balance so our economy will grow and create \nthe jobs we need.\n  It is most important for us to have a climate where we can create \nmore jobs and the type of jobs we want--invest in education, \nconstruction, et cetera. That is what we need to do. That is where we \nneed to come together as Democrats and Republicans to get the job done. \nI urge my colleagues, let's work and get this done as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7781-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7781-S7782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Mr. President, one thing people admire about firefighters \nis that when others are running away from a burning building, they run \ntoward it. Conversely, while most people prudently avoid cliffs, \nPresident Obama and the congressional Democratic leadership are racing \nto go over the fiscal cliff ``Thelma and Louise'' style.\n  Absent action by Congress and leadership by the President, at the end \nof the year almost every Federal income tax payer in America will see \nan increase in their rates. Some will see a rate increase of 9 percent, \nwhile others will see a rate increase of 87 percent.\n  Although not often discussed--and although the President likes to \navoid discussing it--the impact of these rate hikes will have a \nuniquely damaging impact on small businesses and the jobs they provide. \nSmall businesses are the engine of job creation in our economy, and the \nrate hikes the President insists on will hit them hard, undermining \neconomic growth and hampering innovation and job creation. Whether we \ngo over the fiscal cliff or whether the President gets his way on \nraising rates, taxes will go up significantly on small businesses.\n  The President would like us to think that raising these taxes is no \nbig deal; it will just hit people who already have a lot of money and \nwho can ``afford to give a little more.'' As President Obama put it in \nusing his own finances as an example, absent tax increases, ``I'm able \nto keep hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional income that I \ndon't need . . . ''\n  With due respect, this is an amazingly naive understanding of tax \nrates and their impact on economic growth. It assumes that all the \npeople hit by these higher tax rates are wealthy wage earners, CEOs, \nand financiers. It completely negates the impact on small business \nincome that will be subject to these individual rate hikes.\n  Here we are at Christmastime and the Democrats want Santa to put coal \nin the socks of all the small businesspeople. Even President Obama \nacknowledges that two-thirds of the new jobs in our economy are created \nby small businesses. The vast majority of small businesses are \norganized as what we call flowthrough business entities, such as \npartnerships, S corporations, limited liability companies, and sole \nproprietorships. In other words, these small businesses pay the \nindividual income tax rates.\n  Because the vast majority of small businesses are flowthrough \nbusiness entities, the income from these businesses flows through the \nbusiness directly onto the small business owners' individual tax \nreturns. Therefore, any increase in individuals' tax rates means those \nsmall businesses get hit with a tax increase. This tax increase lands \non those small business owners even if they do not take one penny out \nof their business's profits and they put it all back in to be able to \nhire more people or to get more inventory or whatever that helps their \nbusiness along. Even if a small business reinvests all its income to \nhire more workers, pay the workers they already have, or purchase \nequipment, they will still get hit with this looming tax hike.\n  The President and those in his party who support these rate hikes owe \nit to the American people to explain why their proposal will not \nadversely impact small businesses and those who depend on them for \ntheir livelihoods because the data suggests the impact will be severe. \nThere is no question about that. Why can't we get the real facts here?\n  First, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 80 percent of \nthe revenue loss from extending the 2001 and 2003 tax relief provisions \nis found among those making less than $200,000 per year if single and \n$250,000 if married--the President's threshold.\n  Second, the nonpartisan official scorekeeper for Congress on tax \nissues, the Joint Committee on Taxation, tells us that 53 percent of \nall flowthrough business income would be subject to the President's \nproposed tax hikes. This is our Joint Committee on Taxation, which is a \nnonpartisan committee: 53 percent of all flowthrough business income is \nsubject to tax hikes on the top two rates.\n  Given the agreed-upon importance of small businesses to our economic \nrecovery, it is a mystery to me why the President and his Democratic \nallies would pursue tax increases on these job creators. We simply \ncannot afford to raise taxes on over half of all this small business \nincome.\n  President Obama and congressional Democrats defend their plan by \nclaiming that only 3 percent of small businesses would get hit with \nthis tax increase, so we should not fear raising taxes on them. \nHowever, they are misreading the Joint Committee on Taxation's letter \non this issue. That letter only talks about the percentage of taxpayers \naffected, not the percentage of businesses affected.\n  For instance, if 10 people own one business, President Obama and \ncongressional Democrats count that one business as 10 businesses when \nthey make their statement about a small percentage of businesses \naffected. Obviously, that is not the right way to look at this. The \ntruth is, they don't know what percentage of businesses they are \nproposing to raise taxes on and, what is worse, they don't seem to \ncare.\n  The IRS publishes its Statistics of Income Data on its Web site \nproviding the most recent available tax data, which is currently tax \nyear 2010. According to that official IRS data, when looking at the \nentire United States, 21 percent of owners of S corporations and \npartnerships, including limited liability companies, make $200,000 or \nmore.\n  Since President Obama's proposed rate hikes occur on singles making \n$200,000 or more and married couples making $250,000 or more, the vast \nmajority of this 21 percent would get hit with a tax increase. The only \nportion of this 21 percent of S corporation and partnership owners who \nwould not be hit with a tax hike are those who are married and make \nbetween $200,000 and $250,000.\n  According to a 2011 Ernst & Young study entitled ``The Flow-Through \nBusiness Sector and Tax Reform,'' citing 2007 data from the U.S. Census \nBureau, over 44 million workers employed by S corporations and \npartnerships, including limited liability companies--over 60 percent of \nthe 69 million employees who work for flowthrough businesses--are going \nto get hurt. So almost 21 percent of S corporations and partnership \nowners will be subject to the tax hikes on the top two rates, and over \n64 percent of the workers in flowthrough businesses are found in these \ntypes of businesses. This is before we even consider the impact on \nowners of sole proprietorships, which employ the remaining 36 percent \nof employees in the flowthrough sector.\n  When the Federal Government takes an additional 5 percent of the \nmoney that these small businesses earn, the effects are clear. Far from \nthis being--as the President suggests--money business owners don't \nneed, it will, in fact, lead to lost jobs, stagnant or reduced wages, \nand a decrease in investment.\n  The President campaigned on raising the top rates, and he seems bent \non doing so. But he owes it to the American families to come clean \nabout the impact these hikes will have on the economy and on jobs. He \nshould come clean and admit his desire for redistribution trumps all \nother considerations.\n  The debate over the fiscal cliff has been quite discouraging for me. \nThe President knows why it is that Republicans support full extension \nof current tax policy, and it is not because we are trying to defend \nthe so-called rich. It is because we have a genuine and empirically \ngrounded concern about the impact of marginal rate hikes on small \nbusinesses, the jobs they create, and the men, women, and families who \ndepend on them. I couldn't care less about the truly rich.\n  Instead of acknowledging that marginal rate hikes would have an \noutsized impact on small businesses, the President has decided instead \nto demagog this issue, paint Republicans as out of touch, and put \npolitical points ahead of\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\njobs. It is well past time for a grownup conversation about tax policy. \nOur door remains open, and we look forward to having the President walk \nthrough it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7783-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAJIKISTAN WTO ACCESSION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss a matter of great importance in the trade arena.\n  Last week, the Senate approved legislation granting permanent normal \ntrade relations to Russia and Moldova by a vote of 92 to 4. Such a \nstrong vote would not have been possible without bipartisan cooperation \nfrom my Senate colleagues. I would once again like to express my \nappreciation to all the Republican members of the Finance Committee who \nworked with me and my staff in good faith to develop a strong \nenforcement package which addresses many of the concerns we all have \nwith our bilateral trade relations with Russia.\n  I also want to again express my appreciation for the hard work and \ncooperation of Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee. \nThe process we undertook in the Finance Committee is emblematic of how \nthe Finance Committee should work. It is my sincere hope this will be a \nmodel for future legislation.\n  Unfortunately, things don't always work so smoothly. In fact, I was \nquite disturbed to receive a letter earlier this week from Ambassador \nKirk, our trade ambassador, informing me that the Obama administration \nintends to support approval of the proposed terms for Tajikistan's \naccession and the invitation for Tajikistan to become a member of the \nWTO at the upcoming WTO General Council meeting.\n  Let me be clear. I support efforts to help advance the rule of law by \nbringing countries such as Tajikistan into the World Trade \nOrganization. What disturbs me is that the administration had been \nnegotiating the WTO accession package for over 1 year and failed to \neven mention it to anyone on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Even more troubling is the fact that the final WTO working party \nmeeting took place on October 26, 2012, at which Tajikistan's proposed \nprotocol of accession was completed. Yet no one in the Senate received \nany information about the accession until last week. Why the Obama \nadministration waited 5 additional weeks after completing Tajikistan's \nWTO accession negotiations before notifying the committee is a mystery \nfor me.\n  For an administration that touts its commitment to transparency and \nunprecedented consultations with Congress, their failure to consult \nwith the Finance Committee and the Senate on the terms of Tajikistan's \nproposed accession protocol reveals that the administration's bold \npronouncements about their excellent consultations are nothing more \nthan empty rhetoric.\n  Moreover, section 122 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act requires \nthe administration to consult with the Senate Committee on Finance \nbefore any vote is taken by the WTO relating to the accession of a new \nmember. While sending a letter to the committee 1 mere week before a \nvote is taken in the WTO and after the terms of the accession are \nalready completed might technically comply with the letter of the law, \nit in no way complies with the spirit of the law.\n  Had Congress been notified of Tajikistan's pending invitation to join \nthe WTO earlier, it might have been possible to include provisions \ngranting Tajikistan permanent normal trade relations along with the \nRussia and Moldova bills. But that was not possible. Instead, the Obama \nadministration's lack of transparency and failure to meaningfully \nconsult with Congress rendered that impossible.\n  As we continue to try to work with the Obama administration to \ndevelop policies and advance legislation which create economic growth \nand open new markets for U.S. workers and job creators, the \nadministration must engage in meaningful consultations. Accordingly, I \nwould expect the way the Tajikistan accession has been handled by the \nObama administration will be an exception and not the norm regarding \nfuture consultations.\n  To help ensure that is the case, I will soon be sending a letter to \nthe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative with some detailed \nquestions regarding their consultations with Congress and the private \nsector trade advisory committees. It is vitally important that we bring \nmore transparency to this process, so I sincerely hope we receive a \ndetailed and substantive response soon.\n  I also hope we can soon begin to have a meaningful discussion with \nthe administration about their plans for renewing trade promotion \nauthority.\n  As most of my colleagues know, trade promotion authority is an \nimportant tool which helps us pry open foreign markets to U.S. exports. \nEvery President since FDR has sought trade promotion authority from \nCongress. Despite its critical importance, the administration keeps \nputting off any meaningful discussion of renewal. In fact, when \nAmbassador Kirk testified before the Finance Committee last March, I \noffered to sit down with him that day to start talking about TPA \nrenewal. He declined my offer. Instead, he simply said he would be \nhappy to sit down and talk with me and members of the Finance Committee \nabout TPA renewal ``at the appropriate time.''\n  Since that time, there has been no administration dialog with me or \nwith the Finance Committee about TPA, even though the Obama \nadministration intends to conclude the trans-Pacific partnership \nnegotiations by October of next year and is considering launching \nnegotiations for a free-trade agreement with the European Union as \nearly as next month.\n  Frankly, both of these initiatives are going to require TPA in order \nto be successful. While TPA should have been renewed long ago, we \ncurrently cannot wait any longer. If these trade initiatives are going \nto succeed we cannot continue to keep putting them off.\n  The time for the administration to start meaningful consultation with \nCongress on TPA renewal is now and I would like to see more \ncooperation. In this Congress we have seen the Korean Free Trade \nAgreement, we have seen the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, and we have \nseen the Panamanian Free Trade Agreement. We have seen the PNTR with \nRussia. Those would not have happened if we had not been pushing on the \nFinance Committee to get them done.\n  In my opinion, the administration has been slow-walking all of those. \nThose mean balance of trade positives for our companies here in America \nand I hate to see us playing around in deleterious ways with these \ntypes of agreements. I have suggested some other agreements here that \nneed to be entered into. We need to get real on international trade. We \nneed to be able to compete with anybody in this world, and we are able \nto if we are given the chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss \nlegislation we could actually pass. I am not talking about the fiscal \ncliff or sequester or anything quite so heavy, but nevertheless very \nimportant. It has bipartisan support, sort of, been passed out of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, passed out of the House of \nRepresentatives by over 300 votes, but it has yet to be brought to the \nSenate floor for debate. That debate could be over within a half hour.\n  The majority leader talks about bipartisan support for legislation \nand hurdles to bring the bipartisan legislation to the floor. Obviously \nwe have them. But I want to remind the Senate that this bill has \nalready passed the House, as I have said, with broad bipartisan support \nand, again, with over 300 votes. That does not happen often in the \nHouse of Representatives these days. It passed out of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee with bipartisan support. It did not even have to \nhave a hearing. Yet the majority leader has not allowed this bill to \ncome to the floor for a vote. I urge him to do that.\n  I am talking about H.R. 872. What is that? That is the Reducing \nRegulatory Burdens Act of 2011. How could anybody be opposed to that? \nIt has been pending before the Senate for 17 months. That is long \nenough. That is certainly long overdue. This bill was placed on the \nSenate Calendar on June 21 in 2011. We need to pass this bill. We\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\nneed to debate it very quickly and pass this bill. It is a short bill \nbut it is very critical to address a court decision that endangers the \npublic health and places additional paperwork burdens on States that \nare facing very difficult budget times.\n  Let me be clear. This is a pesticide safety bill, pesticides that are \nused to protect our crops and to protect our public safety. I am not \nsaying, nobody is saying, nobody ever will say, pesticides should never \nbe regulated. I just do not think it needs to be done twice. H.R. 872 \ndoes not alter pesticide regulation. Pesticide applications are subject \nto the terms that are printed on a product label as approved by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It is against the law to apply \npesticides in a manner that does not comply with the EPA's approval.\n  Last December, 25 of our colleagues wrote to our majority leader and \nour Republican leader requesting an open debate on H.R. 872, a \nbipartisan bill. I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the letter \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Despite bipartisan requests for consideration, the bill \nfailed to be considered before regulatory requirements went into effect \nlast year. We are already seeing costs to States, to communities, and \nto businesses that total up millions of dollars. Regulations now in \neffect are duplicative--a Senate word, a 35-cent word. That means we do \nnot need it. We already have a bill in place. We already have \nregulation in place. This regulation requires businesses to undertake \nwhat amounts to a paperwork exercise. These requirements can slow \nresponses to real public health crises such as West Nile virus.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report over 5,000 \ncases of West Nile virus this year and sadly over 230 deaths. That is \nnot right. Pesticide applications are currently and should continue to \nbe regulated under FIFRA, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and \nRodenticide Act. This bill does what all of our constituents are \ntelling us to do and that is to protect human health and eliminate \nduplicative, unnecessary regulatory actions.\n  The additional paperwork and permitting processes that States and \npesticide applicators must undertake provide no additional \nenvironmental protection, zip, zero. It is just additional \nenvironmental review. The EPA estimates that approximately 365,000 \npesticide applicators will need permits to cover about 5.6 million \napplications per year. Public health officials, farmers, other \npesticide applicators under this regulatory impact would not be facing \nthese requirements if the administration had chosen to vigorously \ndefend its longstanding policy that the protections under the Federal \npesticide law were sufficient to protect the environment.\n  Again, estimates suggest this duplicative regulation will require \n365,000 individuals--a requirement that will cost $50 million and \nrequire 1 million hours per year to implement--just to fill out the \npaperwork. Bottom line, it will not add any environmental protection. \nThis layer of redtape will place a huge financial burden on the \nshoulders of cities, of counties, farm families all across the country \nas well as State governments responsible for enforcement while at the \nsame time facing dire budget situations.\n  Beyond agency enforcement, they will also now be exposed to the \nthreat of litigation under the clean water law's citizen suit \nprovisions. I think you have the real key as to where this bill was \nheaded. Some of you might say there are special exemptions for public \nhealth emergencies, but environmental groups are challenging emergency \nactions taken this summer to address the mosquito-borne illnesses such \nas eastern equine encephalitis--not something to take an action against \nif you are faced with one of these kinds of threats. Yet we have not \nbeen able to move H.R. 872, to come up for a vote despite clear \nbipartisan support.\n  It seems to me Congress must act to end this regulatory duplication \nand clarify that they do not need this additional burden when they are \ntrying to prioritize staffing and resources.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to protect \nhuman health and put an end to this very costly regulation. With regard \nto the bill again, it is 872, passed the House by over 300 votes, \nbipartisan support in the Agriculture Committee, didn't even have to \nhave a hearing. Let's move this bill. It is something we can do. It \nmakes sense.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We request your \n     leadership in helping to resolve the following issue at the \n     earliest possible opportunity.\n       As you are aware, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     recently finalized its Pesticide General Permit (PGP) under \n     the Clean Water Act (CWA), pursuant to a ruling by the Court \n     of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in National Cotton Council v. \n     EPA. Under this new permitting system, certain pesticide \n     applicators will be required to meet PGP or other permitting \n     requirements in addition to regulation under the Federal \n     Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.\n       On March 31, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 872, \n     the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2011, which would \n     address National Cotton Council v. EPA.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to give some \nperspective on the debate going on in Washington about the so-called \nfiscal cliff. The so-called fiscal cliff is a misnomer, but what it \nreflects is the concern that unless we act our economy is going to be \nhit by significant austerity in 2013. Not at 12:01 on January 1, but \nover the course of the year. So it is not a cliff, it is more like if \nwe do not do something we are going to start on a slope. But we are not \nfalling off any cliff at 12:01 on January 1.\n  Fortunately there is an easy way to address one of the major parts of \nthis puzzle. The Senate earlier this year passed a tax relief bill for \nthe middle class. It would extend for 1 full year all of the Bush-era \ntax cuts on middle-class families. That is sitting in front of the \nHouse of Representatives. President Obama has said, If they pick it up \nand pass it tomorrow I will put my pen to it immediately. That is one \nthing that could be done right now. But the House Republicans will not \ntake it up. I say if they were to take it up today, pass it, the \nPresident signs it, I think you are going to see a lot of middle-class \nfamilies maybe even do a little bit more Christmas shopping because \nthey know their taxes are not going up next year and that will help \nspur our economy.\n  Again, I point out some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, \nhere and in the House, have been talking about doing that very thing. \nSo there are some Republicans who recognize that this would be one of \nthe best things we can do, and that is pass the middle-class tax cut \nthat we passed here in July.\n  Nonetheless, I keep hearing what we really need to do to address the \nso-called fiscal cliff is to enact significant entitlement reform. What \ndoes that mean, entitlement reform? Let's be upfront with the American \npeople. When you hear our friends the Republicans\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\nand others talk about entitlement reform, they are talking about three \nthings: cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, and cutting \nMedicaid. That is it. That is what they are talking about.\n  For example, let's take a look at Social Security. It has become an \narticle of faith, almost, among a lot of people around this city that \none of the ways to reduce the national debt is to ``reform Social \nSecurity.''\n  That is really fishy because Social Security can pay full benefits, \n100 percent, until 2033, and by law it is not allowed to add to the \ndeficit or debt. So, therefore, it is not driving our long-term debt.\n  What is really going on here? I think one of the ways to figure it \nout is a close look at the proposals under consideration. If you look \nclosely you will find almost all of these serious proposals to save \nSocial Security purport to do so by cutting it.\n  For instance, one proposal is to raise the retirement age so that \nhard-working Americans, including nurses, cashiers, carpenters, \nmechanics, truckdrivers, have to work even longer before they can \nretire with full benefits.\n  I remind people we already raised the retirement age. We did that in \nthe 1980s, from 65 to 67. That is being phased in right now. The \nBowles-Simpson Commission, what did they want to do? They wanted to \nraise it to 69. I remind people that life expectancy at age 65--that is \nthe amount of time you are going to live after you reach 65--has not \ngrown equally among all Americans. Not surprisingly, higher income \nAmericans have seen much larger gains in life expectancy after 65 than \nlow- and moderate-income families. So you raise the retirement age for \nSocial Security, you help those who have money and you hurt those who \ndo not. That is exactly what it is. You hurt low- and moderate-income \nAmericans who work at some of the most physically demanding jobs in our \neconomy. It hits them the hardest. So we can dismiss that.\n  I was looking at the list of people proposing that we raise the \nretirement age--Bowles-Simpson; the Third Way; Lloyd Blankfein--CEO of \nGoldman Sachs, how about that--Senator Coburn, the American Enterprise \nInstitute, Cato Institute, Republican Study Committee. Oh, yes, the \nRyan budget, by the way. We know what the voters of America thought \nabout that Ryan budget.\n  Anyway, there is a whole list of people there who are saying we have \nto raise the retirement age. Let's see what kinds of jobs they have, \nwhat kind of work they do during their lifetime.\n  Another proposal we have heard about to kind of ``fix'' Social \nSecurity is to base future cost-of-living adjustments, the COLAs, on \nthe so-called chained CPI. That is a phrase you are hearing more and \nmore of. What it does is basically it reduces annual cost-of-living \nadjustments. It is nothing more than a benefit cut by using a \nmeasurement of inflation that reflects the costs faced by seniors even \nmore poorly than the current measurement. In terms of take-home \nbenefits for an individual beneficiary, the chained CPI will result in \na benefit cut of $136 per year for a 65-year-old. However, because of \nthe compounding, the benefit cut would increase to an average of $560 \nper year less for a 75-year-old retiree. That is a severe benefit cut, \nparticularly for the oldest Americans who are the most likely to have \ngone through all their own retirement savings and must rely totally on \nSocial Security. Furthermore, the chained CPI is simply not a more \naccurate way to measure inflation. Rather, it more accurately measures \nthe degree to which people are reducing their costs and as a result it \ncan mask big changes in the quality of life for Americans.\n\n  I have talked to people in town meetings about chained CPI. If an \nelderly person is on Social Security and due to heating costs or \nperhaps some medical bills that person's budget is pretty tight, \ninstead of buying beef for dinner, he decides to buy chicken. This \ndecreases his costs a little bit. Chained CPI would look at that and \nsay that since his costs have gone down, we should reduce his COLA. Now \nthat his COLA is reduced, he is sort of locked in there. Now his budget \nis a little tighter so he decides to go to beans. In this scenario, he \nhas gone from beef to chicken and is now eating beans. The chained CPI \nsaid his costs went down further so we will reduce his COLA even more. \nPretty soon he is reduced to drinking warm water for soup and the COLA \nkeeps going down even more. That is what the chained CPI does to an \nelderly person.\n  Don't be fooled by a fancy CPI. Chained CPI is akin to being on a \nboat and you have to swim to shore and someone puts a big log chain \naround your ankle and tells you to swim. It is going to drag you to the \nbottom. Chained CPI chains you and drags you down.\n  There are long-term challenges confronting the Social Security \nsystem, and we know that. The baby boomers are retiring and we have \nfewer workers contributing to the system. Fortunately, we knew this has \nbeen coming for decades, and that is why we have the trust fund in the \nfirst place. The trust fund pays 100 percent of the benefits until \n2033. What happens in 2033? A lot of people say Social Security is \ngoing to go belly-up. No, it doesn't. Unless changes are made, the \nSocial Security trust fund will pay out 75 percent of anticipated \nbenefits in 2033. What happens if we reduce unemployment? What if we \nreduce unemployment from its present 7.7 percent down to 4 percent? \nGuess what. That 2033 now goes up because there are more working people \npaying into the system.\n  So one of the best ways to fix Social Security is to get jobs back \nfor people in this country. That is why those of us who are committed \nto honestly strengthening Social Security will resist any effort to cut \nSocial Security and are saying, no, don't make it any part of a grand \nbargain. It should have no part of it whatsoever. There are approaches \nthat can strengthen Social Security. To do so, I introduced legislation \nearlier this year that would provide seniors with greater economic \nsecurity.\n  My proposal does it three ways. First, we actually raise the amount \nof Social Security that people get by $65 a month. Some might ask how \ncan that save money. I thought we were supposed to cut benefits not \nincrease them. I say there is a way. We can increase it by $65 a month. \nOthers might say that to an upper income person, $65 is not much. To \nsome who have paid in the minimum amount to Social Security, they have \nhad minimum-wage-type jobs most of their lives, so $65 a month over 1 \nyear can be quite a bit.\n  Secondly, my proposal ensures that COLAs better reflect the cost of \nliving for seniors than what we presently do right now, and we \ncertainly don't do chain CPI.\n  Finally, how do we do this? By applying the payroll tax to every \ndollar of eligible earnings by removing the so-called wage cap. We \ndon't do it over 1 year; we phase it in over 10 years. For the life of \nme, I have never been able to understand why it is equitable for \nsomeone who is making $50,000 a year to pay their payroll taxes on \nevery $1 they earn, but for someone who is making $500,000 a year, they \nonly pay payroll taxes on the first 20 cents of every $1 they earn. The \nrest of the 80 cents they pay no payroll taxes on.\n  We talked about this for a long time and we have never done it. It is \ntime to remove the wage cap which will allow us to pay $65 more per \nmonth per person. According to the actuaries of Social Security, the \n100-percent benefit that would expire in 2033 goes to 75 percent and \nwould be extended beyond 2050. Just by doing that, we will extend the \nlife past 2050, pay $65 more a month per person, and make it fair for \neveryone by ensuring that everyone pays into the trust fund on every $1 \nthey earn. These are the kind of changes we should consider as part of \nany effort to reform Social Security. Regrettably, I don't hear from \nthose who want to put Social Security on the table as part of a debt \nreduction package calling for these type of reforms. They want to just \ncut benefits, that is all.\n  As we work to resolve the fiscal cliff on our long-term deficits, our \ncore principle should be that we need a resolution that is good for the \nmiddle class, and that starts with strengthening and protecting \nprograms such as Social Security. It also means we should take this \nopportunity to continue to support hard-working families and create \njobs, particularly through programs such as infrastructure investment. \nWe should also continue to provide help, such as\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\nthe middle-class tax cut, to working Americans by giving them more \nmoney to put in their pocket to spend and drive the economy forward.\n  However, we must not continue the payroll tax cut of the last 2 years \nbecause of the threat it poses to the integrity of Social Security. Two \nyears ago, to help middle-class families through tough times, we \nreduced the amount they paid into Social Security by 2 percent, from \n6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. In order to make up for that, we put money \nfrom the general fund into the Social Security trust fund. It is the \nfirst time we have ever done that. I said it was wrong, and I still say \nit is wrong. We then extended it for 1 year until the end of this year. \nI thought that would be the end of it. Now I am hearing voices say we \nought to extend this payroll tax cut.\n  Two of the critical strengths of Social Security are that it is \nuniversal and it is self-funded. No dollar paid in benefits comes from \nany source other than the payroll tax. As such, Social Security does \nnot add one dime to our deficit. Again, that fact alone is a strong \nargument for those of us defending Social Security from misguided \nattempts to cut the system in the name of deficit reduction.\n\n  I have often argued that Social Security doesn't add one dime to the \ndeficit. It never has. However, if we are taking money out of the \ngeneral fund, which we know is borrowed money, and we are putting that \ninto the trust fund, then the trust fund is now taking money that is \nborrowed. No longer can we say every dime paid out of that is from the \npayroll tax since it is coming from the general fund. I think we made a \nmistake 1 year ago by extending it. Now it is the time to end it. It \nmust not be extended. I, for one, will do whatever I can as a Senator \nto stop the extension of the payroll tax cut in order to help solve the \ndeficit and in order to help middle-class families.\n  How can we help middle-class families? It is very easy. First of all, \npass the tax cut extension that we have sitting before the House. \nSecondly, rather than cutting payroll taxes by 2 percent, we should put \nin place a modified version of the Making Work Pay tax credit that we \ndid under the American Recovery Reinvestment Act. That credit provided \nworking Americans with $400 per person, $800 per couple in 2009 and in \n2010. We can adjust that credit and double it to $1,600 per couple to \nreplace the payroll tax cut. So as we put the 2 percent back to where \neveryone pays back in at 6.2 percent, what we do on the other side is \nprovide for a Making Work Pay tax credit that goes to people who are \nworking. Obviously, no one gets the 2-percent payroll tax cut if they \nare not working. The Making Work Pay tax credit would also go to those \nwho are working and make it a similar amount of money as they had on \nthe Social Security payroll tax fund. This would have a greater bang \nfor the buck because it would better target working Americans of modest \nmeans who tend to spend more of what they get back.\n  I will clarify what I mean by that. Under the Social Security payroll \ntax cut--the 2-percent cut--the maximum amount of money someone would \nget would be at the highest level they paid into Social Security, which \nis approximately $110,000 on a payroll of $110,000. So that person \nwould get $2,200 back. That is for someone making at least $110,000 a \nyear. If someone is making $20,000 a year, they would only get $400 \nback. So the higher your income, the more they get back; the lower the \nincome, the less they get back. It is just topsy-turvy. It should be \nthe other way around. There should be more benefits to lower income and \nless benefits to higher income.\n  With this tax credit, that is what we do. More would go to people who \nare making $40,000, $50,000 $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 a year than to \nthose higher income people. That is why the Making Work Pay tax credit \nis much better than extending the Social Security payroll tax.\n  We are at a turning point in our economy. We can either move forward \nwith an agenda that will strengthen the middle class or be dragged \nbackward by misguided policies that consign us to additional decades of \nunequal growth and stagnant wages for working families.\n  I stand ready to work with my Senate colleagues to reduce the deficit \nand debt but not at the expense of hard-working, middle-class families \nwho make this country the great country it is.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to address a critical \nissue for Oregon's farmers and ranchers.\n  If we turn the clock back from the most recent national disaster; \nthat is, this terrible Hurricane Sandy that impacted New York and New \nJersey and other areas, last summer we had another significant \ndisaster, the worst wildfires to hit the State of Oregon since the \n1800s and the worst wildfires in over a century. These wildfires \ndevastated land and livestock. Yet our communities have been left \nstranded, without the protections they normally have, because of the \ninaction of the House and the Senate.\n  The Long Draw Fire in Malheur County burned 557,000 acres. Let's \ntranslate that. That is 900 square miles of land. The Miller Homestead \nFire burned 160,000 acres or 250 square miles.\n  We have had many folks coming to the floor to discuss the terrible \nconsequences of natural disasters. It was not long ago that I was on \nthis floor, before Hurricane Sandy, calling for urgent, immediate \naction. But the challenge is that these emergency programs designed to \nrespond to the ranchers and farmers who have lost so much land, so much \nforage in Oregon, those measures are in the farm bill.\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\n  Never before has the farm bill been unfinished, unaddressed, while \nCongress took their month-long break in August. Yet there it is. We \ncame back and here we are and we still have no action from the House. \nWe can't have a conference committee because the House hasn't acted. We \ncan't address the changes in the House bill because the House hasn't \nacted. And who is paying the price? Farmers and ranchers, devastated by \nthe worst wildfires in over 100 years.\n\n  Now, let me be clear. I would prefer that we pass the farm bill. But \nwe have not. And we cannot control what the other Chamber is doing. If \nwe do not get these key disaster relief programs, ranchers and farmers \nwho have lost livestock or grazing land in these wildfires will be left \nwith few options. That is wrong. A rancher in southeast Oregon who has \nalready been devastated by the wildfire should not pay the price \nbecause the U.S. House of Representatives will not bring the farm bill \nto the floor. There are farmers all across the country who have been \nhit hard by drought. They, too, are held hostage. They need disaster \nassistance.\n  Well, very soon we are going to be talking about a very substantial \ndisaster bill, and it is appropriate that we will be doing so. I will \nbe supporting it because the devastation that has been wrought in \nStates such as New Jersey and New York is exceptional, and we as a \nnation need to hold hands with the citizens of these States. We need to \nhelp them restore their lives and rebuild. But we need to hold hands in \npartnership with the ranchers and farmers in Oregon who have been \ndevastated by these wildfires as well.\n  So if the House has not acted on the farm bill when we come to this \nfloor to address relief for those impacted by Hurricane Sandy, then I \nam going to ask all my colleagues to work with me in the same \npartnership in which we supported folks in the South after Katrina, the \nsame partnership we will have in supporting the folks in the Northeast \ndue to the consequences of Hurricane Sandy, to support the ranchers and \nfarmers of Oregon who have been so devastated by these worst ever \nfires.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I defer to the lovely lady from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to comment about some wonderful \nmen in the Senate who are retiring on both sides of the aisle. Earlier \ntoday I spoke about my deep affection and sorry-to-see-go friends \nOlympia Snowe and Kay Bailey Hutchison, but I want to rise as the dean \nof the women in the Senate to say some very special words about very \nspecial men on both sides of the aisle. Because when I came to the \nSenate, it was only Nancy Kassebaum and myself, and yet we worked on so \nmany issues together. There are really wonderful men here who supported \nme, supported our issues, but really stood up for those States and \ntheir communities.\n\n\n                              Danny Akaka\n\n  I want to say goodbye, aloha, to my very good friend Danny Akaka, a \nwonderful man with whom I have served in both the House and the Senate. \nHe has been a real advocate not only for the people of Hawaii but, wow, \nthe way he stood up for the Federal workforce, the civil servants who \ndo such a great job, the outstanding job he has done on the Veterans' \nCommittee.\n  Lives are better off, particularly for our veterans. I want to say a \nwonderful goodbye and give a hug to him because he demonstrates that \nyou do not have to be loud to be powerful.\n\n\n                               Dick Lugar\n\n  I also wish to pay tribute to someone on the other side of the aisle, \nmy very good friend and someone I admire tremendously, Senator Dick \nLugar from Indiana. Who does not admire Senator Lugar, a gentleman, a \nscholar, I might even add a Rhodes Scholar, a definite advocate for \nIndiana, an incredible thought leader on foreign policy.\n  I am so proud of him and the work he did and the way he reached \nacross the aisle to work with our colleague Senator Sam Nunn on their \nfamous Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. They truly \nworked together to begin to end the threat of weapons of mass \ndestruction in the former Soviet Union and made the world a better and \nsafer place.\n  We want to wish Senator Lugar a fond farewell and let him know he \nwill be deeply missed. I certainly will miss him. I valued his thought, \nhis counsel, his observations, particularly in the area of foreign \npolicy. He taught me a little bit about foreign policy too.\n\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  I also want to say a goodbye to our friend Jeff Bingaman of New \nMexico, someone who has also brought intellectual rigor, a lawyer's \ninsistence on thoroughness, and a real commitment to people. It has \nbeen an honor and a pleasure to work with him on the HELP Committee, \nespecially on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud to support all that \nhe did, particularly in developing and focusing on the health workforce \nfor the future.\n  I knew I could count on Jeff in the committee and on the floor as one \nof those men whom I refer to as a Gallahad, where men of quality always \nsupported us women as we sought equality. Our initiatives to end \ndiscrimination against women in health care and in the workplace were \nsome of our proudest achievements in working together.\n\n\n                                Jon Kyl\n\n  I also wish to comment about Jon Kyl. I have worked across the aisle \nfrom Jon Kyl and I have been seated across the table from him at \neverything from Bible study groups to the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. We studied the words of the Bible together to make ourselves \nbetter, and we worked in our committees to make the world better.\n  We lived through September 11 and the terrible attacks that occurred \nin our country and the anthrax attacks in our offices. With his steady \nleadership, his resourceful mind, his can-do know-how, we worked \ntogether to get the job done. I was delighted to be able to work with \nhim in a way that called forth our highest and better selves to look \nout for our country. I wish him the best in his journey.\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  I wish to comment too about Kent Conrad. Wow, what a numbers guy. \nThose charts--I loved those charts. But we have many other things in \ncommon besides a love of charts. We love baseball. We love the \nBaltimore Orioles and, I might add, an occasional polka at Blob's Beer \nGarden in Maryland. Now you know Kent. He looks like Clark Kent. And he \nis a Superman when it comes to the budget. But, wow, when they played \n``Roll Out the Barrel,'' he was quite a hoofer.\n  Most of all, what I admired about him is the way he breathed life \ninto the numbers. He not only wanted a more frugal government, but he \nwas also passionate and compassionate about how we could use the power \nof the purse to improve the world and at the same time maintain \nsensible spending standards.\n  I am going to look forward to seeing him with or without his charts \nand maybe in a dugout.\n\n\n                               Ben Nelson\n\n  I wish also to say goodbye to Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a brother \nappropriator. We salute him for his work for the people of Nebraska and \nthe Nation. Using those committee assignments on Appropriations, \nAgriculture, and Armed Services, he looked out for rural communities \nand he stood up for men and women in the military. I knew he took it as \na personal responsibility, the issues around personnel for our \nmilitary, that they had the right pay, the right equipment, and we \nprotected their benefits.\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  A comment about Herb Kohl, another brother appropriator, the very \nessence of civility. He brought a businessman's savvy with a deep \ncompassion and commitment to the people of Wisconsin. Now we all know \nthe Kohl family. They own basketball teams, they own department stores. \nI tell you,\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\nthat Herb, he understood retail, whether it was in politics fighting \nfor the people and their day-to-day needs or the national policy of \nlooking out for working families as they build their lives. He stood up \nfor Wisconsin cheese, the Green Bay Packers, his basketball team. But \nmost of all, he stood up for the people. With Herb, what a sense of \nhonor. His handshake was always good. You could count on him. It was a \nbinding contract.\n\n\n                              Scott Brown\n\n  I wish also to say a word about Senator Scott Brown. Many of you know \nthat I was a social worker and a child abuse worker. I want to say \npersonally, I so admire Senator Brown's candor and being forthcoming \nwhen he shared with the world his own child abuse experience in his \nbook, ``Against All Odds.'' He not only experienced the terrible thing \nthat happened to him, but he went on to talk about how he handled this \nterrible tragedy. I must say, I compliment him. It was a model, that as \na young boy this terrible event would not hold him back. I am sure his \npowerful words helped many others come into the light. As a former \nchild abuse social worker, I want to thank him publicly for what he has \ndone not only in this institution but to help other boys--and even \ngirls--who also faced a terrible tragedy and refused to be a victim but \nwent on to do well. I wish him well.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Senator Jim Webb, the Senate's own marine and former Secretary of the \nNavy, I have known him for more than 20 years, since he was Secretary \nof the Navy under Ronald Reagan. Well, in the beginning we fought on \nmany issues, particularly gender equality. When Senator Webb was the \nnew Secretary of the Navy and I was a new Senator, we had a different \nview on where women should be in the military, and we duked it out. But \nyou know what. Over the years we came to know each other, respect each \nother, and appreciate each other's views. I so appreciate the fact that \nhe is an unabashed, unrelenting fierce fighter for our men and women in \nuniform, fighting for them when they are on the front lines and when \nthey return to the homefront.\n  I am so proud of the fact that I could vote for the 21st century GI \nbill for those serving in the military, to make sure that when they are \non the front line, they get the education here so they will not be on \nthe unemployment line. His bill was the most significant legislation \nfor veterans since World War II. So I say to Senator Webb, semper fi, \nand God bless you.\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Then to my good friend, Joe Lieberman--my friend Joe, a true \nIndependent. We have worked together on issues related to the Middle \nEast and the safety and security of Israel. We worked to bring \ncharacter education into our schools because we do believe that \ncharacter counts.\n  Working with Joe--whether it was to help create national service, \nmove national legislation, or to say that in our schools we should come \nto understand the need to teach respect, responsibility, fairness, \ncaring, and citizenship--wow, these were values that should be not only \nin our schools but throughout our country.\n  Joe has been so faithful to his religious beliefs. He has also been \nfaithful to the Constitution he was sworn to uphold and to the people \nof Connecticut. I want him to know we so appreciate his service to \nConnecticut and to the country.\n  I wanted to be sure that the day would not end without me \nacknowledging these wonderful people who have given a big part of their \nlives to making this country a better place. I want to, in the most \nheartfelt way--I am so sorry we did not have a bipartisan dinner or \nparty to be able to express this. I would have liked to have been in \nthe same room, breaking bread with them, in order to be able to tell \nthem how much we appreciate them, across party lines, across those \nlines that ordinarily divide us. They came from different parts of the \ncountry, they arrived in the Senate with different objectives, they \nwill leave under different circumstances. But I want to again let them \nknow that each and every one of them had a positive impact on me and I \nthink a wonderful impact on the future of this country. So I wish them \nwell. God bless and Godspeed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, over the past few weeks, we have been \ndiscussing a plan by the Democratic leadership to break the rules of \nthe Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate; in other words, \nthe nuclear option. This plan would break their very clear commitment, \nwhich was given at the end of 2006 when they were still serving in the \nminority, to respect the rights of the minority. It would break their \npromise to follow the Golden Rule, and it would break their pledge to \nnever, ever use the nuclear option to break the Senate rules.\n  They have governed in a much different way. Their actions yesterday \non the pending bill related to the Transaction Account Guarantee \nProgram illustrate well the heavyhanded ``my way or the highway'' \nmanner of running the Senate.\n  Senate Republicans voted overwhelmingly to get on this bill--voted \noverwhelmingly to get on the bill. We soon found out, however, that no \ngood deed goes unpunished. Less than a minute after agreeing to adopt a \nmotion to proceed to the bill, the Democratic majority filled the \namendment tree to prevent any Senator, Republican or Democrat, from \noffering any amendments.\n  Republicans have significant, on-point amendments we would like to \noffer. For example, Senator Corker has an amendment that requires the \nFDIC to charge the full premium necessary to cover the cost of this \ninsurance. Senator Vitter has a similar amendment. Senator Corker also \nhas an amendment that would make participation in the TAG Program \nvoluntary so banks don't have to pay premiums for insurance they don't \nuse. Senator Wicker has an amendment that would limit the term and \nexposure of the extension of the TAG Program.\n  Other Members on both sides of the aisle have additional amendments \nthat are relevant to this bill. No Senators, however, Republican or \nDemocrat, will get to offer any of these amendments because of the \nautocratic manner in which the Democratic majority is handling this \nlegislation, which is, by the way, the same way they have handled the \nprevious bills nearly 70 times.\n  Within 2 minutes, after blocking out all amendments, the Democratic \nleadership filed cloture on the bill so our friends could end debate on \nthis legislation before it even began. This procedural hard ball, like \nblocking out all amendments by filling the amendment tree, is all too \ncommon.\n  This is the 107th time the Democratic majority has moved to cut off \ndebate on a matter, be it a bill, an amendment, or a conference report, \non the very same day--the very same day the Senate began considering \nthe matter. And to boot, this is a bill that never went through \ncommittee. Like so many other bills the Senate has considered under the \nDemocratic majority, it was written behind closed doors. This has \nhappened nearly 70 times as well.\n  In short, what happened on this bill is a prime example of the \nDemocratic leadership's hat trick: bypass the committee process to \nwrite a bill behind closed doors; prevent anyone, Republican or \nDemocrat, from representing their constituents by offering an \namendment; and then move to end debate on the bill--again, this is a \nbill that never went through committee and that no one was allowed to \namend--on the very same day the Senate takes up the bill. The \nDemocratic leadership, no doubt, likes running the Senate this way \nbecause it gives them nearly total control--nearly total control--or, \nas they prefer to describe it, this approach is ``efficient.'' \nEfficient. Now that they are no longer in the minority, this is what \nthey believe the Senate should aspire to be.\n  One can describe this heavyhanded approach in a lot of ways, but you \ncan't say it comports with their promise to\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\nrespect minority rights. You certainly can't say it is an example of \nthe golden rule, and you can't say it resembles anything like how the \nSenate used to be run, how the Senate is supposed to be run, and how \nour Democratic colleagues promised they would run it. The heavyhanded \nway the Democratic majority is handling this bill is a prime example of \nthe fact that we don't have a rules problem around here, we have an \nattitude problem around here.\n  So I would call on my Democratic colleagues--especially those who are \nnot in the leadership and who have the experience and wisdom that comes \nfrom serving in the minority--to work with us to get the Senate back to \nhow it is supposed to function. I urge them not to be complicit in \nirreparably changing the Senate as an institution that respects the \nrights of the minority and the views of the constituents whom the \nminority represents.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about the tax \nhikes that are going to be hitting middle-class families all across \nthis country, and it is going to do so in a way that many Americans do \nnot realize. Everyone in Washington is talking about the fiscal cliff \nand the tax increases that might come from that, but today I wish to \ntalk about something different; that is, the tax increases that are \ncoming regardless of what happens with the fiscal cliff. Those are the \ntax hikes we are seeing because of President Obama's health care law.\n  People who have been following this closely know that President \nObama's health care law guarantees that middle-class families will pay \nhigher taxes. The President promised repeatedly that he would not raise \ntaxes on the middle class. As a matter of fact, he said, ``If you're a \nfamily making less than $250,000 a year,'' referring to his health care \nplan, ``my plan won't raise your taxes one penny--not your income \ntaxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not any of \nyour taxes.'' That is what the President said. But once he got into \noffice, President Obama arranged for his health care plan to be written \nbehind closed doors. Democrats in Congress passed it, and they did it \nstrictly along party lines.\n  This law included more than 20 different tax increases. These tax \nincreases amount to more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Of \nthose, a dozen taxes specifically targeted middle-class taxpayers. The \nmost famous, of course, is the individual mandate tax. That is the one \nwhich requires that all Americans buy a government-approved health \ninsurance plan. If they don't for even 1 single month out of the year, \nthen they have to pay the tax. Members of the Senate ought to remember \nthis one. This is the one the American public still finds very \nunfavorable, to the point that still a majority of Americans want to \nchange or either completely eliminate and repeal the President's health \ncare law.\n  The law continues to be very unpopular. One of the main reasons has \nto do with this tax. It is a tax that is going to hit families harder \nthan single people, and it is going to hit the middle class harder than \nwealthier Americans. You know what. That is the way it was designed, \namazingly. That is the way the Democrats in this body designed the \ntax--to hit the middle class harder than wealthier Americans. By 2016, \n4.7 million low- and middle-income households will face a tax for not \nbuying government-approved health insurance. It was entirely \npredictable. In fact, a lot of us on the Republican side of the aisle \ndid predict it right here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Well, this leads me to another aspect of the health care law that the \nWhite House and the Democrats have not been eager to talk about, and it \nis the role specifically related to this tax, and that is the role of \nthe IRS, the Internal Revenue Service. The law gives the IRS \nunprecedented new powers to do what? To probe into taxpayers' lives.\n  Right after the election--and they waited until after the election--\nthe Obama administration started releasing a wave of new health care \nregulations. These include new rules on how the IRS plans to implement \nthe new health care taxes. Just last week, they put out proposed rules \non how they are going to enforce the new Medicare payroll taxes. They \nstill haven't said exactly how they plan to enforce the individual \nmandate tax.\n\n  But we do know IRS agents are going to be verifying who bought health \ninsurance and taxing everyone who didn't. We know the IRS will be doing \nmore tax audits for health care spending. We know the IRS will be able \nto confiscate Americans' tax refunds. Why? Well, to pay for health care \ntaxes--not to pay for health care but to pay for health care taxes and \nto assess interest and late fees on people without insurance.\n  We know we are going to see an army of new IRS agents and auditors--\nto do what? They are going to investigate the health insurance choices \nof Americans and their families. The agency is going to have to collect \na huge amount of data not just from insurance companies but from the \nAmerican people. The IRS is going to want to know details such as the \ncost and the benefit structure of every person's health insurance \npolicy. They are going to want to know who in each household is covered \nand how long they have been covered. They will want to know the incomes \npeople reported to their insurance company and what other kind of \ncoverage their employer may have offered.\n  To get all of this information, the Internal Revenue Service will \nhave to develop new layers, additional layers of redtape for businesses \nand for families, new forms, new filing procedures, and new \ninstructions. It is going to have to come up with some way for \ntaxpayers to resolve any discrepancies, and there are going to be a lot \nbetween what their tax returns say and the data the insurance companies \nreport. It is going to be a nightmare. It is not clear how the IRS is \ngoing to do this, but people are certainly going to need to keep very \ncareful records. It is also clear that a lot of Americans are going to \nbe defending themselves against audits.\n  All of that is work the IRS is going to have to do just to get ready \nfor this massive amount of new bureaucracy. The problem is that several \nindependent reviews have found that the agency is seriously unprepared. \nIn one, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found \nthat the IRS is not equipped--not equipped--to implement the law \ncontained in what is called the ``largest set of tax law changes in \nmore than 20 years.'' The IRS hasn't even conducted a thorough review \nof the law that it is required to execute. As a result, the Inspector \nGeneral's Office said it wasn't able to determine whether the IRS had \nadequately planned for the workforce it will need.\n  There was a separate analysis done. There was an analysis done by the \nHouse of Representatives. They found that the IRS could need more than \n16,000 new IRS agents, new IRS examiners, new IRS support employees. \nWell, you know as well as I that the American taxpayers will get hit \nwith the bill to pay for the salaries of all of those new IRS \nemployees--the agents, the examiners, and the support employees.\n  The American people knew what they wanted from health care reform. \nWhat they asked for was the care they need from the doctor they choose \nat a lower cost. That is what the President and Democrats promised \nthem. It turns out that what the American public has gotten is fewer \nchoices, more regulations, and higher taxes.\n  In meeting after meeting, when visiting with constituents in Wyoming, \nI said, ``How many of you believe that under the President's health \ncare law, you are going to pay more for your health insurance?'' All of \nthe hands went up.\n  I said, ``How many of you think that the quality and availability of \nyour care because of the President's health\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\ncare law is going to go down or it is going to get worse?'' Again, all \nof the hands went up.\n  Now what these same people are learning is that the IRS is the chief \nFederal enforcer for key parts of President Obama's health care law. \nThe people of my State and the people around the country do not like it \nat all.\n  What we are going to have as a result of the health care law is a \nmuch larger Internal Revenue Service. They are going to have broad new \npowers--powers to investigate, powers to monitor, and powers to tax the \nAmerican people. At the same time, there is real doubt about whether \nthe agency is even up to the job.\n  America's middle-class families don't want, don't need, and cannot \nafford more taxes. They don't want, they don't need, and they cannot \nafford a more powerful Internal Revenue Service, with more agents \nlooking into the details of their health care choices, but that is \nexactly what President Obama and every Democrat in this body have given \nto the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

SANDY GREENBERG\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague, \nSenator Paul, to discuss the life and work of an exceptional American, \nDr. Sandy Greenberg, who is here with us today, along with his wife Sue \nand his sister Brenda.\n  Sandy, in my view, is an honorary Delawarean because he spends a \nmonth every year at one of our most beautiful beaches, Rehoboth Beach. \nBut he is much more than that. A successful businessman and \nphilanthropist, Sandy has a wide variety of interests and life \nexperiences. He has founded and run software and technology companies, \nhe is a pioneer in the use of technology in medicine, and helped bring \ntelemedicine to rural health care facilities as chairman of the Rural \nHealth Care Corporation.\n  He was appointed by President Clinton to the Board of the National \nScience Foundation. As a young man he took a break from his studies at \nColumbia, where he roomed with Art Garfunkel--a well-known musician--to \nwork as a fellow in Lyndon Johnson's office.\n  All of this on its own merits would make for a life well-lived and a \nsubstantive, meaningful contribution to our country. But there is one \nthing I have not yet mentioned. At the young age of 19, Sandy went \nblind. He lost his sight, and with that all likely hope of the \nsuccessful completion of his college career or a successful career in \nlife. He was told by the social workers who met with him after glaucoma \nstole his sight from him that his future would likely consist of \nassembling screwdriver kits in a sheltered workshop in his hometown in \nupstate New York.\n  But because of the kindness and the intervention of his roommates--\nArt Garfunkel and Jerry Spire--and others who volunteered--Marc \nMukasey--who dedicated countless hours reading to him, he was able to \nfinish his class work, to be successful in completing his studies at \nColumbia, and then to go on to Harvard Law School and to Oxford, and \nthen to go further and further.\n  He has lived his entire adult life and achieved a career most of us \ncan only dream of while also plunged in darkness. His exceptional \ncourage and his perseverance don't end there. Today he wants to serve \nothers and catalyze a transformative shift in the health of our Nation \nby ending blindness by the end of this decade.\n  Is this outrageous? Is this audacious? Maybe. But that is what \nexperts said when President Kennedy stood before this Congress--in the \nsame year, 1961, that Sandy lost his sight--and challenged our Nation \nto put a man on the Moon by the end of that decade. The best and \nbrightest minds, the top scientists and researchers of Kennedy's \ngeneration rose to that challenge and achieved his impossible dream. \nNow, for this generation, Sandy and his wife Sue have once again raised \nour sights and challenged the best scientific and medical researchers \nin the world to rise to an enormous challenge--a challenge that has \nbeen with us from the beginning of mankind.\n  In the Bible itself we hear of blindness, of people who could not see \nwith their eyes but only their hearts. For millennia, humanity has \nstruggled to understand and overcome blindness. Yet today we have the \nscientific tools necessary to reach for a cure--to restore the physical \nsight so many of us take for granted to those who otherwise live in \ndarkness; to bring to life the 39 million people in this world who live \nwithout sight, many in the world's poorest countries, at a time when \nexperts already believe 80 percent of blindness can be prevented or \ncured.\n  We know we can do it. Just think of what an awe-inspiring \naccomplishment this would be, what a triumph of the human mind, of \nindividual initiative, of collaborative efforts of the scientific \nmethod, of modern technology, and of our investment in the belief that \nAmerica can and should be a world leader in curing the diseases that \nhave ailed humanity for generations.\n  Mr. President, a majority of all research scientists in human history \nare alive today. That remarkable fact alone carries with it great \npotential. That is why Sandy and his wife Sue created the Prize to End \nBlindness by 2020, to take advantage of this incredible historic \nopportunity to bring together scientists and researchers and end \nblindness by the end of this decade. To inspire them, the Greenbergs \nhave provided a prize of more than $2 million in gold. Why gold? Well, \nit is a reminder of the color of the beautiful shimmering sunsets Sandy \nand Susan enjoyed together in the waning days of Sandy's sightedness, \nand it is a reminder of the beauty of the challenge of a prize to \nrestore sight to millions who live in blindness.\n  Mr. President, I am no expert on the health or science of the eye, \nbut we are blessed to have in this Senate two Members who are. We had \nsome supportive comments that will be given by Senator Boozman of \nArkansas, but I am particularly glad and honored to be joined today by \nSenator Paul, by Dr. Paul, who is not only a tireless advocate for the \npeople of Kentucky, but who, by professional training and background, \nis an ophthalmologist.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. I thank Senator Coons for inviting me, both figuratively \nand literally, across the aisle to join him on this side--I am glad to \nbe here today--and for introducing me to this prize that Sandy \nGreenberg has brought forward to end blindness.\n  I am an eye surgeon. I have also done research on glaucoma and have \nbeen a longtime member of Lions Club International, whose primary \nresearch and goal is the prevention of blindness.\n  One of the heroes to the Lions' eye movement and to our work \nworldwide on blindness has been Helen Keller who, at the age of 19 \nmonths, lost not only her vision but her hearing. In 1925, she came to \nthe Lions Club International with this mandate--and this is part of her \nspeech from that day:\n\n       You have heard how through a little word dropped from the \n     fingers of another, a ray of light from another soul touched \n     the darkness of my mind and I found myself, found the world, \n     found God. It is because my teacher learned about me and \n     broke through the dark, silent imprisonment which held me \n     that I am able to work for myself and for others. It is the \n     caring we want more than the money. The gift without the \n     sympathy and interest of the giver is empty. If you care, if \n     we can make the people of this great country care, the blind \n     will indeed triumph over blindness.\n       The opportunity I bring to you, Lions, is this: To foster \n     and sponsor the work of the American Foundation for the \n     Blind. Will you not help me hasten the day when there shall \n     be no preventable blindness; no little deaf, blind child \n     untaught; no blind man or woman unaided?\n\n  There is a long history, both in our country and in other countries \naround the world, of private philanthropy and these prizes. Going back \nto the early 18th century, there was a prize for longitude. The \nHarrisons, father and son, worked for nearly 40 years to develop a \nclock to precisely measure where they were on the Earth, to measure \nlongitude.\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\n  We currently have something called the X Prize, which gave money last \nyear to a company that developed a technology to speed up the cleanup \nof oil in the ocean after BP's disaster.\n  Siemens Foundation gives a $100,000 prize. That was given last year \nto a 17-year-old girl from California who developed a nanoparticle \nthat, with a chemotherapy agent, goes directly to treat tumors. A prize \nfrom Siemens was also given to 15-year-old Benjamin Clark, who won the \nprize for his work in how stars are born.\n  I love the idea, and I think it is underappreciated, of private \nphilanthropy. Today, I am happy to be here with you to congratulate \nSandy Greenberg for putting forward this prize, and I hope it will \nbring some results.\n  I think there is within our grasp the ability to treat and, \nhopefully, prevent blindness.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank Senator Paul. I ask unanimous consent to enter \ninto a colloquy with my colleague from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, it certainly hasn't escaped the expert \nknowledge of my colleagues here today that 2020--the date of the prize \nof Sue and Sandy whom we have spoken about--is also the numerical \nindication of perfect vision. So the goal to end blindness by 2020--\nwhich is what the Sandy and Sue Greenberg prize is calling us toward--\nis also a year on the calendar, a year just over 7 years away. In those \n7 years, Sandy Greenberg has the courage, the audacity, the strength to \nbelieve we can end blindness, working together, by 2020. It is a goal \nthat could transform our society, our world, and the lives of millions \nwho live in darkness today. We can do it.\n  At earlier times in our history, as Senator Paul has just reflected, \nwe have come together in response to audacious goals or inspiring \nprizes to conquer other debilitating diseases. One that Sandy Greenberg \nshared with me when we sat together and first talked about this was \npolio, a crippling disease that struck terror into the hearts of \nparents every summer.\n  Dr. Jonas Salk convinced medical researchers at charities such as the \nMarch of Dimes to instead turn their focus from treatment, with devices \nsuch as the iron lung, to ending the disease itself. Because of that \nkind of forward thinking, polio has now been largely eradicated and \ndoes not threaten children in the United States, although it remains in \na few isolated outposts around the world.\n  We can see even more cutting-edge examples today in my home State of \nDelaware. Just earlier this week, I met with scientific researchers Dr. \nKmiec from Delaware State University and the leaders of a company \ncalled Orthogenics, who are taking on the audacious goal of ending \nsickle cell anemia. That particular effort--banishing this disease from \nbodies around the world through research and development--is something \nsupported by public-private partnership.\n  In the end, private contributions, extraordinary generosity by Sandy \nand Sue Greenberg and his family, are critically important.\n  I happen to believe there is also a vital role for a partnership with \nthe National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control, and \nothers that have the unique ability to bring researchers together, \nhopefully for efficient and effective advances in medicine.\n  To continue the citations of the great disability rights advocate \nHelen Keller: ``Alone, we can do little; together, we can do so much.''\n  Even in this era of austerity, these times of budget crunching and \nbelt-tightening, in my view there are few areas more important for our \nsustained investment than the development of treatments and cures for a \ndevastating, life-changing health condition such as blindness.\n  In my view, there is also a pressing economic element to this \nhumanitarian equation. Economists have said that most of the new wealth \ncreated in this country in the last century came from biomedical \nresearch and its application to fighting and changing the human \ncondition. They have told us that curing and treating ancient diseases \nand conditions is a lot of what has driven the extraordinary economic \ngrowth of this country in the last century.\n  We know that when we as a nation invest in making possible cutting-\nedge advances, interconnected networks of learning make possible the \nnext gigantic leap. I am so grateful to Sue and Sandy for making \npossible this challenge, for putting out this pot of gold to literally \nlift the sights of teams all over the world, of individuals, of \ncommunities of effort. It is an effort that could literally bring sight \nto the blind.\n\n  Senator Paul, any closing thoughts?\n  Mr. PAUL. I think what is great about the prize is it didn't set a \nshort and limited goal. It goes for the whole thing: They want to \nprevent and cure blindness.\n  I think we need more big thinking. We need to talk about let's cure \ndiabetes, let's cure AIDS. Sometimes it takes an incremental approach. \nBut sometimes it takes a big, grand or bold vision.\n  The Senator mentioned Dr. Salk. In the early days, with the polio \nvaccine, some actually died from the vaccine. He had to move forward \ndespite some obstacles and despite some setbacks.\n  Originally, the whole idea of vaccination came from Dr. Boylston in \nBoston, preceding the time of our Revolutionary War. There, it was a \nlive vaccine taken from the actual pustules of someone who had \nsmallpox, lanced it, stuck it into the pustules, and then cut into a \nperson who did not have smallpox and gave them the disease. He tried to \ngive them a mild variant of this. For this, Dr. Boylston was hounded \nthrough the streets and mobs came to the house. The persons he chose to \nvaccinate first were his kids. That took a very bold step forward to \nvaccinate his kids. His kids survived, and the rest is history.\n  George Washington had his family inoculated. Back at the time of the \nRevolutionary War, more people died from communicable diseases than \ndied from actual bullets. This was true in most wars up until this \ncentury.\n  I think it takes bold vision, and I think Sandy Greenberg will help \nto move this along with this prize. I love the idea of incentives. We \nare a country built on incentives. I don't think any scientist is going \nto jump forward and say, I am doing it only for the prize. But prizes \ndon't hurt, and we should acknowledge that these scientists who can \ncome forward and may come forward with a great cure should be rewarded.\n  I would like to thank Sandy Greenberg and his family for setting up \nthis prize. I hope that out of this some great good will come for those \nwho have gone blind and for prevention.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank, Senator Paul. I, like the Senator, am confident \nthat some great good will come out of this bold vision, out of this \nclear initiative.\n  As we look forward at the health care debates that have raged \nthroughout this Chamber and this country in the last few years, I will \nsimply say in closing, as we look to the future of the United States, \nthere is a path forward that says the right way to deal with \nskyrocketing health care costs and the fiscal challenges they provide \nis to simply crunch down, to limit, to narrow, to cut off access, and \nto manage downward.\n  A competing and I think a more compelling and I think, frankly, a \nmore American view is we should take bold risks. We should innovate. We \nshould dare to speak of curing diseases that are immensely harmful and \nexpenses that are challenges and burdens for our whole country and the \nworld.\n  This prize--this challenge from Sue and Sandy Greenberg--is something \nI think should lift the sights of all of us in this country to the very \nreal possibilities of working together to find exceptional cures.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for letting us speak about this \nextraordinary American, his wife and his family and his quest to end \nblindness by the end of this decade.\n  I urge anyone interested in this topic and interested in working with \nus further to visit the Web site endblindnessby2020.com. I thank Sandy \nand Sue Greenberg for their courage, their perseverance, and their \ncommitment to bringing light to millions of their fellow men and women \naround the globe.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the clock continues to tick away while we \nwait for the descent from the summit, when the President and Speaker \nBoehner walk out, with tablets in hand, saying we have a deal. Many of \nus are beginning to wonder if that is going to be achievable. We are \nholding our breath. But as we near the end of the year, clearly as has \nbeen stated repeatedly on the floor, the necessity of putting something \ntogether to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, the disastrous \nconsequences of our not acting, is clear. Tax increases for every \nAmerican taxpayer, massive cuts to defense at a time when the threats \naround the world are as varied and as great as we have seen in a long \ntime, other essential programs of the Federal Government being affected \nby that--that is the last thing we need. In this tepid economy with a \nlot of people out of work we are hoping for some consensus to come \ntogether to provide a long-term solution to our fiscal problem that \ncontinues to have a negative effect on our economy and, more \nimportantly, keeps people out of work.\n  As that clock ticks, some are saying partisanship is too great in \nWashington; the country is too divided; we are not going to be able to \nreach a consensus here in terms of how to address this problem.\n  I disagree with that. Over the last 2 years and more, we have had a \nnumber of proposals brought forward on a bipartisan basis. It started \nwith Simpson-Bowles; Bowles, the former Chief of Staff to President \nClinton, and Al Simpson, a Member of this body for a long time, \nrecognized as two individuals who can take a look at the situation we \nare in and make a proposal. That has been running 2-and-some years now. \nThat was presented, the President's own commission, yet that was \nrejected by the President.\n  Then of course there was the Gang of Six, later the Gang of Eight, \nwhich met on a bipartisan basis for a number of months, both sides \ncontributing to an attempt at a package put together to submit to the \nCongress and to the White House. That was a bipartisan effort. The \nsupercommittee of 12, 6 Democrats, 6 Republicans--they were \nunfortunately unable to come to an agreement.\n  That has brought us to this particular point in time because failure \nof our effort to do this ended up in a procedure which drives us here \nat the end of the year toward this so-called cliff. I have been talking \nto a number of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats and others, and \nthere is a majority consensus here for putting together a credible \nlong-term package to deal with our fiscal situation. That would send a \nmessage to the world and send a message to our citizens that the \nCongress and the government are serious about addressing our fiscal \nsituation and putting us on a path to fiscal health. In doing so, it \nwould restore the confidence of the American people. It would restore \nthe confidence of investors around the world that America is getting \nits act together at a time when Europe is struggling, at a time when \nJapan is struggling, when China's growth is slowing down. The world is \nlooking to the United States to take the lead as it has so many times \nand in so many crises before. Yet all they see is a standoff and the \ninability to do what I think we all know we need to do.\n  The choice is very clear. We have come to the point where I think \nmost people looking at this understand that if we do not act now, the \nso-called kicking the can down the road no longer is a viable \nopportunity. It no longer is something we can afford to do. There is a \ngroup called The Can Kicks Back. I can see why the American people are \nfrustrated over our inability to come to some agreement on this.\n  Obviously we hope the President and Speaker Boehner will bring us \nthat grand bargain which we can evaluate and address before the end of \nthe year. I have frequently said from this podium and back to the \npeople I represent in Indiana, if we do not start addressing the \nspending problem, it doesn't matter how much we raise in taxes or \nrevenue, it doesn't matter how much else we do to address our problem--\nif we do not address the out-of-control Federal spending, we cannot get \nfrom there to here. We cannot put forward a credible package.\n  It is no secret that over the years--without laying the blame on one \nparty or another--our spending has exceeded our revenues now to the \nextent that we are plunging into serious debt and serious deficit; over \n$1 trillion a year accumulated over the last 4 years, and a significant \namount of money before that. It is unsustainable. Whether you are a \nliberal economist or conservative economist, whether Democrat, \nRepublican, Independent, or Libertarian, just do the math--and it is \nsimple math; it is not calculus, it is third-grade math. You cannot \nkeep spending $1 trillion a year more than you collect without having \nsevere consequences.\n  The consequence we have had is a very slow recovery from a very deep \nrecession that has stifled job growth, stifled innovation, kept people \nout of work. The latest statistics are that over 23 million Americans \nare either unemployed, underemployed, or have simply given up looking \nfor a job, frustrated trying to find any work whatsoever, and a \nstaggering percentage of those unemployed is young people, people under \n30.\n  Robert Samuelson wrote an article a couple of days ago asking, is \nthis the lost generation, basically saying that those in the under-30 \ncategory may have lost--we may lose a whole generation, those who will \nnot have the opportunity to gain meaningful employment, to realize \ntheir dreams, to participate in the American dream of getting a good \njob, of marrying and having a family, of buying a house, paying the \nmortgage--doing the things which our generation has enjoyed. We have \nbeen given that opportunity, but a generation behind us is being denied \nthat opportunity, and will it be the lost generation.\n  The answer to that question falls on the shoulders of those of us \nhere--not only at the White House with the President and his advisers \nbut with the Congress, the Senate and the House. We now have an \nopportunity, maybe an historic opportunity--I do believe it is an \nhistoric opportunity--to right the wrong and to put in place something \nthat, yes, will have an impact on us. Yes, it is medicine we will have \nto take for our excessive spending, but it will bring about the cure.\n  How many of us are thinking about the future for our children, our \ngrandchildren, the Nation's children, the Nation's grandchildren? How \nmany of us can stand here and simply say we are doing OK at our level, \nour generation, but we are not willing to make any sacrifice whatsoever \nto ensure that this country can provide for future generations? Most \nagree if we do not have a package that has $4 to $4.5 trillion of \nspending reduction over the next 10 years it will not be a credible \npackage. There is also now almost universal agreement that we must \nincorporate long-term entitlement reform. Mandatory spending--over \nwhich we have no control of spending levels--and interest costs now eat \nup 64 percent of our budget and denies those who come to us about \nimproving our roads, providing medical research, supporting education, \nwhatever your interest--those interests are receiving less support than \nthey have before. They will continue to see less support to the\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\npoint they may receive no support because the mandatories projected \nwith the baby boom retirement accelerate to points which our country \ncan simply not afford. It will drive us into bankruptcy.\n\n  If the package that is brought down hopefully from the White House \ndoes not address that, or if we do not address in this body the \nspending issue that incorporates the restructuring for the preservation \nof Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security but also with a realization \nthat unless we do something those programs are going to go bankrupt and \nhave severe impacts on those currently receiving those benefits--unless \nwe do that, we will not have a credible package.\n  Senator Wyden and I have proposed comprehensive tax reform as \nsomething that needs to be done. Regulatory reform has been suggested \nby others, which I support. But if we do not acknowledge that the final \npackage presented to us incorporates those long-term solutions, we will \nsimply be back here in the next debt limit crisis. We will be back here \nin the next fiscal crisis. We will continue to see our country languish \nin terms of providing growth and job opportunities for our people, and \nwe will not have addressed the problem of kick the can down the road \none more time--I think to the disgust and displeasure of the American \npeople.\n  They are cynical enough about our ability to do something as we \nspeak, let alone what might happen if we cannot come to an agreement \nthat everybody knows we need to come to.\n  When I decided to run again in 2010 after being out of the Senate for \nmore than a decade, I did not do it just to regain the title of \nSenator. I did not put retirement on hold and more time with my family \naside because I thought it would be fun to be back here. I did it \nbecause I want to be able to leave a stronger country for my children \nand grandchildren and for others' children and grandchildren. I did it \nbecause I want to restore this country so that America's future \ngenerations can enjoy the kind of life full of promise and opportunity \nthat our generation has been able to enjoy.\n  I look back over the history of our country and see the sacrifices \nbeing made--from the Revolutionary War all the way through the two-plus \ncenturies--the world wars, the fiscal crises, the Depression--the \nsacrifices that have been made by former generations so that future \ngenerations can enjoy the promise of America, unique of any country in \nthe world in terms of providing opportunities for individuals and their \nfamilies.\n  All of us have experienced that moment back home when a man or woman \nlooks us in the eye and tells us they are putting their trust in us to \ndo the right thing when we get back to Washington. They are putting \ntheir trust and faith in us to make sound decisions; that the votes we \ntake on the Senate floor will strengthen our economy so they can make \ntheir mortgage payments, get a job, send their kids to college, and \nenjoy the opportunities and benefits that have been beneficial to so \nmany of us.\n  This is a great challenge. It is a historic moment. It is an \nopportunity to transcend politics, to rise above the petty, partisan \ndecisions and join together to do what is right for the future of this \ncountry. We cannot do this without Presidential leadership.\n  The President seems to have an obsession with raising taxes. We have \nnot heard much from the White House in terms of addressing the spending \nissues or the issues that are driving our deficit forward. Unless these \nissues are addressed, it will not result in a credible solution to our \nproblem.\n  We are asking you, Mr. President, to join us in making the tough \ndecisions, to do what I think we all know needs to be done and not push \nthis into the future anymore. We cannot keep people out of work. There \nare over 23 million Americans who, on average, were considered \nunderemployed over the past year. Of those underemployed Americans, 41 \npercent were 30 or under. We need to give them hope for the future and \na light at the end of the tunnel. We are asking that you join us, and \nwe are asking you to do a grand bargain and talk more than just about \ntax increases, which we know can impact our job opportunities and our \neconomy.\n  The Republicans have put forth ideas in terms of the revenue portion \nof that without raising rates and destroying the opportunities for the \nnearly 1 million businesses and others who don't fall in the corporate \ncategory.\n  As David Brooks said recently in the New York Times:\n\n       It's pointless to cut a short-term deal if entitlement \n     programs are still structured to bankrupt our children. \n     Republicans and Democrats could make 2013 the year of the \n     truly Grand Bargain.\n\n  So that is what we are imploring to you, Mr. President, and that is \nwhat we are asking all of our colleagues to consider. This historic \nopportunity is going to be our legacy. It is not about a vote we made \nin the past, and it might not be about a vote we make in the future. We \nwill be judged at a time when the clock has run out, and there is an \nabsolute necessity for a package that is grand enough to achieve \ncredibility, and go forward to restore the confidence of the American \npeople and the investment community and lead the world to recovery.\n  This is our chance, Mr. President, and I hope we take that chance.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7793-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7793-S7972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HOMELAND BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Ballistic Missile Defense Review of February 2010 \n     stated as its first policy priority that ``the United States \n     will continue to defend the homeland against the threat of \n     limited ballistic missile attack'' and that ``an essential \n     element of the United States' homeland ballistic missile \n     defense strategy is to hedge against future uncertainties, \n     including both the uncertainty of future threat capabilities \n     and the technical risks inherent to our own development \n     plans''.\n       (2) The United States currently has an operational Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system with 30 Ground-Based \n     Interceptors (GBIs) deployed in Alaska and California, \n     protecting the United States against the potential future \n     threat of limited ballistic missile attack from countries \n     such as North Korea and Iran.\n       (3) As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear \n     and Missile Defense Policy Bradley Roberts testified before \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on April 25, \n     2012, ``[w]ith 30 GBIs in place, the United States is in an \n     advantageous position vis-a-vis the threats from North Korea \n     and Iran,'' and ``neither has successfully tested an ICBM or \n     demonstrated an ICBM-class warhead''.\n       (4) Deputy Assistant Secretary Roberts testified that \n     maintaining this advantageous position ``requires continued \n     improvement to the GMD system, including enhanced performance \n     by the GBIs and the deployment of new sensors. It also \n     requires the development of the Precision Tracking Space \n     System (PTSS) to handle larger raid sizes and the Standard \n     Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIB as the ICBM threat from states \n     like Iran and North Korea matures. These efforts will help to \n     ensure that the United States possesses the capability to \n     counter the projected threat for the foreseeable future''.\n       (5) As its highest priority, the Missile Defense Agency is \n     designing a correction to the problem that caused a December \n     2010 flight test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system using the Capability Enhancement II (CE-II) \n     model of exo-atmospheric kill vehicle, and plans to \n     demonstrate the correction in two flight tests before \n     resuming production or assembly of additional Capability \n     Enhancement II kill vehicles.\n       (6) The Department of Defense has a program to improve the \n     performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system, including a plan to test every component of \n     the Ground-Based Interceptors for reliability. According to \n     Department of Defense officials, the goal of the Ground-Based \n     Interceptor reliability program is to double the number of \n     threat Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) that our \n     current inventory of Ground-Based Interceptors could defeat, \n     thereby effectively doubling the capability of our current \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.\n       (7) The Missile Defense Agency, working with the Director \n     of Operational Test and Evaluation and with United States \n     Strategic Command, has developed a comprehensive Integrated \n     Master Test Plan (IMTP) for missile defense, with flight \n     tests for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system planned \n     through fiscal year 2022, including salvo testing, multiple \n     simultaneous engagement testing, and operational testing.\n       (8) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, who \n     must review, approve, and sign each semi-annual version of \n     the Integrated Master Test Plan, testified that the Test Plan \n     is ``a robust and rigorous test plan''. He also testified \n     that the current pace of Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system testing of one flight test per year is the ``best that \n     we've been able to achieve over a decade''.\n       (9) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency testified \n     before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on April \n     25, 2012, that flight testing the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system more often than once per year could cause \n     ``greater risk of further failure and setbacks to developing \n     our homeland defense capability as rapidly as possible''.\n       (10) As part of its homeland defense hedging strategy, the \n     Department of Defense has already decided upon or implemented \n     a number of actions to improve the missile defense posture of \n     the United States in case the threat of Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missiles from North Korea or Iran emerges sooner or \n     in greater numbers than anticipated. These include the \n     following actions:\n       (A) The Missile Defense Agency has completed construction \n     of Missile Field-2 at Fort Greely, Alaska, with eight extra \n     silos available to deploy additional operational Ground-Based \n     Interceptors, if needed.\n       (B) With its request for 5 additional Ground-Based \n     Interceptors in the budget of the President for fiscal year \n     2013, the Missile Defense Agency plans to have enough test \n     and spare Ground-Based Interceptors to emplace in the 8 extra \n     silos from 2014 through 2025, and will keep the Ground-Based \n     Interceptor production line active for 5 additional years, \n     thus allowing additional Ground-Based Interceptor purchases \n     in the future, if needed.\n       (C) The Department has decided not to decommission \n     prototype Missile Field-1 at Fort Greely but, instead, to \n     keep it in a storage status that would permit it to be \n     refurbished and reactivated within a few years if future \n     threat developments make that necessary.\n       (D) The Missile Defense Agency plans to build an in-flight \n     interceptor communications terminal at Fort Drum, New York, \n     to enhance the performance of Ground-Based Interceptors \n     defending the eastern United States against possible future \n     missile threats from Iran.\n       (E) The Missile Defense Agency is continuing the \n     development and testing of the two-stage Ground-Based \n     Interceptor for possible deployment in the future, if needed.\n       (F) The Missile Defense Agency is upgrading early warning \n     radars in Clear, Alaska, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to \n     enhance the ability to defend against potential multiple \n     future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threats from North \n     Korea and Iran.\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\n       (G) The Missile Defense Agency is pursuing development of \n     the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB interceptor for Phase 4 of \n     the European Phased Adaptive Approach. It is intended to \n     augment the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system as a cost-\n     effective first layer of defense of the homeland against a \n     possible future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threat \n     from Iran.\n       (H) The Missile Defense Agency is pursuing development of \n     the Precision Tracking Space System, a satellite sensor \n     system to provide persistent tracking of large numbers of \n     missiles in flight, and fire-control quality targeting data \n     to various missile defense interceptor systems. According to \n     the Director of the Missile Defense Agency, ``the greatest \n     future enhancement for both homeland and regional defense in \n     the next ten years is the development of the Precision \n     Tracking Space System satellites''.\n       (11) As part of its homeland defense hedging strategy \n     review, the Department of Defense is considering other \n     options to enhance the future United States posture to defend \n     the homeland, including the feasibility, advisability and \n     affordability of deploying additional Ground-Based \n     Interceptors, either in Alaska or at a missile defense site \n     on the East Coast of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is a national priority to defend the homeland \n     against the potential future threat of limited ballistic \n     missile attack from countries such as North Korea and Iran;\n       (2) the currently deployed Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system, with 30 Ground-Based Interceptors deployed in Alaska \n     and California, provides protection of the United States \n     homeland against the potential future threat of limited \n     ballistic missile attack from North Korea and Iran;\n       (3) it is essential for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system to achieve the levels of reliability, availability, \n     sustainability, and operational performance that will allow \n     it to continue providing protection of the United States \n     homeland against limited ballistic missile attack;\n       (4) the Missile Defense Agency should, as its highest \n     priority, correct the problem that caused the December 2010 \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system flight test failure and \n     demonstrate the correction in flight tests before resuming \n     production of the Capability Enhancement-II kill vehicle, in \n     order to provide confidence that the system will work as \n     intended;\n       (5) the Department of Defense should continue to enhance \n     the performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system, and enhance the capability of the Ballistic \n     Missile Defense System, to provide improved capability to \n     defend the homeland against possible increased future missile \n     threats from North Korea and Iran;\n       (6) the Missile Defense Agency should continue its robust, \n     rigorous, and realistic testing of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system at a pace of one flight test per year, as \n     described in the Integrated Master Test Plan, including salvo \n     testing, multiple simultaneous engagement testing, and \n     operational testing;\n       (7) if successfully developed, the Standard Missile-3 Block \n     IIB interceptor would provide an essential first layer of \n     defense of the homeland against an emerging Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missile threat from Iran, using a cost-effective \n     forward-based early intercept system that could permit \n     holding Ground-Based Interceptors in reserve, and if such \n     interceptor could be deployed on ships, it would also provide \n     a significant enhancement to defense against possible future \n     threats from North Korea;\n       (8) the Precision Tracking Space System has the potential \n     to improve dramatically the capability of homeland and \n     regional missile defense systems against large numbers of \n     missiles launched simultaneously, and should remain a high \n     priority for development;\n       (9) the Department of Defense has taken a number of \n     prudent, affordable, cost-effective, and operationally \n     significant steps to hedge against the possibility of future \n     growth in the missile threat to the homeland from North Korea \n     and Iran; and\n       (10) the Department of Defense should continue to evaluate \n     the evolution of the long-range missile threat from North \n     Korea and Iran and consider other possibilities for prudent, \n     affordable, cost-effective, and operationally significant \n     steps to improve the posture of the United States to defend \n     the homeland against possible future growth in the threat.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     on the status of efforts to improve the homeland ballistic \n     missile defense capability of the United States.\n       (2) Elements of report.--The report required by paragraph \n     (1)) shall include the following:\n       (A) A detailed description of the actions taken or planned \n     to improve the reliability, availability, and capability of \n     the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.\n       (B) A description of any improvements achieved as a result \n     of the actions described in subparagraph (A).\n       (C) A description of the results of the two planned flight \n     tests of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (Control \n     Test Vehicle flight test-1, and GMD Flight Test-06b) intended \n     to demonstrate the success of the correction of the problem \n     that caused the flight test failure of December 2010, and the \n     status of any decision to resume production of the Capability \n     Enhancement-II kill vehicle.\n       (D) A detailed description of actions taken or planned to \n     improve the homeland defense posture of the United States to \n     hedge against potential future Intercontinental Ballistic \n     Missile threat growth from North Korea and Iran.\n       (E) Any other matters the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (3) Form of report.--The report shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 232. REGIONAL BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the introduction to the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Review of February 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n     states that ``I have made defending against near-term \n     regional threats a top priority of our missile defense plans, \n     programs and capabilities''.\n       (2) In describing the threat of regional ballistic \n     missiles, the report of the Ballistic Missile Defense Review \n     states that ``there is no uncertainty about the existence of \n     regional threats. They are clear and present. The threat from \n     short-range, medium-range, and intermediate-range ballistic \n     missiles (SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs) in regions where the \n     United States deploys forces and maintains security \n     relationships is growing at a particularly rapid pace''.\n       (3) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate on April 25, 2012, Dr. Bradley Roberts, Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Missile \n     Defense Policy stated, with respect to regional missile \n     defense, that ``the need arises from the rapidly emerging \n     threats to our armed forces in Europe, the Middle East, and \n     East Asia from regional missile proliferators and the basic \n     challenge such proliferation poses to the safety and security \n     of our forces and allies and to our power projection \n     strategy''.\n       (4) Iran has the largest inventory of regional ballistic \n     missiles in the Middle East, with hundreds of missiles that \n     can reach southeastern Europe and all of the Middle East, \n     including Israel. Iran is improving its existing missiles and \n     developing new and longer-range missiles.\n       (5) North Korea has a large and growing inventory of short-\n     range and medium-range ballistic missiles that can reach \n     United States forces and allies in South Korea and Japan. \n     North Korea is improving its existing missiles and developing \n     new and longer-range missiles.\n       (6) In September 2009, President Barack Obama announced \n     that he had accepted the unanimous recommendation of the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to \n     establish a European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defense, designed to protect deployed United States forces \n     and allies and partners in Europe against the large and \n     growing threat of ballistic missiles from Iran.\n       (7) In November 2010, at the Lisbon Summit, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to adopt the core \n     mission of missile defense of its population, territory and \n     forces. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to \n     enhance its missile defense command and control system, the \n     Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense, to provide \n     a North Atlantic Treaty Organization command and control \n     capability. This is in addition to contributions of missile \n     defense capability from individual nations.\n       (8) During 2011, the United States successfully implemented \n     Phase 1 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, including \n     deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey, deployment of an \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ship in the eastern \n     Mediterranean Sea with Standard Missile-3 Block IA \n     interceptors, and establishment of a missile defense command \n     and control system in Germany.\n       (9) During 2011, the United States successfully negotiated \n     all the international agreements with North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies needed to permit future phases of the \n     European Phased Adaptive Approach, including agreements with \n     Romania and Poland to permit the deployment of Aegis Ashore \n     missile defense systems on their territory, an agreement with \n     Turkey to permit deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar on its \n     territory, and an agreement with Spain to permit the forward \n     stationing of four Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships at \n     Rota.\n       (10) Phase 2 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2015, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptors on \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore \n     site in Romania.\n       (11) Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2018, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIA interceptors on \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore \n     site in Poland.\n       (12) Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2020, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIB interceptors at \n     Aegis Ashore sites. This interceptor is intended to protect \n     both Europe and the United States against potential future \n     long-range ballistic missiles from Iran.\n       (13) At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in \n     Chicago in 2012, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plans \n     to announce it has achieved an ``interim capability'' for the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense system, \n     including initial capability of its Active Layered Theater \n     Ballistic Missile Defense system at a command and control \n     facility in Germany.\n       (14) The United States has a robust program of missile \n     defense cooperation with Israel, including joint development \n     of the Arrow Weapon System and the new Arrow-3 upper tier \n     interceptor, designed to defend Israel against ballistic \n     missiles from Iran. These jointly developed missile defense \n     systems are designed to be interoperable with United States \n     ballistic missile defenses, and these interoperable systems \n     are tested in large military exercises. The United States has \n     deployed an AN/TPY-2 radar in Israel to enhance missile \n     defense against missiles from Iran.\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\n       (15) The United States is working with the nations of the \n     Gulf Cooperation Council on enhanced national and regional \n     missile defense capabilities against growing missile threats \n     from Iran. As part of this effort, the United Arab Emirates \n     plans to purchase two batteries of the Terminal High Altitude \n     Air Defense (THAAD) system, as well as other equipment.\n       (16) The United States has a strong program of missile \n     defense cooperation with Japan, including the co-development \n     of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA interceptor for \n     the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system, intended to be \n     deployed by Japan and in Phase 3 of the European Phased \n     Adaptive Approach, Japan's fleet of Aegis Ballistic Missile \n     Defense ships using the SM-3 Block IA interceptors, and the \n     United States deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Japan.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the threat from regional ballistic missiles, \n     particularly from Iran and North Korea, is serious and \n     growing, and puts at risk forward-deployed United States \n     forces and allies and partners in Europe, the Middle East, \n     and the Asia-Pacific region;\n       (2) the Department of Defense has an obligation to provide \n     force protection of forward-deployed United States forces, \n     assets, and facilities from regional ballistic missile \n     attack;\n       (3) the United States has an obligation to meet its \n     security commitments to its allies, including ballistic \n     missile defense commitments;\n       (4) the Department of Defense has a balanced program of \n     investment and capabilities to provide for both homeland \n     defense and regional defense against ballistic missiles, \n     consistent with the Ballistic Missile Defense Review and with \n     the prioritized and integrated needs of the commanders of the \n     combatant commands;\n       (5) the European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defense is an appropriate and necessary response to the \n     existing and growing ballistic missile threat from Iran to \n     forward deployed United States forces and allies and partners \n     in Europe;\n       (6) the Department of Defense--\n       (A) should, as a high priority, continue to develop, test, \n     and plan to deploy all four phases of the European Phased \n     Adaptive Approach, including all variants of the Standard \n     Missile-3 interceptor; and\n       (B) should also continue with its other phased and adaptive \n     regional missile defense efforts tailored to the Middle East \n     and the Asia-Pacific region;\n       (7) European members of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization are making valuable contributions to missile \n     defense in Europe, by hosting elements of United States \n     missile defense systems on their territories, through \n     individual national contributions to missile defense \n     capability, and by collective funding and development of the \n     Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense system; and\n       (8) the Department of Defense should continue with the \n     development of the key enablers of enhanced regional missile \n     defense, including the Precision Tracking Space System.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees a report describing \n     the status and progress of regional missile defense programs \n     and efforts.\n       (2) Elements of report.--The report required by paragraph \n     (1) shall include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the adequacy of the existing and \n     planned European Phased Adaptive Approach to provide force \n     protection for forward deployed United States forces in \n     Europe against ballistic missile threats from Iran, and an \n     assessment whether adequate force protection would be \n     available absent the European Phased Adaptive Approach.\n       (B) An assessment whether the European Phased Adaptive \n     Approach and other planned regional missile defense \n     approaches of the United States meet the integrated \n     priorities of the commanders of the regional combatant \n     commands in an affordable and balanced manner.\n       (C) A description of the progress made in the development \n     and testing of elements of systems intended for deployment in \n     Phases 2 through 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, \n     including the Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptor and the \n     Aegis Ashore system.\n       (D) A description of the manner in which elements of \n     regional missile defense architectures, such as forward-based \n     X-band radars in Turkey and Japan, contribute to the \n     enhancement of homeland defense of the United States.\n       (E) A description of the current and planned contributions \n     of North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, both \n     collectively and individually, to missile defense in Europe.\n       (3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For more than a decade, the United States and Russia \n     have discussed a variety of options for cooperation on shared \n     early warning and ballistic missile defense. For example, on \n     May 1, 2001, President George W. Bush spoke of a ``new \n     cooperative relationship'' with Russia and said ``it should \n     be premised on openness, mutual confidence and real \n     opportunities for cooperation, including the area of missile \n     defense. It should allow us to share information so that each \n     nation can improve its early warning capability, and its \n     capability to defend its people and territory. And perhaps \n     one day, we can even cooperate in a joint defense''.\n       (2) Section 1231 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law \n     by Public Law 106-398; 1654A-329) authorized the Department \n     of Defense to establish in Russia a ``joint center for the \n     exchange of data from systems to provide early warning of \n     launches of ballistic missiles and for notification of \n     launches of such missiles'', also known as the Joint Data \n     Exchange Center (JDEC).\n       (3) On March 31, 2008, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon \n     England stated that ``we have offered Russia a wide-ranging \n     proposal to cooperate on missile defense--everything from \n     modeling and simulation, to data sharing, to joint \n     development of a regional missile defense architecture--all \n     designed to defend the United States, Europe, and Russia from \n     the growing threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. An \n     extraordinary series of transparency measures have also been \n     offered to reassure Russia. Despite some Russian reluctance \n     to sign up to these cooperative missile defense activities, \n     we continue to work toward this goal''.\n       (4) On July 6, 2009, President Barack Obama and Russian \n     President Dmitry Medvedev issued a joint statement on missile \n     defense issues, which stated that ``Russia and the United \n     States plan to continue the discussion concerning the \n     establishment of cooperation in responding to the challenge \n     of ballistic missile proliferation. . . We have instructed \n     our experts to work together to analyze the ballistic missile \n     challenges of the 21st century and to prepare appropriate \n     recommendations''.\n       (5) The February 2010 report of the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Review established as one of its central policy \n     pillars that increased international missile defense \n     cooperation is in the national security interest of the \n     United States and, with regard to cooperation with Russia, \n     the United States ``is pursuing a broad agenda focused on \n     shared early warning of missile launches, possible technical \n     cooperation, and even operational cooperation''.\n       (6) at the November 2010 Lisbon Summit, the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to develop a missile \n     defense system to ``protect NATO European populations, \n     territory and forces'' and also to seek cooperation with \n     Russia on missile defense. In its Lisbon Summit Declaration, \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reaffirmed its \n     readiness to ``invite Russia to explore jointly the potential \n     for linking current and planned missile defence systems at an \n     appropriate time in mutually beneficial ways''. The new NATO \n     Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon Summit states that \n     ``we will actively seek cooperation on missile defense with \n     Russia'', that ``NATO-Russia cooperation is of strategic \n     importance'', and that ``the security of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and Russia is intertwined''.\n       (7) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the leadership of the \n     Senate, President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization ``invited Russia to cooperate on missile \n     defense, which could lead to adding Russian capabilities to \n     those deployed by NATO to enhance our common security against \n     common threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the \n     Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving \n     NATO-Russian relations. This comes even as we have made clear \n     that the system we intend to pursue with Russia will not be a \n     joint system, and it will not in any way limit United States' \n     or NATO's missile defense capabilities. Effective cooperation \n     with Russia could enhance the overall efficiency of our \n     combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time \n     provide Russia with greater security''.\n       (8) Section 221(a)(3) of the Ike Skelton National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; \n     124 Stat. 4167) states that it is the sense of Congress ``to \n     support the efforts of the United States Government and the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pursue cooperation with \n     the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense relative \n     to Iranian missile threats''.\n       (9) In a speech in Russia on March 21, 2011, Secretary of \n     Defense Robert Gates cited ``the NATO-Russian decision to \n     cooperate on defense against ballistic missiles. We've \n     disagreed before, and Russia still has uncertainties about \n     the European Phased Adaptive Approach, a limited system that \n     poses no challenges to the large Russian nuclear arsenal. \n     However, we've mutually committed to resolving these \n     difficulties in order to develop a roadmap toward truly \n     effective anti-ballistic missile collaboration. This \n     collaboration may include exchanging launch information, \n     setting up a joint data fusion center, allowing greater \n     transparency with respect to our missile defense plans and \n     exercises, and conducting a joint analysis to determine areas \n     of future cooperation''.\n       (10) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on April 13, 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy Bradley H. \n     Roberts stated that the United States has been pursuing a \n     Defense Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia since \n     2004, and that such an agreement is necessary ``for the \n     safeguarding of sensitive information in support of \n     cooperation'' on missile defense, and to ``provide the legal \n     framework for undertaking cooperative efforts''. Further, Dr. \n     Roberts stated that the United States would not provide any \n     classified information to Russia without first conducting a \n     National Disclosure Policy review. He also stated that the \n     United States is not considering sharing ``hit-to-kill'' \n     technology with Russia.\n       (11) In a March 2012 answer to a question from the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia, Acting Under Secretary of Defense \n     for Policy Jim Miller wrote that ``I support U.S.-Russian \n     cooperation on missile defenses first and foremost because it \n     could improve the effectiveness of U.S. and NATO missile \n     defenses, thereby improving the protection of the United \n     States, our forces overseas, and our Allies. Missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia is in the security\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\n     interests of the United States, NATO, and Russia, first and \n     foremost because it could strengthen capabilities across \n     Europe to intercept Iranian missiles''. He also wrote that \n     ``[t]he United States has pursued missile defense cooperation \n     with Russia with the clear understanding that we would not \n     accept constraints on missile defense, and that we would \n     undertake necessary qualitative and quantitative improvements \n     to meet U.S. Security needs''.\n       (12) In February 2012, an international group of \n     independent experts known as the Euro-Atlantic Security \n     Initiative issued a report proposing missile defense \n     cooperation between the United States (with its North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization allies) and Russia. The group, \n     whose leaders included Stephen Hadley, the National Security \n     Advisor to President George W. Bush, proposed that the \n     nations share satellite and radar early warning data at joint \n     cooperation centers in order to improve their ability to \n     detect, track, and defeat medium-range and intermediate-range \n     ballistic missiles from the Middle East.\n       (13) In a letter dated April 13, 2012, Robert Nabors, \n     Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of \n     Legislative Affairs, wrote that ``it is Administration policy \n     that we will only provide information to Russia that will \n     enhance the effectiveness of our missile defenses. The \n     Administration will not provide Russia with sensitive \n     information that would in any way compromise our national \n     security, including hit-to-kill technology and interceptor \n     telemetry''.\n       (14) The United States and Russia already engage in \n     substantial cooperation on a number of international security \n     efforts, including nuclear nonproliferation, anti-piracy, \n     counter-narcotics, nuclear security, counter-terrorism, and \n     logistics resupply through Russia of coalition forces in \n     Afghanistan. These areas of cooperation require each side to \n     share and protect sensitive information, which they have both \n     done successfully.\n       (15) The United States currently has shared early warning \n     agreements and programs of cooperation with eight nations in \n     addition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The \n     United States has developed procedures and mechanisms for \n     sharing early warning information with partner nations while \n     ensuring the protection of sensitive United States \n     information.\n       (16) Russia and the United States each have missile launch \n     early warning and detection and tracking sensors that could \n     contribute to and enhance each others' ability to detect, \n     track, an defend against ballistic missile threats from Iran.\n       (17) The Obama Administration has provided regular \n     briefings to Congress on its discussions with Russia on \n     possible missile defense cooperation.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with \n     Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, \n     its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, and Russia, \n     particularly against missile threats from Iran;\n       (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile \n     defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral basis and \n     a multilateral basis with its North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia \n     Council;\n       (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not ``in \n     any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense \n     capabilities'', as acknowledged in the December 18, 2010, \n     letter from President Obama to the leadership of the Senate, \n     and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature;\n       (4) the United States should not provide Russia with \n     sensitive missile defense information that would in any way \n     compromise United States national security, including ``hit-\n     to-kill'' technology and interceptor telemetry; and\n       (5) the United States should pursue missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia in a manner that ensures that--\n       (A) United States classified information is appropriately \n     safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure;\n       (B) prior to sharing classified information with Russia, \n     the United States conducts a National Disclosure Policy \n     review and determines the types and levels of information \n     that may be shared and whether any additional procedures are \n     necessary to protect such information;\n       (C) prior to entering into missile defense technology \n     cooperation projects, the United States enters into a Defense \n     Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia that establishes \n     the legal framework for a broad spectrum of potential \n     cooperative defense projects; and\n       (D) such cooperation does not limit the missile defense \n     capabilities of the United States or its North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization allies.\n\n     SEC. 234. NEXT GENERATION EXO-ATMOSPHERIC KILL VEHICLE.\n\n       (a) Plan for Next Generation Kill Vehicle.--The Director of \n     the Missile Defense Agency shall develop a long-term plan for \n     the Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) that addresses both \n     modifications and enhancements to the current Exo-atmospheric \n     Kill Vehicle and options for the competitive development of a \n     next generation Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle for the Ground-\n     Based Interceptor (GBI) of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     (GMD) system and any other interceptor that might be \n     developed for the defense of the United States against long-\n     range ballistic missiles.\n       (b) Definition of Parameters and Capabilities.--\n       (1) Assessment required.--The Director shall define the \n     desired technical parameters and performance capabilities for \n     a next generation Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle using an \n     assessment conducted by the Director for that purpose that is \n     designed to ensure that a next generation Exo-atmospheric \n     Kill Vehicle design--\n       (A) enables ease of manufacturing, high tolerances to \n     production processes and supply chain variability, and \n     inherent reliability;\n       (B) will be optimized to take advantage of the Ballistic \n     Missile Defense System architecture and sensor system \n     capabilities;\n       (C) leverages all relevant kill vehicle development \n     activities and technologies, including from the current \n     Standard Missile-3 Block IIB (SM-3 IIB) program and the \n     previous Multiple Kill Vehicle technology development \n     program;\n       (D) seeks to maximize, to the greatest extent practicable, \n     commonality between subsystems of a next generation Exo-\n     atmospheric Kill Vehicle and other exo-atmospheric kill \n     vehicle programs; and\n       (E) meets Department of Defense criteria, as established in \n     the February 2010 Ballistic Missile Defense Review, for \n     affordability, reliability, suitability, and operational \n     effectiveness to defend against limited attacks from evolving \n     and future threats from long-range missiles.\n       (2) Evaluation of payloads.--The assessment required by \n     paragraph (1) shall include an evaluation of the potential \n     benefits and drawbacks of options for both unitary and \n     multiple Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle payloads.\n       (3) Standard missile-3 block iib interceptor.--As part of \n     the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Director shall \n     evaluate whether there are potential options and \n     opportunities arising from the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB \n     interceptor development program for development of an exo-\n     atmospheric kill vehicle, or kill vehicle technologies or \n     components, that could be used for potential upgrades to the \n     Ground-Based Interceptor or for a next generation Exo-\n     atmospheric Kill Vehicle.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Director shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report setting forth the \n     plan developed under subsection (a), including the results of \n     the assessment under subsection (b), and an estimate of the \n     cost and schedule of implementing the plan.\n       (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n     SEC. 235.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE SUBMITTAL TO CONGRESS OF \n                   THE HOMELAND DEFENSE HEDGING POLICY AND \n                   STRATEGY REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81; 125 Stat. 1340) \n     requires a homeland defense hedging policy and strategy \n     report from the Secretary of Defense.\n       (2) The report was required to be submitted not later than \n     75 days after the date of the enactment of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, namely by \n     March 16, 2012.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense has not yet submitted the \n     report as required.\n       (4) In March 2012, General Charles Jacoby, Jr., Commander \n     of the United States Northern Command, the combatant command \n     responsible for operation of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system to defend the homeland against ballistic \n     missile threats, testified before Congress that ``I am \n     confident in my ability to successfully defend the homeland \n     from the current set of limited long-range ballistic missile \n     threats'', and that ``[a]gainst current threats from the \n     Middle East, I am confident we are well postured''.\n       (5) Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) \n     is intended to augment the\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\n     currently deployed homeland defense capability of the Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense system against a potential future \n     Iranian long-range missile threat by deploying an additional \n     layer of forward-deployed interceptors in Europe in the 2020 \n     timeframe.\n       (6) The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \n     has testified to Congress that, although the intelligence \n     community does ``not know if Iran will eventually decide to \n     build nuclear weapons'', it judges ``that Iran would likely \n     choose missile delivery as its preferred method of delivering \n     a nuclear weapon''. He also testified that ``Iran already has \n     the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle \n     East, and it is expanding the scale, reach, and \n     sophistication of its ballistic missile forces, many of which \n     are inherently capable of carrying a nuclear payload''.\n       (7) The 2012 Annual Report to Congress on the Military \n     Power of Iran by the Department of Defense states that, in \n     addition to increasing its missile inventories, ``Iran has \n     boosted the lethality and effectiveness of its existing \n     missile systems with accuracy improvements and new \n     submunitions payloads'', and that it continues to develop \n     missiles that can strike Israel and Eastern Europe.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LATVIA AND \n                   OTHER NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION MEMBER \n                   NATIONS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NORTHERN \n                   DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The remote and austere environments in which United \n     States troops are required to operate as part of the \n     International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in \n     Afghanistan have increased the need for reliable lines of \n     supply in southwest Asia.\n       (2) The country of Afghanistan presents unique logistics \n     challenges, which have precipitated the development of \n     several redundant lines of supply.\n       (3) United States Transportation Command and the Defense \n     Logistics Agency (DLA), in consultation with United States \n     Embassy officials and other parties, have successfully \n     established memoranda of understanding and other agreements \n     with nations in and around southwest Asia to ensure the \n     reliability of lines of supply to Afghanistan.\n       (4) The lines of supply through Pakistan have been \n     repeatedly threatened by instability in that country. \n     Airlifting goods to Afghanistan, while safer, is expensive.\n       (5) The Northern Distribution Network (NDN) was established \n     in late 2008 to ensure that a safe and cost-effective line of \n     supply is available for United States troops in Afghanistan.\n       (6) The two prongs of supply provided by the Northern \n     Distribution Network ship nonlethal goods from the Baltic \n     ports in the north and the Caucauses in the west to southwest \n     Asia and Afghanistan.\n       (7) The Northern Distribution Network has been successful \n     and now handles more than 50 percent of cargo shipped to \n     Afghanistan.\n       (8) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member \n     nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes have \n     contributed significantly to the success of the Northern \n     Distribution Network.\n       (9) The United States has strong economic ties to Northern \n     Distribution Network nations that are members of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, and these nations may be able \n     to provide quality goods and services for near and long-term \n     use by the Department of Defense.\n       (10) Since 2009 the port of Riga, on the Baltic Sea, has \n     been a critical overland entry point for goods being shipped \n     using the Northern Distribution Network. Latvia is a member \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and has been an \n     ally of the United States in the region for many years.\n       (11) In September 2010, the Defense Logistics Agency, the \n     General Services Administration, and other parties hosted a \n     local procurement conference in Riga, Latvia.\n       (12) One hundred nine Latvian vendors attended the \n     September 2010 conference in Riga, and contracts with Latvian \n     vendors have been entered into as a result.\n       (13) In May 2012, Latvia hosted an international workshop \n     in Riga to examine ways of transforming the Northern \n     Distribution Network from a route for the delivery of United \n     States and other Allies' non-lethal goods to Afghanistan into \n     a commercial route that would support the economic growth of \n     Afghanistan and the southwest Asia region.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     member nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes \n     are key economic and security partners of the United States \n     and are to be commended for their contribution to ensuring \n     United States and International Security Assistance Force \n     troops have reliable lines of supply to achieve the mission \n     in Afghanistan;\n       (2) when quality products at competitive prices are \n     available, significant effort should be made to procure goods \n     locally from Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization member nations along the Northern Distribution \n     Network routes; and\n       (3) Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     member nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes \n     remain allies of the United States in the region, and a \n     mutually beneficial relationship should continue to be \n     cultivated between the United States and Latvia and such \n     other nations in the future.\n\n     SEC. 869.

SENSE OF SENATE ON POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS TO \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE NETWORKS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cybersecurity threats are pervasive and serious, \n     including through the supply chain of information technology \n     equipment and software.\n       (2) Semiconductor manufacturing is already dominated by \n     foreign producers, presenting supply chain risk management \n     challenges.\n       (3) In a number of instances, foreign manufacturers of \n     telecommunications equipment, including advanced wireless \n     technology, are gaining global market share due to high \n     quality and low prices. Competitive market forces ensure that \n     commercial providers of consumer, business, and government \n     systems and services will choose equipment and associated \n     software from these manufacturers. In some cases, like Huawei \n     Industries, this competitive position stems in part from \n     inappropriate government subsidies and other forms of \n     assistance.\n       (4) Some of these companies also present clear \n     cybersecurity supply chain risks that the Government must \n     address.\n       (5) The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United \n     States has blocked the attempt by Huawei to acquire United \n     States technology firms on two occasions and the National \n     Security Agency and the Secretary of Commerce have advised \n     two major United States telecommunications carriers against \n     selecting Huawei as a supplier.\n       (6) The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383) provided authority and \n     mechanisms for the Secretary of Defense to control these \n     supply chain risks, but only for National Security Systems, \n     leaving many information technology systems and missions \n     exposed to supply chain risks.\n       (7) Blocking sales from providers of information technology \n     systems and services due to concerns about cybersecurity \n     risks, while maintaining our commitment to free trade and \n     fair and transparent competition, poses difficult policy \n     challenges.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Department of Defense--\n       (1) must ensure it maintains full visibility and adequate \n     control of its supply chain, including subcontractors, in \n     order to mitigate supply chain exploitation; and\n       (2) needs the authority and capability to mitigate supply \n     chain risks to its information technology systems that fall \n     outside the scope of National Security Systems.\n\n     SEC. 935. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES CYBER \n                   COMMAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 23, 2009, the Secretary of Defense directed the \n     Commander of the United States Strategic Command to establish \n     the United States Cyber Command, which became operational on \n     May 21, 2010, and operates as a sub-unified command \n     subordinate to the United States Strategic Command.\n       (2) In May 2012, media reports indicated that General \n     Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     planned to recommend to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta \n     that the two-year-old United States Cyber Command be elevated \n     to full combatant command status.\n       (3) On August 14, 2012, General Keith Alexander, the \n     Commander of the United States Cyber Command and the Director \n     of the National Security Agency, addressed the TechNet Land \n     Forces conference and stated that ``[i]n 2007 we drafted . . \n     . a paper . . . about establishing a Cyber Command . . . \n     [which concluded that] . . . the most logical is to set it up \n     as a sub unified and grow it to a unified, and I think that's \n     the process that we're going to work our way through''.\n       (4) On October 11, 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta \n     discussed cybersecurity in a speech to the Business \n     Executives for National Security in New York, New York, \n     specifically calling for a strengthening of the United States \n     Cyber Command and stating that the Department of Defense \n     ``must ensure that [the United States Cyber Command] has the \n     resources, that it has the authorities, that it has the \n     capabilities required to perform this growing mission. And it \n     must also be able to react quickly to events unfolding in \n     cyberspace and help fully integrate cyber into all of the \n     department's plans and activities.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the serious cyber threat to national \n     security and the need to work both offensively and \n     defensively to protect the Nation's networks and critical \n     infrastructure;\n       (2) acknowledges the importance of the unified command \n     structure of the Department in directing military operations \n     in cyberspace and recognizes that a change in the status of \n     the United States Cyber Command has Department-wide and \n     national security implications, which require careful \n     consideration;\n       (3) expects to be briefed and consulted about any proposal \n     to elevate the United States Cyber Command to a unified \n     command before a decision by the Secretary make such a \n     proposal to the President and to receive, at a minimum--\n       (A) a clear statement of mission and related legal \n     definitions;\n       (B) an outline of the specific national security benefits \n     of elevating the sub-unified United States Cyber Command to a \n     unified command;\n       (C) an estimate of the cost of creating a unified United \n     States Cyber Command and a justification of the expenditure; \n     and\n       (D) if the Secretary considers it advisable to continue the \n     designation of the Commander of the United States Cyber \n     Command as also being the Director of the National Security \n     Agency--\n       (i) an explanation of how a single individual could serve \n     as a commander of a combatant command that conducts overt, \n     albeit clandestine, cyber operations under title 10, United \n     States Code, as well as the director of an intelligence \n     agency that conducts covert cyber operations under the \n     National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) in a \n     manner that affords deniability to the United States; and\n       (ii) a statement of whether the Secretary believes it is \n     appropriate either to appoint a line officer as the Director \n     of the National Security Agency or to take the unprecedented \n     step of appointing an intelligence officer as a unified \n     commander; and\n       (4) believes that appropriate policy foundations and \n     standing rules of engagement must be in place before any \n     decision to create a unified United States Cyber Command.\n\n     SEC. 936.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RECAPITALIZATION FOR THE NAVY \n                   AND COAST GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 70 percent of the world's surface is \n     comprised of navigable oceans.\n       (2) More than 80 percent of the population of the world \n     lives within 100 miles of an ocean.\n       (3) More than 90 percent of the world's commerce traverses \n     an oceans.\n       (4) The national security of the United States is \n     inextricably linked to the maintenance of global freedom of \n     access for both the strategic and commercial interests of the \n     United States.\n       (5) To maintain that freedom of access the sea services of \n     the United States, composed of the Navy, the Marine Corps, \n     and the Coast Guard, must be sufficiently positioned as \n     rotationally globally deployable forces with the capability \n     to decisively defend United States citizens, homeland, and \n     interests abroad from direct or asymmetric attack and must be \n     comprised of sufficient vessels to maintain global freedom of \n     action.\n       (6) To achieve appropriate capabilities to ensure national \n     security the Government of the United States must continue to \n     recapitalize the fleets of the Navy and Coast Guard and must \n     continue to conduct vital maintenance and repair of existing \n     vessels to ensure such vessels meet service life goals.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the sea services of the United States should be funded \n     and maintained to provide the broad spectrum of capabilities \n     required to protect the national security of the United \n     States;\n       (2) such capabilities should include--\n       (A) the ability to project United States power rapidly \n     anywhere on the globe without the need for host nation basing \n     permission or long and potentially vulnerable logistics \n     supply lines;\n       (B) the ability to land and recover maritime forces from \n     the sea for direct combat action, to evacuate United States \n     citizens from hostile situations, and to provide humanitarian \n     assistance where needed;\n       (C) the ability to operate from the subsurface with \n     overpowering conventional combat power, as well as strategic \n     deterrence; and\n       (D) the ability to operate in collaboration with United \n     States maritime partners in the common interest of preventing \n     piracy at sea and maintaining the commercial sea lanes \n     available for global commerce;\n       (3) the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the \n     Secretary of the Navy, should maintain the recapitalization \n     plans for the Navy as a priority in all future force \n     structure decisions; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security should maintain the \n     recapitalization plans for the Coast Guard as a priority in \n     all future force structure decisions.\n\n     SEC. 1024.

Vessels of the \n     Continental Navy were named for early patriots and military \n     heroes, Federal institutions, colonial cities, and positive \n     character traits representative of naval and military \n     virtues.\n       (2) An Act of Congress on March 3, 1819, made the Secretary \n     of the Navy responsible for assigning names to vessels of the \n     Navy. Traditional sources for vessel names customarily \n     encompassed such categories as geographic locations in the \n     United States; historic sites, battles, and ships; naval and \n     military heroes and leaders; and noted individuals who made \n     distinguished contributions to United States national \n     security.\n       (3) These customs and traditions provide appropriate and \n     necessary standards for the naming of vessels of the Navy.\n       (b) Notice to Congress.--Section 7292 of title 10, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(d)(1) The Secretary of the Navy may not announce or \n     implement any proposal to name a vessel of the Navy until 30 \n     days after the date on which the Secretary submits to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives a report setting forth such proposal.\n       ``(2) Each report under this subsection shall describe the \n     justification for the proposal covered by such report in \n     accordance with the standards referred to in section 1024(a) \n     of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2013.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section and the amendment made by \n     this section shall go into effect on the date that is 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n                     Subtitle D-- Counterterrorism\n\n     SEC. 1031.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NON-UNITED STATES CITIZENS \n                   WHO ARE GRADUATES OF UNITED STATES EDUCATIONAL \n                   INSTITUTIONS WITH ADVANCED DEGREES IN SCIENCE, \n                   TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is a national security concern that more than half \n     of all graduates with advanced scientific and technical \n     degrees from United States institutions of higher education \n     are non-United States citizens who have very limited \n     opportunities upon graduation to contribute to the science \n     and technology activities of the Department of Defense and \n     the United States defense industrial base.\n       (2) The capabilities of the Armed Forces are highly reliant \n     upon advanced technologies that provide our forces with a \n     technological edge on the battlefield.\n       (3) In order to maintain and advance our military \n     technological superiority, the United States requires the \n     best and brightest scientists, mathematicians, and engineers \n     to discover, develop, and field the next generation of weapon \n     systems and defense technologies.\n       (4) The Department of Defense and the defense industrial \n     base compete with other sectors for a limited number of \n     United States citizens who have appropriate advanced degrees \n     and skills.\n       (5) While an overarching national priority is to increase \n     the numbers of United States citizens who have appropriate \n     advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and \n     mathematics (STEM), it would be beneficial if the Department \n     of Defense and the defense industrial base were able to \n     access the pool of talent of non-United States citizens with \n     advanced scientific and technical degrees from United States \n     institutions of higher education, many of whom are otherwise \n     returning to their home countries.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--\n       (1) that the Department of Defense should make every \n     reasonable and practical effort to increase the number of \n     United States citizens who pursue advanced degrees in \n     science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and\n       (2) to strongly urge the Department of Defense to \n     investigate innovative mechanisms (subject to all appropriate \n     security requirements) to access to the pool of talent of \n     non-United States citizens with advanced scientific and \n     technical degrees from United States institutions of higher \n     education, especially in those scientific and technical areas \n     that are most vital to the national defense (such as those \n     identified by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research \n     and Engineering and the Armed Forces).\n\n     SEC. 1084. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE MAINTENANCE BY THE UNITED \n                   STATES OF A TRIAD OF STRATEGIC NUCLEAR DELIVERY \n                   SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The April 2010 Nuclear Posture Review concluded that \n     even with the reductions specified in the New START Treaty, \n     the United States should retain a nuclear ``Triad'' of land-\n     based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched \n     ballistic missiles and nuclear capable heavy bombers, noting \n     that ``[r]etaining all three Triad legs will best maintain \n     strategic stability at reasonable cost, while hedging against \n     potential technical problems or vulnerabilities''.\n       (2) The resolution of ratification for the New START \n     Treaty, which the Senate approved on December 22, 2010, \n     stated that ``it is the sense of the Senate that United \n     States deterrence and flexibility is assured by a robust \n     triad of strategic delivery vehicles. To this end, the United \n     States is committed to accomplishing the modernization and \n     replacement of its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and \n     to ensuring the continued flexibility of United States \n     conventional and nuclear delivery systems''.\n       (3) In a message to the Senate on February 2, 2011, \n     President Obama certified that he intended to ``modernize or \n     replace the triad of strategic nuclear delivery systems: a \n     heavy bomber and air-launched cruise missile, an ICBM, and a \n     nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) and SLBM'' \n     and to ``maintain the United States rocket motor industrial \n     base''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should maintain a triad of strategic \n     nuclear delivery systems; and\n       (2) the United States is committed to modernizing the \n     component weapons and delivery systems of that triad.\n\n     SEC. 1085. PLAN TO PARTNER WITH STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO \n                   ADDRESS VETERANS CLAIMS BACKLOG.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs defines any claim \n     for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs as backlogged if the claim has been pending \n     for 125 days or more.\n       (2) According to the Department, as of November 24, 2012, \n     there were 899,540 pending claims, with 604,583 (67.2 \n     percent) of those considered backlogged.\n       (3) The Department's data further shows that, on November \n     22, 2010, there were 749,934 claims pending, with only \n     244,129 (32.6 percent) of those considered backlogged.\n       (4) During the past two years, both the overall number of \n     backlogged claims and the percentage of all pending claims \n     that are backlogged have doubled.\n       (5) In order to reduce the claims backlog at regional \n     offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs located in \n     Texas, the Texas Veterans Commission announced two \n     initiatives on July 19, 2012, to partner with the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs--\n       (A) to assist veterans whose claims are already backlogged \n     to complete development of those claims; and\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\n       (B) to help veterans who are filing new claims to fully \n     develop those claims prior to filing them, shortening the \n     processing time required.\n       (6) The common goal of the two initiatives of the Texas \n     Veterans Commission, called the ``Texas State Strike Force \n     Team'' and the ``Fully Developed Claims Team Initiative'', is \n     to reduce the backlog of claims pending in Texas by 17,000 \n     within one year.\n       (7) During the first two months of these new initiatives, \n     the Texas Veterans Commission helped veterans complete \n     development of more than 2,500 backlogged claims and assisted \n     veterans with the submission of more than 800 fully developed \n     claims.\n       (8) In testimony before the Subcommittee on Disability \n     Assistance and Memorial Affairs of the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 21, \n     2012, Diana Rubens, Deputy Under Secretary for Field \n     Operations of the Veterans Benefits Administration, indicated \n     that the Department of Veterans Affairs has experienced \n     positive outcomes in projects with the Texas Veterans \n     Commission, stating that both Veterans Service Organizations \n     ``and state and county service officers . . . are important \n     partners in VBA's transformation to better serve Veterans.''.\n       (9) At the same hearing, Mr. John Limpose, director of the \n     regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in \n     Waco, Texas, testified that the ``TVC is working very, very \n     well'' with regional offices of the Department in Texas, \n     calling the Texas Veterans Commission a ``very positive story \n     that we can branch out into . . . all of our stakeholders.''.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall submit to Congress a plan to reduce the current backlog \n     of pending claims for benefits under laws administered by the \n     Secretary and more efficiently process claims for such \n     benefits in the future.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A summary of all steps the Secretary has taken thus far \n     to partner with non-Federal entities in support of efforts to \n     reduce the backlog described in paragraph (1) and more \n     efficiently process claims described in such paragraph in the \n     future, including two previous initiatives by the Texas \n     Veterans Commission, namely the 2008-2009 Development \n     Assistant Pilot Project and the 2009-2011 Claims Processing \n     Assistance Team.\n       (B) A plan for the Secretary to partner with non-Federal \n     entities to support efforts to reduce such backlog and more \n     efficiently process such claims in the future, including the \n     following:\n       (i) State and local agencies relating to veterans affairs.\n       (ii) Organizations recognized by the Secretary for the \n     representation of veterans under section 5902 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       (iii) Such other relevant government and non-government \n     entities as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (C) A description of how the Secretary intends to leverage \n     partnerships with non-Federal entities described in \n     subparagraph (B) to eliminate such backlog, including through \n     increasing the percentage of claims that are fully developed \n     prior to submittal to the Secretary and ensuring that new \n     claims are fully developed prior to their submittal.\n       (D) A description of what steps the Secretary has taken and \n     will take--\n       (i) to expedite the processing of claims that are already \n     fully developed at the time of submittal; and\n       (ii) to support initiatives by non-Federal entities \n     described in subparagraph (B) to help claimants gather and \n     submit necessary evidence for claims that were previously \n     filed but require further development.\n       (E) A description of how partnerships with non-Federal \n     entities described in subparagraph (B) will fit into the \n     Secretary's overall claims processing transformation plan.\n\n     SEC. 1086. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROTECTION OF DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE AIRFIELDS, TRAINING AIRSPACE, AND AIR \n                   TRAINING ROUTES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Department of Defense airfields, training airspace, and \n     air training routes are national treasures that must be \n     protected from encroachment;\n       (2) placement or emplacement of obstructions near or on \n     Department of Defense airfields, training airspace, or air \n     training routes has the potential of increasing risk to \n     military aircraft and personnel as well as impacting training \n     and readiness; and\n       (3) the Department of Defense should develop comprehensive \n     rules and regulations to address construction and use of land \n     in close proximity to Department of Defense airfields, \n     training areas, or air training routes to ensure \n     compatibility with military aircraft operations.\n\n     SEC. 1087.

PLAN FOR PROMOTING THE SECURITY OF AFGHAN WOMEN \n                   AND GIRLS DURING THE SECURITY TRANSITION \n                   PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Defense's April 2012 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan:\n       (A) ``U.S. and coalition forces will continue to degrade \n     the Taliban-led insurgency in order to provide time and space \n     to increase the capacity of the Afghan National Security \n     Forces and the Afghan Government so they can assume full \n     responsibility for Afghanistan's security by the end of \n     2014.''\n       (B) ``Transition to Afghan security lead began in July 2011 \n     and transition to full Afghan security responsibility will be \n     complete country-wide by the end of 2014.''\n       (C) ``The security of the Afghan people and the stability \n     of the government are used to judge provincial readiness to \n     move to each successive stage of transition implementation.''\n       (D) For each area designated for transition, a transition \n     implementation plan is developed by the Government of \n     Afghanistan, NATO, and ISAF and approved by the Joint Afghan-\n     NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB). JANIB is also responsible for \n     recommending areas to enter and exit the transition process.\n       (2) According to a 2002 study on Women, Peace and Security \n     submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations \n     pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), ``the \n     suspension of or restriction on women's enjoyment of their \n     human rights'' can act as an early-warning indicator of \n     impending or renewed conflict. In Afghanistan, restrictions \n     on women's mobility and rights can signal the presence of \n     extremist or insurgent elements in a community.\n       (3) The security of Afghan women and girls in areas \n     undergoing security transitions will be an important gauge of \n     the transition strategy's success. Indicators by which to \n     measure women's security include the mobility of women and \n     girls, the participation of women in local government bodies, \n     the rate of school attendance for girls, women's access to \n     government services, and the prevalence of violence against \n     women.\n       (4) Maintaining and improving physical security for Afghan \n     women and girls throughout the country is critical in order \n     for women and girls to take advantage of opportunities in \n     education, commerce, politics, and other areas of public \n     life, which in turn is essential for the future stability and \n     prosperity of Afghanistan.\n       (5) Women who serve as public officials at all levels of \n     the Government of Afghanistan face serious threats to their \n     personal security and that of their families. Many female \n     officials have been the victims of violent crimes, but they \n     are generally not afforded official protection by the \n     Government of Afghanistan or security forces.\n       (6) Protecting the security and human rights of Afghan \n     women and girls requires the involvement of Afghan men and \n     boys through education about the important benefits of \n     women's\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\n     full participation in social, economic, and political life. \n     Male officials and security personnel can play a particularly \n     important role in supporting and protecting women and girls.\n       (7) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n     2012 states: ``As the Afghan National Police further develop \n     and professionalize, they will evolve towards a sustainable, \n     credible, and accountable civilian law enforcement force that \n     will shoulder the main responsibility for domestic security. \n     This force should be capable of providing policing services \n     to the Afghan population as part of the broader Afghan rule \n     of law system.''\n       (8) Women face significant barriers to full participation \n     in the ANA and ANP, including a discriminatory or hostile \n     work environment and the lack of separate facilities designed \n     for female personnel.\n       (9) As of September 2012, female recruitment and retention \n     rates for the Afghan National Security Forces are far below \n     published targets, as follows:\n       (A) Approximately 1,700 women serve in the Afghan National \n     Security Forces, or less than half of one percent of the \n     total force.\n       (B) In 2010, President Hamid Karzai announced plans to \n     recruit and train 5,000 women in the Afghan National Police, \n     or approximately 3 percent of the force, by 2014. Currently, \n     there are approximately 1,370 women in the ANP, or 0.87 \n     percent of the police force.\n       (C) Approximately 350 women currently serve in the Afghan \n     National Army, representing only 0.17 percent of the force. \n     The Government of Afghanistan has said that its goal is to \n     achieve a force that is 10 percent female. As of May 2012, \n     approximately 3 percent of new ANA recruits were women.\n       (10) Male security personnel often do not respond to \n     threats or incidences of violence against women, particularly \n     at the local level. They largely lack the training and \n     understanding needed to respond appropriately and effectively \n     to situations involving women. According to the Department of \n     Defense's April 2012 Report on Progress Toward Security and \n     Stability in Afghanistan:\n       (A) The Afghan Ministry of Defense ``lacks the combination \n     of policies, procedures, and execution to promote opportunity \n     and fair and respectful treatment of women in the force''.\n       (B) The Afghan Ministry of Interior ``faces significant \n     challenges in fully integrating and protecting women in the \n     ANP workforce, especially among operational units at the \n     provincial and district levels''.\n       (C) In the Afghan National Police, ``Many Provincial \n     Headquarters Commanders do not accept policewomen, as they \n     prefer male candidates and lack adequate facilities to \n     support females.''\n       (D) ``While women are greatly needed to support police \n     operations, a combination of cultural impediments, weak \n     recruitment, and uneven application of policies hinder \n     significant progress.''\n       (E) ``Although stronger documentation, implementation, and \n     enforcement of policies, procedures, and guidance to better \n     integrate women will help, time will be needed to change the \n     cultural mores that form the basis of many of the current \n     impediments.''\n       (11) The United States, the North American Treaty \n     Organization, and United States coalition partners have made \n     firm commitments to support the human rights of the women and \n     girls of Afghanistan, as evidenced by the following actions:\n       (A) According to the United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace and Security, ``integrating women and gender \n     considerations into peace-building processes helps promote \n     democratic governance and long-term stability,'' which are \n     key United States strategic goals in Afghanistan.\n       (B) The National Action Plan also states that ``the \n     engagement and protection of women as agents of peace and \n     stability will be central to United States efforts to promote \n     security, prevent, respond to, and resolve conflict, and \n     rebuild societies.'' This policy applies to United States \n     Government efforts in Afghanistan, where addressing the \n     security vulnerabilities of Afghan women and girls during the \n     period of security transition is an essential step toward \n     long-term stability.\n       (C) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n     2012 states: ``We emphasize the importance of full \n     participation of all Afghan women in the reconstruction, \n     political, peace and reconciliation processes in Afghanistan \n     and the need to respect the institutional arrangements \n     protecting their rights. We remain committed to the \n     implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     (UNSCR) 1325 on women, peace and security. We recognize also \n     the need for the protection of children from the damaging \n     effects of armed conflict as required in relevant UNSCRs.''\n       (12) The Strategic Partnership Agreement signed between the \n     United States and Afghanistan by President Obama and \n     President Karzai in June 2012 states, ``Consistent with its \n     Constitution and international obligations, Afghanistan shall \n     ensure and advance the essential role of women in society, so \n     that they may fully enjoy their economic, social, political, \n     civil and cultural rights.''\n       (b) Plan To Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in \n     concurrence with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a plan to promote the \n     security of Afghan women during the security transition \n     process.\n       (2) Elements.--The plan required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following elements:\n       (A) A plan to monitor and respond to changes in women's \n     security conditions in areas undergoing transition, including \n     the following actions:\n       (i) Seeking to designate a Civilian Impact Advisor on the \n     Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB) to assess the impact \n     of transition on male and female civilians and ensure that \n     efforts to protect women's rights and security are included \n     in each area's transition implementation plan.\n       (ii) Reviewing existing indicators against which sex-\n     disaggregated data is collected and, if necessary, developing \n     additional indicators, to ensure the availability of data \n     that can be used to measure women's security, such as--\n\n       (I) the mobility of women and girls;\n       (II) the participation of women in local government bodies;\n       (III) the rate of school attendance for girls;\n       (IV) women's access to government services; and\n       (V) the prevalence of violence against women; and \n     incorporating those indicators into ongoing efforts to assess \n     overall security conditions during the transition period.\n\n       (iii) Integrating assessments of women's security into \n     current procedures used to determine an area's readiness to \n     proceed through the transition process.\n       (iv) Working with Afghan partners, coalition partners, and \n     relevant United States Government departments and agencies to \n     take concrete action to support women's rights and security \n     in cases of deterioration in women's security conditions \n     during the transition period.\n       (B) A plan to increase gender awareness and responsiveness \n     among Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police \n     personnel, including the following actions:\n       (i) Working with Afghan and coalition partners to utilize \n     training curricula and programming that addresses the human \n     rights of women and girls, appropriate responses to threats \n     against women and girls, and appropriate behavior toward \n     female colleagues and members of the community;

REGIONAL RADIOLOGICAL SECURITY ZONES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A terrorist attack using high-activity radiological \n     materials, such as in a dirty bomb, could inflict billions of \n     dollars of economic costs and considerable societal and \n     economic dislocation, with effects and costs possibly lasting \n     for years.\n       (2) It may be easier for terrorists to obtain the materials \n     for, and to fabricate, a dirty bomb than an improvised \n     nuclear device.\n       (3) Radiological materials are in widespread use worldwide, \n     with estimates of the number of radiological sources ranging \n     from 100,000 to millions.\n       (4) Many nations have a security and regulatory regime for \n     their radiological sources that is much less developed than \n     that of the United States.\n       (5) Radiological materials are used at many civilian sites \n     including hospitals, industrial sites, and other locations \n     that have little security, placing these materials at risk of \n     theft.\n       (6) Many radiological materials have become lost, disused, \n     unwanted, or abandoned, with the Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative of the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     having recovered more than 30,000 radioactive sources in the \n     United States, repatriated more than 2,400 United States-\n     origin sources from other countries, and helped recover more \n     than 13,000 radioactive sources and radioisotope \n     thermoelectric generators in other countries.\n       (7) High-activity radiological materials can be used in a \n     dirty bomb.\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     United States and global nonproliferation efforts should \n     place a high priority on programs to secure high-activity \n     radiological sources to reduce the threat of radiological \n     terrorism.\n       (c) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the National \n     Nuclear Security Administration shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a study in accordance with \n     paragraph (3).\n       (2) Consultation.--The Administrator may, in conducting the \n     study required under paragraph (1), consult with the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and such other departments and \n     agencies of the United States Government as the Administrator \n     considers appropriate.\n       (3) Matters included.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the radioactive isotopes and \n     associated activity levels that present the greatest risk to \n     national and international security.\n       (B) A review of current United States Government efforts to \n     secure radiological materials abroad, including coordination \n     with foreign governments, the European Union, the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, other international \n     programs, and nongovernmental organizations that identify, \n     register, secure, remove, and provide for the disposition of \n     high-risk radiological materials worldwide.\n       (C) A review of current United States Government efforts to \n     secure radiological materials domestically at civilian sites, \n     including hospitals, industrial sites, and other locations.\n       (D) A definition of regional radiological security zones, \n     including the subset of the materials of concern to be the \n     immediate focus and the security best practices required to \n     achieve that goal.\n       (E) An assessment of the feasibility, cost, desirability, \n     and added benefit of establishing regional radiological \n     security zones in high priority areas worldwide in order to \n     facilitate regional collaboration in--\n       (i) identifying and inventorying high-activity radiological \n     sources at high-risk sites;\n       (ii) reviewing national level regulations, inspections, \n     transportation security, and security upgrade options; and\n       (iii) assessing opportunities for the harmonization of \n     regulations and security practices among the nations of the \n     region.\n       (F) An assessment of the feasibility, cost, desirability, \n     and added benefit of establishing remote regional monitoring \n     centers that would receive real-time data from radiological \n     security sites, would be staffed by trained personnel from \n     the countries in the region, and would alert local law \n     enforcement in the event of a potential or actual terrorist \n     incident or other emergency.\n       (G) A list and assessment of the best practices used in the \n     United States that are most critical in enhancing domestic \n     radiological material security and could be used to enhance \n     radiological security worldwide.\n       (H) An assessment of the United States entity or entities \n     that would be best suited to lead efforts to establish a \n     radiological security zone program.\n       (I) An estimate of the costs associated with the \n     implementation of a radiological security zone program.\n       (J) An assessment of the known locations outside the United \n     States housing high-risk radiological materials in excess of \n     1,000 curies.\n       (4) Form.--The study required under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n       (d) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON OVERSIGHT OF THE NUCLEAR \n                   SECURITY ENTERPRISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     was established as an independent entity within the \n     Department of Energy to manage and secure the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile of the United States and to manage nuclear \n     nonproliferation and naval reactor programs.\n       (2) Serious security and health incidents continue to occur \n     at sites of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n       (3) In September 2012, an official of the Government \n     Accountability Office testified to Congress that lax \n     laboratory attitudes toward safety procedures, laboratory \n     inadequacies in identifying and addressing safety problems \n     with appropriate corrective actions, and inadequate oversight \n     by site offices of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration were responsible for nearly 100 safety \n     incidents since 2000.\n       (4) On July 28, 2012, three unarmed individuals compromised \n     security at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee, and according to the Government Accountability \n     Office, ``gained access to the protected security area \n     directly adjacent to one of the nation's most critically \n     important nuclear weapons-related facilities''.\n       (5) In June 2006, hackers attacked an unclassified computer \n     system at the National Nuclear Security Administration's \n     Service Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and gained access \n     to a file containing the names and social security numbers of \n     more than 1,500 employees of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (6) As early as February 2005, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Energy identified problems with the retrieval \n     of badges from terminated employees at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory and other sites of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (7) In 2004, a pattern of safety and security incidents \n     that occurred over the course of a year prompted the stand-\n     down of Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (8) The National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     independent of the safety and security reform efforts of the \n     Department of Energy, has launched an overhaul of its \n     contracting oversight, placing an emphasis on contractor \n     self-policing through an untested ``contractor assurance'' \n     approach.\n       (9) The Government Accountability Office has given the \n     contractor administration and project management capabilities \n     of the National Nuclear Security Administration a ``high \n     risk'' designation and found there to be insufficient \n     qualified Federal acquisition professionals to ``plan, \n     direct, and oversee project execution''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there is a need for strong, independent oversight of \n     the United States nuclear security enterprise;\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\n       (2) any attempt to reform oversight of the nuclear security \n     enterprise that transfers oversight from the Department of \n     Energy to the National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     reduces protections for worker health and safety at \n     facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration to \n     levels below the standards of the Department of Energy, or \n     transfers construction appropriations for the nuclear \n     security enterprise from the Department of Energy \n     appropriation account to the military construction \n     appropriation account, should be carefully evaluated;\n       (3) the Office of Health, Safety, and Security of the \n     Department of Energy, which reports to the Secretary of \n     Energy but is also accountable for routinely reporting to \n     Congress on the performance with respect to safety and \n     security of the Department, including the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, and the role of that Office in \n     overseeing safety and security at the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, should not be diminished but should \n     be routinely evaluated;\n       (4) any future modifications to the management or structure \n     of the nuclear security enterprise should be done in a way \n     that maintains or increases oversight of critical \n     construction, security, and acquisition capabilities;\n       (5) to the extent possible, oversight of programs of the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration by the Department of \n     Defense should increase to ensure current and future \n     warfighting requirements are met; and\n       (6) the Nuclear Weapons Council should provide proper \n     oversight in the execution of its responsibilities under \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code.\n\n            Subtitle E--American Medical Isotopes Production\n\n     SEC. 3151.

Madam President, I now lay before the Senate a message \nfrom the House with respect to H.R. 2838.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2838) entitled ``An Act to authorize appropriations for \n     the Coast Guard for fiscal years 2012 through 2015, and for \n     other purposes.'', do pass with amendments.\n\n\n                     american Fisheries Act Vessels\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from the State of Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, and my colleague \nfrom the State of Washington, Ms. Cantwell, regarding a provision in \nH.R. 2838, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012, \nthat deals with two great fisheries of the Bering Sea. The American \nFisheries Act--AFA--regulates one of the single greatest fishery \nresources in the world: Alaska Pollock. This fishery produces over 2 \nbillion pounds of product in most years and is sustainably harvested, \nthanks to standards set under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act. Amendment 80 to the Bering Sea Groundfish Fishery \nManagement Plan regulates fishing for other species of groundfish like \nPacific cod, Atka mackerel and yellowfin sole and while smaller than \nthe AFA fishery, it still ranks among the major fisheries of the world.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I agree these are two great fisheries \nand economic drivers of our thriving seafood industry. I have a \nquestion about Section 307 of H.R. 2838, which I understand is intended \nto clarify longstanding restrictions that have applied with respect to \ncertain vessels under the American Fisheries Act. I know that Senator \nCantwell and the senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, have \nworked with Senator Begich and others to develop this language for \ninclusion in the final version of the Coast Guard bill as received from \nthe other body last week, and I think it is important for us to make \nclear what it is intended to do. I am told that this provision is \ndesigned to maintain and reinforce the separation that exists between \nthese two fisheries, and nothing more. Currently, none of these 20 AFA \nvessels participate in the Amendment 80 fishery, and under Amendment 97 \nto the Bering Sea Fishery Management Plan they are expressly prohibited \nfrom doing so. Is it true that Section 307 maintains this separation?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Murkowski raising \nthis issue, as I know it is of great importance to both our States, and \nI am happy to discuss the intent and effect of the provision to which \nshe is referring. Senator Murray and I have worked closely with Senator \nBegich, with the Commerce Committee, and with our colleagues in the \nother body to develop this language for inclusion in the Coast Guard \nbill. Section 307 of H.R. 2838 does, as Senator Murkowski states, \nclarify longstanding restrictions that apply to certain vessels under \nthe American Fisheries Act. The intent of this language is to maintain \nthe status quo between two separate and distinct fisheries: one \nregulated under the American Fisheries Act and the other by Amendment \n80 to the Bering Sea Fishery Management Plan. There has always been a \ncareful balance struck between these two sectors, and we need to \nmaintain that balance in order to protect the investments and job \nopportunities they provide. This language is in no way intended to \nupset that balance, but rather to insure that the status quo of \nseparate and mutually exclusive sectors remains in place while \naffording the Amendment 80 fleet the opportunity to replace their older \nvessels with new ones and to encourage the economic investments that \nwould follow.\n  Mr. BEGICH Madam President, as chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee \non Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and the Coast Guard, I concur with my \ncolleagues that this is an important provision, and I want to reiterate \nthat it is only designed to maintain and reinforce the separation \nbetween these two fisheries, and nothing more. As NOAA informed our \noffices via email this week: ``There is currently a regulatory \nprohibition on AFA vessels from being used as replacement vessels in \nthe Amendment 80 fleet. The concerns addressed in the assistance \naddress what would occur if that regulatory prohibition were to be \nremoved. Subject to judicial interpretation, any change to the status \nquo would need to be made through the Council's and NOAA Fisheries' \nrulemaking process and is unlikely to occur in the near future.''\n  I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                             survival craft\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as my colleagues know, I was the lead \nSenate author of the Americans with Disabilities Act the ADA. The ADA \nstands for a simple proposition--that disability is a natural part of \nthe human experience and that all people with disabilities have a right \nto make choices and participate fully in all aspects of society. Thanks \nto the ADA, our country has become a more welcoming place not just for \npeople with a variety of disabilities but for everyone.\n  In that context, I want to raise an issue in H.R. 2838, the Coast \nGuard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012. Under current law, there \nis a provision that requires that no survival craft allow a person to \nbe submerged in water. H.R. 2838 requires a study and report on this \nrequirement to be completed within 6 months. While I have no objection \nto the Coast Guard doing another report on the issue, I want to be sure \nthat this study will appropriately take into account the specific needs \nof people with a diverse variety of disabilities who may need to \nutilize these survival craft. For example, my expectation is that the \nstudy would not recommend that all individuals be required to hold on \nto the outside of the survival craft or other items, since an \nindividual with a significant disability may not be able to do so, as a \nresult of their disability. In addition, it is important that not only \nthe means of egress, but also the avenues for evacuation and rescue \nshould be accessible for people with disabilities.\n  I would also want to be sure that the study will be completed within \nthe 6 month designated period.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments \nof\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\nthe Senator from Iowa. My expectation is that the Coast Guard study and \nreport will include the consideration of the specific needs of \nindividuals with disabilities with respect to their use of survival \ncraft, and will not make any recommendations that could be considered \ndiscriminatory against people with disabilities, or require individuals \nwith disabilities to perform actions which they may be unable to do as \na result of their specific disability. The goal of the study and report \nshould be an inclusive one which allows people with disabilities to \nparticipate fully in the underlying activity, and provides a full and \nequal opportunity for each person with a disability to utilize these \nsurvival craft in a safe manner, as necessary. I will continue to work \nwith my colleague from Iowa and the Coast Guard on these issues and I \nwill encourage the Coast Guard to complete their report within the 6 \nmonth period so that new requirements will take effect in a timely \nmanner.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr President, I appreciate the efforts of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with him to assure that individuals with \ndisabilities have access to survival craft that will properly protect \nthem from injury.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the final \npassage of a reconciled Coast Guard authorization bill for fiscal years \n2013 and 2014. This achievement is the culmination of several months of \ncareful negotiation between the Senate and the House, and is a tribute \nto what can happen when we rise above trivial partisanship, roll up our \nsleeves, and reach across the aisle on behalf of the American people.\n  The United States Coast Guard is truly unique among the services and \nagencies of the Federal Government. As a branch of our Armed Forces, it \ndefends the Nation in time of war, but it also functions as a Federal \nagency with law enforcement and regulatory authority in a number of \nareas critical to our national security, economic security, and \nenvironment. Today, the Coast Guard is charged with 11 statutory \nmissions that include saving lives at sea; protecting our ports, \nwaterways, and maritime infrastructure from terrorists; responding to \nnatural disasters; interdicting drugs and migrants at sea; and \nprotecting our marine environment.\n  Each and every day, we ask the 42,000 men and women of the Coast \nGuard to put their lives on the line to carry out these important \nmissions. Over the past few years, we have seen the Coast Guard take \nthe lead in responding to numerous crises like Hurricanes Katrina and \nSandy, the earthquake in Haiti, and the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. \nIn all of these cases, the Coast Guard has met and exceeded our \nexpectations. We have asked them to do more with less and they have \nresponded. The least we can do is to make sure they have the tools \nessential to carrying out their missions successfully. With the passage \nof this year's Coast Guard reauthorization bill, I believe we're on our \nway towards meeting that responsibility.\n  This bipartisan bill authorizes additional funding and personnel \nlevels for the Coast Guard over fiscal years 2013 and 2014, improving \nits ability to carry out its three overarching roles of maritime \nsecurity, safety and stewardship successfully. The bill also makes a \nnumber of changes to the Coast Guard's major acquisitions authorities \ncritical to the ongoing and needed recapitalization of its aging fleet. \nAdditionally, the bill addresses America's increasing presence in a \nchanging Arctic by ensuring that the Coast Guard maintains and \nstrengthens its capability to conduct polar ice operations in support \nof its statutory missions and operational needs of the United States \nNavy. Importantly, the bill also gives the Coast Guard greater parity \nwith its sister Armed Services by further aligning Coast Guard \nmanagement and personnel authorities with statutory authorities of the \nDepartment of Defense to better support its service members and their \nfamilies.\n  The bill's passage would not have been successful without the \ntireless efforts of many here in Congress. I first want to thank \nSenator Begich, who, after assuming the chairmanship of the Oceans \nSubcommittee at the beginning of this Congress, quickly went to work on \ndrafting the Senate's version of the Coast Guard bill. His legislation, \nof which I was a proud cosponsor, served as a blueprint for the \nSenate's negotiations with the House.\n  I also want to thank my dear friend and ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Hutchison. Her efforts were instrumental to \nmoving the ball down the field. It is increasingly difficult to get \nconsensus in this body, particularly for legislation that needs \nunanimity. Without her efforts to hammer out differences across the \naisle, today's achievement would not have been possible. Senator \nHutchison will be missed.\n  In recent weeks, much attention was given to the efforts to pass \nneeded reauthorization for the Department of Defense and each of the \nArmed Services under it. It was a tough slog, but in the end it \ndemonstrated what can be achieved when the Senate works as it should. \nIn its own quiet way, the passage of this legislation for this \nessential service branch is a testament to that as well.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I further ask that the Senate immediately proceed to a \nvoice vote on a motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \namendment to H.R. 2838.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I further ask that the motion to reconsider be made and \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. To conclude, this is the Coast Guard reauthorization \nbill. It is a bill that has taken a while to work out between all of \nthe parties, but it has incredible value, obviously, for my home State \nof Alaska and for the Presiding Officer's home State of Washington and \nfor, really, the country to make sure we have the right elements for \nour Coast Guard. It is very exciting to see it now moves from this \nside, and we anticipate the House will accept it.\n  So thank you very much, Madam President. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7973-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7973-S7974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW WALKER\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding \nservice provided by one of my long-serving staff members, Matthew \nWalker, to the Small Business Committee, our beloved home State of \nMaine, and indeed our Nation. Matt is a dedicated individual whose \nenthusiasm and insights will be sorely missed. As he moves on to the \nnext step in his professional life, I wish him the best and thank him \nfor his years of service.\n  A native son of Bangor, ME, Matt attended my alma mater, the \nUniversity of Maine, before earning his Juris Doctor from the Maine \nSchool of Law. I first met Matt when he served as an intern in my \noffice in 1994, when I was still a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, and since then he has been an integral part of my \nstaff for nearly 14 years collectively. Among his experiences, he has \nbeen a volunteer on my first Senatorial campaign, worked in two of my \ndistrict offices handling constituent casework, served in my personal \noffice in Washington, and most recently, Matt performed the absolutely \ncrucial role of Deputy Staff Director and Chief Counsel on the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. From these roles he \nhas gained diverse and invaluable knowledge from many areas, from \nproviding effective constituent services to the people of Maine to \ndrafting and introducing significant legislation. His flexibility and \nwide range of experience have made him a vital member of my staff. On \nthe Small Business Committee, Matt has been a trusted advisor on a host \nof legislative issues that have come before the Committee since 2003, \nas well as shaping the Committee's agenda during my tenure as chair and \nranking member.\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\n  Anyone who knows Matt can attest to the crucial role service to our \nNation plays in his life. A recent retiree from the National Guard and \na veteran, Matt served a 1-year tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2006 and \n2007. And I certainly gained an even greater sense of what it was like \nto experience the gratification and honor--as well as trepidation--that \nservice members feel when we saw Master Sergeant Walker deploy. I was \nso touched when Matt had an American flag fly over Bagram Air Field in \nAfghanistan for me, and when he sent it to me, I had it framed and \ndisplayed in my front office.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Matt's boundless \nenergy, personable demeanor, and infectious sense of humor. Over the \nyears, I have been truly fortunate to benefit from Matt's indispensable \nwisdom and thoughtful guidance. I will miss his strong work ethic and \ncheerful demeanor, which have been nearly constant in my office for so \nlong. Matt's strengths and attributes will serve him well as he moves \noff the Hill. I wish Matt, his wife Rhonda, and their beautiful \nchildren, Riley and Logan, all the best as they begin an exciting new \nchapter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7974-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN DOWDELL\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise to speak of the confirmation of \nJohn Dowdell of Tulsa, OK, to a seat on the District Court for the \nNorthern District of Oklahoma.\n  Mr. Dowdell is a native of Tulsa and a graduate of Bishop Kelly High \nSchool. Mr. Dowdell received his B.A. from Wake Forest University in \n1978 and his J.D. from the University of Tulsa College of Law in 1981. \nFollowing law school, he served for two years as a law clerk to the \nHonorable William J. Holloway of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. He \nthen joined the firm of Norman & Wohlgemuth as an associate. In 1987, \nhe was promoted to partner and the firm became Norman Wohlgemuth \nChandler & Dowdell. Mr. Dowdell's practice areas include complex \nlitigation and appellate work. He has been involved with six cases \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court and has litigated before the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals on numerous occasions.\n  In addition to his legal practice, Mr. Dowdell serves as an Adjunct \nSettlement Judge in the Northern District of Oklahoma. In this capacity \nhe has conducted over 50 mediations on a pro bono basis. He has also \nperformed extensive pro bono work for several criminal appellate cases \nand his alma mater, Bishop Kelley High School. Additionally, Mr. \nDowdell is a member of the Editorial Board of the Oklahoma Bar \nAssociation, a former president of the Bishop Kelley High School Board \nof Directors, and was appointed by the mayor to serve on Tulsa's Public \nFacilities Board.\n  Mr. Dowdell has received numerous honors for his legal practice, \nincluding being rated as one of Oklahoma's ``Super Lawyers'' from 2006 \nthrough 2011 and being named a Top Commercial Litigation Lawyer by \nAmerican Litigation Magazine. He also was the recipient of the \nDistinguished Service Award of the American Inns of Court in 1993 and \nthe Jack R. Givens Award for Professionalism and Service in 1998. The \nOklahoma Bar Association Board of Governors has endorsed Mr. Dowdell's \nnomination to this judicial position and passed a resolution praising \nhis demeanor, intelligence, and legal skills.\n  I firmly believe the rule of law is the foundation of our great \nNation. By confirming judges of high character and integrity such as \nMr. Dowdell, who are committed to the principles established by our \nFounders, we will ensure our Federal court system continues to dispense \nfair and predictable justice to all. I thank my colleagues for joining \nme in supporting John Dowdell's confirmation to the District Court for \nthe Northern District of Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/12/senate-section/article/S7974-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO REBEKAH FORMAN\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 3671. A bill to provide certain assistance to North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization allies; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Liquefied Natural \nGas, LNG, for NATO Act.\n  The United States is in possession of vast resources that could \ndirectly contribute to the energy security of our closest NATO allies, \nwho face over-reliance on Russian and Iranian gas sources. In 2009, the \nUnited States overtook Russia as the world's largest natural gas \nproducer due to vast unconventional reserves. At current U.S. \nconsumption rates, the United States possesses perhaps a century of gas \nsupply. This development has caused U.S. natural gas prices to fall to \nnearly a half to a third of gas prices in other key European and Asian \nmarkets and has prompted numerous applications for export licenses of \nU.S. liquefied natural gas exports.\n  Pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, gas exports are subject \nto approval by the Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy and \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which must certify that a \nparticular export is in the U.S. public interest. For destination \ncountries with which the United States has a free trade agreement, a \npresumption is created that the export is in the public interest, and \nthe license is automatic. For non-free trade agreement nations, a study \nmust be conducted to determine the public interest, entailing a notice \nand comment period. Several companies have submitted applications to \nretrofit U.S. LNG import terminals for regasification and export; to \nconstruct new LNG export terminals; and to export cryogenic natural gas \nto Latin America by rail and ship. After approving one application, the \nObama administration deferred others until at least 2013, pending a \nstudy completed last week. This study found that under any scenario, \nLNG exports will be a net benefit for the U.S. economy. Moreover, \ncontinued development of unconventional gas suppliers is an important \nsource of job creation in the United States.\n  U.S. shale gas reserves are already transforming European natural gas \nmarkets since LNG previously destined for the United States has now \nbeen made available for Europe. The United States can do much more to \nboth use LNG exports to benefit NATO allies facing energy insecurity in \nEurope and to promote economic growth in the United States.\n  Turkey currently relies on Iran for 20 percent of its gas imports, \nwhich could come under increased pressure when the European Council's \ndecision of October 15, 2012 to prohibit the ``purchase, import or \ntransport of natural gas from Iran'' is implemented. Moreover, several \nallies and partners in Central and Southeastern Europe, Bulgaria, \nCroatia, Hungary, Greece, the Czech Republic, and Moldova, will see \ntheir long-term contracts with Gazprom expire in the coming years. For \nthese countries, targeted U.S. LNG exports, along with infrastructure \ninvestment and other policy responses, could help alleviate energy \ninsecurity. It is possible that several other NATO allies and partners \nmay opt for U.S. natural gas imports, and even paying a reliability \npremium for them, if the opportunity existed.\n  Meanwhile, European nations are ramping up capacity to import LNG. At \npresent, Europe imports LNG primarily from Algeria, Egypt, Oman, and \nQatar to meet about 26 percent of its gas needs, due in large part to a \nlack of LNG import terminals, which are mostly located in Western \nEurope, as well as underdeveloped onward interconnectors and storage \ncapacity in Europe. However, numerous European countries, some with \nfinancing from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nEBRD, are considering construction of additional LNG import terminals, \nincluding Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, \nRomania, Turkey, and Ukraine. In light of these dynamics, the United \nStates is well-positioned to\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\nbecome a strategic energy supplier of LNG to NATO allies in need of \ndiversification.\n  The LNG for NATO Act would not direct supply, which should remain \nexclusively the function of private industry. Instead, this legislation \nwould affect Section 3 the Natural Gas Act to create a presumption that \nlicenses to export U.S. natural gas to NATO allies is in the U.S. \npublic interest, giving NATO allies the same preferential treatment \nenjoyed by our free trade partners. Specifically, swift passage of this \nact will make gas export licenses automatic for Turkey, which relies on \nIran for 20 percent of its gas demand, and those NATO countries, whose \nlong-term gas contracts with Russia's Gazprom expire in the coming \nyears.\n  Through market forces, NATO allies will be more secure and the \nAlliance will be stronger. While the U.S. Congress will no doubt \ncontinue to debate full liberalization of natural gas exports, the LNG \nfor NATO Act follows other precedents for narrowly tailored exceptions \nto our export licensing regime.\n  I am hopeful that the LNG for NATO Act can command bipartisan support \nand swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORKER:\n  S. 3673. A bill to provide a comprehensive deficit reduction plan, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am here to introduce a bill that would \naddress entitlement reforms and the debt ceiling called the Dollar for \nDollar Act. I continue to hope Speaker Boehner and President Obama will \nnegotiate a deal north of $4 trillion before year end. However, I think \nwe should also prepare now for the possibility that they will not, \nespecially based on recent conversations. The next opportunity we have \nto make the structural, transformative reforms to Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid that will save these programs and put our \ncountry on a path to fiscal solvency will be during the debt ceiling \nvote which will come up after the first of the year as soon as we get \nback.\n  I am introducing the Dollar for Dollar legislation that will raise \nthe debt ceiling by roughly $1 trillion in exchange for roughly $1 \ntrillion in reforms to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This \nputs into legislative language many of the concepts laid out in a \nbipartisan Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin proposal. This meets our \nobligations to older and younger Americans.\n  Young Americans expect us to solve their fiscal issues so they are \nnot saddled with debt and robbed of opportunity for the American dream. \nSeniors expect us to honor the commitments we have made to them. If we \nact now, we will be addressing the debt ceiling more than 3 months \nbefore we reach it.\n  Let me walk through those changes that are well known to policymakers \nand Congress and the administration. I will begin with Medicare. \nMedicare's trust fund has $27 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and it \nis expected to be insolvent by the year 2024. According to an Urban \nInstitute study, an average income of a married family will contribute \nabout $119,000 in payroll taxes to Medicare in today's dollars over \ntheir lifetime and consume about $357,000 in today's dollars in \nMedicare benefits. Obviously, this is unsustainable. Everybody in this \nroom knows this. The pages in front of me know it. Medicare needs to be \nstructured in a way to provide care for current and future \nbeneficiaries in a fiscally responsible manner.\n\n  This bill would structurally transform Medicare, keeping fee-for-\nservice Medicare in place forever, while having it compete side-by-side \nwith a reformed Medicare Advantage program called Medicare Total \nHealth. Seniors would maintain the option of choosing fee-for-service \nMedicare or a private plan as they do today. I think most of us know \nthat about 25 percent of the people in our country who are on Medicare \nare in a private plan today.\n  The competition created by these reforms would significantly reduce \nMedicare costs by $290 billion--and this is very important--without a \nspending cap on the program. This proposal is similar to one backed by \nAlice Rivlin, former Budget Director for Bill Clinton.\n  In addition, this bill would update cost-sharing requirements to \nreflect 21st-century health care practices, such as capping out-of-\npocket expenditures for beneficiaries and unifying deductibles and \ncoinsurance structures. This bill also would improve solvency by \nrequiring higher income beneficiaries to pay more for their premiums.\n  Finally, it would raise the eligibility age incrementally from 65 to \n67 by the year 2027. Moving to Medicaid, the bill would provide \nincreased flexibility for States to achieve Medicaid savings by \nestablishing a waiver process for States to better manage their \nMedicaid programs. It also would eliminate a massive ``bed tax'' \ngimmick used to bilk Federal taxpayers out of $50 billion over a 10-\nyear period.\n  Next, let me walk through Social Security changes. Although some have \nsuggested we should ignore the impending crisis in Social Security \nfunding, we should address it now because it is already beginning to \ncause the Federal Government to spend more than it takes in, and the \nSocial Security trust fund is projected to be exhausted in the year \n2033. It also will be much more painful to make these adjustments to \nachieve solvency in Social Security if we procrastinate.\n  In order to return the program to long-term solvency, the bill would \nenhance the progressivity of benefit calculations. In addition, it \nwould adopt chained CPI in measuring inflation to calculate annual \ncost-of-living adjustments. Chained CPI is the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics most modern and most accurate measure of inflation. By the \nway, the bill would apply chained CPI government-wide, which would also \naffect revenues, and it would reflect revenues in a positive way as it \nrelates to our budget deficits. It would slowly raise the retirement \nage to better reflect longevity increases.\n  Finally, the bill would strengthen the disability insurance program \nby moving beneficiaries into Social Security insurance at an earlier \nage. This part of Social Security will go bankrupt by the year 2017 if \nwe do nothing.\n  In conclusion, I am offering a bill that would implement structural \nentitlement reforms and, in exchange, it would raise the debt ceiling \ndollar for dollar. Dealing with this now would avoid facing a crisis \nnext year when we hit that debt ceiling in February or March, which \nwould rattle financial markets and generate tremendous uncertainty in \nour country and around the world. We need to get our fiscal problems \nbehind us so that businesses, investors, and all of the American people \ncan have confidence about the future. If we do that, the economy will \ntruly take off.\n  So if I could, if one of the pages could take this to the desk, I am \nintroducing this bill. I hope Senator Reid will put in place a process \nthrough regular order for bills of this nature to be introduced and go \nthrough the appropriate committees. I hope when we deal with the debt \nceiling in this coming year, we do so on a dollar-for-dollar basis, \njust as has been recently established this last year--the precedent has \nbeen set--that during this fiscal dilemma we are dealing with, when we \nraise the debt ceiling, we actually lower spending by a dollar. Up \nuntil this point, almost all the things we have talked about have been \nthrough discretionary spending. Thus far, we really haven't addressed \nentitlement reforms.\n  Again, let me reiterate that I hope the President and Speaker Boehner \ncome to some accommodation over the next couple of weeks that actually \ndeals with some maybe $4 trillion in size that would actually put this \nin the rearview mirror. But as the conversations continue, and not much \nsubstance is coming forward, that is looking doubtful. So I hope as we \nend this year and move into next year we will begin to put in place an \nopen process whereas we move toward the debt ceiling and use the same \nprecedent we have already used this last year, so that when we raise \nthe debt ceiling by a dollar, we will reduce spending by a dollar.\n  We have all said we need revenues and we need entitlement reform. \nWhat I have done today is to lay out a way--and I know other Senators \nwill have ideas, and I hope they will bring them to the floor--for us \nto raise the debt\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\nceiling by around $1 trillion and in return have entitlement reform on \na dollar-for-dollar basis, saving and reforming these programs, so that \nseniors in the future certainly will have the opportunity to continue \nthese programs they depend upon so much, and the young people who are \ncoming behind us will have the certainty that we, as mature adults, I \nhope, have dealt with these issues in an appropriate way.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3675. A bill to expand the HUBZone program for communities \naffected by base realignment and closure, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, with \nSenator Snowe, to expand the geographic boundaries of HUBZones located \nat former U.S. military installations that have been closed through the \nso-called Base Closure and Realignment--or BRAC--process. These \nmilitary installations were often the economic heart of the community \nin which they were located, and those communities can struggle for \nyears to overcome the closure of those facilities.\n  In recognition of this fact, Congress passed legislation providing \n``HUBZone'' status for 5 years to military facilities closed through \nthe BRAC process. Last week, the Defense Reauthorization bill passed by \nthe Senate included language, authored by Senator Sherrod Brown of \nOhio, to extend HUBZone status for these facilities for an additional \nfive years.\n  The HUBZone program provides certain federal contracting preferences \nto small businesses located within a HUBZone. In addition to the BRAC-\nrelated HUBZones I have already mentioned, HUBZones are located in \n``economically distressed communities,'' that suffer from low income, \nhigh poverty rates, or high unemployment.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, there are currently \n127 BRAC-related HUBZones in the United States. Unfortunately, for many \nof the military bases that have been closed, HUBZone status has not \nbrought the benefits we had hoped for. One of the reasons is simple--\nthe law defines the geographic boundaries of a BRAC-related HUBZone to \nbe the same as the boundaries of the base that was closed. When that is \ncombined with the requirement that 35 percent of the employees of a \nqualifying business must live within the HUBZone, the problem is clear: \nvery few people live on these former bases, so it is difficult or \nimpossible for businesses to get the workers they need to meet the \nrequirements of the HUBZone program.\n  One of these HUBZones is located at the former Brunswick Naval Air \nStation, in Brunswick, Maine. This facility closed in 2011, as a result \nof the 2005 BRAC round. When the Navy left, the host community lost \nmore than 2400 military and civilian personnel. Brunswick and its \nneighbor, Topsham, have a combined population of just 22,000, so losing \nthe Naval Air Station has had a significant economic impact on these \ncommunities. Because so few people actually live within the boundaries \nof the former base, its HUBZone designation does not provide any real \nassistance to these communities.\n  My legislation would expand the geographic boundaries of BRAC-related \nHUBZones to include the town or county where the closed installation is \nlocated, or census tracts contiguous to the installation, up to a total \npopulation base of 50,000. This would provide a large enough pool of \npotential workers to enable qualifying businesses to locate within the \nHUBZone, and to help host communities overcome the loss of military \ninstallations closed through the BRAC process.\n  The Association of Defense Communities has endorsed the concept of \nexpanding BRAC-related HUBZones in this manner. In a letter to Senate \nArmed Services Committee Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain, the \nADC noted how important it is that ``Congress restore its intent to \nsupport BRAC-impacted communities attracting small businesses to help \nbuild and strengthen their local economies.''\n  Steve Levesque, the Executive Director of the Midcoast Regional \nRedevelopment Authority, or MRRA, which oversees the redevelopment of \nthe former Brunswick Naval Air Station, also urges Congress to modify \nthe HUBZone program. In a letter, Steve explained that BRAC facilities \ndo not have the residential areas needed to support the 35 percent \nresidency requirement for businesses located within the HUBZone. As a \nconsequence, these businesses cannot ``realize the HUBZone benefits for \nBRAC'd installations as envisioned by Congress.''\n  This point was underscored in a letter from Heather Blease, an \nentrepreneur who is hoping to locate a new business at the former \nBrunswick Naval Air Station. Ms. Blease describes the HUBZone law as \n``flawed,'' because the 35 percent residency requirement makes it \nimpossible for businesses like hers to achieve HUBZone status.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the legislation I am offering today \nto help communities get back on their feet after the loss of a military \ninstallation closed through the BRAC process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Association of Defense\n\n\n                                                  Communities,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2012,\n     Hon.

ADC, the leading organization representing those \n     communities, always appreciates the opportunity to share \n     information with you and your staff that may help strengthen \n     communities with active installations and those that continue \n     to redevelop following base closure or realignment.\n       Communities that have been impacted by Base Realignment and \n     Closure (BRAC) often face severe economic distress for years, \n     especially during times of national economic difficulty. To \n     assist in these communities' recovery, Congress authorized in \n     the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 that BRAC-\n     impacted communities would receive Small Business \n     Administration HUBZone certification, a federal initiative \n     that further helps small businesses in disadvantaged areas to \n     compete for federal contracts. The designation gives small \n     businesses relocating to closed military installation areas \n     equal footing with businesses in other disadvantaged areas \n     that receive the designation because of their location in \n     under-utilized census tracts.\n       While the intent of Congress was to provide the HUBZone \n     designation to help closed military installations attract \n     small businesses, one aspect of the HUBZone program actually \n     works against these redevelopment areas. To maintain HUBZone \n     status, 35 percent of a business' employees must also live in \n     a HUBZone area. Because a military installation's HUBZone \n     area encompasses only the base itself, many closed military \n     installations do not have a substantial number of HUBZone-\n     certified residential areas from which to draw sufficient \n     future employees for the businesses desiring to locate on \n     those properties. Thus, it is often impossible for a business \n     to qualify for HUBZone status and compete fairly against \n     other small businesses.\n       Many defense community leaders are hopeful this issue can \n     be resolved without additional spending, creation of a new \n     government program or a change in government contracting \n     goals. Senator Susan Collins is also working to address this \n     issue during the final stages of the FY 2013 National Defense \n     Authorization Act. We look forward to sharing further \n     information with your office and hers to help explain why it \n     is important to defense communities that Congress restore its \n     intent to support BRAC-impacted communities attracting small \n     businesses to help build and strengthen their local \n     economies.\n       As always, ADC appreciate your service and support and \n     hopes you will contact us if we may be of further assistance.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                            Robert M. Murdock,\n\n                                            President, Association\n     of Defense Communities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Midcoast Regional\n\n\n                                      Redevelopment Authority,\n\n                                                December 11, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I represent the Midcoast Regional \n     Redevelopment Authority, which is charged with redeveloping \n     the former Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine that closed in \n     2011 and is now known as Brunswick Landing.\n       We seek your assistance in modifying the current federal \n     program related to SBA HUBZones to make it a more effective \n     tool for businesses locating at Brunswick Landing. Over the \n     past several years, we have had several companies inquire \n     about the current HUBZone status of the former NAS Brunswick. \n     In fact, we are currently working with one company who is \n     willing to locate here\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\n     and create upwards of 200 jobs, if we are successful in \n     getting the current HUBZone program for closed military \n     installations broadened.\n       With the implementation of the latest 2005 BRAC round, a \n     number of military installations have been closed across the \n     country resulting in severe economic distress for those \n     communities and States that have realized these closures. \n     Redeveloping these BRAC'd properties proved quite difficult \n     in good economic times, and now it is made even more \n     difficult with the national and State economic recession we \n     are experiencing.\n       While it would seem that the HUBZone designation for a \n     closed military installation would be an aid to its \n     redevelopment efforts, the 35% residency rule in the existing \n     law actually makes the program not a very effective \n     redevelopment tool for these properties at all. With the \n     exception of closed military installations, most of the \n     HUBZones in the Country are census tract based. Under current \n     law, only the closed military base itself (i.e., the \n     geographic area which used to be the former base) is \n     designated as a HUBZone, which is a much smaller area than \n     the census tract basis. Furthermore, many closed military \n     installations do not have a substantial amount of residential \n     areas from which to draw sufficient future employees (35%) \n     for the businesses desiring to locate on those properties.\n       In addition the above, the Small Business Act established a \n     five year time-frame for the duration of the HUBZone from the \n     actual date of base closure. This is of particular concern \n     given that the actual transfer of properties from the \n     military services to the base closure communities often \n     occurs many years following closure. Thus, these properties \n     are not available for business development until actually \n     transferred.\n       The net effect is that eligible HUB businesses seeking new \n     or expanded opportunities on closed installations cannot meet \n     these requirements and thus are not able to realize the \n     HUBZone benefits for BRAC'd installations as envisioned by \n     Congress. This issue exacerbates the difficulties for us and \n     other similar communities to overcome the devastating \n     economic effects of base closures.\n       In order to make the BRAC HUBZone designation an effective \n     economic development tool for Brunswick Landing, as well as \n     all the other closed installations across the country, the \n     attached amendment language to the existing law is \n     recommended. It should be noted that these recommendations do \n     not create a new program, require additional government \n     spending, or increase federal contracting goals.\n       Thank you for your service to our Country and the State of \n     Maine and your thoughtful consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Steven H. Levesque,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 12, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I have established a new contact \n     center business that focuses on providing service to the \n     federal government. A key strategy for our success hinges \n     upon the establishment of my business as a HUBZone certified \n     entity.\n       As a native of Brunswick, Maine, I am keenly interested in \n     locating my business at the former Brunswick Naval Air \n     Station, now called Brunswick Landing. As a BRAC facility, \n     the SBA rules limit the boundary of the HUBZone \n     geographically to base property which has very few housing \n     units.\n       In order to achieve HUBZone certification, 35% of my \n     employees need to reside within the HUBZone.\n       As the law is written, I cannot locate at Brunswick Landing \n     and hope to achieve HUI3Zone status. The BRAC HUBZone law is \n     flawed as written. Our Congress attempted to create an \n     economic development vehicle to help communities recover from \n     base closures, but unless the law is tweaked, the HUBZone \n     designation is meaningless.\n       Please help modify the existing definition for BRAC \n     HUBZones by broadening the boundary of the HUBZone for closed \n     military installations to include the surrounding community. \n     In the case of my company, it provides me with HUBZone \n     employees to put to work so I can meet the HUBZone \n     certification requirements.\n       If the law is changed, I will locate my business at \n     Brunswick Landing and provide hundreds of jobs to the \n     economically depressed area. Otherwise, I will need to seek \n     out other alternatives.\n       Thank you for your service to our country, the State of \n     Maine and your interest in helping small businesses thrive.\n           With greatest respect,\n                                                Heather D. Blease,\n                                           CEO, Savi Systems, LLC.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of a bill that I \nam cosponsoring today with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, \nthat will ensure that the Small Business Administration's, SBA, \nHistorically Underutilized Business Zone, HUBZone, program will support \nthe many communities around this Nation that have been negatively \nimpacted by base closures.\n  Over the course of my career, my state has experienced two major base \nclosures--Loring Air Force Base was closed by the 1991 BRAC round and \nBrunswick Naval Air Station was closed by the 2005 BRAC round. Like \nevery community around the Nation that has experienced a base closure, \nBrunswick and Loring have fought tirelessly to replace the jobs and \neconomic impact of their military installations.\n  Unfortunately, theirs is an exceptionally difficult task. Consider, \nfor instance, that the closure of Brunswick Naval Air Station directly \neliminated nearly 3,300 military and federal civilian jobs, and \nindirectly caused the loss of approximately 3,800 additional jobs from \nthe region. Overcoming the effects of such dramatic changes in a local \nemployment and economic market is, without question, a long-term \nchallenge that is made even more difficult in a period of prolonged \neconomic recession.\n  That is why I have always argued that the Nation has a responsibility \nto do everything within our power to help those communities that have \nsupported our military infrastructure for decades to recover from the \ndevastating economic impacts of a base closure.\n  One way that we can assist in their recovery is to encourage the \nlocation and growth of small businesses in and around closed military \ninstallations. As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I frequently talk with small business \nowners and employees about their challenges and needs. In many cases, \nthey tell me about the difficulties they face in competing against \nlarger and more established businesses for federal contracts.\n  That is why, in my efforts to champion our Nation's small businesses \nand to promote their interests, I have supported the Small Business \nAdministration's HUBZone Empowerment Contracting program. Congress \nestablished this program as part of the Small Business Reauthorization \nAct in 1997 in order to spur business development and employment \nopportunities in economically distressed areas of the country. In 2004, \nwith my support, we took the critical step of expanding the HUBZone \nprogram to include ``base closure areas,'' which directly addressed \nmilitary installations that have been closed through any of several \nmilitary base closure and realignment authorities, including BRAC \nrounds.\n  Although this was an important step forward, the 2004 expansion to \ninclude closed military installations in the HUBZone program was \nlimited to areas within the physical boundaries of the military base. \nCurrent law requires that 35 percent of the employees of a HUBZone \nqualified small business concern also must live within the HUBZone \ndesignated area.\n  However, small businesses that are interested in establishing a \nlocation at a closed military installation in order to gain the \nbenefits of becoming a HUBZone small business concern are likely to \ndiscover that not very many people live on the grounds of that closed \nbase, leaving them without sufficient workers to meet the 35 percent \nrequirement. This, of course, defeats the very purpose of the HUBZone \ndesignation for closed military installations by serving as a \ndisincentive for small businesses to open shop at a redeveloping base.\n  In light of these facts, and considering that the economic and \nemployment impacts of closing a military installation are \nunquestionably and disproportionately felt by the people who reside in \nthe communities around former military installations--not just within \nthe fencelines of former bases--it is clear that the HUBZone \ndesignation for closed military installations needs to be clarified.\n  That is why the bill that I have cosponsored with my colleague \nadjusts the designation of a base closure area to include the \ngeographic area that is the municipality, county, or census tract in \nwhich the installation is located (as well as the adjacent census \ntract), which incorporates up to 50,000 people. And so, to my friends \nand colleagues here in the Senate, I urge you to join me in supporting \nthis bill and showing your strong support for providing the maximum \nbenefits of the HUBZone designation to the many communities around our \nnation that have been impacted by base closures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3676. A bill to promote high-quality, cost-efficient, and \neffective administrative support services to agencies\n\n[[Page S7981]]\n\noverseas; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Reducing \nDuplication Overseas Act of 2012.\n  At a time when the Federal Government is facing significant fiscal \nchallenges, we must explore all potential avenues to improve the \nefficiency and effectiveness of Federal programs. This bill seeks to \nease some of our current fiscal pressures by eliminating duplication of \ncertain administrative services at overseas posts and reducing \nadministrative operational costs.\n  The Department of State oversees the International Cooperative \nAdministrative Support Services, ICASS, system, which provides and \nshares the cost of administrative support services for overseas \nemployees, such as vehicle maintenance or leasing services. The purpose \nof developing this system was to ensure more efficient delivery and \nquality of overseas administrative support services. Although the level \nof agency participation varies, as use of ICASS for most administrative \nservices is voluntary, last year, more than 40 agencies participated in \nICASS and the cost of the services totaled approximately $2 billion.\n  In 2004, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, reported that \nICASS had not achieved efficient delivery of administrative support \nservices because it failed to eliminate duplicative services and \ncontain costs. GAO recommended that there be one provider for each \nservice at American facilities overseas. The ICASS Executive Board took \nsteps to reduce costs, but still had not implemented GAO's \nrecommendation that there be a single service provider.\n  In 2010, former Senator Voinovich and I requested that the GAO review \nthe delivery of administrative services at overseas posts. In their \nreport issued earlier this year, GAO concluded that, although agency \nparticipation in ICASS has increased, agencies chose to provide their \nown services about one third of the time, resulting in duplicative \nadministrative services and missed opportunities to decrease costs.\n  Duplication and overseas administrative costs can and must be \ndecreased. The Reducing Duplication Overseas Act seeks to eliminate \nduplicative services and reduce overall costs to the Federal Government \nby requiring agencies to use ICASS for services. Although the GAO \nrecommends that agencies consolidate all services with ICASS, this bill \nstarts with only a few services in order to determine best practices \nfor consolidation, as well as whether consolidation is appropriate for \nall services.\n  Specifically, the Act would require agencies to participate in the \nICASS for household furniture, furnishings, appliance pools, and motor \npool services, unless the agency provides an explanation on how \nproviding the service outside the ICASS system will not increase \noverall costs to the Federal Government or if it certifies that the \nmission of the agency cannot be achieved by participating in ICASS \nsystem.\n  Additionally, the bill would allow an agency to provide \nadministrative services at an overseas post in place of the existing \nICASS provider if it can provide the administrative service more \nefficiently and agrees to provide the administrative service to all \nICASS customer agencies at the overseas post.\n  The Act would also require the ICASS Executive Board and the \nComptroller General of the United States to submit reports to Congress \non agency use of ICASS services and the impact consolidating these \nservices has on cost-efficiencies and redundancies at overseas posts. \nNothing in this bill is intended to interfere with the existing \nauthorities of the Chief of Mission at each overseas post.\n  I believe that this bill is an important step towards improving the \nefficiency and effectiveness of government operations overseas. \nAlthough I will not have the opportunity to push for this bill in the \nnext Congress, it is my hope that my colleagues will take up and pass \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
