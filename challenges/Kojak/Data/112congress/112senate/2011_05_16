Mr. President, imagine there is a choice for Congress to \nmake. Here is the choice. There are two doors. We are standing before \nboth of them, but we have to pick one of the doors. Behind door No. 1 \nis a choice that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve calls \n``catastrophic.'' The Secretary of the Treasury says if we open that \nsame door, it could lead to a financial crisis ``more severe than the \ncrisis from which we are only now starting to recover.'' Let me repeat \nthat, Mr. President. Chairman Bernanke says that opening that door \nwould be ``catastrophic.'' Secretary Geithner says it would lead to a \nfinancial crisis ``more severe than the crisis from which we\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\nare only now starting to recover.'' The majority of the American people \nwe represent say opening that door would be ``disastrous''--not just a \nbad idea, not one that would lead to discomfort, but one that would \nlead to disaster. It would not be just irresponsible to make that \nchoice; we would be out of our minds.\n  Well, we are going to have to make up our minds and do that sooner \nrather than later. That is because today America has hit a milestone, \nbut it is not one anyone is celebrating. Today is the day we hit our \ndebt limit, which means we have reached the maximum amount the United \nStates is allowed to borrow. It means that with each passing day, we \nare that much closer to the disaster that would come from defaulting on \nour debts--the day we would forfeit, for the first time ever in the \nhistory of this great county, the full faith and credit of the United \nStates. This is the crisis Chairman Bernanke called ``catastrophic,'' \nwhat Secretary Geithner warned 10 times over would make the great \nrecession look small, and what the American people demand we avoid.\n  Defaulting on our obligations would be unprecedented, but it is not \nunavoidable. We can be responsible leaders and choose to open the other \ndoor. It might not be ideal, but we have to make a choice. Door No. 2 \nis a much better, safer, and smarter choice.\n  Let's be clear about what the debt limit does and does not mean. \nRaising the debt limit when it is absolutely necessary--and to do it \nright now--lets us pay the bills that have already come due. We borrow \na lot of money in this country. That is not a new phenomenon or unique \nto one party; it is how America has done business for centuries. \nBorrowing a lot of money means we owe a lot of money. We cannot cut off \nour own ability to pay those debts.\n  Here is what it does not mean. The emergency we enter today is not \nabout a penny of new spending. It is not about new programs or new \ntaxes. It is not about creating new obligations, only meeting existing \nones. The debt limit is about paying what we already owe.\n  If we do not act, if we allow the United States to default, the day \nof reckoning will be much, much worse than today. Things will be much, \nmuch worse for American jobs, families, and businesses than they \nalready are. And the fallout will be felt around the world.\n  Right now, a lot of people are reaching for that first door--the one \nthat leads to catastrophe and crisis. They are looking at this choice \nthrough a political lens, not an economic lens, and they are willing to \nrisk the strength of our economy just to make a political point. We \ncannot afford to play these political games and trigger a default \ncrisis that would lead to a catastrophe. We cannot afford to make \nunrealistic demands or hold hostage policies that affect real people. \nSpeaker Boehner recently asked that everyone should act as an adult and \nreach a solution. I second that request. Let's open the second door and \nhonor our obligations.\n  Once we avert this crisis, we can have another important adult \nconversation--a conversation about saving. One good way to do that--not \nthe only way but a good, easy, obvious way--is to cut wasteful \nspending. Taxpayer giveaways to companies pulling in record profits is \nthe epitome of wasteful spending. We all know which companies I am \ntalking about--the five biggest oil and gas companies. It is time to \nmake sure we take away incentives they do not need and we cannot \nafford. They can afford it. We cannot afford to give it to them.\n\n  That is a question that will come before the Senate this week. It is \na question of fairness, really. The bonus checks taxpayers are writing \nto Big Oil are absurd and obscene. They defy common sense.\n  The big oil companies, we know, are not hurting. It does not need a \nhand, Big Oil. In the first 3 months of this year, the oil industry \nmade $36 billion in profits alone--not revenues, profits. That is $12 \nbillion a month. That is $3 billion a week. It is pretty good money. \nMeanwhile, the American taxpayer is giving those same successful \ncompanies $4 billion a year. So when you take these companies' profits \nand add in the handout you, I, and every taxpayer gives them, America \nis saying to Big Oil: You make $3 billion a week for 52 weeks, and we \nwill basically give you a 53rd week for free.\n  Well, what about the average American taxpayer, the one who is \nfooting the bill for this Big Oil bonus? ExxonMobil now pays a smaller \nshare of its income in taxes than the average taxpayer. This is not \nbecause the average American is paying more in taxes; it is because Big \nOil is paying less.\n  Over the last 4 years, since Democrats have controlled the Senate, we \nhave cut taxes for middle-class families nine different times. The \nDemocratic Senate has passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut in different ways. \nAgain, the Democratic Senate has passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut. And \nnow families pay less in Federal taxes as a share of the economy than \nsince 1950, when Harry Truman was President.\n  So this really is a question of fairness. It is about Big Oil paying \nits fair share. It is also a question of priorities. The people who \nwant to keep giving Big Oil $4 billion a year are the same ones who \nwant to take the social safety net away from the sick, seniors, and the \npoor. These people kick and scream about investing in cancer research \nor protecting student loans that help so many afford the rising costs \nof college, but ask them to recognize the absurdity of giving Big Oil \ntaxpayer money they do not need and they cover their eyes and plug \ntheir ears. Ask them to defend it, and they cannot.\n  That is what happened last week. The Nation watched the Big Oil \nbosses try to defend it. Frankly, they did not do a very good job. It \nis not their fault for doing so poorly--they were trying to defend an \nindefensible position. But it is their fault for holding that position.\n  So this is a question of fairness and a question of priorities. It \ncertainly is a question of economics. But it is not a question of gas \nprices. Independent, nonpartisan experts--and even some of the CEOs \nthemselves--say taking away these giveaways does not have a thing to do \nwith the price at the pump. Anyone who claims otherwise is simply not \ntelling the truth.\n  Those distractions are disruptive to this debate. So are the \ngratuitous attacks on the patriotism of the debaters. One of those \ncompanies, ConocoPhillips, said using taxpayer money to pay down the \ndeficit rather than pad Big Oil's pockets was ``un-American.'' It is \nhard to comprehend that, Mr. President. ConocoPhillips said using \ntaxpayer money to pay down the deficit rather than pad Big Oil's \npockets was ``un-American.'' That is ConocoPhillips' word, not mine. \nAttacking another's patriotism has no place in this debate. It is \noffensive that this company has done that; that is, saying that because \nwe want to pay down the debt and not give these bonuses to these big \noil companies is un-American? I do not think so. It is offensive that \nthis company has done that and shameful that its CEO, whom we saw on TV \nthis past week, refuses to recant or to apologize. I disagree strongly \nwith his position on this issue. I disagree with his claim that only \none side of this debate loves this country. I question his sense of \nfairness. I question his priorities. But I do not question his \npatriotism. He should not question mine.\n  Would the Chair announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2976-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons).

Mr. President, when word spread that American forces\n\n[[Page S2977]]\n\nfound and killed Osama bin Laden, Americans gathered at Ground Zero, in \nNew York's Times Square and in front of the White House to celebrate \nthe news. For more than a decade bin Laden had been on the FBI's top \nten most wanted list, and the announcement that our military conducted \nthe successful operation in Pakistan filled us with national pride.\n  After nearly 3,000 Americans died in the September 11 attacks, bin \nLaden, the plot's mastermind, was named public enemy No. 1. The years \nfollowing that tragic day, he eluded capture. Justice finally caught up \nwith him, as a result of years of hard work and dedication from the \nbrave men and women in our military and intelligence community. The \ndeath of Osama bin Laden allows us to close this chapter of the global \nwar on terror, but it does not mean the end of the threat from al-Qaida \nor other like-minded organizations. We must remain vigilant, both at \nhome and abroad, in the fight against terrorism.\n  The fact is, terrorism is not the only major threat to our \nsovereignty. There is one that lurks much closer to home, born and bred \nright here in this town. I am speaking about Washington's addiction to \nspending.\n  In testimony before Congress, Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike \nMullen said the greatest threat to our sovereignty is not Iran; not al-\nQaida; not radical Islam--it is our national debt. Most people don't \nthink of spending in terms of a threat to our sovereignty; and those \nwho do are rarely so blunt. But Admiral Mullen is right. We simply \ncannot continue to operate at this pace.\n  This year alone, the Federal Government will spend $3.7 trillion \nwhile only collecting $2.2 trillion. Does this sound like responsible \nbudgeting to anyone? The average American family does not have this \nluxury. If you or I tried to run our household this way, the bank would \neventually cut us off. It is time we apply that lesson to Washington. \nIt is time we cut off the government.\n\n  This is long overdue. Our national debt stands at a jaw-dropping \n$14.3 trillion. Foreign holdings account for almost half of these \nobligations, and much of that is owed to countries that are not always \nfriendly to us. This is the very reason Admiral Mullen sounded the \nalarm on how big of a security threat our debt has become. Being \nindebted to countries with ideals, value systems and agendas that are \noften at odds with ours puts us in a very precarious position.\n  For example, China owns $1.2 trillion of our debt. The Chinese \nGovernment contends that it won't use this liability for political \nadvantage, but the government also claims there are no human rights \nviolations in that country. Clearly, the Chinese Government's word is \nnot a promise we should bank on.\n  Along with the Chinese, a portion of the list of foreign creditors \nreads like a ``who's who'' of dictatorial regimes. Iran, Venezuela, \nLibya make up the rouges gallery of nations that owns some of our debt. \nThese dictatorships, along with other oil exporting nations such as \nSaudi Arabia--whose role in spreading radical Islam is well \ndocumented--come in at No. 4 on the list of foreign creditors. We are \ncurrently engaged in an operation with our NATO allies against \nQadhafi's regime, yet rely on it in part, no matter how small, to keep \nour government operational.\n  This is the problem with our reckless spending. We cannot put \nourselves at the mercy of foreign governments. It is irresponsible and \ndangerous. We must act now to get our spending under control and pay \ndown our debt.\n  We cannot run a country on a Visa card; nor can we keep kicking the \ncan down the road for future generations to address. Our debt is a \nnational security problem, and this one our brave men and women in \nuniform cannot save us from. It is up to us to make the tough decisions \nto get our economic house in order and the time is now to act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the subsidies to oil and gas companies in \nthe form of tax breaks cost the Federal Government in the neighborhood \nof $4 billion a year. What most Democrats, including this Democrat, \npropose to do is to end those subsidies and to use the money to reduce \nour Federal budget deficit. This is not a particularly complicated \nissue.\n  If oil and gas companies were struggling, if a large number of jobs \nwere at risk, if ending these subsidies threatened to increase the \nprice families have to pay for gasoline or fuel oil or if ending them \nwould create a drag on our fragile economic recovery--if any of those \nthings were true, this might be a closer call. But they are not true. \nWe are subsidizing massively profitable oil companies. Nearly every \nindependent analyst--and even some from the oil industry itself--tells \nus this proposal will not alter the economic fundamentals that \ndetermine gasoline prices. Oil production, and therefore the jobs it \ncreates, will not decline if we pass this bill. Struggling families and \nsmall businesses will not pay more because we end these subsidies. And \nby ending them, we can help close a budget deficit we all agree is a \nsignificant problem.\n  The arguments against this measure are misguided. Republicans have \nclaimed it would increase gas prices. Independent economists disagree. \nFor instance, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported \nlast week that:\n\n       Prices are well in excess of costs and a small increase in \n     taxes would therefore be less likely to reduce oil output and \n     hence increase petroleum product gasoline prices.\n\n  Even the chief tax expert of the American Petroleum Institute said \nlast week that the proposal:\n\n       . . . would not affect the global economics underpinning \n     oil supply and demand, which explain today's gasoline prices.\n\n  That is an important point to keep in mind. The price of oil depends \non a number of factors, one of which is supply and demand for this \ninternationally traded commodity. Another factor, one which I and \nseveral other Senators believe bears further examination, is the role \nof speculation in that market. But the money we are talking about \nsaving is relatively small in the context of a massive global \nmarketplace for oil.\n  It is also small relative to the profits oil companies have reaped. \nThe five companies that would be affected by the proposal we support \nmade a combined $76 billion in profit in 2010. That is not revenue; \nthat is not sales; that is profit--$76 billion. From 2001 to 2010, \ntheir combined profit approached $1 trillion. With the price of oil in \nthe neighborhood of $100 a barrel, these record profits are likely to \ncontinue. These companies do not need taxpayer assistance.\n  At the same time, the money we spend helping them is increasing the \nbudget deficit--a deficit our Republican friends say justifies making \ndramatic reductions in health care for our seniors, support for our \ncollege students, Head Start for our youngest students, and other \nDraconian cuts. Yet tax breaks for companies making billions of dollars \na year in profits is something they say we can afford. I don't buy it.\n  More importantly, the American people don't buy it. The American \npeople know these tax breaks we can't afford for companies that can \nmore than afford to lose them are wrong. They know if we are going to \nget serious about our debt problem, we need to eliminate tax \nexpenditures that contribute to our deficit. They know if we can't \ntackle such an obvious example of wasteful spending as this, further \nreform is unlikely. The American people recognize the fundamental \nunfairness of tax breaks for oil companies making billions in profits \nat the same time working families are told they will have to do with \nless.\n  Last week, with the CEOs of major oil companies testifying before the \nFinance Committee, they said they want to be treated like everybody \nelse. I say, fine, let's do that. Let's tell the massively profitable \noil companies not to expect tax subsidies from Uncle Sam. Let's expect \nthose companies to give a little bit as we address the budget deficit, \njust as middle-class American\n\n[[Page S2978]]\n\nfamilies are going to have to give a little bit as we cut back on \nimportant programs for them.\n  Our Republican colleagues say our deficits are unsustainable, and I \nagree. They say the deficit problem is urgent, and I agree. They say we \nmust act, and I agree. And we can act. We can end these oil company \nsubsidies. Now is the time for all of us to act to end billions of \ndollars in handouts to massively profitable oil companies and use that \nmoney to help put our fiscal house in order.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2978-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2978-S2980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DEBT LIMIT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague, \nSenator Levin. I just caught the tail end, but it is a good segue into \nwhat I wish to speak about today.\n  Today is May 16, an important day for me, because it happens to be my \nbirthday, although I am not anxious to have any more birthdays and it \nis no big deal. This day is more important because this is the day that \nTreasury Secretary Geithner said we have reached the debt limit \nceiling.\n  I read from this missive that came out a little bit ago:\n\n       Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced on Monday \n     morning that the Federal Government had met its statutory \n     borrowing limit of $14.294 trillion cap.\n\n  This is the day we have been talking about for a long time. In fact, \nthis day had been advertised as the likely date on which the United \nStates would hit the debt limit.\n  Here we are with an empty floor on a Monday and people are saying, \nWhoa, shouldn't you guys have been in every night last week and all \nweekend to avert hitting this limit, because doesn't this mean we have \nto default on our debt? Well, as the article goes on to report:\n\n       Treasury will now begin a series of ``extraordinary'' \n     measures designed to stave off a potential government \n     default.\n\n  Treasury has been able to move some money around so that now we won't \nreach that magic date until August 2.\n  Is this good news or bad news? Well, it is maybe good from the \nstandpoint that we may have avoided a catastrophic situation today, but \nit simply postpones the date of the inevitable. What I fear is that it \nsimply gives us more time to avoid getting engaged in dealing with what \nis arguably one of the largest crises in American history, particularly \nin American financial history. So when we look at what has been \ntranspiring over the last several years, as all of us have watched with \nalarm, our debt limit continues to climb at an unprecedented rate and \nthere has been not nearly enough debate and engagement on how we should \naddress this. I know the last several months have been filled with \nproposals and plans and dire predictions. The last year--2010, an \nelection year--certainly aroused the interests of the American people, \nwhen I think for the first time the reality became clear on what the \nincrease in the debt and the deficits is doing to our country's \nfinancial health.\n  I have this chart here on the left which shows total U.S. debt and \nstatutory debt limit from the years 1941 to 2011. In December 1941, we \nwere engaged in World War II. We see a small little spike here in terms \nof the debt limit. That is understandable, because we were in a crisis \nsituation and we had to put all of our efforts and expenditures into \nproduction to address the war needs. But as we can see, from 1941 all \nthe way through to 1981, we moved along at a fairly low level of \nincrease in debt and finally hit the $1 trillion mark in 1981. So for \nmore than 200 years in the history of this country, we ran this country \nwithout going more than $1 trillion in debt. That is enough as it is. \nBut I remember at the time, in 1981, people were saying, How could this \nbe possible? How could we possibly reach this limit, $1 trillion? We \ncan hardly comprehend it.\n  The sad news is that since 1981 we have been on a steady incline of \ndebt, which has accelerated dramatically in the last few years. Today--\nMay 16, 2011--we have hit a total of nearly $14.3 trillion in debt. \nThis line continues off this chart and goes much higher as we project \nforward the spending, much of which is occurring because of mandatory \nspending put in place for programs that were locked in and it is \nobligatory spending on the part of the Federal Government. Of course, \nas we go forward, the interest rate on our debt increases and the \namount we pay each year increases. So we find ourselves in a spiral, a \ndownward spiral of debt that seems to have no end.\n  This is no surprise to most people because there has been focus on \nthis all across America over the last couple years. Throughout this \nperiod of time, people have had to stretch their own dollars at home in \norder to make ends meet. Businesses have had to make significant \nchanges in the way they do business in order to make ends meet. State \ngovernments have found they are deeply in debt and have had to take \nsome dramatic measures. But it is only now that the Federal Government \nis starting to look seriously at what we need to do.\n  All throughout the year 2010, with no budget in place, Congress \ncontinued to spend. But I am not here to place blame on any one \nindividual or any one group. I am simply here to point out the fact \nthat we have a serious crisis at hand and it deserves serious debate \nand a serious solution or we are going to find our country in very \ndifficult straits.\n  From this point forward, as shown on the chart, Congress has been run \nby Democrats and Republicans. The Presidency has been held by Democrats \nand Republicans. So we can go back and say: Well, who is responsible \nfor this and who is responsible for that and what about here and what \nabout there? That is a wasted effort at this particular point in time. \nThis is the situation we face, and this is the situation with which we \nmust address.\n  I regret that the Senate, to date--other than activities such as \nSenator Levin was engaged in, I am engaged in; that is, coming to the \nfloor at a time when the issue is not before us in terms of seeking a \nresolution but simply stating the facts and urging us to move forward--\nI regret that this year we have spent a total of only 4 hours and 20 \nminutes of actual debate on the spending. Instead, we have been tied up \nfor weeks on not trivial but far less serious measures: confirming some \njudges to district and appellate court positions, dealing with the \nFederal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill, which took \nseveral weeks. Now we have been stuck on the small business \nauthorization bill for several weeks, injecting here and there in some \ndebate and some talk and discussion about the deficit but no real focus \non that.\n  If we do not set aside the less important and begin to focus on what \nwe need to do, we are going to quickly find ourselves into the month of \nJuly careening toward an August 2 deadline, during which time the \nuncertainty that exists in the investment community and in the business \ncommunity and in households, in terms of spending and what the future \nmight bring--all that continues.\n  What the world is waiting for, and what the world is watching and \nhoping and praying for, is that the Congress and the executive branch \nwill work together to seek a solution to this problem that will bring \nreassurance to the investment world and bring confidence to our \npopulation that we have gotten serious and we are going to do something \nabout this.\n  None of us believe this is going to be easy. None of us believe this \nis going to be painless. But we simply cannot postpone the debate that \nneeds to take place, not only in this Chamber and in the House of \nRepresentatives but between the House and the Senate and the White \nHouse.\n  Some conversations have already started in that regard but also \nacross the Nation. This is a debate that has to come before the \nAmerican people because they are going to be the ones who are going to \nbear the brunt of whatever cuts and whatever solutions need to take \nplace in order to put us on the right fiscal track.\n  If I have learned anything in discussions outside this Chamber with \npeople who have studied and analyzed and looked at this issue, it is \nthat several things must take place, and they must take place \nimmediately. A host of people who have spent their lives understanding \nthe dynamics of the financial system--understanding the consequences of \ndebt as a percentage of gross national product, understanding the \nconsequences of how a nation rises\n\n[[Page S2979]]\n\nto this level of debt, the consequences of that to its people and to \nits financial future and its stature in the world and its ability to do \nthe many wonderful things the United States has been able to do, to \nlead the world in so many different areas--all this is in jeopardy if \nwe do not address this issue.\n  What they are saying, if I could bring that into just some basic \nconclusions, is, No. 1, this crisis is real. All you have to do is look \nat this chart I have in the Chamber to understand this crisis is real. \nHere is where we were in World War II when we were having to go into \ndebt, which we thought was serious at the time. But look at what has \nhappened in just the last 30 years.\n  So the crisis is real. As measured by historical analysis of nations \nthat have faced these kinds of situations before, the consequences are \nalways dire. Therefore, No. 1--and I was glad to hear my Democratic \ncolleague acknowledge this is the case because this is something both \nsides of the aisle are going to have to deal with--both sides have to \nrecognize that, No. 1, the crisis is real and it is now.\n  The second conclusion, based on what the experts are saying, is that \nwe have to act now, not later. This is not something we can postpone. \nFor years and years and years, as this line has gone forward, as shown \non this chart, Congress has said: We'll get to that. Presidents have \nalso said: We need to address our debt, but only after the next \nelection.\n  Well, there is always a next election. Now the latest thing we hear \nis: Well, we need to take care of that after the 2012 election. We will \nput it before the American people in terms of which way they want to \ngo.\n  The American people spoke very loudly and clearly in 2010. If that \nwas not a wake-up call politically, I do not know what will be. But, \nnevertheless, falling into the trap of simply saying that waiting until \nafter the next election we might be in a better position to deal with \nit then simply postpones the inevitable and potentially brings about a \ncrisis which will occur before the election in 2012.\n  It is shameless to put before the American people that the political \nsituation is such that we are not willing to address this now and, \ntherefore, we are putting their lives, their futures, their children's \nfutures, and their children's children's futures in jeopardy, while we \nplace a higher priority on the political outcome of 2012 rather than on \nwhat we were elected to do in 2010 and years before.\n  No. 1, the crisis is real. No. 2, we have to act now without delay. \nNo. 3, many experts have advised that, if we do something, it needs to \nbe a comprehensive plan that includes all aspects of Federal spending. \nWe need to talk about the discretionary part of our budget, which we \nvote on every year, although in the last couple of years we have not \neven passed a budget. Last year, we failed to pass a single \nappropriations bill. Instead, we have had continuing resolutions and \nsupplemental spending bills, which is not what we were elected to do \nand not a good way to govern. But we have to address that portion of \nthe budget.\n  When addressing a long-term economic plan, we cannot exempt major \nsectors of our budget such as interest and defense and mandatory \nspending and we must include entitlements. That is No. 4, many experts \nsay. If you do not have a comprehensive plan that includes everything, \nthen the burden falls on a disproportionate share of discretionary \nspending that undermines essential programs the government ought to be \nengaged in.\n  We cannot get from here to there without including all aspects of the \nbudget, including comprehensive tax reform. That is another thing these \nexperts have said. Many say the comprehensive plan must include some \nbasis on which we move forward with tax reform.\n  Senator Wyden and I have cosponsored a bipartisan bill for that very \neffort. We are not saying it is the perfect bill. We are saying it is \nsomething in place with which we could start on and address \ncomprehensive tax reform, to broaden the base and generate more revenue \nfrom the economic growth that comes with lowering taxes and reforming \nthe tax code.\n  Entitlements are a must. That is what these people have said. You \ncannot get from where we are now to where we need to be unless we \ninclude Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security reforms. We all know \nthere are structural problems, given the massive move into retirement \nage of the baby boom population of this country. We all know these \nprograms are teetering on the edge. There was a report from the \ntrustees of Medicare last week saying they are moving up 5 years when \nMedicare runs out of money in order to pay for benefits that are \npromised under that program.\n  We all know there are some relatively painless solutions the earlier \nwe start, in terms of adjusting the retirement age, in terms of \nadjusting some formulas, and making some of the changes that have been \nproposed that we are talking about. But if we do not include that \nentitlement spending in our discussions, we are not going to be able to \nreach a successful conclusion.\n\n  Another principle they have listed is that we have to make this for \nthe long term and we have to lock it in. We have to guarantee the \npromises we make and the commitments we make, as we address this \nproblem of how much to cut and how to change the Tax Code and how to \nwork through the revenue side of this effort. They have to be locked in \nplace and guaranteed, hopefully, with the passage of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  We failed twice in the 1990s in this Senate to pass a constitutional \namendment to send to the States for ratification. It failed by one vote \non two occasions. I wonder what would have happened had we passed that. \nNo, I do not wonder. I know what would have happened. We would have \nbeen forced to make the decision at this point, as shown on the chart, \nwhich would have brought us back to here instead of now having to go \nfrom this point on the chart all the way down--a much more painful \nprocess than had we passed that amendment then.\n  So what we want to avoid, when we are forced to do this--and it is \ngoing to happen; we have to do it--we need to lock that in on a path \nthat will bring us back to fiscal parity and balanced budgets and then \nlock it in with a constitutional amendment. It cannot be done in 1 \nyear. That is why the other principle is that this has to be a long-\nterm process in getting us from where we are to where we need to go, \nand then we need to stay with it. We cannot just pass it for 2 years, \nelect a new Congress and come in and make these changes.\n  If we move forward, and if we can come together to find a rational \nsolution to this, it will send--this is the last point the experts have \nsaid--it will send a tremendous signal around the world to all those \ninvestors who have always looked to the United States as the safe-\nhaven, last-resort place to put their money. The dollar will be rescued \nfrom falling against other currencies. It will continue to be seen as \nthe world's currency. Confidence in the United States as a safe place \nto put your money will be restored in nations around the world. The \nAmerican people will have a tremendous psychological sense of relief \nand assurance that we are finally getting serious about doing something \nabout this crisis that faces us.\n  Lastly, what I would like to do is send a message to President Obama, \nthe majority leader, my Republican and Democratic colleagues, the \nminority leader, and others: The time is now. I believe we should \nsuspend, as soon as we can, everything but the absolute essential and \nspend the next amount of time, starting now, debating and working \nthrough--whether it takes day and night and weekends--rolling up our \nsleeves and sitting down, holding this debate across the country, to \nget input from the public, but also meeting together, working to find a \nsolution to this, which we all recognize has to be done, without \nletting this thing trail all the way to late July and then do something \nin a panic.\n  This crisis is going to occur. It is going to occur probably sooner \nthan we think. The last piece of advice they gave us--I know I said it \njust a minute ago--but the other piece of advice they gave us was: \nTrust us, you do not want the financial markets to force you into doing \nthings that will be done in a rush, that will be done in a panic, that \nwill not be rationally applied; and instead of having a principled, \nrational\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\nway of solving this problem, we will be in crisis mode, and we will be \nhaving to make decisions that will have a significant negative impact \non our public and on the world.\n  I hope to keep talking about this issue. I hope to keep urging our \nleadership to suspend all but the essential of what we are now doing \nand that all of us commit whatever time it takes to bring about a \ndebate and a decision as to how we are going to go forward. Put it in \nfront of the American people. Let our yea be yea and our nay be nay. \nThen at least we will know where we stand and we, hopefully, can come \ntogether to find a reason to forgo letting the markets do this for us, \nwhich everyone concedes is not the way to go.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2980-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2980-S2981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DEBT LIMIT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes today about \nthe effort that we are undergoing right now with the Vice President and \nour colleagues in the House of Representatives to find a way to \nconstrain spending, reduce our deficits and debt sufficient to warrant \nan increase in the debt ceiling, as the President has asked us in the \nCongress to do.\n  We are told by the Secretary of the Treasury that by around the first \npart of August the United States will run up to the debt ceiling and, \ntherefore, Congress needs to pass legislation to extend that authority. \nEssentially, this is because financial commitments the United States \nhas already made can only be paid if we borrow money to pay those \nfinancial commitments. Therefore, the debt ceiling would need to be \nincreased.\n  Members of both bodies on both sides of the aisle have acknowledged \nthat one of the primary things we need to do at the same time we raise \nthe debt ceiling--if that is to be accomplished--is to ensure that we \ndon't have to keep doing that in the future; that is to say, that we \ndon't keep piling on more debt by increasing spending in the future so \nthat certain things will be necessary at that time: constraints on \nfuture spending; limitations on the ability of Congress and the \nPresident to pass additional appropriations for spending; for example, \nsetting limits on our budget for the next at least couple of years so \nwe know exactly how much Congress would be authorized to spend. Of \ncourse, those limits should take us back in time. They should not \nincrease the amount of spending but should result in reductions.\n  Tackling entitlements--we know the big money is in entitlements such \nas Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and other forms of what is \ncalled mandatory spending, spending that is committed to groups of \nAmericans that doesn't require congressional action but money that we \nknow we are going to have to spend in the future--enormous sums, in the \ntrillions of dollars.\n  If we are not able to trim that in one way or another, or at least \nstop the increases in growth, we are not going to be able to afford \nthose programs in the future and would, therefore, have to continue to \nraise the debt ceiling.\n  Another question that has arisen is whether it would be helpful in \nthis connection to raise taxes. I have said, and the Republican side \nhas said, we will not do that as part of this exercise in extending the \ndebt ceiling. There may come a point in time later this year or next \nyear where all of us would get together and engage in what some have \ncalled fundamental tax reform--or I like to call it progrowth tax \nreform because I think a lot of economists believe our Tax Code today \nis not conducive to economic growth, and were we to make it much \nsimpler and do things such as reducing the corporate tax rate, for \nexample, we can be much more competitive with our foreign trading \npartners. The President himself has made the point that we can reduce \nthe corporate tax rate were we to eliminate what some call loopholes, \nand thereby reduce the amount of money we have to collect through the \ntax rate itself. This is a potential when we get into that kind of \nreform.\n  I want to distinguish the point of rebalancing our Tax Code to get a \nprogrowth kind of Tax Code with the possibility of generating more \nrevenue to deal with our debt situation. Those are two totally \ndifferent situations. While I would be very much in favor of taking a \nlook at these tax expenditures, various subsidies, for example, to \ndifferent groups to see whether we could reduce some of those, thereby \nreduce tax rates in a revenue-neutral manner so our Tax Code would be \nmore conducive to growth, but in a revenue-neutral manner, meaning not \nin order to raise revenues but in order to have a more sensible Tax \nCode so we can be more competitive with our trading partners, for \nexample, that is what the President, as I understand it, proposed \nrelative to our corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the world \ntoday. If we can get that down from 35 percent to 20 or 25 percent, we \ncan be much more competitive with our trading partners.\n  One way is to reduce so-called tax expenditures. To give an example \nor two, we have significant tax credits and deductions that are taken \nfor the production of things such as ethanol or for production of \ncertain kinds of weather stripping equipment or solar energy equipment. \nThis is an effort to promote so-called green energy. Those are pretty \nbig subsidies. They are tax credits or deductions called tax \nexpenditures. Were some of those to be eliminated or reduced, then we \ncan offset that increase in revenue with a reduction in the tax rate \nand still have as much revenue coming into the Treasury but have a more \nsensible Tax Code.\n  Let's contrast that with the situation on the debt ceiling question \nbecause that is the one before us right now. We are going to have to \nact on the debt ceiling in the next couple of months or so. The \nquestion is, How should we deal with our ballooning deficits and debt \nin order to warrant increasing the debt ceiling above what it is today? \nThe answer, of course, is to reduce spending, not raise revenues or \nincrease taxes.\n  I don't think anybody is suggesting increasing revenues by increasing \ntax rates. But some people have said we can eliminate some of these \nloopholes or tax expenditures, and that is a way to collect more \nrevenue. If a company cannot take a certain credit or deduction, it is \ngoing to have to pay more in taxes.\n  I wish to make the point that, no if we are going to get into that \nkind of discussion, we should do it in the context of reforming our Tax \nCode so we can use those increased revenues in order to reduce the tax \nrates, as I said before, so that our country can be more competitive.\n  That is the context in which we should be discussing the reduction or \nelimination of some of these so-called tax expenditures.\n  Just in looking at this in an abstract way--and I will get more \nspecific about numbers--our problem is spending. We have increased \nspending so much more than it has ever been in the past that we are \ngetting very deep in debt.\n  To just give a comparison, spending is over 25 percent of GDP. That \nis the amount we are now spending at the Federal Government level. Our \nhistoric level is just above 20 percent of the GDP. That is an enormous \nincrease in the amount of spending by this country. Some will point out \nthat the revenues collected by the Treasury are also down, and that has \ncontributed to the deficit. To some extent that is true. What are the \nreasons? It is primarily because of the recession that we have been in \nsince the end of 2006--the decrease in the amount of money that \nindividuals and businesses are making, and therefore a reduction in the \nrevenues collected as taxes by the IRS. So revenues are down, but it is \ndue to the recession that we have. We have not cut tax rates in the \nlast few years--since 2006--for example.\n  The last time we had any kind of tax reduction was as a result of the \n2001 and 2003 so-called Bush tax cuts. But we were generating a lot of \nrevenue in this country before the recession. The recession caused us \nto generate less as families, as State and local governments, and as \nthe Federal Government. But CBO figures demonstrate that under any of \nthe budgets offered, including the Obama budget, we will be back to \nhistoric average levels of tax\n\n[[Page S2981]]\n\ncollections in just the next few years--something on the order of 20 \npercent of our gross domestic product. Revenues are not the problem. \nThey are going to be back where they have always been. Our problem is \nthe spending, as I said. The spending in this country is now above 25 \npercent.\n  I misspoke a moment ago when I was talking about collections. The tax \ncollections in this country have averaged between 18 and 19 percent of \nGDP. The spending has been a little above 20 percent. So the revenues \nare going to get back up to that 18 or 19 percent under any of the \nbudgets that have been suggested--the Ryan budget, the Obama budget, \nand others.\n  The problem is spending. Under the Obama budget, spending never gets \nbelow 23 percent of the gross domestic product. In the Ryan budget, it \ngoes from the 25 percent that we are at today to below 20 percent. I \nthink that after 10 years, in the Ryan budget passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, it is about 19.1 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. That is a way to get spending down to historic levels. \nRevenues will be back up to historic levels, and that is the way we \nhave both a vibrant economy and we produce the revenues the Federal \nGovernment needs to operate without having to borrow 40 cents or 42 \ncents on every dollar as we have to do today.\n  When we are talking about how to get the budget better balanced, how \nto reduce our deficits, we should not be looking at the revenue side or \nthe taxing side; we should be looking at the spending side. On \nspending, we know the big money is in the entitlements, not the \ndiscretionary part of the budget.\n  We need to, as a downpayment, be looking in the order of magnitude of \nabout $2 trillion. Speaker Boehner has said that if the administration \nwants to increase the debt ceiling by $2 trillion, then we should show \n$2 trillion in savings. If it is $1 trillion, then make it $1 trillion. \nSo far in our negotiations, we are only talking about a couple hundred \nbillion dollars. We have to get up to the $1 trillion and $2 trillion \nlevel. Over the course of the 10 years, we are going to have to at \nleast double that to more than $4 trillion if we are going to handle \nthe long-term debt problem. That is how big it is.\n  Under the Ryan budget, the actual debt ceiling is increased by $5 \ntrillion over 10 years. So we are not talking about slashing everything \nin half. We are talking about continuing to have to borrow more money \nto pay our bills. But under the Obama budget, the amount we would have \nto borrow, in addition to what we have, is $12 trillion. President \nObama would be asking us to raise the debt ceiling by another $12 \ntrillion, and that is not sustainable in this country. It has to be \nmore along the line of the Ryan budget, as I said. That means we are \ngoing to have to come up this year with at least $4 trillion--I would \nsay between $4 trillion and $6 trillion--in savings in order to be able \nto bend this spending curve downward over time. That means at least a \ncouple trillion dollars as a downpayment, at least double that over \nthis 10-year period, and that means a lot more than what we have been \ntalking about in our negotiations so far.\n  I do not doubt the good will of the parties to achieve that \nobjective, but it cannot be achieved by looking at just domestic \ndiscretionary spending. We have to look at fundamental entitlement \nreform in order to achieve those kinds of savings. For those who say \nthat may change the Medicare Program or it may change the Social \nSecurity Program, two things:\n  First, nobody is talking about changing any of those programs for \nanybody who is currently on them or even somebody who is going to be on \nthem within a 10-year period of time. We are not talking about people \nwho are on Social Security or people who are even 9 years away from \nSocial Security.\n  Second, with respect to the benefits that are promised in these \nprograms, understand that if we do not do something about them now, \nthose benefits are not going to be there in 15 or 20 years. In fact, \nunder Social Security, the law is that when it no longer has the \nbenefits, the benefits stop. This is not a matter of either keeping in \nlaw what we have right now or nothing; this is a matter of either \nfixing the programs now or having a dramatic reduction in benefits on \ndown the road. That is why we need to tackle this issue now.\n  One of the reasons I wanted to discuss this on the floor today is \nbecause there is some misunderstanding of comments I made on television \nyesterday, and I think it is easy to misunderstand people when they \ntalk about raising revenue in the context of dealing with a budget \ndeficit. Republicans are simply not going to raise tax rates in order \nto try to reduce this deficit with more revenue as opposed to savings. \nIt is much different to talk about that than it is to say there are tax \nexpenditures we can deal with, and if we can eliminate those or reduce \nthem, then we can also reduce our tax rates and make our Tax Code more \ncompetitive.\n  That makes a perfect amount of sense. But I don't think we will be \nable to do that within the next 2 months. My guess is it is either \ngoing to be later this fall or early next year before we are able to \nachieve that kind of bipartisan revision of our Tax Code, if we can \neven do it then. I hope we can because I think there is a recognition \nby a lot of folks that there are a lot of these tax expenditures in the \ncode that do not need to be in the code. They pick winners and losers. \nThe more we can do away with and thereby reduce tax rates, the better \noff we will be. I am hopeful we will, through these bipartisan \nnegotiations, be able to come together on significant savings.\n  The last point I will make is I would not be concerned, however, that \nthe United States of America will ever default on our debt. We will \nnot. The President has made it clear, the Secretary of the Treasury has \nmade it clear that we can't. In fact, if we look at article IV of the \n14th amendment, it says we can't. So I don't think any creditor should \nbe of the view that we are not going to pay them when their T-bill \ncomes due. That is not going to happen.\n  Nonetheless, it is not a good situation when the income of the \ngovernment is less than the bills we need to pay because even though we \nmay pay creditors, that may mean, Mr. President, your paycheck and mine \nmight be paid 2 weeks late or something like that, and I am sure all of \nus would like to see our bills paid on time. But I think we can come \ntogether and even avoid that result if we are able to work together as \nboth sides of the aisle and as both bodies in the Congress have \ncommitted themselves to do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about a \nconversation I had in Baltimore this afternoon dealing with the high \nprice of gasoline. I was talking to a station owner. I mention that \nbecause the problems of the high price of gasoline have nothing to do \nwith the station owners. These are small business owners. They are \nhaving a difficult time with the cash flow due to the higher costs to \npurchase their product. They are also on the front lines, getting the \nwrath of consumers as they get the sticker shock when they fill up \ntheir tanks.\n  I can tell you that consumers are hurting today every time they go to \na gasoline station to fill up their gas tanks. It is affecting their \nhousehold budgets. It is affecting our economy. It will become even \nmore dire as we go into the summer months when more and more families \nwill be deciding on their family vacations, and the cost of gasoline \nwill very much figure into it, having a direct impact on our economy.\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\n  I can tell you a group of companies that are not hurting as a result \nof the gasoline price increase, and they are our big oil companies. \nWith gas prices escalating, oil profits have soared. There is a direct \nrelationship. As our economy is suffering with higher gasoline prices, \nthe profits of the oil companies go up. The five largest oil \ncompanies--ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips--have \nseen nearly $1 trillion in profits over the last 10 years. In the first \nquarter of 2011 alone, the first 3 months, they had a record profit of \n$35.8 billion.\n  When we compare that to a year ago, these companies have seen an \nincrease in their profits. Where American businesses are suffering, \nwhere household incomes are being stretched, the oil industry makes \nmore money on higher prices of gasoline.\n  I am for the free market economy. I hope businesses make a lot of \nmoney and hire more people; that is good. But that is not the situation \nwith the oil industry. Most of their profits go to their stockholders \nand to repurchase shareholders' interests. It is not going to creating \nnew jobs in America.\n  They are making these profits in part because of taxpayer subsidies. \nThe person who goes to fill up his or her gas tank at a gasoline \nstation is being affected adversely twice: first, by the cost of the \ngasoline today, and, second, they are being asked as taxpayers \nliterally to help subsidize the oil industry. That makes absolutely no \nsense whatsoever.\n  In 2005, President George W. Bush said:\n\n       I will tell you, with $55 oil we don't need incentives to \n     the oil and gas companies to explore. There are plenty of \n     incentives.\n\n  As you know, the crude oil price per barrel today is not $55; it is \n$100, and it has even gone higher than that. At the time, 2005, all of \nthe Big Oil CEOs agreed there was no need for subsidies with oil prices \nreaching $55 a barrel. Once again, today it is $100 a barrel.\n  We will have a chance later this week to consider legislation to \neliminate these tax loopholes. Senator Menendez has introduced \nlegislation, and we are going to have a cloture vote on that later this \nweek.\n  I want to talk about the largest tax provision that is involved in \nthis legislation, section 199. There is about $18 billion of taxpayer \nrevenue involved. Let me give a little history about the genesis of \nthis tax provision.\n  It was originally put in the tax law for foreign sales companies, \nU.S. companies that exported products overseas for, you see, a U.S. \nmanufacturer is at a disadvantage with regard to a foreign company \nmanufacturer. If you manufacture your product in Europe or Asia and you \nimport it into America, you can take off from the imported price the \nvalue-added tax that is added in Europe and Asia. But if you are an \nAmerican manufacturer, and you are sending your product into Europe and \nAsia--and, yes, there are taxes involved in producing a product in \nAmerica--you cannot take that tax off when you send that product into \nEurope. So the playing field we are competing on is not a level playing \nfield. American manufacturers do not share the same competitive \nadvantage.\n  Congress did something about that and passed a tax provision to give \nU.S. manufacturers that export products a tax break. That is what we \ndid. Obviously, the oil industry did not get that tax break. First of \nall, they are not what we would call traditional manufacturing, and, \nsecond, they import a lot more than they ever export. They import their \ncrude oil, and the amount of their exported product is a lot less than \nthat.\n  The problem happened after we passed this foreign sales provision. \nCompanies in Europe and Asia took us to the World Trade Organization \nand said this was an illegal subsidy to U.S. manufacturers. We argued, \nand I think ours was the right position, that it was not, but we lost \nthe case. As a result, we had to redo the tax provisions, and we passed \nwhat is now known as section 199.\n  What we did is rough justice. We gave all manufacturing a certain tax \nbreak, figuring that it would be fair to deal with their manufacturing \nthat was used for export.\n  I must tell you, I don't think any of us envisioned at that time that \n$18 billion of that revenue would go to the oil industry. They did not \nneed this break. This is not a matter of subsidizing their products \ninto the export market when, as we know, petroleum and oil is a global \nproduct. It makes no sense whatsoever to continue this tax provision \nfor the oil industry. It should have been repealed a long time ago.\n  But one thing is clear. It is not needed. The profits of the oil \nindustry are very high, and we need these revenues for other purposes. \nWe need these revenues in order to deal with deficit reduction.\n  I hear my colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk frequently about \nhow we need a credible plan to reduce the Federal deficit. I agree with \nthat. We do need a credible plan to reduce the Federal deficit. But if \nwe don't start with getting rid of these tax expenditures that are \nclearly not serving any public purpose--if we can't start with what is \neasy--how are we going to make the tough decisions?\n  If we are being asked to tell our seniors they will have to make do \nwith less, students will have to pay more, let me tell you, the oil \nindustry can do without this subsidy they do not need.\n  We will hear all types of scare tactics used by those who oppose this \nrepeal. One of the common lines is that it will increase the price at \nthe gas pump. Nothing could be further from the truth. If I could just \ntell you the basic math: $140 billion in profits, we are talking about \nannually--projected to be $140 billion. The tax provisions are about $4 \nbillion on an annual basis. The numbers I was giving you before are 10-\nyear numbers; this is on an annual basis.\n  In 2009, over 85 percent of the profits went back to the \nshareholders. So there is no possible way it would have an impact on \nprice.\n  Let me quote from some experts in this area. Severin Borenstein, the \ncodirector of University of California Berkeley's Center for the Study \nof Energy Markets observes:\n\n       Gasoline prices are a function of world oil prices and \n     refining margins . . . the incremental change in production \n     that might result from changing oil subsidies will have no \n     impact on world oil prices, and therefore no impact on \n     gasoline prices.\n\n  Our own Congressional Research Service said:\n\n       In the recent market environment . . . prices are well in \n     excess of costs and a small increase in taxes would be \n     unlikely to reduce oil output, and hence increase petroleum \n     product (gasoline) prices.\n\n  So let me just put that myth aside.\n  All of us are concerned about how do we bring down gasoline prices. \nWill eliminating this price bring down gasoline prices? No, it will \nnot, in and of itself. But what it will do is give us all the tools we \nneed in order to move forward with energy policies in America. We are \ngoing to be asking for budget priorities to deal with energy \nindependence so we can bring down energy prices. We have to get rid of \nthese unnecessary tax expenditures so we can have a budget that makes \nsense and is fiscally responsible.\n\n  Yes, there are things we can do to help bring down gasoline prices. \nWe can certainly regulate speculation in the commodities market, give \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission the tools they need. Some of \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle want to cut their resources. \nWe think they should have the resources in order to get their job done.\n  It is time we take on the monopolistic policies of the countries that \nproduce oil. These are countries, many of which are not what we would \ncall at all free economic countries. They are manipulating price and \nsupply. We need to do a better job taking that on. We need a \ncomprehensive energy policy.\n  I have said many times on the Senate floor that America has a little \nover 2 percent of the reserves of oil and we consume 25 percent of the \nworld's oil. We have to get off oil, imported oil. The only way to do \nthat is develop renewable energy resources, use less energy so our \nNation can become energy independent. That will not only help us as it \nrelates to the current economic problems, it will also help us create \nmore jobs in America, will make us more energy secure, and will also \nhelp our environment. The first step is to repeal the unwarranted \ntaxpayer subsidies to the big oil companies.\n  Let me close by quoting from an editorial that appeared in my local \npaper, the Baltimore Sun, on Friday, this past\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\nFriday, May 13. I am going to quote a small part of it.\n\n       What, tens of billions of dollars in potential profits \n     isn't good enough without the government adding some kind of \n     sweetener to your $100 barrels of black gold?\n       That's just greedy, and with the nation facing a debt \n     crisis, it's downright immoral. To be talking about trimming \n     Medicare and Medicaid--basic health care for our seniors and \n     the poor--while preserving tax breaks that cost the federal \n     treasury $21 billion annually is just beyond the pale.\n\n  I agree with the editorial in the Baltimore Sun. It is well past time \nthat we end these taxpayer subsidies. We are going to have a chance to \ndo it this week.\n  The first vote will be on cloture, whether we want to take this up \nfor a vote, up or down. I don't think this is terribly complicated. \nThis is an issue on which the American people expect us to take a \nstand, on an up-or-down vote. I hope my colleagues will support the \nconsideration of the bill of Senator Menendez to repeal these tax \nsubsidies and vote to repeal these subsidies so we can help the \nAmerican taxpayers and work together to develop an energy policy to \nmake America secure so we can have a stable energy cost, including \nreducing the costs of gasoline at the pump, which is affecting every \none of our constituents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Senate is expected to take \nup a bill that would repeal $20 billion in outdated, antiquated tax \nbreaks for the oil and gas companies. In many cases, this tax break was \ncreated about a century ago. They have little, if anything, to do with \nmodern, job-creating energy policy. It is time for them to go.\n  These oil and gas tax breaks are targeted in this bill we are going \nto vote on. They are narrow, special interest tax subsidies that \ndistort the marketplace. It happens to pad the profits as a result of \nthe tax breaks, and it does nothing to keep gas prices down.\n  It simply doesn't make any sense to me that we would continue to rely \non oil and gas tax breaks that were originally written in 1916. These \nrules are truly vestiges of another era. In some cases, rather than \nencouraging energy independence, the tax breaks actually promote energy \ndependence on the OPEC oil-producing member states and other foreign \ncountries that produce oil.\n  For example, there is a part in it called the ``dual capacity'' \nprovision and it allows major oil companies to claim a foreign tax \ncredit for royalties paid to foreign governments. The foreign tax \ncredit was never intended to offset royalty payments. It was originally \nintended to offset foreign income tax payments. So a company does \nbusiness in a foreign country, they pay an income tax. The foreign tax \ncredit was created so you could offset your foreign taxes on your \nAmerican income taxes. But what has happened is the oil companies have \ntwisted that and are claiming the royalties they pay to foreign \ngovernments as an income tax. It isn't. It is a royalty payment. The \nforeign tax credit was never intended for that, and it is another \nloophole in our Tax Code that does nothing more than promote reliance \nand dependence on foreign oil and, for that matter, foreign \ngovernments. That is exactly what we ought to be reversing, just from a \nnational security standpoint, not even speaking of the threat to our \nnational economic condition, because we are now importing 70 percent of \nour daily consumption of oil from foreign shores.\n  In addition to repealing those kinds of tax subsidies, we also need \nto close a loophole that allows oil companies to claim a tax break for \ntheir own irresponsible actions. It turns out that BP has figured out \nhow to shift nearly a third of their cleanup and legal costs of the \nGulf of Mexico oilspill onto the backs of American taxpayers. Here is \nwhat they have done. They have come out with a projection of future \nincome and profitability in a report. They expect they are going to \nhave somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 billion of payments they are \ngoing to make as a result of their irresponsible action of having this \nhuge Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf. Part of that, of course, \nis payments to local governments. Part of that is payments through the \nGulf Claims Facility Fund. Part of that is going to be a hefty fine \nthat is going to be imposed by the Federal Government.\n  Very cleverly, they have gotten their tax lawyers together and \nfigured out what they can do is deduct the oil spill recovery payments \nas an expense, and save themselves $11.8 billion in taxes. What BP is \ndoing is treating its cleanup and legal expense as an ordinary and \nnecessary cost of doing business. These costs aren't ordinary business \nexpenses and they should not be deductible.\n  When the five oil company CEOs were in front of our Finance \nCommittee, I asked the CEO of BP: Are you going to do this?\n  He said: That is what the law allows and that is what we are going to \ndo.\n  I said: What the law allows doesn't make it right. Why don't you take \na cue from the Boeing Company or from Goldman Sachs for the expenses \nthey incurred as a result of untoward activity? They voluntarily did \nnot employ this part of the Tax Code to use it as a business deduction \nand, therefore, to cut their taxes.\n  Of course, when a company such as this cuts their taxes nearly $12 \nbillion, guess who makes up the difference? The rest of us do. The \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  I filed a bill, the Oilspill Tax Fairness Act, and it aims to reduce \nthe deficit by billions of dollars by preventing oil companies from \nshifting the cost of oilspills onto our taxpayers. In the past, \nCongress has stepped in to prevent unconscionable tax deductions for \nexpenses such as civil and criminal fines, bribes, lobbying \nexpenditures, political contributions, excessive executive \ncompensation. We have done that in the Congress by passing laws to \nprevent those as tax deductions. Well, we ought to step in and do it \nagain. I think anybody would say BP was irresponsible and negligent to \nthe detriment of a whole lot of people and the company should not be \nable to claim tax savings for their missteps, especially while our \npeople are being squeezed at the pump every day because of the price of \ngasoline at the same time that in the first 3 months of this year, the \nfirst quarter, those five oil companies had $35 billion in profits. \nThis is pouring salt on the wound. How much more flagellation can the \nAmerican taxpayer take?\n  Today's rising gas prices reflect more than just record profits for \nthe oil companies. There is also rising demand in Asia. It is clearly \nevident that our oil and energy markets are no longer governed by \nsupply and demand. Speculation is back with a vengeance. We saw the \nhandiwork of speculators 2 years ago when the price of oil hit an all-\ntime high of $147 a barrel, only to plummet 80 percent of that price a \nfew months later. That is not supply and demand. That is not the \nworkings of the economic market. That is in part caused by speculators \nrunning the price of oil up, and then because they had to drop their \npositions on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the \nexchanges, they started dropping all of those futures contracts in oil. \nNow speculators are using the turmoil in the Middle East and North \nAfrica as an excuse to drive the price of oil sky high.\n  It makes no sense that we continue to let the commodities exchanges \nself-regulate by setting their own margin levels and other rules. Last \nyear, when we passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act, Congress empowered the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission under the new law to rein in excessive speculation so that \ncommodities markets don't fly off the rails. Yet this same commission \nhas yet to finalize new rules to impose speculative position limits, \nwhich are hard caps on the amount any one speculator can invest in oil \nderivatives.\n\n  There are a number of us who have been working for months in this \nSenate to push the CFTC to act. The law we passed was clear, and it is \ntime for the Federal regulators to follow through.\n  Sadly, I want to recall a little over a year ago something that a lot \nof us remember so vividly. Many people cannot forget the images of the \noil that was gushing from 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf of \nMexico.\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\n  In my public service for decades, I have warned about the dangers of \ndrilling out there in the gulf. It is now unbelievable that almost a \nyear after the gulf oilspill and the environmental disaster that \nensued, folks are still now talking about being willing to risk the \neconomy of the entire gulf coast again. You remember that 11 people \ndied because safety took a back seat to expediency and profit.\n  Last week the House passed three bills that would speed up oil \nproduction in a way that ignores serious safety concerns. Now Senator \nMcConnell has a similar proposal. These bills would require the \nSecretary of the Interior to approve or deny drilling permits within a \nmaximum of 60 days, and if the Secretary does not take action within \nthat time, a permit is deemed approved. That is like saying if a home \nbuyer is not approved for financing within 60 days, they automatically \nget the financing regardless of their credit. Or it is like saying if a \nprisoner does not hear back from the parole board in 2 months, that \nprisoner is going to be automatically out on parole.\n  It is simply irresponsible to deregulate an inherently dangerous \nactivity in this manner, and it is a slap in the face to the commercial \nfishermen, the hoteliers, and the small business owners on the gulf \ncoast who, to this day, have not been made whole. Yet these bills are \nout here. The House passed it.\n  Senator McConnell's bill would roll back the Department of the \nInterior's post-Deepwater Horizon revisions to offshore leasing--\nrevisions that came about because of what we learned from the oilspill. \nSenator McConnell's bill seeks to limit the fundamental right of \nAmericans; that is, access to the courts. His bill would not allow \nFloridians who want to file a civil lawsuit regarding any offshore \nenergy projects in the Gulf of Mexico to have a claim near their home \nin Florida or their place of business in Florida. Instead, under his \nbill, they have to go to the Fifth Circuit. That is Mississippi, \nLouisiana, and Texas. Why should people from Florida have to file a \nclaim there? Why can't they go through the Eleventh Circuit, which is \nthe one for the State of Florida and Georgia? The Fifth Circuit \ncertainly cannot be the only circuit with expertise on the subject of \noffshore energy.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to protect access to the courts, \nand Senator McConnell's bill jeopardizes that for the people who do not \nhave the luxury of going far off to another State to bring a lawsuit.\n  Meanwhile, the House has passed a bill last week that seeks to open--\nnow it is getting personal--they seek to open the eastern Gulf of \nMexico off of Florida, that which Senator Martinez and I made off \nlimits in law. There are obvious reasons we have it off limits in law. \nIt is the largest testing and training area for the U.S. military in \nthe world. We have two letters from two successive Secretaries of \nDefense, including the present one, Secretary Gates, that says you \ncannot have oil drilling and related activities--they use the word it \nis ``incompatible'' with the military training and testing mission. \nThat is the largest training and testing area for the U.S. military in \nthe world.\n  It is basically right off of Florida. Of course, you all have heard \nme over and over talk about all the dry holes. There is not much oil \nout there off of Florida. The oil is where the Lord intended the oil to \nbe--and that was for years the sediments coming down the Mississippi \nRiver and then being compacted, and then for millions of years the \ncompacting of the Earth's crust formed that oil. That is off of, \nprimarily, Louisiana, some off of Mississippi, some off of Alabama and \nTexas, not Florida.\n  The proponents of these bills claim they will lower gas prices. At \nthe same time, the oil and gas companies are making billions of \ndollars. Just look at their first quarter report. And we are giving big \ntax subsidies to the oil companies.\n  The price of oil dropped $17 a barrel last week. It was the largest \nweekly decline in over 2 years. But do you know what? I do not think \nthe folks at the gas pump saw a commensurate drop. I think it is about \ntime we gave them some relief, and we are going to have a chance to do \nthat.\n  I conclude by saying we are not fooling ourselves. To be able to get \nan individual bill such as this for specific tax breaks--however \nobjectionable those tax breaks are, it is going to be difficult to get \n60 votes to break a filibuster. But help is on the way. There is a \ngroup called the Gang of Six. They are meeting, and they are trying to \nput together a package to solve our deficit crisis and to make real \nprogress over the next decade or so, as we move toward budget balance--\na condition we enjoyed as recently as 2001--not only budget balance, \nbut a budget surplus.\n  It is my hope when we get down to putting this package together of \nhow we are going to lower the deficit, people of good will will come \ntogether and recognize there are things in the Tax Code that have to be \nchanged to make them right. I have enumerated but a few here today.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I look forward to \nthe comments of the very distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased I could be here to hear our \ncolleague from Florida talking so eloquently about the importance of \nending the subsidies we are currently paying to the Nation's largest \noil companies and about the importance of continuing to preserve the \ngulf and to make sure the regulations we put in place last year \ncontinue.\n  I appreciate his leadership on both of those issues, and particularly \non protecting the gulf, which is a national treasure. So I thank very \nmuch our colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson.\n  I came down to the floor today to talk about the important \nlegislation that is before us to reduce our deficit by ending the \nneedless subsidies for the Nation's largest oil companies.\n  At a time when Americans are paying these companies $4 a gallon for \ngasoline--and in some places it is more than that--it might be \nsurprising to some people out there that these same companies are \nreceiving $4 billion a year in subsidies from the American taxpayer.\n  The legislation that is before us in the Senate right now would end \nsix of these separate tax handouts. One of them repeals a provision \nthat essentially amounts to a subsidy for foreign oil production. A \nsecond closes a loophole that lets oil companies drill for free on \npublic lands in the Outer Continental Shelf. Another ends a practice \nthat lets oil companies manipulate the numbers when deducting the cost \nof new wells from their taxes. Under current law, in fact, oil \ncompanies sometimes can deduct more than they actually paid to put in \nplace the well.\n  While so many families and small businesses nationwide have struggled \nto pay the high cost of gasoline, the five largest oil companies in the \nUnited States collectively made nearly $1 trillion in profits over the \nlast decade.\n  Yet because of unnecessary and outdated tax subsidies, ExxonMobil--\nthe biggest oil company--paid no U.S. income tax in 2009. That is hard \nto explain to the small businesses in New Hampshire and Florida and \nDelaware that are struggling in this recession to pay their taxes, that \nthe biggest oil company in the country that made the highest profits \ndid not pay any taxes in 2009. With record deficits, ending those \ngiveaways is a commonsense step toward fixing the Federal budget.\n  I have heard some people who are in favor of these giveaways say we \nneed them so the oil companies can keep prices low. But as Senator \nNelson so clearly put it, the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService said last week in a report that rolling back these tax handouts \nwill not raise gas prices. With prices so high, they said, oil \ncompanies will do all they can to maximize production from all existing \nwells and the oil supply will remain unchanged. A barrel of oil is \ncurrently selling for far more than it costs an oil company to produce. \nThese subsidies are doing nothing to make gasoline cheaper.\n  In fact, the former CEO of Shell Oil Company spoke about drilling \nsubsidies last February, and he said: ``with high oil prices, such \nsubsidies are not necessary.''\n  But I think it is important to be clear. This legislation is not \nabout punishing the oil companies for doing well. We want all companies \nin America to do well. It is about reducing the deficit and our debt \nand making smart policy choices with our limited resources.\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\n  Tax breaks for big corporations are just spending under another name, \nand all government spending of taxpayer dollars has to come under \nscrutiny as we tackle our debt and deficits. We are never going to get \nour massive deficits and debt under control unless we are prepared to \neliminate outdated and unnecessary government programs--and that means \ngovernment programs that we support on the Democratic side of the \naisle, and it also means outdated and unnecessary programs that our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle support.\n  Providing tax handouts to one of the most profitable industries in \nhuman history--an industry that clearly needs no help from taxpayers--\nis a logical place to start.\n  As we emerge from this historic recession and grapple with our long-\nterm deficits, we have to ask ourselves: What are our priorities--\ninvesting in the next-generation economy, reducing the national debt to \nleave to our children or is it providing outdated tax breaks to one of \nthe most profitable industries in the history of our country? I think \nthe choice is pretty clear.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this legislation to \neliminate these giveaways, reduce the deficit, and strengthen our \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation we will \nlater vote on this week, authored by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nMenendez. As we all know, he has been championing this legislation for \nquite some time. He had the prescience and foresight to focus on this \nidea early on, and I applaud the hard work he has done to build support \nfor it.\n  I am also glad our leader, Senator Reid, scheduled a vote on it this \nweek. I hope the bill will pass. I have heard that even a few of my \nfriends from the other side of the aisle say they are considering \nvoting for it.\n  Nothing would be better, in terms of showing bipartisanship and \ngiving the American people hope that we can come to a fair agreement on \nthe budget, than to pass the legislation this week.\n  In the last election, voters gave those of us who serve in this \nChamber two distinct mandates. They told us to do two things at once, \neither one of which alone would be hard to do. First, and perhaps \nforemost, they said make the economy grow, create good-paying jobs, \nmake sure of that the American dream which says the odds are that you \nwill be doing better 10 years from today and the odds are that your \nchildren will do better than you. That is the American dream.\n  Since the founding of our great Republic, that candle has burned \nbrightly in the eyes of Americans, whose ancestors have been here since \nthe Mayflower landed, as well as in the eyes of Americans who are just \nhere for a generation or two and even new immigrants.\n  They also gave us a second mandate--not just grow the economy, not \njust to employ people but a second one: rein in the out-of-control \nFederal deficit. The American people, as usual, had wisdom, because \nboth these goals are important. Some say the debt isn't important. I \nbelieve it is.\n  Here is the way I put it: We, the Federal Government, are a \nblindfolded man, and we are walking toward a cliff. Once we fall off \nthat cliff, there is no getting back. The debate is whether we are 20 \nfeet from the cliff or 200 yards from it. But we know that sooner or \nlater, no matter our distance, if we keep walking, we are going to fall \noff. Once you fall off, there is no getting back. So that means we have \nto take the bull by the horns and confront our mounting debt.\n  It would be hard enough to accomplish one of these two goals. To try \nto do both at once is a Herculean task. I think everybody is trying to \ndo what is right, regardless of their ideology, but there are strong \nand different feelings and clear policy differences.\n  There are many tough choices ahead, but there is at least one choice \nthat isn't tough at all--not by a mile. It is obvious to me and to most \nAmericans, whether it is people you talk to as you go about your State \nor looking at the polling data, that at this time of fiscal restraint, \nto continue to give the big oil companies giant tax breaks makes no \nsense. Getting rid of these corporate subsidies to Big Oil is a no-\nbrainer.\n  Decades ago, when these breaks were enacted, oil was $17 a barrel. \nMaybe it made sense then to give companies an incentive to explore and \nproduce. One of the subsidies the Menendez legislation repeals, the oil \ndepletion allowance, dates back to 1913. That is the same year a man \nnamed William Burton patented a new oil extraction process called \nthermal cracking. Big Oil no longer cracks petroleum using Mr. Burton's \nmethod. It is an outdated process, but the outdated tax subsidy still \nremains on the books, amazingly enough.\n  With oil hovering at $100 a barrel and Big Oil reaping record \nprofits, it defies logic for the government to spend billions of \ntaxpayer dollars on these subsidies. We are writing out a check for $4 \nbillion to the big oil companies. Does that make sense when we have so \nmany other needs and a huge deficit? To me, it doesn't.\n  At the same time, Americans get hit with a double whammy. When they \ndrive up to the pump, they are paying $4--or close to it--a gallon for \ngasoline, diesel fuel, and Big Oil is taking some dollars out of their \npockets because their taxes--a small percentage of it--go to pay these \nBig Oil subsidies. How galling.\n  In my home State of New York, the price of gasoline is up 35 percent, \non average, compared to this time last year. Economists estimate that a \ntypical New York family--a typical American family--will pay as much as \n$1,000 more on gas this year than last. When these families sit around \nthe dinner table on Friday nights after dinner and mom and dad are \ntrying to figure out how they are going to pay their bills, those gas \nprices make things much harder. Families across the country are \nstruggling to make ends meet, as the economy slowly recovers. They \ncan't afford to get gouged at the pump. With billions of dollars' worth \nof tax subsidies and gas prices at near record highs, it is no wonder \nthese top five oil companies have just announced mind-boggling profits. \nThese companies are not only among the most profitable businesses in \nthe United States, but they are among the most profitable businesses in \nthe whole world.\n  In the first quarter of this year, the big five brought in $35 \nbillion in profits. In the past decade, they took home nearly $ 1 \ntrillion--that is with a T. There is nothing wrong with profits in and \nof themselves. In America, we celebrate success. We want the private \nsector to thrive and make good profits. But at a time when the \ngovernment is looking to tighten its belt and we are asking every \nfamily to tighten their belt and we are grappling with painful cuts \nbecause of the dual goal of growing the middle class but also reducing \nthe deficit, it boggles the mind that we continue to subsidize such a \nlavishly profitable industry.\n  There are priorities. I said this to the auto company executives last \nweek when they testified before our Finance Committee. There are \npriorities. How many Americans would choose to give oil companies an \nextra subsidy rather than help kids who deserve to go to college pay \nfor their tuition? That is what some of my colleagues are recommending. \nWhen I asked Mr. Mulva, the head of Conoco, one of the big five oil \ncompanies--I said: Well, which would you choose? He said they are two \ndifferent things. Mr. Mulva, in all due respect, they are not. If we \nhave to reduce the deficit by a certain amount, if we take the $21 \nbillion we are giving you, that gives us some money to play with that \nwe might be able to deal--not play with but to use for good purpose--\nthat we could give to prevent cuts and help middle-class families \ndefray the cost of tuition to send their kids to college, which is part \nof the American dream. So they are related--at least in a government-\ndeficit world, at least in a budget world in which we live; every \ndollar you don't spend on one thing is a dollar you might be able to \nuse on something else.\n  Try to wrap your head around it. Big Oil is recording record profits. \nGas\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\nprices are near an alltime high and we as American taxpayers, are \nsubsidizing the oil industry to the tune of $4 billion a year. You need \nthe imagination of Lewis Carroll, who wrote ``Alice in Wonderland,'' to \ncome up with a more ridiculous scenario.\n  That is why I strongly support and am proud to cosponsor Senator \nMenendez's ``Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act.''\n  This legislation will put an end to taxpayer handouts to the five \nlargest integrated oil companies and use that $21 billion in savings to \nreduce the deficit. This $21 billion is an excellent downpayment on the \neffort to get our fiscal house in order. If we use this $21 billion, it \nwill be a little easier to reach our huge goal of reducing the deficit. \nIt will be a little easier to complete our dual goals of reducing the \ndeficit but still growing the economy.\n  The bill repeals a host of Byzantine tax provisions that only a \nlobbyist could love, such as the deduction for tertiary injectants and \nthe deduction for intangible extraction costs. Some thought these up a \nlong time ago. They have sat in our Tax Code, but they mean lots of \nmoney to Big Oil.\n  Small- and medium-sized oil firms are exempt. The only companies the \nlegislation deals with are the big five--Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, \nConocoPhillips, and British Petroleum.\n  I have heard pundits from the hard right parrot Big Oil's talking \npoint that repealing these giveaways would increase gas prices for \nconsumers. Nothing could be further from the truth. Last week, two \nmajor studies--one from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nand another from the Joint Economic Committee--found that ending these \nabsurd subsidies would not--would not--impact the price of gas. Neither \nof these studies--these were scientific studies done by economists. \nThey did not have any biases.\n  In what was perhaps an inadvertent moment of candor at last week's \nFinance Committee hearing, ExxonMobil's CEO Rex Tillerson said:\n\n       Gasoline prices are a function of crude oil prices, which \n     are set in the marketplace by global supply and demand, not \n     by companies such as ours.\n\n  Let me repeat what he said because it directly answers the argument \nthat some on the other side of the aisle have made that if we repeal \nthese subsidies, we will raise gas prices because that means the \ncompanies would decide to raise them because they are getting less \nsubsidy. Here is what Mr. Tillerson said:\n\n       Gasoline prices are a function of crude oil prices, which \n     are set in the marketplace by global supply and demand, not \n     by companies such as ours.\n\n  That does not seem like an objectionable comment; it is true. But \nwhen he made that comment, Mr. Tillerson of ExxonMobil was conceding \nthat repealing taxpayer-funded subsidies for the big five will not \nincrease prices. Prices are set, as he says, by global supply and \ndemand. That is not to say repealing the subsidies would necessarily \nbring down prices. We are not making that claim. All along we have been \nclear that the purpose of this bill is to make a dent in the deficit by \nrepealing tax breaks for the five companies that are the least in need \nof help from Uncle Sam.\n  Lowering the cost of gasoline and ridding our country of its \ndependence on foreign oil requires, of course, a long-term \ncomprehensive approach. It is something we must do. It is outrageous \nthat our country sends $1 billion a day overseas, wealth out of \nAmerican pockets. To whom do we send them? People we dislike \nintensely--Ahmadinejad of Iran and Chavez of Venezuela. Why are we \ndoing that? Because we failed to come up with a long-term policy that \nreduces our dependence on foreign oil.\n  In the months ahead, I expect the Democratic caucus will unveil a \nthorough and forward-thinking plan to do just that. In the meantime, if \nRepublicans in the House are serious about deficit reduction, the \nMenendez bill is their chance to show it now.\n  If we are going to come together, is this not the easiest place to \ncome together? We are going to have a lot of hard struggles as we \nattempt to reduce the deficit, as the debt ceiling looms over us. But \nthis is an easy one, and many people on my side of the aisle are \nscratching their heads. If our colleagues on the other side cannot give \nin on something such as this, what are they going to give in on? \nSpeaker Boehner said earlier this week he wants to make trillions of \ndollars in cuts. Here is a good place to start. Indeed, the Speaker \nhimself has said as much.\n  At one point, he seemed to say it makes some sense to eliminate \nsubsidies to the big five. Let's not forget that Speaker Boehner was in \nfavor of repealing oil subsidies before he was against it.\n  The bottom line is this: At a time of sky-high oil prices, it is \nunfathomable to continue to pad the profit of companies with taxpayer-\nfunded subsidies. The time to repeal these giveaways is now. No more \nshould we send $4 billion this year, next year, or any year to the five \nbig oil companies which have made record profits and admittedly, by the \nadmission of Mr. Tillerson, if we take them away from them it would not \nraise gas prices a plug nickel.\n  Our plan to cut the deficit begins with ending wasteful subsidies to \nBig Oil. The Republican plan, as embodied by the Ryan amendment, for \nwhich almost every Republican in the House voted begins with ending \nMedicare as we know it. That is a bright line difference between our \nside and theirs. We know what choice the American people want us to \nmake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from New \nYork who has been a real leader on this issue to bring more tax \nfairness to the American people and take away the subsidies of these \nfive companies that absolutely do not need those subsidies and to help \ndeal with the budget deficit. We can do that with one simple step that \nfar too many conservative politicians in this city are resisting. I \njoin Senator Schumer in expanding on his comments.\n  We think our Nation's spending and its budget should reflect our \nNation's priorities, should reflect our investments in education, \ninfrastructure, how it will strengthen our economic competitiveness, \nwhether in Charleston, WV, or Ironton, OH, through the innovation of \nentrepreneurs and small businesses.\n  Our Tax Code should also reflect our priorities to create jobs at \nhome--to encourage companies to invest in clean energy to end our \nNation's dependence on foreign dirty oil.\n  Last week, unfortunately, we heard just how out of touch some \npoliticians and their benefactors in the oil industry are with the real \npriorities and real problems facing our Nation--huge Federal deficits, \n$4-a-gallon gas, Americans struggling to find a job or put food on the \ntable even if they are employed.\n  I received a letter from Laurie from Lakewood, OH:\n\n       This recession has hurt our family budget for the past \n     three years. My husband and I have had our pay reduced.\n       We cut our expenses--not going out to eat or to the movies \n     or the department stores. My husband and I are both working \n     second jobs to keep our kids in school and food on the table. \n     We carpool and do everything we can to cut expenses.\n       I'm at the end, I don't know where else to cut and I don't \n     have the option of not putting gas in my tank because I have \n     to get to my jobs.\n\n  She said ``jobs,'' plural.\n\n       Please, if you can do anything, it would help so many of us \n     who are struggling.\n\n  Laurie's story is similar to that of many other Americans and so many \nOhioans from Ashton, OH, to Hamilton, from Lima to Gallipolis, the \nworking mom who drives from home in the suburbs to work downtown; \ntruckdrivers in Toledo where high gas prices jeopardize their ability \nto operate and transport products across the country;\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\nsmall business owners in Lima, in Zanesville, Findlay, Mansfield, and \nChillicothe who worry that high gas prices cut into already razor-thin \nmargins, where money spent on gas means less spent on finished \nproducts, goods, and services.\n  Their stories stand in sharp contrast to what we heard last week when \nthe CEOs of the five largest oil companies testified before the Senate \nFinance Committee. They insisted on holding on to those tax loopholes \nthat they said before they do not want and they have acknowledged they \nwill not use to expand production.\n  A common refrain we hear from conservative Washington politicians is \nthat just as American families are tightening their belts, so, too, \nshould the Federal Government. Just ask Laurie and the thousands of \nother Ohioans who work hard and play by the rules and are doing \neverything they can to get by.\n\n  What about big oil? They are doing just fine with windfall profits, \nbillions and billions. The five largest oil companies made $32 billion \nin profits in the first quarter of this year. Based on that, over four \nquarters over this full calendar year of 2011, we can project the five \ncompanies' profits being $128 billion plus--$128 billion. Their profits \nare good. But when their profits are more than $30 billion in the first \nquarter alone, it is clear they do not need these taxpayer-funded \ngiveaways.\n  Americans spent 28 percent more for gas in the first 3 months of 2011 \nthan they did in the same period in 2010. Meanwhile, the big five oil \ncompanies--BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and Shell--made 38 \npercent more profit. The companies then used a major portion of these \nadditional profits to buy back stock to enrich their board of \ndirectors, senior managers, and shareholders.\n  These massive profits are possible by a misguided part of the Tax \nCode--one that allows them to take advantage of credits that are, in \nfact, meant to encourage American manufacturing. That is why the Close \nBig Oil Tax Loopholes Act is so important. The bill would end more than \n$2 billion in tax subsidy deductions and royalty relief that big \ncompanies receive each year.\n  Consumers who are already paying for $4-a-gallon gas at the pump \nshould not be forced to write another $2 billion check to companies \nthat do not need it. But that is exactly what our Tax Code allows. To \nput it another way, it grants corporate welfare to Big Oil. It is \nunnecessary and undermines the actual manufacturing that can create \njobs and strengthen our production of domestic clean energy.\n  We should promote only those tax credits--only precisely those tax \ncredits--that constitute an effective use of tax dollars. For example, \nmanufacturers from across Ohio and the Nation have benefited from the \n48(c) advanced manufacturing tax credits that help us move away from \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  Mr. President, 48(c) leverages public incentives to attract private \nsector investment. That means government and business working together \nto create jobs and build a clean energy economy. Seven Ohio companies \nwere awarded $125 million in initial 48(c) funding in the first phase \nof last year. These companies and their workers--in Bedford, Bucyrus, \nCircleville, Dayton, Findlay, Perrysburg, and Toledo, OH--will retool \ntheir factories to build clean energy products from wind turbine bolts \nto energy-efficient lamps and home appliances to state-of-the-art solar \npanel technologies.\n  I introduced the Security in Energy and Manufacturing Act--the SEAM \nAct--to extend the 48(c) program. The SEAM Act will promote grants as a \nmeans to invest in more companies, especially small- and medium-sized \nmanufacturers that do not have tax liabilities or companies that \nstruggle to find credit in the tight financial market.\n  We want these manufacturing tax credits--very different from what the \noil industry is demanding they keep because their tax incentives \naccomplish none of this. We are asking that those startup companies, \nthose companies that are not yet so profitable, take these 48(c) tax \ncredits because they simply do not have the tax liability yet. We are \nasking that those be part of the code so those companies can get some \nassistance as they begin to grow their businesses and conserve energy.\n  This would further promote U.S. clean energy manufacturing and ensure \nour manufacturers produce all the component parts in the clean energy \nsupply chain.\n  Yet instead of adopting this valuable incentive, Republican \nopposition in the Senate and Republican opposition in the House forces \nus to continue to allow Big Oil to exploit the manufacturing deduction \nto extract oil from the ground. They do not need any more incentives to \ndrill for oil when they are getting close to $100 a barrel. What they \nare doing is not manufacturing in any sense of the word.\n  We need a more comprehensive reexamination of the corporate Tax Code. \nIn the meantime, we should be able to agree there is no justification \nto continuing tax subsidies to companies that have no need for them. \nThis legislation is modest. It is only in the scheme of a huge Federal \nbudget, in the scheme of $125 billion profits for the oil companies. It \nis only in the scheme of that a first step. After removing these \nunnecessary tax loopholes, the Senate should work on cracking down on \nboth reckless Wall Street speculators and OPEC members that manipulate \nprices through collusion and price fixing.\n  One step is to take away the tax subsidies. Middle-class families in \nDayton, Akron, Canton, Youngstown, Huntington, Charleston, in Beckley \nare reaching into their pockets and giving to the oil companies. We are \ntaking that away. At the same time, the administration needs to crack \ndown on Wall Street speculators that are gaming the system as they \nmanipulate prices with OPEC nations through collusion and price \nfixing. By taking these necessary steps, we show how our spending and \nour Tax Code and our budget can reflect not only our priorities but how \nwe can actually meet them.\n\n  The time to ask is now. I ask my more conservative colleagues here to \njoin us. It is a pretty easy step to move toward a better fiscal \nsituation, a more coherent budget policy--that we eliminate these tax \nsubsidies that have gone to America's five largest oil companies, some \nof the most profitable companies, frankly, in the history of the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2987-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2987-S2988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to honor the service of our \nNation's law enforcement officers on the occasion of National Police \nWeek, which is taking place this year from May 15 through May 21.\n  Every day, in cities and towns across America, police officers put \ntheir lives on the line to protect their fellow citizens. As a State \nand Federal prosecutor, I was proud to work alongside so many fine law \nenforcement officers in Rhode Island. I saw their hard work, their \ndedication to protecting the public, their commitment to upholding the \nrule of law, and the sacrifices they made for their communities.\n  During National Police Week, we remember those officers who have \nfallen in the line of duty, and we honor their families. It is a \ntragedy for a single officer to be killed in the line of duty. Yet \naccording to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, there \nwere 162 law enforcement fatalities in America last year, a jump of \nnearly 40 percent from the year before. In 2011, the statistics are \neven more upsetting: as of May 12, there have already been 69 officer \nfatalities, a 17-percent increase from this time a year ago.\n  Here in the Nation's Capital, we are marking the service and loss of \nour country's fallen police officers through the events of National \nPolice Week. Yesterday more than 20,000 officers gathered in \nWashington, DC, to observe National Peace Officers Memorial Day. I was \nproud to join with Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, and other \nmembers of the Senate in cosponsoring a resolution recognizing that \nday, and commemorating the dedication of those officers killed or \ninjured in the line of duty.\n  I also wanted to highlight for my colleagues two recent events to \nhonor this occasion in my home State.\n  Earlier this month, Newport hosted the 28th annual Aquidneck Island \nNational Police Parade. Hundreds of officers from nearly every police \nagency in Rhode Island marched alongside more than 1,000 fellow police \nofficers from across the Northeast and Canada.\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\n  The marchers in Newport included Robert Shaw, the father of \nProvidence police Sergeant Steven Shaw, who was killed in the line of \nduty in 1994. Mr. Shaw has been an active leader of Concerns of Police \nSurvivors, COPS, an organization that has provided so much support to \nthe loved ones, families, and former comrades of fallen officers. I am \npleased to have joined with Senator Murkowski and other Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle in cosponsoring a resolution recognizing the \nwork of this organization and designating May 14, 2011, as National \nPolice Survivors Day.\n  Last week, another group of Rhode Island police officers embarked on \na longer march. Thirteen officers from Woonsocket marched for 4\\1/2\\ \ndays in the 11th annual COPSwalk to Washington, under the leadership of \nSergeant Ed Cunanan. Their dedication has raised thousands of dollars \nto provide financial support for the families of fallen police \nofficers.\n  Once again, I thank the officers across Rhode Island and our country \nwho protect our kids, secure our communities, and bring criminals to \njustice. They are public servants of the highest order who have given \nso much of themselves for the benefit of us all. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to make sure we do all we can to protect \ntheir safety as they fulfill their vital responsibilities.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nthousands of peace officers who tirelessly serve our country and our \ncommunities. Having just commemorated Peace Officers Memorial Day on \nMay 15, I want to specifically acknowledge the 162 officers killed in \n2010, including 5 from my home State of Missouri, who laid down their \nlives in service to others.\n  This past week in our Nation's Capital thousands of police officers, \ndeputy sheriffs, State troopers, investigators, and agents gathered in \nfellowship as brothers and sisters united by a bond of service and \nsacrifice. Every year, they gather to commemorate their fallen at the \nNational Law Enforcement Officer Memorial where the names of nearly \n19,000 officers who have been killed in the line of duty are etched. \nNationally, the average age of the officers killed in 2010 was 41; the \naverage length of their law enforcement service was nearly 12 years; \nand, on average, each officer left behind 2 children. While there is no \nway we can fully restore the families, the coworkers, and the \ncommunities of our fallen law enforcement professionals, we can offer \nsolace and tribute in the hope that they know we honor them and their \nsacrifice.\n  The profession of a being a peace officer in this country is unique \nin many ways and its challenges are many. We expect our officers, \ndeputies, troopers, agents, and investigators to uphold the law of the \nland without compromise and without blemish. We expect them to run \ntoward the sounds of gunfire, to transform chaos into order, to provide \ncomfort to the afflicted and injured, to protect the vulnerable, and to \nfacilitate justice for the victimized. We ask them to do this at every \nhour of the day, every day of the year, in every climate and place \nwhere the American flag flies. The most amazing thing is that our peace \nofficers exceed every one of these expectations, and for this we remain \neternally grateful.\n  Much like our military, peace officers are ordinary men and women who \nchoose to answer a call to become extraordinary heroes. They are our \nmoms, our dads, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors, and our \nfriends. Our peace officers understand duty before self. They \nunderstand what it means to miss holiday meals with their loved ones. \nThey understand that long hours of calm may turn into moments of \nintense violence. They understand they are sentinels, standing in the \ngap between our loved ones and those who would do them harm.\n  In closing, I offer my humblest and sincerest gratitude to the \nfamilies and loved ones of our wonderful peace officers. They, too \nunderstand sacrifice and commitment, and without their enduring \nsupport, the men and women behind the badge would not be able to \naccomplish all they do. To those who wear the badge and answer the call \nto serve, I humbly say thank you, and I ask my fellow Senators to join \nme in acknowledging them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2988-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2988-S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING OUTDOOR GEAR EXCHANGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I wish to bring the attention of the \nSenate to a small business in Vermont, the Outdoor Gear Exchange, which \nis moving to a new location near and dear to my heart--the Church \nStreet Marketplace in Burlington.\n  A large, national retailer recently chose to depart the Marketplace. \nThis left a big hole on one of our nation's most successful pedestrian \nmalls. The local owners of the Outdoor Gear Exchange, Marc Sherman and \nMike Donahue, quickly took the opportunity to move their successful \nventure from a nearby side street onto Church Street.\n  As a longtime supporter of the Church Street Marketplace, I was \npleased to see this locally owned and much-beloved fixture in the \nVermont business scene fill one of the most high-profile store fronts \non Church Street.\n  I hope Americans interested in good news during this difficult \neconomy might take a moment to read about this great business, and I \nask unanimous consent to have the May 16, 2011, Burlington Free Press \narticle written by Dan D'Ambrosio entitled ``Outdoor Gear Exchange \ntakes its store, and philosophy, into a bigger space'' printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 16, 2011]\n\n Outdoor Gear Exchange Takes Its Store, and Philosophy, Into a Bigger \n                                 Space\n\n       At the beginning of last week, Marc Sherman, co-owner of \n     Outdoor Gear Exchange, sat in the empty, cavernous space on \n     Church Street where he was moving his business--in the spot \n     Old Navy used to occupy--and contemplated the grand opening \n     of his new store approaching on Thursday.\n       Sitting surrounded by partially finished displays and \n     unopened boxes of merchandise scattered about on the concrete \n     floor, it was hard to believe. But Sherman and his crew of 65 \n     full-time employees were determined to be ready for this \n     week's ribbon cutting and remarks by Gov. Peter Shumlin. \n     Sherman said the creation of his new store--at 15,000 square \n     feet of retail space, twice the size of the old store on \n     Cherry Street--cost more than $100,000.\n       ``All of my staff is running around putting this \n     together,'' Sherman said last week. ``Unlike most stores, \n     we're not moving into a store, we're building our own. That \n     increases everyone's commitment.''\n       Sherman said he thinks of his staff as family, and said the \n     rush to get the new store open has been exhilarating. He's \n     proud to be, he says, the first local store in that prime \n     space on Church Street in a very long time.\n       ``I have the world's greatest staff,'' Sherman said. \n     ``Everyone is fun and enthusiastic. They're funny and smart. \n     I love hanging out with them. They're all really active. To \n     me that is the most important thing about what I do. I like \n     the people I work with.''\n       Sherman grew up in Englewood, N.J., moving to New York City \n     after graduating from college to take a job crunching numbers \n     for the marketing department of a manufacturing company, a \n     job he remembers as ``not particularly exciting.''\n       On winter weekends, he would drive to Vermont to ski at \n     Ludlow.\n       ``I realized every weekend I wanted to go home to New York \n     less and less,'' Sherman said. ``I never had a bad experience \n     in Vermont. I said, Why not stay here and visit New York?' \n     That was 19 years ago.''\n       Sherman began his business with a friend in 1995 in an 800-\n     square-foot space on Main Street, where Tonic is now. Their \n     business plan was based on the fact that Sherman had more \n     outdoor equipment than he knew what to do with, and his \n     friend didn't have any.\n       ``We wanted to connect people who have too much with people \n     who have too little and make it affordable for them to get \n     outside because, I'll be the first to say, the gear is \n     expensive; the clothing is expensive,'' Sherman said.\n       Sherman quickly moved beyond consignments, settling on a \n     three-tier model. Consignment items still make up about 8 \n     percent of his business, all of it walk-in, but the bulk is \n     in new clothing and gear plus seconds, close-outs and \n     cosmetic blemishes. There are very few outdoors stores using \n     this particular mix of product offerings, Sherman said.\n       ``It's a model that's proven to work even if it doesn't \n     always make sense,'' Sherman said. ``Somebody is looking at a \n     full-price backpack for $450 next to somebody looking at a \n     close-out backpack for $250, next to somebody looking at a \n     used backpack for $150, and we sell to all of them. Some \n     people want to spend more for what's out this year. Some \n     people want to save a little. We have something for \n     everybody.''\n       Sherman also went his own way when it came to deciding what \n     to stock.\n       ``We felt if we opened a store that would focus on what \n     consumers are looking for opposed to what manufacturers are \n     generating,\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\n     we'd be successful,'' Sherman said. ``We always tried to find \n     gear our friends would buy, or that we would want to buy.''\n       Outdoor Gear Exchange also does an online business account \n     for 25 percent of its sales and growing, nearly doubling this \n     year. Sherman was able to consolidate his online staff from \n     where they were, in a space above The Body Shop on Church \n     Street, to offices in his new space. Although he doesn't \n     release sales figures, Sherman did say his annual payroll \n     approaches $1 million.\n       With all the extra space to work with in the new location, \n     Sherman and co-owner Mike Donohue are getting into gear for \n     family camping, also known as car camping, which will put \n     them in competition with Dick's Sporting Goods in Williston. \n     Traditionally, Outdoor Gear Exchange has focused on \n     backpackers, climbers and hikers, ``folks going out into the \n     wilderness,'' Sherman said, and who place a high value on \n     light-weight gear.\n       But Sherman said family camping is a growing segment of the \n     market, especially for people his age--45 years old. It's not \n     inexpensive to get into, but once you're set up, it is a \n     relatively cheap vacation. The priorities for the gear are \n     different than those for hikers and climbers.\n       ``Car camping is a little more focused on amenities and \n     space, as opposed to weight,'' Sherman said. ``We'll offer \n     tents with more features oriented toward cushy living, \n     thicker sleeping pads, things like that.''\n       Sherman also plans to expand his offering of casual outdoor \n     clothing to include lower price ranges than he has \n     historically stocked, in memory of the recently departed Old \n     Navy.\n       ``We're sensitive to the fact that Old Navy provided a \n     service to folks who couldn't afford more expensive \n     clothing,'' Sherman said. ``Whether it was high quality or \n     not, the bottom line is it was highly affordable. We want to \n     make sure that doesn't become a void in the downtown, so \n     we'll look for outdoor casual that's more affordable than \n     what we currently sell.''\n       Eventually, Sherman plans to add another 8,000 square feet \n     of retail space in the basement of his new space, which he is \n     also leasing. Panera Bread, the national chain of bakery-\n     cafes, will also be on the main floor of the building as the \n     only other tenant, although there will be no physical \n     connection between the two businesses. Panera isn't expected \n     to open for another month or two.\n       ``I hope we get some bread smell, but that's about it,'' \n     Sherman said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2989-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL GIPSON\n\n Mr. BLUNT.

Mr. President, today I join with the citizens of \nNorth Carolina who have a long and proud history since the Nation's \nbirth of paying special honor and respect to its sons and daughters who \nprotect our country's freedoms. Americans from coast to coast enjoy \ntheir freedoms because of the service and sacrifices of our veterans. \nNorth Carolina is proud to be the home of Cherry Point Marine Corps Air \nStation, Charlotte Air National Guard, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, \nU.S. Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, Fort Bragg, Pope Army Air \nField, Marine Corps Air Station New River, and Seymour Johnson Air \nForce Base. We are proud to be a state that one of the largest \npopulations of veterans in the United States call home.\n  North Carolina has a rich military history dating back to before the \nRevolutionary War. In a 1771 rebellion against the royal governor, \nNorth Carolina farmers called ``Regulators'' employed tactics at \nAlamance Battleground that were later adopted as a model for fighting \nthe British. Troops from North Carolina played a significant role in \nmany Civil War battles, including the Battle of Gettysburg, where ``Tar \nHeels'' were prominent in Pickett's Charge. Many of the 86,000 North \nCarolinians who served in World War I were assigned to the 30th \nInfantry Division, which distinguished itself in the Somme Offensive by \nbreaking through the famed and supposedly impregnable ``Hindenburg \nLine,'' helping to hasten the end of the conflict. During World War II, \nthe U.S. Marine Corps trained their first class of African Americans at \nMontford Point Base, near Camp Lejeune, and members of the North \nCarolina National Guard landed on the Normandy beaches. During the war \nin Southeast Asia soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg \ndeployed to participate in the Tet Offensive and remained in theater \nfor 22 months. Airmen flying F-15E's from the 4th Fighter Wing out of \nSeymour Johnson Air Force Base were the first to lead nighttime strikes \nagainst Iraqi forces during Operation Desert Storm and helped bring the \nPersian Gulf war to a swift conclusion. Elements of the 2nd Marine \nDivision from Camp Lejeune crossed into Iraq on the first day of the \nground war in Operation Iraqi Freedom and later forged relationships \nwith the Sunni tribes in Iraq's restive Anbar Province. Elite Green \nBerets from Fort Bragg have been operating throughout Afghanistan, \nexpanding Village Stability Operations and seeking out terrorist \nleaders. And members of the Coast Guard's National Strike Force based \nin Elizabeth City responded to the devastating earthquakes in Haiti by \nconducting facility inspections around crippled Haitian ports to help \nresume the vital supply of aid to that poverty stricken nation.\n  This Fourth of July will hold special significance for North \nCarolina. On that day in Fayetteville, NC home to Fort Bragg, where the \nrenowned 82nd Airborne, Eighteenth Airborne Corps, U.S. Army's Special \nOperations Command, and Pope Army Airfield are located, there will be a \ndedication of the North Carolina Veterans Park. The purpose of the \nVeterans Park is to honor all North Carolina veterans and serve as a \ncenterpiece for a compilation of historic objects and images and \nlandscaped spaces that symbolize a Nation's unending gratitude, somber \nreflection, and ongoing education for generations to come. It will \ncommemorate the achievement, service, dedication, and sacrifice of our \nArmed Forces.\n  The park is adjacent to the Airborne and Special Operations Museum, \nwhich is a part of the U.S. Army Museum System, providing an \nexceptional educational experience and preserving the legacy of \nairborne and special operations forces from their early days in World \nWar Two to the present operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and across the \nglobe.\n  The city of Fayetteville has directed that the design and \nconstruction of the North Carolina Veterans Park meet or exceed all the \nguidelines and expectations provided by a large representative segment \nof the veteran population, including members of a content committee who \nserved in all five branches of the military services: Army, Navy, \nMarine Corps, Coast Guard, and Air Force.\n  The Park consists of seven water features and public art crafted by \nindividuals from across the State. The hands of 100 veterans were cast \nto honor and represent every county in North Carolina and are displayed \nin this park's Wall of Oath. Soil from each of the State's 100 counties \nwill be included in the construction of the columns in the park. The \nsculptures in the public plaza signify our veterans' commitment, \ncourage, dedication, heroism,\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\nsacrifices, service, and strength, and showcase the incredible talents \nof our State's artists.\n  Please join me and the citizens of the great State of North Carolina \nin expressing our pride and gratitude to the veterans for their \nservice, dedication, and sacrifice in protecting the freedoms of this \ncountry. And as we designate July 4, 2011, as ``North Carolina Veterans \nPark Day,'' please reflect on the words that tell the story of the \nNorth Carolina Veterans Park:\n\n     From the soils of North Carolina\n     You left your families and homes\n     With purpose to serve your country.\n     In service, you made sacrifices.\n\n     You are our veterans.\n\n     This is your place to reflect on and\n     Share your experiences.\n     To feel pride in your service,\n     Bond with fellow veterans, and heal.\n     Here, may you find support and inspiration\n     To live your lives today.\n\n     The people of North Carolina\n     Honor your service and welcome you home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2990-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR.

Dr. \nFong's enthusiasm and leadership have ensured the success of the annual \nDick Lugar Run, Walk, and Health Fair, which has been held on the \nButler campus for the last 32 years.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to prevent the \nenforcement of certain national primary drinking water regulations \nunless sufficient funding is available; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small System \nDrinking Water Act of 2011. This is the fourth Congress that I have \nintroduced this bill which would help water systems throughout the \ncountry comply with the ever growing number of federal drinking water \nstandards. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Thad Cochran, David \nVitter, John Boozman, James Risch, and Mike Crapo as cosponsors of this \nlegislation. My bill will require the Federal Government to live up to \nits obligations and require the EPA to use the tools it was given in \nthe 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act amendments, SDWA.\n  My goal here is to ensure that small towns across the country have \nsafe, affordable drinking water and that the\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nlaws are fair to small and rural communities. Currently EPA assumes \nthat families can afford water rates of 2.5 percent of their annual \nmedian household income, or $1,000 per household. For some families, \npaying $83 a month for water may not be a hardship but for so many \nmore, it is nearly impossible. There must be some flexibility inserted \ninto the calculation that factors in the ability of the truly \ndisadvantaged to pay these costs. Forcing systems to raise rates beyond \nwhat their ratepayers can afford only causes more damage than good.\n  EPA needs to look more closely at how it determines affordability. My \nbill directs EPA to take additional factors into consideration when \nmaking this determination. These include ensuring that the \naffordability criteria are not more costly on a per-capita basis to a \nsmall water system than to a large water system.\n  In EPA's most recent drinking water needs survey, Oklahoma identified \na total of over $4.1 billion in drinking water needs over the next 20 \nyears. $2.4 billion of that need is for community water systems that \nserve fewer than 10,000 people. The $4.1 billion does not include the \ntotal costs imposed on Oklahoma communities to meet federal clean water \nrequirements, the new Groundwater rule, the DBP II rule or the Long \nTerm 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. Oklahoma continues to \nhave municipalities struggling with the 2002 arsenic rule. Many of our \nsmall systems are having difficulty with the Disinfection Byproducts, \nDBP, Stage I rule, and small systems who purchase water from other \nsystems and did not have to test, treat or monitor their water must now \ncomply with DBP II. EPA estimates that over the next 20 years, the \nentire country will need $52.0 billion to come into compliance with \nexisting, proposed or recently promulgated regulations.\n  My bill proposes a few simple steps to help systems comply with all \nthese rules. First, it reauthorizes the technical assistance program in \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. The DBP rules are very complex and involve \na lot of monitoring and testing. If we are going to impose complicated \nrequirements on systems, we need to provide them with help to implement \nthose requirements.\n  The bill creates a pilot program to demonstrate new technologies and \napproaches for systems of all sizes to comply with these complicated \nrules. It requires the EPA to convene a working group to examine the \nscience behind the rules in order to compare new developments since \neach rule's publication.\n  Section 1412(b)(4)(E) of the SDWA Amendments of 1996 authorizes the \nuse of point of entry treatment, point of use treatment and package \nplants to economically meet the requirements of the act. However, to \ndate, these approaches are not widely used by small water systems. My \nlegislation directs the EPA to convene a working group to identify \nbarriers to the use of these approaches. The EPA will then use the \nrecommendations of the working group to draft a model guidance document \nthat states can use to create their own programs.\n  Most importantly this bill requires the Federal Government to pay for \nthese unfunded mandates created by laws and regulations. In 1995, \nCongress passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to ensure that the \nFederal Government pays the costs incurred by state and local \ngovernments in complying with Federal laws. My bill is designed to \nensure that EPA cannot take an enforcement action against a system \nserving less than 10,000 people, without first ensuring that it has \nsufficient funds to meet the requirements of the regulation.\n  Since the 108th Congress, I have co-authored and cosponsored \nlegislation to provide additional resources to communities through the \nState Revolving Loan Funds. Unfortunately, not much has changed. We \nstill have too many regulations and not enough money to pay for them. \nFunding legislation is important but until that money becomes \navailable, it is unreasonable to penalize and fine local communities \nbecause they cannot afford to pay for regulations we imposed on them. I \nthank my colleagues and look forward to their support of this \ncommonsense proposal. \n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1001. A bill to reduce oil consumption and improve energy \nsecurity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Sen. Stabenow and I are introducing \nlegislation designed to reduce our dependence on imported oil by \nreplacing it with cleaner, domestic sources of energy to power our \ncars, trucks, buses, tractors, and ships. The only way to reduce our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil is to reduce our dependence on oil. \nWhen it comes to reducing our use of oil, transportation is where the \nvast bulk of America's oil use is. Over 70 percent of all of the oil \nused in the U.S. is used for transportation. Unless we do something \nabout the amount of oil used by our transportation sector, we have no \nchance of making a significant dent in our dependence on oil. The goal \nof this bill is to replace a significant portion of that oil with home-\ngrown alternative fuels--electricity, natural gas, propane, biofuels, \nand hydrogen. We believe this will create jobs and economic growth here \nin the U.S. and reduce the relentless flow of dollars overseas to buy \noil.\n  Many of our colleagues share our concern and have been strong \nadvocates for individual vehicle technologies. Indeed, both Sen. \nStabenow and I voted last year in the Senate Energy Committee to \nsupport legislation by Sen. Dorgan, Sen. Merkley and Sen. Alexander to \npromote electric vehicles. With electric vehicles, fuel can come from \nmany sources, and very little of it from oil. With plug-in electric \ntechnology now hitting the streets, you can literally use power from a \nwind turbine to drive to the store. Sen. Menendez and Sen. Reid have \noffered bills to promote natural gas vehicles. Natural gas is a natural \nfuel for many vehicle applications and it now appears that there are \nsignificant new natural gas resources here in North America that could \nbe tapped to replace imported oil.\n  At the end of the day, however, different fuels are going to work \nbetter in different types of vehicles and in different parts of the \ncountry. For that reason, our bill does not pick technology winners and \nlosers. It is ``technology neutral,'' ``geography neutral'' and \n``market neutral.'' An alternative fuel that is readily available in \none part of the country may not be readily available in every part of \nthe country, or it may not work as well in an 18 wheel tractor-trailer \nas in the family car. Our bill does not chose which fuel is used where, \nor for what kind of vehicles. We leave that up to the free market so \nthat fuel providers and vehicle manufacturers can compete for what \nworks best for their customers.\n  While it is true that cars and pick-up trucks use about 63 percent of \nall transportation fuel, that still means that well over a third is \nused in other kinds of vehicles. Medium and heavy trucks and buses, for \nexample, use about 20 percent of all motor fuel. Our bill is aimed at \nmaking inroads on oil imports all up and down the road, in all kinds of \nvehicles, and even for off-road vehicles and engines that aren't on the \nroad at all.\n  Our bottom line goal is to help American businesses, which build \nvehicles and supply fuel, provide genuine alternatives to conventional \nfuels and engine technologies so that Americans can reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. The bill does this by providing a set of \ntools to promote the deployment of these technologies while keeping in \nmind the difficult budget situation the country faces. In several \ninstances, the bill modifies existing programs, rather than create new \nones, and it includes a source of funds to pay for the new programs it \ndoes create.\n  First, the bill takes the existing advanced vehicle manufacturing \nsupport program at the U.S. Department of Energy, which is now focused \non providing financial support to major manufacturers of light duty \nvehicles, and opens it up to alternative fuel technologies. It also \nexpands the program to component manufacturers further down the supply \nchain and to the production of medium and heavy trucks, buses, and \ntransit vehicles and lifts the cap on the amount of loans that can be \nmade to American manufacturers and their suppliers.\n  Alternative fuel vehicles need alternative fuel. So the next major \ninitiative in the bill is to provide financial\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\nsupport for the production and distribution of those alternative fuels. \nAgain, instead of creating a whole new program to support this \nalternative fuel infrastructure, the bill modifies the existing clean \nenergy Department of Energy loan guarantee program created section 1703 \nof the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This loan program was aimed at \nfinancing new, innovative low-carbon electricity generation \ntechnologies. That is all well and good, but those investments do not \naddress the very real energy security challenge facing our country from \noil imports, especially since so little electricity in the U.S. is \nactually generated using oil. Our bill would allow this already \nexisting program to be used for alternative fuel infrastructure.\n  The bill includes additional measures to provide technical assistance \nto States and local governments, public-private partnerships and \nutility companies and utility commissions to help overcome barriers to \nthe deployment of these alternative fuel vehicles. The bill provides \nworker training and technology research programs to make sure there is \na skilled workforce and new technologies. Taken altogether, these \nprovisions are designed to provide the tools for manufacturers, parts \nsuppliers, fuel providers, transportation planners, utility regulators, \nand State and local officials to deploy alternative fuel vehicles, and \nthe fuels to power them, in numbers that make a difference and truly \nreduce our dependence on imported oil.\n  Finally, the bill includes a funding offset by capping the size of \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, at 90 days of non-North American \ncrude oil and petroleum fuel imports. Under current law, the SPR is \nsupposed to grow to 1 billion barrels at a cost of over $5 billion for \nconstruction and, at current prices, over $30 billion to fill it with \noil. Buying more insurance doesn't make that old car any safer. While I \nsupport having a Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the plain truth of the \nmatter is that spending billions of additional dollars to put more oil \ninto the SPR will not reduce our dependence on oil imports by a single \nbarrel. This bill would take the money generated by reducing the size \nof the SPR and reinvest it in alternative energy technologies that \nwill, in fact, genuinely reduce that dependence. Rather than putting \nmore oil in the ground for short-term supply emergencies, we put \nAmerican innovation to work to reduce our Nation's oil dependence \npermanently.\n  I applaud my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, and our other \nSenate colleagues, for recognizing that new vehicle technologies now \nentering the market are not just scientific curiosities, but game-\nchanging opportunities to finally get our country off of its addiction \nto oil. I look forward to working with them to enact programs and \npolicies that ensure these alternative fuel technologies succeed in the \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to support Promise Neighborhoods; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in many of our Nation's poorest \ncommunities, children and families do not have access to the \neducational opportunities that enable youth to start school ready to \nlearn and graduate from secondary school ready to succeed in college \nand the workforce, achieve economic self-sufficiency, and support \nfamilies of their own someday.\n  As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \nit is my responsibility to lead the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, which affords an exciting opportunity to \nimprove the quality of elementary and secondary education for our \nchildren and youth. Our Nation's future economic strength and national \nsecurity require well-educated workers who are not only academically \nprepared, but also healthy, understand the importance of community and \ncivic participation, and possess the skills needed to successfully \ncompete in the 21st century global economy. To accomplish these goals, \nchildren and youth must have access to a great education and safe and \nsupportive community, beginning at birth.\n  However, in too many communities the consequences of poverty limit \nthe chances students have to obtain a solid academic foundation that \nleads to college and career success. That is why we need Promise \nNeighborhoods. Promise Neighborhood partnerships leverage community \nassets to significantly improve academic outcomes, including school \nreadiness, high school graduation and college entry and completion. \nPromise Neighborhood partners use data-driven decisionmaking to guide \ninvestments in a community-based continuum of high-quality services and \nevidence-based practices that address the needs of children, from birth \nthrough college and career entry. The reauthorization of ESEA provides \nus with an opportunity to build upon the successes of Promise \nNeighborhoods, of which there are more than 40 across the country, to \nensure that children and youth have access to good schools, integrated \nstudents supports and other wrap-around services needed to ensure \nacademic, as well as social and emotional, growth and development.\n  The lack of supports for families and children in distressed \nneighborhoods has a profound impact on student achievement and \ndevelopment. Children from poor families are less likely to have access \nto nutritious foods, high-quality early learning programs, adults who \nread to them every day, and basic health care. As a result, these \nchildren are more likely to experience sickness and developmental \ndelays, chronic hunger and homelessness, and abuse and neglect--all of \nwhich contribute to slow brain development and low academic \nachievement. Children from low-income families enter kindergarten \napproximately three months behind the national average in reading and \nenter first grade with 900 hours less of one-on-one book-reading time \nthan do their middle-class peers.\n  The number of poor children facing these challenges and experiencing \nthese devastating results is growing at an alarming rate. According to \nthe National Center for Children and Poverty, the number of poor \nchildren under age 6 increased by 24 percent between 2000 and 2007. The \ncenter also found that in my home State of Iowa, 20 percent of children \nunder age 6 live in poor families. Between 2007 and 2009, the number of \nchildren living in poverty nationwide grew by 2.2 million, to 15.5 \nmillion. This means that more of our Nation's children are starting \nschool ill-equipped to thrive and gain the skills needed for success in \nthe 21st century. The best way to combat this trend is to ensure that \nall children, especially those in low-income and under-resourced \ncommunities, have access to high-quality early learning programs, \neffective schools, and family and student supports that prepare them \nfor success.\n  One low-income neighborhood where children and their families receive \nthese essential programs and supports is in Harlem, through an \norganization called Harlem Children's Zone. Geoffrey Canada began \nHarlem Children's Zone as a single-block pilot in the 1990s, which has \nsince expanded to 96 blocks. Today Harlem Children's Zone operates two \ncharter schools and leverages a wide range of public, nonprofit, and \nphilanthropic resources to provide wrap-around services to over 10,000 \nyouth and about the same number of adults each year. Harlem Children's \nZone's programs have equipped children with the skills needed to be \nsuccessful in elementary school and have provided families with the \ntools needed to effectively support their children's development and \nacademic achievement. The New York Times has called it ``one of the \nmost ambitious social-service experiments of our time''.\n  The bill I am introducing today builds on this outstanding framework. \nThis Promise Neighborhoods proposal would fund competitive grants to \nimplement cradle-to-career ``continuums of care'' similar to Harlem \nChildren's Zone for children in distressed neighborhoods. Promise \nNeighborhoods encourages communities and schools to leverage \npartnerships that provide children with access to evidence-based \neducation reforms, community services, and family supports that improve \nacademic, developmental, career, and life outcomes.\n  This bill focuses on ensuring the provision of high-quality early \nlearning programs, effective family and community engagement \nstrategies, and better services for special populations, such as \nchildren with disabilities and English learners.\n  It also allows for grants that are led by community-based \norganizations working in partnership with school districts, or led by \nschools in partnership with community-based organizations or \ninstitutions of higher education. Partners must collaborate to develop \nand implement a high-quality, evidence-based pipeline of services.

It requires \norganizations, agencies, and caring adults to work together to \nrevitalize a single neighborhood, focusing on access to the educational \nand other supports children need to be successful in school and in \nlife. It also supports communities in working together to combat the \ndevastating effects poverty has on children's development and academic \nachievement.\n  One day I would hope that all children grow up in a neighborhood that \nprovides support for their success from birth. This bill will help us \ntake an important step towards this vision.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Risch, Mr. Coats, \n        Mr. Thune, and Mr. Johanns):\n  S. 1005. A bill to provide for parental notification and intervention \nin the case of a minor seeking an abortion; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, polls show nearly 80 percent of Americans \nagree parents should have the legal right to stop an abortion from \nbeing performed on their minor daughter. Many States such as Arkansas \nhave enacted laws requiring parental notification, and these laws have \nproven very effective at the state level. Texas' teen abortion rate has \ndropped 25 percent since passage of its parental notification law in \n2000 and Virginia and South Dakota have had similar results since \nparental notification laws were passed more than 10 years ago. However \nwithout a Federal law parents in those States are not required to be \nnotified when their daughters go out-of-state for an abortion. Also, \njudges exploit loopholes in state laws by granting ``judicial bypass'' \nso often times the law is not enforced. The Parental Notification and \nIntervention Act requires that parents be notified at least four days \nin advance of any abortion to be performed on their minor daughter and \ngives them power to stop an abortion from being performed. My \ncolleagues Senators Graham, Risch, Coats, Thune, and Johanns join me in \nintroducing this important legislation. I would also like to thank \nRepresentative Steve King for his support and leadership on the House \ncompanion version of the Parental Notification and Intervention Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1005\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Parental Notification and \n     Intervention Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PARENTAL NOTIFICATION.\n\n       (a) It shall be unlawful for any person or organization to \n     perform any abortion on an unemancipated minor under the age \n     of 18, to permit the facilities of the entity to be used to \n     perform any abortion on such a minor, or to assist in the \n     performance of any abortion on such a minor, if the person or \n     organization has failed to comply with the following \n     requirements:\n       (1) Unless there is clear and convincing evidence of \n     physical abuse of the minor by a parent, written notification \n     has been provided to each parent of the minor, informing each \n     parent that an abortion has been requested for the minor.\n       (2) There is compliance with a 96-hour waiting period after \n     notice has been received by, subject to paragraph (1), each \n     parent of the minor before the abortion may be performed.\n       (3) In the case of an action brought by a parent of such \n     minor pursuant to section 3, with respect to the performance \n     of such abortion, the person or organization shall not \n     perform such abortion unless and until there is a final \n     judgement pursuant to such section that granting permanent \n     relief to enjoin the abortion would be unlawful.\n       (b) Whoever violates the provisions of subsection (a) of \n     this section shall be fined not more than $1,000,000, or \n     imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\n       (c) The provisions of this section shall not apply if, with \n     respect to an unemancipated minor for whom an abortion is \n     sought, a defense or affirmative defense exists which would \n     be applicable to other provisions of title 18, United States \n     Code. For purposes of the previous sentence, such a defense \n     or affirmative defense shall not apply unless a physician \n     other than the physician with principal responsibility for \n     making the decision to perform the abortion makes a \n     determination that--\n       (1) a medical emergency exists in which an abortion on the \n     minor is necessary due to a grave, physical disorder or \n     disease of the minor that would, with reasonable medical \n     certainty, cause the death of the minor if an abortion is not \n     performed;\n       (2) parental notification is not possible as a result of \n     the medical emergency; and\n       (3) certifications regarding compliance with paragraphs (1) \n     and (2) of this subsection have been entered in the medical \n     records of the minor, together with the reasons upon which \n     the determinations are based, including a statement of \n     relevant clinical findings.\n       (d) For purposes of this section, any parental notification \n     provided to comply with the provisions of subsection (a) \n     shall be provided through the manner described in paragraph \n     (1), or through the manner described in paragraph (2), as \n     follows:\n       (1) The notification shall be provided through certified \n     mail in accordance with the following procedures:\n       (A) The notification shall be addressed to the parent of \n     the unemancipated minor.\n       (B) The address used shall be the dwelling or usual place \n     of abode of the parent.\n       (C) Return receipt shall be requested.\n       (D) Delivery shall be restricted to the parent.\n       (2) The notification shall be delivered personally to the \n     parent.\n       (e) For purposes of this section, the term ``parent'' \n     includes, but is not limited to, any legal guardian of the \n     child.\n\n     SEC. 3. PARENTAL INTERVENTION.\n\n       Any parent of a minor required to be notified pursuant to \n     section 2 may bring, in the district court of the United \n     States where the parent resides or where the unemancipated \n     minor is located, an action to bar the performance of an \n     abortion on such minor. The court shall issue an injunction \n     barring the performance of the abortion until the issue has \n     been adjudicated and the judgment is final. The court shall \n     issue relief permanently enjoining the abortion unless the \n     court determines that granting such relief would be unlawful.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE AND SEVERABILITY.\n\n       (a) The provisions of this Act shall be severable. If any \n     provision of this Act, or any application thereof, is found \n     unconstitutional, that finding shall not affect any provision \n     or application of the Act not so adjudicated.\n       (b) The provisions of this Act shall take effect \n     immediately upon enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2998-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2998-S2999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 185--REAFFIRMING THE COMMITMENT OF THE UNITED STATES \nTO A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT OF THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT THROUGH \nDIRECT ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATIONS, REAFFIRMING OPPOSITION TO THE \nINCLUSION OF HAMAS IN A UNITY GOVERNMENT UNLESS IT IS WILLING TO ACCEPT \nPEACE WITH ISRAEL AND RENOUNCE VIOLENCE, AND DECLARING THAT PALESTINIAN \n  EFFORTS TO GAIN RECOGNITION OF A STATE OUTSIDE DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS \nDEMONSTRATES ABSENCE OF A GOOD FAITH COMMITMENT TO PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, \n       AND WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR CONTINUED UNITED STATES AID\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Thune, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \nCasey, and Mr. Risch) submitted the following resolution: which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 185\n\n       Whereas the policy of the United States since 2002 has been \n     to support a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli \n     conflict;\n       Whereas a true and lasting peace between the people of \n     Israel and the Palestinians can only be achieved through \n     direct negotiations between the parties;\n       Whereas Palestine Liberation Organization Chair Yassir \n     Arafat wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on \n     September 9, 1993, that ``all outstanding issues relating to \n     permanent status will be resolved through negotiations'';\n       Whereas the reconciliation agreement signed by Fatah and \n     Hamas on May 4, 2011, was reached without Hamas being \n     required to renounce violence, accept Israel's right to \n     exist, and accept prior agreements made by the Palestinians \n     (the ``Quartet conditions'');\n       Whereas Hamas, an organization responsible for the death of \n     more than 500 innocent civilians, including two dozen United \n     States citizens, has been designated by the United States \n     Government as a foreign terrorist organization and a \n     specially designated terrorist organization;\n       Whereas Hamas kidnapped and has held captive Israeli \n     sergeant Gilad Shalit in violation of international norms \n     since June 25, 2006;\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n       Whereas Hamas continues to forcefully reject the \n     possibility of negotiations or peace with Israel;\n       Whereas, by contrast, Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin \n     Netanyahu has accepted a two-state solution to the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict;\n       Whereas, on April 22, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton stated, ``We will not deal with nor in any way fund a \n     Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless and until \n     Hamas has renounced violence, recognized Israel and agreed to \n     follow the previous obligations of the Palestinian \n     Authority.'';\n       Whereas the United States, under two different Presidents, \n     has vetoed 11 United Nations Security Council resolutions in \n     the last 15 years related to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict \n     and its outstanding issues;\n       Whereas United States Permanent Representative to the \n     United Nations Susan Rice stated on February 18, 2011, that \n     it was ``unwise'' for the United Nations to attempt to \n     resolve key issues between the Israelis and Palestinians;\n       Whereas Palestinian leaders are pursuing a coordinated \n     strategy to seek recognition of a Palestinian state within \n     the United Nations, in other international forums, and from \n     foreign governments;\n       Whereas, on March 11, 1999, the Senate adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 5 (106th Congress), and on March 16, \n     1999, the House of Representatives adopted House Concurrent \n     Resolution 24 (106th Congress), both of which resolved that \n     ``any attempt to establish Palestinian statehood outside the \n     negotiating process will invoke the strongest congressional \n     opposition'';\n       Whereas current United States law precludes assistance to a \n     Palestinian Authority that shares power with Hamas unless \n     that Authority publicly accepts the right of Israel to exist \n     and adheres to all prior agreements and understandings with \n     the Governments of the United States and Israel;\n       Whereas the United States Government provides more than \n     $550,000,000 annually and more than $3,500,000,000 \n     cumulatively in direct bilateral assistance to the \n     Palestinians, who are among the world's largest recipients of \n     foreign aid per capita;\n       Whereas aid to the Palestinians is predicated on a good \n     faith commitment from the Palestinians to the peace process;\n       Whereas abandonment by Palestinian leaders of the Quartet \n     conditions and inclusion of Hamas in a government could \n     jeopardize the positive steps the Palestinian Authority has \n     taken in building institutions and improving security in the \n     West Bank in recent years; and\n       Whereas efforts to form a unity government without \n     accepting the Quartet conditions, to bypass negotiations and \n     unilaterally declare a Palestinian state, or to appeal to the \n     United Nations or other international forums or to foreign \n     governments for recognition of a Palestinian state would \n     violate the underlying principles of the Oslo Accords, the \n     Road Map, and other relevant Middle East peace process \n     efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its strong support for a negotiated solution \n     to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states, \n     a democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a viable, democratic \n     Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace, security, \n     and mutual recognition;\n       (2) states its firm belief that any Palestinian unity \n     government must publicly and formally forswear terrorism, \n     accept Israel's right to exist, and reaffirm previous \n     agreements made with the Government of Israel;\n       (3) reiterates its strong opposition to any attempt to \n     establish or seek recognition of a Palestinian state outside \n     of an agreement negotiated between leaders in Israel and the \n     Palestinians;\n       (4) urges Palestinian leaders--\n       (A) to ensure that any Palestinian government will seek \n     peace with Israel;\n       (B) to cease all efforts at circumventing the negotiation \n     process, including through a unilateral declaration of \n     statehood or quests for recognition of a Palestinian state \n     from other nations or the United Nations;\n       (C) to resume direct negotiations with the Government of \n     Israel immediately and without preconditions; and\n       (D) to take appropriate measures to counter incitement to \n     violence and fulfill all prior Palestinian commitments, \n     including dismantling the terrorist infrastructure embodied \n     in Hamas;\n       (5) supports the opposition of the President to a \n     unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state and the veto by \n     the United States on February 18, 2011, of the most recent \n     United Nations Security Council resolution regarding a key \n     issue of the Israeli-Palestinian process;\n       (6) calls upon the President to announce that the United \n     States will veto any resolution on Palestinian statehood that \n     comes before the United Nations Security Council which is not \n     a result of agreements reached between the Government of \n     Israel and the Palestinians;\n       (7) calls upon the President to lead a diplomatic effort to \n     oppose a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state and to \n     oppose recognition of a Palestinian state by other nations, \n     within the United Nations, and in other international forums \n     prior to achievement of a final agreement between the \n     Government of Israel and the Palestinians;\n       (8) will consider restrictions on aid to the Palestinian \n     Authority should it persist in efforts to circumvent direct \n     negotiations by turning to the United Nations or other \n     international bodies;\n       (9) supports the position taken by Secretary of State \n     Hillary Clinton on April 22, 2009, that the United States \n     ``will not deal with or in any way fund a Palestinian \n     government that includes Hamas unless and until Hamas has \n     renounced violence, recognized Israel and agreed to follow \n     the previous obligations of the Palestinian Authority'';\n       (10) urges the President to consider suspending assistance \n     to the Palestinian Authority pending a review of the unity \n     agreement between Fatah and Hamas; and\n       (11) reaffirms the requirement under United States law \n     precluding assistance to a Palestinian Authority that shares \n     power with Hamas unless that Authority and all its ministers \n     publicly accept the right of Israel to exist and all prior \n     agreements and understandings with the Governments of the \n     United States and Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S2999-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak to S. 940. Tomorrow \nevening, we are going to have a vote on whether to proceed to debate \nthis bill, which closes oil and gas tax loopholes, thereby raising a \nsignificant amount of additional revenue for important projects in the \nUnited States of America.\n  I rise in favor of this motion tomorrow because if we have a \nsuccessful vote tomorrow evening, we will finally get to debate this \nissue of whether we should continue to have massive tax giveaways to \nthe most profitable companies in America.\n  Gas is at $4 a gallon. Every American is going to the pump, and they \nare finding that, once again, the total toll as they fill up their 15-\ngallon tank in their car is well over $50 and can hit $60. That is a \nhuge chunk out of my family budget, once or twice a week. It diminishes \nwhat is available to be spent for other core expenses to the families. \nIndeed, that $4 a gallon at the gas pump is raiding Americans' \npocketbooks.\n  Americans do not also need to be subsidizing the same highly \nprofitable oil companies through their paychecks, through tax \nloopholes. Make no question, the companies are highly profitable. Oil \nis now $100 a barrel. So the companies are able to sell oil that costs \nno more to produce today than it did 1 month ago, no more to produce \ntoday than it did 3 months ago, when oil was much lower, no more \nexpensive to produce today than 1 year ago, when it was $3 a gallon.\n  So oil companies are experiencing enormous profits. The final \nquarterly filings by ConocoPhillips, $3 billion in profits--this is \njust quarterly, over 3 months--BP, $7.1 billion in profits; Exxon, \n$10.7 billion in profits.\n  That $10.7 billion equates to $5 million an hour every hour, day and \nnight, throughout the week, throughout the weekend, through the entire \nquarter--$5 million per hour.\n  I think, if you have an ounce of common sense, then you will \nrecognize if you are making $5 million per hour, you do not need \ntaxpayer subsidies to stay afloat.\n  These subsidies come in many forms.\n  The first is the domestic manufacturing deduction for oil and gas. \nThis allows you to deduct a specified percentage--6 percent--of your \nqualified domestic production income. So it is not just that you get to \ndeduct expenses, you also get to deduct income as if it was a business \nexpense.\n  Wouldn't all of us, when we are filing our taxes, like to deduct our \nincome as an expense and, thereby, drastically cut our tax bill? Well, \nit is a sweet deal for big oil.\n  Then they have the ability to expense intangible drilling costs. The \nbasic notion is that when you have equipment that is necessary for the \nsuccess of a company, then you depreciate that equipment over the life \nof the equipment. If it is equipment that lasts 5 years, you expense it \nover 5 years. These are things, for the oil industry, such as derricks \nand tanks and pipelines and other physical structures. But this allows \nthe companies to take that deduction of the entire expense immediately, \nnot expense it over the life of the capital equipment like everyone \nelse. So it is another sweet deal.\n  The third is a special deduction called the tertiary injection cost \ndeduction. It comes in the form of a tax credit. A tax credit is much \nmore valuable than a tax deduction because it is a dollar-for-dollar \ndeduction in the taxes you owe. This is for employing enhanced oil \nrecovery methods--methods that are to the benefit of an oil company \nbecause they get a lot more oil out of an oilfield if they employ wise \nstewardship of that field. So they have an incentive to do this anyway, \nbut we are giving this huge bonus credit. That is a sweet deal. That is \nsweet deal No. 3.\n  Then you have the dual capacity taxpayer credit. This one you almost \ncannot believe is real because dollar-for-dollar, we, the taxpayers in \nAmerica, reimburse the oil companies for the taxes they pay overseas. \nWell, quite frankly, it is America subsidizing the foreign taxes. So \noil companies just pass through. It certainly is an incentive for the \nforeign governments to tax the oil companies extremely heavily because \nthey get it all back from America. It is also proven incentive for \ncompanies to call royalties a foreign income tax so they get reimbursed \nfor their royalties as well.\n  As proposed, changing this will reduce the deficit by $429 million in \nfiscal year 2012 and $6.5 billion in fiscal year 2021. That is the \nfourth sweet deal.\n  The fifth is the percentage depletion deduction. Firms that extract \noil or gas are permitted to deduct 15 percent of the sales to recover \ntheir capital investment in oil and gas reserves. They get to, again, \ndeduct their sales, essentially in a situation as if they are an \nexpense. That is sweet deal No. 5. In that case, often the value of \nthat deduction exceeds the value of the original capital investment by \nthe company. They get more than compensated.\n  Then, No. 6: royalty relief for deepwater Outer Continental Shelf \nproduction. The Department of the Interior must allow companies doing \ncertain types of drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf--deepwater \ndrilling and deep wells in shallow water--it allows them to not pay \nroyalties on a certain minimum volume of production. Royalty relief is \na great benefit to the oil companies and comes at great cost to the \nAmerican Treasury. That is sweet deal No. 6.\n  This world in which companies have had, over the years, inserted \nvarious provisions--making a very strong case for each one at the time \nof why this was necessary, that was necessary--amounts to an enormous \ntax bill. This bill that takes and modifies these provisions for the \ntop five companies that have the largest profits would produce about $2 \nbillion in savings from closing these six tax loopholes.\n  The question we all need to ask ourselves is: Can that $2 billion per \nyear be put to better work than subsidizing companies that are making \nenormous profits at the pump? One possibility is that $2 billion could \ngo toward decreasing our deficit. A lot of folks on the floor of the \nSenate talk about how important that is. Which is more important, \ngiveaways to the most profitable\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\ncompanies or reductions in the national deficit?\n  How about creating jobs? We have constantly been trying to get a bill \nto this floor that provides low-cost loans for energy saving \nrenovations. It is considered the most powerful job creator dollar-for-\ndollar of any idea that has been put forward. It is in the form of HOME \nStar, which provides low-cost energy saving loans to families, and they \ncan pay them back from the savings in energy. So it is a win-win for \nthe family, and it puts people to work in America in a construction \nindustry that is 50 percent unemployed.\n  How about Building Star? It does the same thing on commercial \nbuildings. How about Rural Star Energy, the bill that provides these \nlow-cost loans through rural co-ops, so rural America can benefit from \nenergy savings and can pay back these low-cost loans from the savings \non their monthly utility bills.\n  The reason this creates so many jobs is because not only can you not \noutsource overseas the jobs themselves for the construction work that \nis done, but almost every single thing that is used in the energy \nsaving economy--from the insulation, to the caulk, to the double-paned \nwindows--is made here in America. That is why you get so much \ntremendous leverage. You put the American construction industry to work \nand you utilize American products.\n  Maybe it is more important to create jobs than it is to give away $2 \nbillion a year to the most profitable five oil companies in America. \nMaybe it is important to shore up Medicare. Some of my colleagues have \ntalked about they want to dismantle Medicare. They want to turn it into \na voucher program, where the voucher would not increase as medical \ncosts increase, so that slowly Medicare would be wiped out as the \nability to provide health care for our seniors. Maybe it is more \nimportant to provide a strong Medicare Program than it is to give away \n$2 billion a year to the most profitable five oil companies in America.\n  Maybe it is more important to enable our children to get loans to go \nto college. We are becoming the first generation of adults whose \nchildren are getting less education than we have because the cost of \ntuition has gone up disproportionately to the income of a working \nfamily. The more tuition goes up, in comparison, the more our students \nhave to wrestle with whether they can afford to go to college and, if \nthey go, whether they need to drop out after the first year in order to \ngo back to work in order to save to go the second year. When students \nleave college in that situation, they do not often get back.\n  Maybe it is more important that we proceed to help American \nstudents--our children--go to college than to give away $2 billion to \nthe five most profitable oil companies in America.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to have a vote. The vote is simply whether \nthis is important enough to debate, whether it is important enough for \nus to come together as a Chamber and say it matters whether tax \nloopholes were carved out through special interest lobbying over the \npast 20 years in order to get very sweet deals when they serve no basic \ncore purpose in the American economy. We need to have that debate. I \nwish to encourage my colleagues across the aisle to vote yes tomorrow, \nto vote yes on a motion to proceed, so we can get to the bill and have \nthat debate.\n  Under the rules that have been established, we need 60 votes; \notherwise, my colleagues across the aisle threaten to filibuster, that \nthey are going to do a silent filibuster, blocking the ability of this \nChamber to have a debate. Let me tell you, this needs to be debated.\n  Fiscal responsibility needs to be debated. These tax giveaways need \nto be debated. The tradeoffs between assisting our students and tax \ngiveaways need to be debated. The tradeoff between reducing the deficit \nand these giveaways needs to be debated. The contrast and comparison \nbetween shoring up programs that provide health care to our seniors and \nthese giveaways need to be debated.\n  I encourage my colleagues: Do not shy from your responsibility to \nwrestle with difficult challenges. Come and vote yes tomorrow evening \non proceeding to debating the giveaways to the five most profitable oil \ncompanies in America so we can consider whether those funds will be \nbetter serving American citizens by reducing the deficit or by \nproviding core programs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/16/senate-section/article/S3002-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 904, S. 953\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.
