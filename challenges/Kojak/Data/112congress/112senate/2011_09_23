Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur with an amendment \noccur at 5:30 p.m., Monday, September 26.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object and with the indulgence \nof my friend the majority leader, let me make some brief remarks about \nwhere we are.\n  For anyone who is confused about what is going on in Congress right \nnow, let me make it easy. In order to keep the government running \nbeyond next week, Congress needs to pass a short-term bill that funds \ngovernment operations at a spending level to which both parties can \nagree. The good news is, we have already agreed on a spending level. \nThat has already been done. Last night, the House of Representatives \npassed a bill that meets that figure we agreed on a couple of months \nago.\n  Here is the holdup. Because of some of the horrible weather we have \nhad over the past several weeks, we have all agreed to add emergency \nfunds we\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\ndidn't originally plan in this bill, and Republicans have identified a \ncouple of cuts to make sure we don't make the deficit any bigger than \nit is already, including an offset Leader Pelosi has used in the past. \nThe rest is from a cut to a loan guarantee program that gave us the \nSolyndra scandal. I think we can all agree this program should be put \non hold until we get more answers, but our friends on the other side \ndon't like the idea. They would rather just add these funds to the \ndeficit. Why? Because, they say, that is the way we have always done \nthings around here. Well, I think there is a lesson we can draw from \nthe debates we have been having here over the last 6 months; that is, \nthe American people won't accept that excuse any longer. The whole \n``that is the way we have always done it'' argument is the reason we \nhave a $14 trillion debt right now.\n  If we pass this bill, FEMA will have the funds they need--have the \nfunds they need--to respond to these emergencies. That is not the \nissue. What is at issue is whether we are going to add to the debt.\n  We have a path forward to get disaster funding done right here, \ntoday. There is absolutely no reason, in my judgment, to delay funding \nfor disasters until Monday, as my friend the majority leader is now \nasking us to do. I don't think we ought to delay at all. We just \nreceived the amendment a few minutes ago, but we are aware of what it \ndoes, and I think it is important for us to try to resolve this issue \nsooner rather than later.\n  Let's just walk through the next few days. If we don't have this vote \nuntil Monday, that leaves 24 hours or so before the Jewish holidays \nbegin and then several days before the end of the fiscal year. It \nstrikes me that we would be better off going ahead and having this vote \nnow and entering into the discussions that will probably now be delayed \nuntil sometime Monday night to see how we can resolve this impasse \nbetween the House and Senate.\n  We would be happy to have the cloture vote on the proposal of my \nfriend the majority leader right now rather than Monday night so we can \nget a clear sense of where we stand. It is my view that we ought to \nhave the vote today rather than wait until Monday and basically \nsquander the next few days toward getting an agreement we know we have \nto reach. Therefore, Mr. President--and I thank my friend the majority \nleader for letting me explain my position--I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. First of all, my friend, I am sure, understands that this \ngreat piece of legislation that was sent to us by the House received 36 \nvotes over here. It was tabled on a bipartisan basis.\n  The matter that is now before the Senate is really a nice piece of \nlegislation. It funds the government until November 18. That is what \nthe House wanted. There also is money in this bill to take care of \nFEMA. And even though we passed a bill here with bipartisan support \nthat had $6.9 billion, which we believed was an appropriate figure, in \nan effort to compromise on this CR, we have the number the House thinks \nis a better number. That is what is before us.\n  So, Mr. President, my suggestion to my friend--and he is my friend--\nis that the two Democratic leaders, Reid and Pelosi, and the two \nRepublican leaders, McConnell and Boehner, should just cool off a \nlittle bit and then work through this. There is a compromise here, and \nthe compromise is now before the Senate. Everyone, once in a while, \nneeds a little cooling-off period.\n  The government is not shutting down. I spoke to Mr. Fugate myself, \nand FEMA is not out of money. We will come here Monday, and more \nreasonable heads will prevail. I hope over the weekend the four leaders \ncan lead their troops in the right direction.\n  So I again ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to concur with an amendment occur at 5:30 \np.m., Monday, September 26.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, obviously, here in the \nSenate we would have a 60-vote threshold, and that is what we will have \nMonday afternoon. I see no reason why we shouldn't advance that to now \nso it can be clear whether this measure would pass the Senate. I am \npretty confident it will not, and I don't see any purpose to be served \nby delaying the outcome of that, making the outcome clear on Monday \nwhen we could have a clear outcome today; therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, we have a piece of legislation \nat the desk that takes care of all the issues. It takes care of funding \nthe government after October 1, and it also takes care of FEMA for the \nforeseeable future. It is a nice piece of legislation.\n  It is not our number; it is the House number.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Reid motion to concur to the House \namendment to the Senate amendment H.R. 2608 with amendment No. 656 be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelating to this bill be placed in the Record at the appropriate place \nas if read. In fact, what we are asking here is the CR, with the FEMA \nlanguage, be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we will have that vote on Monday. I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I renew my request. I would tell everyone--as my friend \nsaid, we will have the vote on Monday. We will keep the vote open, and \nif people are pressed on planes, I will work with the Republican leader \nand make sure that everyone is protected as much as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the renewed request for \nMonday?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, last night the \nHouse of Representatives approved a continuing resolution which \nincludes critical funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nFEMA. It has been reported that my friends on the other side of the \naisle are committed to defeating this measure because the FEMA spending \nhas been offset by a $1.5 billion reduction in the Advanced Technology \nVehicles Manufacturing Loan Program.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that in 2009, before the change \nof leadership in the House, that body sent over a bill, H.R. 3435, to \n``Make supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2009 for the \nConsumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Program''--otherwise known as \n``Cash-for-Clunkers.'' That bill provided an additional $2 billion, on \ntop of an already appropriated $1 billion, for a program that did \nnothing to boost long-term car sales in this country.\n  And how was the second appropriation to ``Cash-for-Clunkers'' paid \nfor? You guessed it, unused funds from a Department of Energy loan \nguarantee program. The former leadership in the House transferred money \nfrom the Department of Energy Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee \nProgram that was funded by the stimulus bill.\n  If ``Cash-for-Clunkers'' was important enough to transfer money from \na loan guarantee program that was not being utilized, why not the \ndisaster relief we are seeking to fund now? I would like to hear from \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle as to what made ``Cash-for-\nClunkers'' so critical to our Nation's health that we could pay for it \nwith money from a loan guarantee program but are unable to do the same \nwith FEMA?\n  And what is it about the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing \nLoan Program that the majority prioritizes over FEMA's disaster relief \nefforts?\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, the Department of \nEnergy has not obtained technical expertise to monitor the loan \nprogram, developed sufficient performance measures to ensure the loan \nguarantee program achieves its intended goals, and ``could not provide \nCongress with information on whether the program was achieving its \ngoals and warranted continued support.''\n  There is absolutely no excuse for not passing the continuing \nresolution approved by the House last night.\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I know my colleagues here want to join \nin on the debate that just transpired, but I wanted to take a minute to \ntalk about Senate bill 1542, which passed last night. I know, just as \npeople are frustrated here with everything that is going on, I think it \nis important to stop for a second, when something does pass and it is \ngood policy, that we talk about it, and that is the Child and Family \nServices Improvement and Innovation Act.\n  Congress took a pretty big step last night by improving the lives of \nchildren by the passage of this legislation. It is about keeping \nfamilies together. It is about rewarding government efficiency and \ndriving down costs, and it is about giving flexibility to invest in \nprograms that are proven to work for kids and families.\n  This bill is about America's children. It is about making sure that \nAmerica's foster care program works for children so they can keep their \nfamilies together. Too often, our Federal policies have punished States \nwhich have innovative programs, giving States money based on how many \nkids were still in foster care instead of rewarding success and \ninnovation that helped transition children out of the foster care \nsystem and back with their families.\n  Let me tell you what has happened in Washington State. We have been \nimplementing innovative programs to improve foster care for many years \nnow. When Washington State noticed a disproportionate number of Native-\nAmerican children being placed in foster care, our advocates took \naction and implemented the Washington Indian Child Welfare Act in \ndeveloping strategies for strengthening tribal relationships and \npromoting the best interests of Native-American children.\n  When Washington State noticed in general how long children were \nstaying in foster care, advocates took action, this time implementing \npolicies to help reduce the length of stay for children in out-of-home \ncare. As a result, the median length of stay for children in out-of-\nhome care declined almost 100 days between 2009 and 2011. In addition, \nWashington State reduced its foster care caseloads by 13.8 percent \nduring a similar time period.\n  Unfortunately, instead of being rewarded for these actions, we were \npenalized, and that is what this legislation has helped to correct. In \nfact, we lost $2.7 million during that time period. So this \nlegislation, instead of punishing Washington State for keeping kids out \nof foster care, helps us ensure the kind of innovation that will help \nus to make sure the best programs are implemented. This allows \nWashington to increase its capacity to keep doing the things that keep \nchildren who have been in the foster care system from being in the \nfoster care system the entirety of their childhood. This instead drives \nthem, hopefully, successfully back with their families.\n  Our State can invest in evidence-based programs that have proven to \nwork, and just as this legislation will help us to do, it will make \nsure that children don't bounce from foster home to foster home on a \ncontinuing basis. We will help to keep kids out of the care system and, \nwhen possible, place them back safely with families.\n  Washington State Representative Ruth Kagi, who has been a tireless \nadvocate for this system, said it best:\n\n       Title IV-E waivers can help the State move from purchasing \n     specific services to purchasing specific outcomes.\n\n  I thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Hatch for their timely and \ninnovative work on this legislation. I wish my colleagues could have \nbeen at the hearing that was held earlier this year when Senator Baucus \nasked young adults, who had been part of the foster system for their \nentire lives, how to change the system.\n  I thank the chairman for taking into consideration the specific \nimprovements and innovations that Washington State has advocated. And I \nthank my colleague, Representative Jim McDermott, and the Washington \nState legislators who worked on this, including Partners for Our \nChildren, the Children's Home Society of Washington, and the various \nsocial workers and advocates who, in our State, continue to try to \ninnovate when it comes to foster care in America.\n  This legislation is a major step forward to promote innovation on a \nFederal basis and to help keep families together. In doing so, we will \nhave the benefit of also driving more efficiency and driving down the \ncost. But, more importantly, we are going to be working to strengthen \nAmerica's children and families by trying effectively to keep them \ntogether.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5924-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5924-S5929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AMERICAN JOBS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments about \nwhat has been happening all week here in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  First of all, this year we have seen a terrible string of natural \ndisasters that have shut down businesses and left families homeless \nacross America. As chair of the Agriculture Committee, I am certainly \nvery concerned about the flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri \nRivers, and the record droughts that have devastated the livelihoods of \nmen and women who grow our food across America.\n  In response to that, the Senate, on a strong bipartisan basis, \nresponded to provide the funding for FEMA to help with communities \nacross America, 48 States, to be able to respond and be able to do what \nwe always do as Americans--to be able to step forward and work together \nand meet these kinds of natural disasters and the help that is needed.\n  We sent that to the House. The House decided, on the other hand, that \nthey not only would lower the funding amount, even though we know that \nmeans multiple times now having to keep churning to work something out, \nbut they have cut the amount. Then they added to it an effort to cut in \nhalf a public-private sector effort that is creating jobs.\n  I know people in Michigan and people across the country would be \nscratching their heads, saying, Wait a minute. Did I hear this right? \nWe are stepping forward to help families who had their house wiped out \nor their business wiped out or their farm wiped out or some other \nhorrendous challenge because of natural disasters. In order to help \nthem, the House Republicans are saying we have to cut jobs. That makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  I would say that while Michigan was very fortunate that we were not \none of the 48 States that has lost, because of weather disasters, homes \nor businesses or jobs or families, we have had a different kind of \ndisaster that has been going on. It is an economic disaster, it is a \njobs disaster.\n  I find it appalling that, on the one hand, we see strong support on \nthe other side of the aisle to rebuild homes and businesses and roads \nand schools in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are not saying there, well, \ngosh, we need to take away an effort to fund jobs or education here at \nhome to be able to fund what we are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan. But \nwhen it comes to helping people in America, somehow we can't work \ntogether and get that done without having to pit one State which has a \njobs crisis against another State which has a flood or a hurricane or a \ndrought. I don't find that to be very American.\n  I think it is time to stop playing politics. When hundreds of \nthousands of families and businesses have been devastated by \nunprecedented strings of floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, and \nother natural disasters, we ought to be stepping up, doing what we did \nin the Senate and passing a bipartisan bill to help those families, \nthose businesses, those farms, without playing\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\npolitics and trying to hurt other States that have been hit by other \nkinds of economic disasters.\n  We have 14 million people out of work in this country, and that \ndoesn't count people working part time two jobs, three jobs, or trying \nto piece it all together in some way. We know it is much higher than \nthat when you count those individuals and families. For each and every \none of them, their job search is an emergency. It is an emergency every \ntime they think about how to put food on the table for their family. It \nis an emergency every month when they have to scrape together the money \nthey need for rent or to pay the mortgage. It is an emergency every \ntime these men and women are filling out applications, every day going \nto job fairs, going on the Internet, trying to fill out forms, getting \nin lines, to find the best way to be able to get back to work. It is an \nemergency.\n  So, to me, it is outrageous that the House of Representatives--the \nRepublicans in the House--has included a job-killing offset to what is \nan important disaster assistance bill, to pull the rug out from \nbusinesses across the country and put up to 50,000 American jobs at \nrisk.\n  Let me tell you about what this particular program is. I am proud to \nhave championed this and initiated it in the Energy bill back in 2007, \na bipartisan bill signed by President Bush. It was slow to get going \ninitially to get the funding. I am proud that President Obama embraced \nit and moved forward to be able to put in place an alternative vehicle \nmanufacturing loan program to help retool plants in America so we \nwouldn't be losing the production of new, small plug-in electric \nvehicles and other new technology vehicles to other countries. It is a \nloan program to retool plants in America, and it is working.\n  In Michigan, these retooling loans made it possible for Ford Motor \nCompany to save 1,900 jobs at their Michigan assembly plant in Wayne, \nMI, so they could build the all-new Ford Focus electric and the \nbattery-electric Focus in America. In the process of that, between the \nretooling loans and our partnership with industry to invest in advanced \nbattery technology, we are now bringing jobs back from Mexico.\n  How many times have I heard colleagues on the floor talking about how \nwe want to make sure we are exporting products, not jobs, and that we \nwant to bring jobs back? What the House Republicans have done is to cut \nin half an initiative with the private sector that is actually bringing \njobs back from other countries. So far, 41,000 jobs have been saved or \ncreated through this effort around the country. Obviously, I care \ndeeply about Michigan and have fought for this, but we are talking \nabout Indiana, Illinois; we are talking about Florida and Louisiana and \nCalifornia, and all across our country where we are seeing communities \nhave the opportunity to retool plants that would be idle, empty, an \neyesore, and be able to bring those back with new technologies that are \ngoing to get us off of foreign oil and are creating jobs--41,000 jobs \nso far.\n  The real insult to me, as I look at what is happening to people in my \nState and across the country, is that they are poised to be giving out \nup to 11 additional loans to partner with business in the next couple \nof months that will create somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 new \njobs, saving or creating new jobs in the next few weeks. And right when \nthis is about to happen, the House Republicans are saying: Oh, no, in \norder to help the folks in Joplin, MO, who are wiped out as a \ncommunity, we want to make sure we are not creating jobs in Michigan; \nthat we are not creating jobs in Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Florida, \nLouisiana, California, Minnesota, wherever it is; that somehow we have \nto pit Americans against each other. That is not the America I know and \nlove.\n  In Michigan we don't have a weather emergency. But we stand with \nevery single State on this floor, every single Member who has had one. \nWe stand as Americans together to support people across this country. \nBut we say, Stop, when that means that somehow an effort to make things \nin America, manufacturing, the backbone of our economy, is somehow \nattacked one more time and partnerships taken away in order to make \nthat happen.\n  It makes absolutely no sense. That is what this debate is about. I \nwish to share some comments because we received a lot of support. I \nwish to share a couple comments, if I might, on the floor.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers has sent a letter opposing \nthe defunding of this particular partnership and they say: ``Defunding \nthe Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program will hurt \nmanufacturers and their employees.''\n  Everybody is spending a whole lot of time talking about jobs around \nhere. Unbelievably, we are talking about defunding this program in the \nmiddle of talking about jobs, how we need to create jobs, how we need \nto support employers, and how we can compete internationally with \ncountries such as China that say: Come on over. We will build the plant \nfor you. Forget a loan you are going to pay back with interest; we will \njust build it for you. Come on over, and, by the way, we will steal \nyour patents and manipulate our currency and make sure you get the \ntoughest deal possible to compete with us. But that is what they do.\n  So we put together something to say we are going to partner with the \nprivate sector to be able to keep the jobs in America and it is \nactually working. Jobs are coming back. We are rebuilding communities. \nWe are rebuilding plants. We are helping to get off foreign oil because \nwe are focused on new electric vehicles and an advanced battery \ntechnology industry where, because of our efforts, from producing 2 \npercent of the world's batteries, we are on our way to producing 40 \npercent, having the capacity to manufacture and create 40 percent of \nthe world's batteries within the next 3 years. Why? Because we have \nbeen working together in partnerships with industry, which is what our \nindustry is competing against around the world.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said: ``The ATVM loan program . . . \npromotes manufacturing in the U.S. and is an important component of \nAmerica's energy security.''\n  We all want to get off foreign oil. We do not want to be buying oil \nfrom folks we do not like and they don't like us and we can't trust \nthem. We have an opportunity, through the efforts we are focused on \naround alternative vehicles and battery initiatives, to get off foreign \noil.\n  This makes absolutely no sense to me. We have multiple other \nletters--the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, the Blue/Green \nAlliance--we have others who have come back and shared that as well.\n  We are at a moment when we know we need to pass a continuing \nresolution on the regular budget. We have a new process for a \nsupercommittee to look at how we take on and tackle the issues around \nour national debt and economic growth. During the process that set that \nup, there was an agreement on the budget numbers. We have the ability \nto pass that now. We have passed a bill to help our citizens across the \ncountry who have had weather disasters, natural disasters. We came \ntogether in the Senate to do that. The House has that.\n  There is one thing standing in the way: whether at this time we are \ngoing to say to people in Michigan and in other States where the \neconomic disaster has been overwhelming that we are going to pit their \nneed for jobs against somebody else's need to have their home or their \nstreet or their school rebuilt.\n  That is not who we are in America. I do not believe Americans support \nthat strategy. I think it is outrageous that there is a proposal that \npassed. I thank my House Democratic colleagues and my House colleagues \nin Michigan and the Democratic leadership in the House for waging a \nfierce battle to protect those jobs.\n  This is about making products in America. It is about rejuvenating an \nadvanced manufacturing sector that is critical. We are not going to \nhave a middle class if we do not make products in America. We are not \ngoing to have a middle class. This particular partnership, which is \nnothing more than a loan, repaid with interest, but it is support for \nour communities to rebuild--rebuild not in Afghanistan, not in Iraq but \nin America; rebuild communities and create jobs. It is working. It is \nbeginning to bring jobs back. It is outrageous that they have decided \nto take half the funding for this partnership away.\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n  I wish to support our effort to send over the continuing resolution \non the budget we need. I thank my caucus and our leadership for \nstanding firm and standing up for American jobs. That is what we care \nabout. That is what we have been fighting for. Along the way, we are \ngoing to make sure we are doing everything we can to help citizens who \nhave been so devastated by the natural disasters across the country.\n  I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor and will spend the \nnext 15 minutes or so, maybe even longer, to support the arguments made \njust recently, and I might say eloquently and passionately, by the \nSenator from Michigan, who was one of the key architects of this very \nsuccessful job creation program that the Republican House leadership is \ntrying to kill. That is, in large measure, what this debate this \nweekend and through next week is about. That is why almost unanimously \nDemocrats in the Senate are supporting our Democratic caucus in the \nHouse as we try to bring this debate forward so the American people can \nunderstand at this time and hopefully give their voice of support for \nwhat we are trying to do--keep government operating and keep jobs being \ncreated in this country.\n  It is a struggle. We know we are not creating as many as we would \nlike. But one of the programs that is creating thousands of jobs and \nhas broad support in America--and I am going to read the groups \nsupporting it in just a minute. For some reason, the Republican leader \nin the House, Eric Cantor, decided last week--even as the winds were \naffecting his district and Hurricane Irene was challenging the east \ncoast, a portion of the country he represents--he decided we needed to \nfind an offset so we could send money to his district and to other \ndistricts across the country and picked this program.\n  They couldn't have picked a worse one because this program is \nactually working. It has already demonstrated it has revitalized \ncommunities.\n  In addition, it is a program that created jobs, so several dozen \nRepublican House Members have sent private letters to the Secretary of \nEnergy asking for the money to go back to their districts, but publicly \nthey want to gut the program. Democrats have decided to bring this to \nthe attention of the American public. I have those letters, and I am \ngoing to submit them for the Record.\n  How is it that dozens of Republican leaders wrote private letters--\nwhich are a public record--but they do not issue them to the press. \nThey sent them to the Secretary. Anyone can get copies of them. I did \nthis morning and I have them. They are private letters to the \nSecretary, asking for this program to loan money to a public-private \npartnership to create jobs in their district. Then they go home and \nthey talk about their efforts to create jobs and they come back to \nWashington and try to gut the program under the guise that they need \nthe money to help disaster victims. That is what this debate is about. \nThat is why the Democrats are not--at least at this point, and I hope \nover the weekend and through next week--going to give in to that \nnonsense and hypocrisy.\n  I hope the President and the White House will fight hard, along with \nthe Democrats. I hope some of the Republicans who have signed these \nletters will think twice when this vote comes up again. I hope the \npress is reading these letters and asking these Republicans, whose \nsignatures are on these letters, one question: How is it possible that \nthey sent a letter to the Secretary asking for a loan to support job \ncreation in their district and then, at the same time, stand on the \nSenate floor and vote to gut the same program and then go back home and \nclaim they are helping to create jobs in America?\n  I am going to start with the first letter, which is the most \ninteresting to me. It is from Dr. Darrell Issa. He is a Member of \nCongress. He actually chairs an oversight committee. I think his \ndistrict is in California. He is a Republican from California. He is a \nvery powerful Member of the House. I am going to read his whole letter.\n\n       I write to express my support for Aptera Motors' \n     application for a loan under the Department of Energy's 136 \n     Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program. \n     Otherwise known as the ATVMIP.\n\n  The program he voted last night to eliminate. The same one.\n\n       Funding will allow Aptera to establish U.S. manufacturing \n     facilities for the commercial production of its plug-in and \n     hybrid electric cars. Aptera Motors plans to purchase and \n     equip manufacturing facilities to begin commercial-scale \n     production of its energy electric vehicles. Awarding this \n     opportunity to Aptera Motors will greatly assist a leading \n     developer of electric vehicles in my district.\n       Electric vehicle initiatives, like Aptera's, will aid U.S. \n     long-term energy goals by shifting away from fossil fuels and \n     using viable renewable energy sources like plug-in electric \n     energy. Additionally, Aptera's vehicles will reduce \n     dependence on foreign oil and enhance energy security. \n     Aptera's project will also promote domestic job creation \n     through California as well as in other States.\n       Unlike many other electric vehicles, Aptera's energy \n     efficient electric vehicles have a range of over 100 miles \n     per charge and the possibility to become one of the most \n     energy efficient vehicles in the world. A loan to Aptera will \n     help accelerate the move from gasoline-powered vehicles to \n     cleaner electric vehicles.\n       I urge you to give Aptera's Advanced Technology Vehicles \n     Manufacturing Incentive Program funding application full \n     consideration.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate \n     to contact me--\n\nor amazingly--\n\n     my press assistant.\n\n  Normally, when I write these letters, I say if I can be of further \nassistance, please contact me and my energy assistant. The energy leg \nperson usually handles this. But in this case he said we should call \nhis press secretary. I guess the press secretary could go back to his \ndistrict and claim he is doing a great job creating programs in \nCalifornia.\n  Maybe the press actually writes that Darryl Issa, Republican leader, \nis promoting manufacturing in California. This is what he says in his \ndistrict, and this is the letter he sends to the Secretary. However, \nwhen he was on the floor of the House last night, he voted to gut this \nprogram. That is what this debate is about. I am looking forward to \nhaving it.\n  The next letter I am going to read--and I am going to do this all \nweek, so I hope the press gets ready to ask these Republican leaders \nhow they could possibly have the gall to hold press opportunities in \ntheir districts promising people they are helping them create jobs and \nthen come back to Washington and cut the rug out from underneath their \nfeet with the bogus excuse that they have to come up with $1 billion, \nwhen the real need is only $175 million. I checked with Craig Fugate, a \nvery good friend of mine. I am the chair of his committee. I talk to \nhim all the time. When the real need for FEMA in 2011 is $175 million, \nbut under the guise of having to provide $1 billion, they want to gut \nthis program that is creating jobs, and they themselves have asked for \nthese loans to be made in their district.\n  This is the next letter signed by several Members, and I am going to \nsubmit their names for the Record. There are several Republicans. I am \nsorry, but from this letter I am not able to determine which ones are \nRepublicans and which ones are Democrats.\n  I ask unanimous consent that theses letters be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you. This is to Secretary Chu.\n\n       The State of California has traditionally assumed a leading \n     role in fighting global warming and working to eliminate our \n     dependence on foreign sources of oil. We want to commend you \n     for also taking effective steps towards achieving these \n     goals. As part of this effort, the Department of Energy's \n     Electric Drive and Vehicle Battery and Component \n     Manufacturing Initiative is currently reviewing submissions \n     for the construction of new lithium ion battery facilities in \n     the United States. This initiative is a huge step forward in \n     our efforts to improve our environment, eliminate our \n     dependence on foreign sources of oil, and create a modern \n     green-collar workforce here in the United States.\n       Quallion, an innovative American company located in \n     California, can be a valuable partner in your efforts because \n     it is ready today to directly support President Obama's\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\n     goal to have one million plug-in hybrid cars on the road by \n     2015. Quallion is a world leader in the development of \n     customized lithium ion batteries for medical, military, \n     aerospace and vehicle applications. If Quallion is successful \n     in its bid for grants through the Department of Energy's \n     Electric Drive and Vehicle Battery Component Manufacturing \n     Initiative, it is set to immediately execute the construction \n     of state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities to produce--\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n       Quallion projects that with this grant funding the proposed \n     facility could be fully operational by 2011, and could \n     produce more that 20,000 lithium ion batteries each year.\n\n  This is the killer.\n\n       In addition, Quallion projects this funding will create \n     more than 2,300 new and long-term jobs nationwide.\n\n  This is the program that Representative Cantor decided to use as an \noffset so he could fool the American people into believing we need to \nfind an offset to offset $1 billion of expenses, when we only have $175 \nmillion in expenses.\n  So they write the letters privately to the Secretary asking for \nfunding to go with their districts to create jobs and then they come to \nWashington and they gut the program for no reason.\n  This is another letter, and it is a little close to home. This is a \nletter I wrote. I was joined by my colleague Senator Vitter, Republican \nfrom Louisiana, and my Republican counterpart Rodney Alexander, who \nrepresents the district in my State. We sent this letter on December \n21.\n\n       We are writing to reiterate our strong support for Next \n     Autoworks Company's loan application under the Department of \n     Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program \n     and inquire about the status of the application.\n       Next Autoworks resubmitted a revised application in May \n     2010 that was almost immediately declared substantially \n     complete and expeditiously reviewed for technical and \n     financial merit. We appreciate the Department's work to move \n     the application through several critical stage-gates over the \n     past several months.\n       Next Autoworks has the ability to transform communities in \n     Louisiana by bringing critical economic growth in jobs to our \n     state and region. As you know, the company plans to re-equip \n     a former Guide Corp Plant in Monroe, LA, that was shuttered \n     in 2006 and establish a production facility that would bring \n     approximately 1,400 direct jobs and an additional 1,800 \n     indirect jobs to Northeast Louisiana. In addition, the \n     project will create thousands of jobs at supply facilities \n     across the U.S. The State of Louisiana and local communities \n     have already demonstrated their commitment by offering this \n     company $82 million in grants, $128 million in employee \n     training services, and an estimated $33.8 million in tax \n     abatements to support the project.\n\n  This is how strongly our Republican Governor and Republican \nlegislature in Louisiana feel about this project, that we have put up \nState and local money to see if we could attract this loan from the \nFederal Government to get this going.\n  It is signed by my colleague Senator Vitter and signed by my friend \nand colleague Representative Alexander, who represents this district. \nThis is one of our No. 1 economic development projects in the State of \nLouisiana, and what did the Representative do last night? He voted to \ngut the program.\n  I have dozens of other letters, but I am going to pause because I \nthink I have made my point. I am going to read every one of these \nletters that I have between now and when this debate ends. I just pray \nthe press will do their job and ask the Members who voted and sent \nthese letters why did they send a letter to the Secretary asking for \nthe program and then turn around and gut the program when they came to \nWashington.\n  I would like to ask for 5 minutes more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The other point is this: This is not just an issue for \none State or two States. That is why Democrats believe strongly about \nthis because this is about the whole country. The President has \ndeclared disasters this year in 48 of the 50 States. Maybe if we just \nhad had disasters in one or two places and they were not that terrible, \nwe would figure out some way. The problem is we have disasters in all \nStates, and I am going to show what these pictures portray because they \nare heartwrenching.\n  This is New Jersey. This is someone's household belongings. This is a \nhome that is completely uninhabitable. I am not sure how high the water \nis, but this is what a home looks like after a flood. I can visualize \nwhat it looked like after Katrina and smell, even more than the vision.\n  This is what New Jersey looked like a couple weeks ago. This water \nhas gone down, but this is Bound Brook, NJ. We do not know much about \nthis town. We hear about Trenton. We hear about New York. I have never \nbeen to Bound Brook, NJ, but I am sure it is a lovely place and it \nneeds our help.\n  So what does Representative Cantor do? He comes to Washington, he \nlooks at places such as this, and he decides out of the blue sky that \nhe is now going to assert his power by demanding an offset for disaster \nfunding when it is not necessary. The offset is way more than what is \nrequired. Again, it is an offset that is creating jobs in America.\n  I wish to say something else about the danger of requiring offsets \nand respond directly to what minority leader Mitch McConnell said \nearlier today. I think he said something akin to the reason we want to \nrequire offsets is because we have to stop doing things the same way \naround here, and just because we have never required them in the past, \nthat is no reason to not require them now. I understand that. I am kind \nof a person who likes to do things differently. I like to change \nthings.\n  I wish to remind the leader that not one Republican, to my mind, \neither in the Senate or the House, ever asked for 5 minutes to debate \n$1 to offset war or rebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan. I wish to put \nup this chart.\n  This is from 2001, so this is a chart that shows--let's say the last \nyear. I think it is important for the public to understand not just \ntoday but 10 years.\n  If we were to chart, which we have done here, a lot of this \nsupplemental spending, emergency spending and disaster spending--these \nare not for just natural disasters, these are for emergencies. For \nexample, when we went to war in Iraq, it was an emergency. When we went \nto war in Afghanistan, it was an emergency. When we had the avian flu, \nthat was an emergency, not a disaster. So this is disasters and \nemergencies.\n  Let's take this red bar here. It says Iraq and Afghanistan, $79 \nbillion. Do my colleagues see this zero here? That is zero offset. So \n$79 billion and no offset. This one is war money.\n  This is tsunami money that we actually sent to--remember we had the \ntsunami in Indonesia, and we sent some money over there. Did Eric \nCantor come to the floor and say we need to offset the money? No. So we \nsent that money, and less than 2 percent of it was offset.\n  Here is Iraq and Afghanistan, and none of it was offset--$87.6 \nbillion.\n  So I think disaster victims in his own district and around the \ncountry are saying: So why are we now in this debate trying to find an \noffset we really don't need for a program that really works? That is a \ngood question. If we want to find an offset, we should find another \nprogram. The only offset required is $175 million, but that makes too \nmuch sense.\n  So I want the Republican leadership to know they are risking a very \nimportant debate. I don't believe we should even talk about shutting \nthe government down. People are tired of that. We just went through a \nchallenge to the whole economy with the debt ceiling limit. Enough is \nenough. Democrats should not, in my view, cave on this point. We should \nfight and get them to compromise which is reasonable.\n  In addition to these arguments, I will put up a chart that is hard to \nlook at, but I think for the gulf coast Republicans and Republican \nSenators, it is a very important chart.\n  One of the dangers of requiring an offset is, No. 1, like right now, \nit is virtually impossible to get 535 Members to all agree on an \noffset. So what happens is, if we demand to have one, we keep the \nvictims waiting while we debate. It also doesn't help to choose an \noffset that is very popular on one side. There might be a program that \nwe could over the next couple of months decide is unnecessary, but we \ncan't do that within a few days of the disaster. It takes time. They \nshould know that.\n  Let me explain what this is for the gulf coast Senators. I had this \ndone after Katrina just to show the vulnerability of the gulf coast. \nAll of these red lines that look like spaghetti and then these bigger \nlines--the blue and the yellow and the orange--these are all\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\nhurricanes that have actually hit the United States between 1851 and \n2008. It is a very frightening chart.\n  One of the reasons I think Senator Rubio from Florida is voting with \nus is because he has seen a picture of this chart. That is how many \nhurricanes have hit Florida since 1851. He is most certainly aware from \nhis State that if he takes the position that we have to require an \noffset to fund disasters, his job as a Senator will be very, very \ndifficult, even more challenging than it is today, because the next \ntime a hurricane hits Florida, he is going to have to go sit down with \nthe budget folks and find out--before he can offer his people the \n$2,000 in emergency aid, the $30,000 that helps them, the loans through \nthe Small Business Committee, the loans to get their businesses back--\nhe is going to have to come up here and negotiate to find an offset.\n  Last night, I watched the debate on the House side. I thought our \nDemocratic colleagues did a beautiful job, and I wish to thank them for \nthe beautiful way they spoke. I didn't see one Republican come to the \nfloor. They had just one of their leaders talking last night when the \nvote happened. Maybe they are a little embarrassed, and they should be \nbecause I am going to read the letters they sent.\n  Also, the gulf coast Republicans I think really have to think about \nthis because these storms, as we can see--my State and the people I \nrepresent are in Hurricane Alley. This is Hurricane Rita, the blue, \nwhich is one of the most devastating storms. That is why it is a \nthicker line. Hurricane Gustav is the orange, Hurricane Ike is the dark \npink, and Hurricane Katrina is the yellow. All of these storms hit us \nand wrecked the gulf coast.\n  Let me say what happened after that. Haley Barbour, the Governor of \nMississippi, who is still the Governor of Mississippi, came up here \nwhen George Bush was the President and got $4.6 billion without one \npenny of offset, and he got that within 60 days of the storm. I am \ngoing to repeat that. Governor Haley Barbour, who is still the Governor \nof Mississippi, came to Washington, met with the President, and left \nwith $4.6 billion to rebuild Mississippi. The Congress gave Louisiana \n$5.4 billion, for which I was very grateful. However, we had 70 percent \nof the damage but only got 55 percent of the money, so we were \nshortchanged. I had to work for years. I finally got that squared away.\n  But this is why gulf coast Republicans and Republican Senators from \nthe gulf coast should think not twice but three times before they vote \nto require an offset.\n  I am just saying I am not going to forget this vote, because I chair \nthis committee, and if my colleagues vote to require an offset and \nanother storm hits their State, then the responsibility is on their \nshoulders to tell their people: I am sorry, I can't help you until I go \nto Washington and find an offset.\n  Maybe it will get so ridiculous--and I am going to call this the \nCantor doctrine--maybe it will get so ridiculous that Eric Cantor will \ntell all the people in America--there was a cartoon in the newspapers \nabout this. I am having it blown up because it is really sad, but it is \nactually funny. There is a woman sitting on top of her roof because her \nhouse is completely flooded. She has a phone, and she calls FEMA and \nFEMA says: We can't rescue you right now. We are looking for an offset.\n  So maybe the new Cantor Republican model of ``pick yourself up by \nyour bootstraps and swim away on your own'' will actually really be put \ninto practice because I think that is what they want because before \nthat woman can be rescued, before the debris can be removed, that woman \nis going to have to sit down at the table with her husband and kids in \na broken-down house or trailer and suggest some offsets to send to \ntheir Congressman before we can send them help. That is not right. That \nis what this debate is about.\n  Now, do we eventually have to pay for these disasters? Absolutely.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorialized against me the other day, so \nlet me answer them. They said: There goes Senator Landrieu; she doesn't \nthink she has to pay for anything. That is not true. I believe right \nnow we are paying for the war in Iraq, and it is very tough to pay for \nthat. We are finding a way in the supercommittee. But we didn't have to \nfind an offset before we could let our troops march in. We didn't have \nthem standing on the border, saying: Stand right here. Hold your fire. \nEric Cantor is working on an offset for you. We sent the troops in, we \nlet the bombers go, and we will figure out how to pay for it later.\n  So I am telling the Republicans in the House that they better think \nvery carefully about this vote. Senator Reid has sent a very good \ncompromise. He said: We will give up our number, we will take your \nnumber on FEMA, but we are not going to take this offset.\n  Now, I still think and I want to say for the record, as the chairman \nof this committee, that 3.65 is not going to be enough to get us \nthrough all of next year, but it will get us through the next couple of \nweeks and months--not months, maybe weeks. The government won't shut \ndown, and FEMA will have money to operate, as the leader said. It is \nnot ideal. It is not what is in our bill, which is the best, which is a \n$6.5 billion level, which is funding not just FEMA, but it will fund \nthe Corps of Engineers, community development, agriculture. What the \nHouse is doing only funds FEMA. It doesn't give any money to the poor. \nIt doesn't give any money to community development. It doesn't give any \nmoney to the farmers. So if you are sitting out there looking at your \nfarm with your crops ruined, please don't think the House of \nRepresentatives is doing one thing to help you because they are not.\n\n  So I have given any number of reasons why this is an important debate \nto have. There is no guarantee Democrats will win, but every now and \nthen it is a good thing to stand up for principle, and I believe this \nis a principle worth standing up for and worth fighting for.\n  I hope the press does their job over the next several days and asks \nthese Republicans: How in the world can you send a private letter \nasking for funding and then come back to Washington and gut the same \nprogram? And if the press does their job and if the people in our \ncountry will ask those same questions, maybe a few of these Republican \nleaders will compromise the way they should. Either give up the offset \nor come up with a different one. Come up with another one that is much \nless harmful.\n  Let me end with this. We have three letters that I will submit for \nthe Record. If people can't take my word for any of this, they can \nlisten to the chamber of commerce. What did the chamber of commerce \nsay? I will submit their letter. This is the wrong thing to do, the \nchamber says. Don't eliminate this program. It is creating jobs in \nAmerica. So the Republicans, I know, don't really like to listen to \nwhat I say a lot, but they should listen to the chamber of commerce.\n  The National Manufacturing Association--a very conservative group--\nsent the Republicans a letter saying: Bad deal. Don't do it. They did \nit anyway.\n  I just got a letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors. All of the \nmayors in the country, Republicans and Democrats, sent a letter to the \nHouse saying: Don't do this. And they did it anyway.\n  So the only people more powerful and the only group more powerful \nthan the chamber, than NAM, than the mayors, are the people themselves. \nSo I hope this weekend the people will say to their representatives: \nDon't cut out a program that is creating jobs. Don't require disaster \nvictims to have an offset. Let's keep the government operating, and \nlet's find a way to pay for this over time together and get this \ndeficit under control.\n  I am willing to do that. As the chair of this committee, I promise \nthem we can do better budgeting in the future. Nobody did it really \ngreat in the past. I am willing to do that. I am willing to work with \nthem in any way. But let's not go down this dangerous and inappropriate \nroad.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 14, 2009.\n     Hon.

Funding will allow Aptera to \n     establish U.S. manufacturing facilities for the commercial \n     production of its plug-in and hybrid electric cars. Aptera \n     Motors plans to purchase and\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\n     equip manufacturing facilities to begin commercial-scale \n     production of its energy efficient electric vehicles. \n     Awarding this opportunity to Aptera Motors will greatly \n     assist a leading developer of electric vehicles in my \n     district.\n       Electric vehicle initiatives like Aptera's will aid U.S. \n     long-term energy goals by shifting away from fossil fuels and \n     using viable renewable energy sources like plug-in electric \n     energy. Additionally, Aptera's vehicles will reduce \n     dependence on foreign oil and enhance energy security. \n     Aptera's project will also promote domestic job creation \n     throughout California as well as in other states.\n       Unlike many other electric vehicles, Aptera's energy \n     efficient vehicles have a range of over 100 miles per charge \n     and the possibility to become one of the most energy \n     efficient vehicles in the world. A loan to Aptera will help \n     accelerate the move from gasoline-powered vehicles to cleaner \n     electric vehicles.\n       I urge you to give Aptera Motors' Advanced Technology \n     Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program funding application \n     full consideration. If I can be of further assistance, please \n     do not hesitate to contact me or my Press Assistant, Justin \n     LoFranco at (202) 225-3906.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     Darrell Issa,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Re Quallion application for Department of Energy's Electric \n         Drive and Vehicle Battery and Component Manufacturing \n         Initiative grant.\n\n     Secretary Steven Chu,\n     U.S. Department of Energy, Independence Ave., SW, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Secretary Chu: The State of California has \n     traditionally assumed a leading role in fighting global \n     warming and working to eliminate our dependence on foreign \n     sources of oil. We want to commend you for also taking \n     effective steps towards achieving these goals. As part of \n     this effort, the Department of Energy's Electric Drive and \n     Vehicle Battery and Component Manufacturing Initiative is \n     currently reviewing submissions for the construction of new \n     lithium ion battery facilities in the United States. The \n     Initiative is a huge step forward in our efforts to improve \n     our environment, eliminate our dependence on foreign sources \n     of oil and create a modern ``green collar'' workforce here in \n     the United States.\n       Quallion, an innovative American company located in \n     California, can be a valuable partner in your efforts because \n     it is ready today to directly support President Obama's goal \n     to have one million plug-in hybrid cars on the road by 2015. \n     Quallion is a world leader in the development of customized \n     lithium ion batteries for medical, military, aerospace and \n     vehicle applications. If Quallion is successful in its bid \n     for grants through the Department of Energy's Electric Drive \n     and Vehicle Battery and Component Manufacturing Initiative, \n     it is set to immediately execute the construction of a state-\n     of-the-art manufacturing facility to produce advanced lithium \n     ion cells, modules and battery technology in volumes that \n     will meet America's current and future military and \n     commercial needs. Quallion projects that with this grant \n     funding the proposed facility could be fully operational by \n     2012, and could produce more than 20,000 lithium ion \n     batteries each year.\n       In addition, Quallion projects that this funding will \n     create more than 2,300 new and long-term jobs nationwide. It \n     will also signal America's seriousness to the world that we \n     are ready to compete in the manufacturing of green \n     technologies, in this case the lithium ion battery \n     manufacturing space.\n       The lithium ion batteries manufactured in Quallion's new \n     facility will have the potential to deliver real and \n     immediate environmental solutions, while also creating new \n     jobs at a time when Americans need them the most. The \n     Environmental Protection Agency estimates that truck idling \n     results in the emission of 11 million tons of CO2 \n     and the consumption of 960 million gallons of diesel fuel \n     annually. Quallion's new facility will produce zero emission \n     advanced lithium ion batteries designed to replace engine \n     idling as a power source for stationary trucks. Quallion will \n     deliver an immediate clean energy solution that enables the 1 \n     million heavy trucks on our roads to comply with the growing \n     number of anti-idling laws across the U.S., eliminate \n     unnecessary pollution, and significantly reduce America's \n     consumption of fossil fuels.\n       We believe that the Department of Energy's Electric Drive \n     and Vehicle Battery and Component Manufacturing Initiative \n     can and will play a large role in helping us achieve our \n     goals. We are also confident that Quallion is a perfect \n     partner in our objectives and will advance projects that are \n     vital to our energy policy and national security.\n       Thank you for the leadership you have provided the \n     Department and our country as we embark on an exciting era in \n     our nation's stewardship of the environment and as we move \n     towards our shared goal of energy independence.\n           Sincerely,\n         Brad Sherman, Dana Rohrabacher, Lynn C.

Steven Chu,\n     U.S. Department of Energy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Chu: We are writing to reiterate our strong \n     support for Next Autoworks Company's loan application under \n     the Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicle \n     Manufacturing (ATVM) program and inquire about the status of \n     the application.\n       Next Autoworks resubmitted a revised ATVM application in \n     May 2010 that was almost immediately declared substantially \n     complete and expeditiously reviewed for technical and \n     financial merit. We appreciate the Department's work to move \n     the application through several critical stage-gates over the \n     past several months.\n       Next Autoworks has the ability to transform communities in \n     Louisiana by bringing critical economic growth and jobs to \n     our state and region. As you know, the company plans to re-\n     equip a former Guide Corp plant in Monroe, LA that was \n     shuttered in 2006 and establish a production facility that \n     would bring approximately 1,400 direct jobs and an additional \n     1,800 indirect jobs to Northeast Louisiana. In addition, the \n     project will create thousands of jobs at supplier facilities \n     across the U.S. The State of Louisiana and local communities \n     have already demonstrated their commitment to the project by \n     offering the company $82 million in grants, $12.8 in employee \n     training services, and an estimated $33.8 million in tax \n     abatements to support the project.\n       Every day that Next Autoworks' application is delayed is \n     another day that workers cannot be hired to begin work at the \n     Monroe site and help mitigate our state's continued high \n     unemployment rate. Moreover, continued delay in the financing \n     for the project will also negatively impact the vehicle's \n     launch timing and this Administration's goals for fuel \n     economy. DOE's own environmental assessment of this project, \n     issued in October 2010, states that Next Autoworks' vehicle \n     will have a significant positive impact on fleet fuel economy \n     and the environment by providing a high quality, affordable \n     ``green'' car to the American market.\n       We strongly urge you to continue to expedite Next \n     Autoworks' application. We would request an update on the \n     status of the application and expected timeframe for moving \n     forward before the end of the year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mary Landrieu,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     David Vitter,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Rodney Alexander,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to speak for no more than 5 minutes and \nthat the Senator from West Virginia follow my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank \nthe Senator from Louisiana. I also want to point out, look at all those \nred lines. Those are the paths of hurricanes. Where do you think most \nof them were going between 1851 and 2008? And why are folks like us on \nthe gulf coast and the Atlantic coast so sensitive about disaster \nmoney? It is because we have been hit over and over.\n  Our lands we call paradise. But they happen to be, as the Senator \nfrom Louisiana said, in the middle of ``hurricane highway.'' It is a \npart of our lifestyle. When I was a kid, it was an excuse to get out of \nschool. When I was a bachelor, it was an excuse to have a party. But \nnow that I have the privilege of representing one of those very large \ngulf coast States and Atlantic coast States, it is absolute, utter \ndestruction.\n  When Hurricane Andrew hit Miami, had it turned one degree to the \nnorth, and instead drawn a bead on the Dade-Broward line in north \nMiami, it would have been a $50 billion insurance loss storm in 1992 \ndollars. That would have been upward of $80 billion today. It would \nhave taken down every insurance company that was doing business in the \npath of that storm. This is the destructive power. Do our people need \nhelp? Of course they need help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5929-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5929-S5930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BOB LEVINSON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I came to speak on a different \nsubject. A retired FBI agent named Bob Levinson, over 4 years ago, \ndisappeared when he checked out of his hotel in the Iranian tourist \nattraction of Kish Island in the Persian Gulf. He disappeared. It is \nonly recently that his family--and he leaves behind a family\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nof a wife and seven children--only recently have they had the belief \nthat he is alive.\n  We have brought this to all levels of our government. This Senator, \nwho represents the State Christine Levinson lives in, went to the \nIranian Ambassador at the United Nations years ago trying to intervene. \nOur Secretary of State has, in fact, pushed this very hard.\n  Why am I saying all this? Because on the occasion of the release of \nthe hikers by the Iranian Government, for whatever compassion they have \nshown--the government bringing together disparate parties that had \ntheir own little power centers in Iran--whatever success they had in \nbringing that together and releasing those hikers back to their loved \nones, we pray that same decisionmaking apparatus in Tehran would now \nactivate the process to bring Bob Levinson home to his wife and seven \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, I say to my good friend \nfrom Florida, I thank him so much for the compassion he has. I \nappreciate very much him bringing this issue to our light and to the \nattention of all of us, and maybe we can help. I thank the Senator.\n  To my good friend, the Senator from Louisiana, I think what she \nspeaks about is us identifying who we are as Americans and the way we \nhave taken care of each other. I do not know of any State that has not \nhad to depend on FEMA for help--and not just the States she showed \nwhere ``hurricane alley'' is and where the tornadoes and hurricanes \nhave hit, but basically all of us have had to depend on FEMA for \nassistance. So I think what she brings to light is the fairness we \nidentify with as Americans and to do what we have always done: to take \ncare of each other. I, for one, have said we need to rebuild America; \nwe need to take care of Americans first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5930-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5930-S5931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FISCAL CHOICES\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the difficult \nfiscal choices we, as Members of Congress, must soon make and the \ndeficit-cutting proposals that President Obama has recently made.\n  As we discuss these fiscal choices, and as we face our exploding \ndebts and deficits, it is clear our Nation is truly at a crossroads. A \nnation that was built on the strength of our people's optimism must \nstruggle to overcome a loss of confidence--a loss of confidence that \ncomes from an economy that has struggled for far too long, a loss of \nconfidence that comes from watching debt and deficits explode, a loss \nof confidence that comes from watching Republicans and Democrats engage \nin a fruitless partisan fight.\n  The American people worry about how to get their families out of debt \nand their financial house in order. They worry about finding or keeping \na job. They worry about how they are going to pay the rent, how they \nare going to take care of their children, how they are going to keep \nclothes on their backs, and how, maybe, they can buy them a Christmas \npresent.\n  Once again, instead of all of us coming together to do what is right \nfor the Nation and lighten their worries, congressional Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, and the President, are again gearing up for a fight \nabout politics, even as our Nation's fiscal and economic picture gets \nworse every minute.\n  Today, we yet again find ourselves on the brink, and I cannot begin \nto explain why to the American people. This summer, they watched us go \nthrough this exercise--the Senate, the House, and the President--and \nthen we agreed on spending cuts to keep the government working. Where I \ncome from--the same as the Presiding Officer from the great State of \nMinnesota--your word is your bond, and an agreement is an agreement, \nand it is one that should be kept. It is one we negotiated. It should \nnot be changed in midstream. I am committed to passing a clean CR to \nkeep our government working until the supercommittee we all are \nsupporting comes up with the recommendations to reduce the deficit.\n  In the midst of yet another disagreement over whether to keep the \ngovernment running, the people of West Virginia and the American people \nare demanding we put our partisan differences aside and work together \nin the best interests of this country. They are pleading for us to quit \nfighting and worrying about the next election and start worrying about \nthe next generation.\n  With our Nation facing a death spiral of debt, now is the time that \neach of us should be zeroing in on credible, commonsense solutions that \nhave truly bipartisan support.\n  After carefully reviewing the President's recommendations to the so-\ncalled supercommittee, I believe they fall short of what this country \nneeds to put our fiscal house in order. President Obama's deficit \nrecommendations not only fall short of his stated $4.4 trillion goal, \nbut could, according to an analysis done by the Center for Responsible \nFederal Budget, have the perverse effect of adding as much as $1.9 \ntrillion to our Nation's debt.\n  I am also greatly concerned about rehashing unproductive \nrecommendations such as raising tax rates on small businesses in a \nrecession and budget gimmicks such as the notion that taxpayers will \nsomehow ``save'' $1.1 trillion from not fighting wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq--and I believe we should not be there anyway.\n  I have said this: On my best day, I cannot sell that to the people of \nWest Virginia, nor should we try to sell it to the American people.\n  That is not to say that the President's proposal is all bad. There is \nsome good stuff in there. I have long said our tax system needs to be \nmore fair and balanced and that billionaires such as Mr. Buffett should \npay their fair share. I appreciate the concept of the Buffett rule and \nlook forward to seeing more details. And I agree that one of the best \ninvestments we all could make is in the infrastructure of this great \ncountry.\n\n  But as they stand right now, President Obama's proposals are too \nskewed to appeal to both sides of the aisle. So we see what we see \nhappening again. If we are being serious about addressing our debt and \ndeficits, neither Republicans nor Democrats can propose partisan \nproposals and then pretend they are credible. We cannot do that any \nlonger. The American people deserve better, and I also know we can do a \nlot better.\n  In my short time in Congress, I have seen only one plan that has \nearned support from Members of both parties. In fact, the President's \nown bipartisan deficit commission--the Bowles-Simpson group--is the \nbest example of what can be accomplished if we put politics aside and \ndo what is right for our Nation. While no one, including me, will agree \nwith everything in the Bowles-Simpson approach, it at least offered a \ncommonsense, bipartisan template that would cut spending, restore tax \nfairness, and would help restore fiscal sanity to our Nation.\n  To date, it is the only plan that has offered a framework that has \nhad bipartisan support from the beginning, and still has it now. But \ninstead of this approach, there are many people on both sides of the \naisle who have chosen a path that all but guarantees that Republicans \nand Democrats will continue to fight over how to solve our fiscal \nproblems, instead of seeking common ground and commonsense solutions. \nFor the sake of our Nation, for our families, we cannot let this \nhappen. We must act, and we must act together.\n  Looking ahead to the vigorous debates of the fall, my hope is the \ndeficit supercommittee will seize the moment and seek common ground to \ndevelop a plan that puts our Nation on the right path to fiscal \naccountability. Common sense, to me, is that you would start with a \nplan that already has bipartisan support because it will take both \nsides of the aisle to fix this problem.\n  I urge them and the President to look beyond partisan politics and do \nwhat is right for this country. I continue to urge the committee to \nlook past their legal mandate of $1.5 trillion in savings and revenue \nand, instead, look for reforms that will create much broader fairness \nin our system that will lead to deficit reductions of at least $4 \ntrillion.\n  I, for one, will work with the Senate Democrats and Republicans who \nare committed to develop a commonsense debt fix that responsibly \nreduces spending; makes our tax system more fair, cuts waste, fraud, \nand abuse, and\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\nmakes sure we protect critical programs such as Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week President Obama \nstood beside Israel and the cause of peace when he addressed the United \nNations General Assembly. I rise today to also stand beside our ally \nand friend, Israel, and the goal of its two-state solution. I firmly \nbelieve that only a two-state solution can lead to a lasting peace \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian people.\n  Unfortunately, we are heading down a path that will not lead to a \nlasting peace. Involvement by the U.N. General Assembly will not lead \nto a solution but will act as a disruptive force. I urge the parties to \nuse the time in New York to begin a constructive dialog toward \nagreement on final status issues. If peace is to be achievable, then we \nmust break through the cycle of failure that has too often plagued \nnegotiations. U.N. action will not resolve the issues acting as a \nroadblock to peace.\n  It is important also to note, as the President stated, that peace \nwill not come until each side ``learns to stand in each other's \nshoes.'' Each party must realize the other's aspirations, because their \nfutures are intricately intertwined. No action at the United Nations \ncan remove or change what is an essential fact. For Israel, the two-\nstate solution will enable its people to enjoy a secure and peaceful \nfuture. For the Palestinians, the goal of nationhood can only occur \nthrough negotiations with Israel.\n  I believe the President is making a good-faith attempt to realize and \nunderstand the aspirations of each party, while standing firm with our \nfriends. The central reality is this: We will only recognize a \nPalestinian state as part of an agreement that leads to a lasting \npeace. This is in the best interests of Israel, the Palestinian people, \nthe United States, and the international community.\n  There is no time like the present to restart the hard work needed to \nachieve a lasting peace. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert \nrecently pressed on the urgent need to return to negotiations in an op-\ned in the New York Times. I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. While I don't agree with everything the \nPrime Minister wrote, I do believe he was especially correct about one \npoint:\n\n       I truly believe that a two-state solution is the only way \n     to ensure a more stable Middle East and to grant Israel the \n     security and well-being it desires. As tensions grow, I \n     cannot but feel that we in the region are on the verge of \n     missing an opportunity--one that we cannot afford to miss.\n\n  He concludes in his piece:\n\n       Now is the time. There will be no better one. I hope that \n     Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas will meet the challenge.\n\n  I also hope that today both parties sit down in New York and avoid \nthe disruption that will be caused by a vote in the United Nations.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                          Peace Now, or Never\n\n                            (By Ehud Olmert)\n\n       Jerusalem.--As the United Nations General Assembly opens \n     this year, I feel uneasy. An unnecessary diplomatic clash \n     between Israel and the Palestinians is taking shape in New \n     York, and it will be harmful to Israel and to the future of \n     the Middle East.\n       I know that things could and should have been different.\n       I truly believe that a two-state solution is the only way \n     to ensure a more stable Middle Est and to grant Israel the \n     security and well-being it desires. As tensions grow, I \n     cannot but feel that we in the region are on the verge of \n     missing an opportunity--one that we cannot afford to miss.\n       The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, plans to make a \n     unilateral bid for recognition of a Palestinian state at the \n     United Nations on Friday. He has the right to do so, and the \n     vast majority of countries in the General Assembly support \n     his move. But this is not the wisest step Mr. Abbas can take.\n       The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has \n     declared publicly that he believes in the two-state solution, \n     but he is expending all of his political effort to block Mr. \n     Abbas's bid for statehood by rallying domestic support and \n     appealing to other countries. This is not the wisest step Mr. \n     Netanyahu can take.\n       In the worst-case scenario, chaos and violence could erupt, \n     making the possibility of an agreement even more distant, if \n     not impossible. If that happens, peace will definitely not be \n     the outcome.\n       The parameters of a peace deal are well known and they have \n     already been put on the table. I put them there in September \n     2008 when I presented a far-reaching offer to Mr. Abbas.\n       According to my offer, the territorial dispute would be \n     solved by establishing a Palestinian state on territory \n     equivalent in size to the pre-1967 West Bank and Gaza Strip \n     with mutually agreed-upon land swaps that take into account \n     the new realities on the ground.\n       The city of Jerusalem would be shared. Its Jewish areas \n     would be the capital of Israel and its Arab neighborhoods \n     would become the Palestinian capital. Neither side would \n     declare sovereignty over the city's holy places; they \n     wouldn't be administered jointly with the United States.\n       The Palestinian refugee problem would be addressed within \n     the frame-work of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. The new \n     Palestinian state would become the home of all the \n     Palestinian refugees just as the state of Israel is the \n     homeland of the Jewish people. Israel would, however, be \n     prepared to absorb a small number of refugees on \n     humanitarian grounds.\n       Because ensuring Israel's security is vital to the \n     implementation of any agreement, the Palestinian state would \n     be de-militarized and it would not form military alliances \n     with other nations. Both states would cooperate to fight \n     terrorism and violence.\n       These parameters were never formally rejected by Mr. Abbas, \n     and they should be put on the table again today. Both Mr. \n     Abbas and Mr. Netanyahu must then make brave and difficult \n     decisions.\n       We Israelis simply do not have the luxury of spending more \n     time postponing a solution. A further delay will only help \n     extremists on both sides who seek to sabotage any prospect of \n     a peaceful, negotiated two-state solution.\n       Moreover, the Arab Spring has changed the Middle East, and \n     unpredictable developments in the region, such as the recent \n     attack on Israel's embassy in Cairo, could easily explode \n     into wide-spread chaos. It is therefore in Israel's strategic \n     interest to cement existing peace agreements with its \n     neighbors, Egypt and Jordan.\n       In addition, Israel must make every effort to defuse \n     tensions with Turkey as soon as possible. Turkey is not an \n     enemy of Israel. I have worked closely with the Turkish prime \n     minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In spite of his recent \n     statements and actions, I believe that he understands the \n     importance of relations with Israel. Mr. Erdogan and Mr. \n     Netanyahu must work to end this crisis immediately for the \n     benefit of both countries and the stability of the region.\n       In Israel, we are sorry for the loss of life of Turkish \n     citizens in May 2010, when Israel confronted a provocative \n     flotilla of ships bound for Gaza. I am sure that the proper \n     way to express these sentiments to the Turkish government and \n     the Turkish people can be found.\n       The time for true leadership has come. Leadership is tested \n     not by one's capacity to survive politically but by the \n     ability to make tough decisions in trying times.\n       When I addressed international forums as prime minister, \n     the Israeli people expected me to present bold political \n     initiatives that would bring peace--not arguments outlining \n     why achieving peace now is not possible. Today, such an \n     initiative is more necessary than ever to prove to the world \n     that Israel is a peace-seeking country.\n       The window of opportunity is limited. Israel will not \n     always find itself sitting across the table from Palestinian \n     leaders like Mr. Abbas and the prime minister, Salam Fayyad, \n     who object to terrorism and want peace. Indeed, future \n     Palestinian leaders might abandon the idea of two states and \n     seek a one-state solution, making reconciliation impossible.\n       Now is the time. There will be no better one. I hope that \n     Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas will meet the challenge.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Res. 261\n\n       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been \n     determined to be safe and effective when used properly;\n       Whereas the abuse of such medicines can be extremely \n     dangerous and produce serious side effects;\n       Whereas according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services Administration's 2010 National Survey on Drug Use \n     and Health, the nonmedical use of prescription drugs has \n     risen, with 2.5 percent of the population engaging in \n     nonmedical use of prescription drugs in 2008 and 2.8 percent \n     of the population engaging in such use in 2009;\n       Whereas the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health \n     illustrates that the abuse of prescription medications such \n     as pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives \n     is second only to marijuana, the most commonly abused illegal \n     drug in the United States;\n       Whereas the 2010 Monitoring the Future survey, funded by \n     the National Institutes of Health, indicates that \n     approximately 5 percent of teenagers in the United States \n     report having abused an over-the-counter cough medicine to \n     get high, and prescription and over-the-counter drugs account \n     for 8 of the 14 most frequently abused drugs by students in \n     grade 12;\n       Whereas the 2010 Monitoring the Future survey also \n     indicates that the intentional abuse of cough medicine among \n     students in grades 8, 10, and 12 is at 3.2 percent, 5.1 \n     percent, and 6.6 percent, respectively;\n       Whereas according to research from The Partnership at \n     DrugFree.org, more than one-third of teenagers mistakenly \n     believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not \n     prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using street \n     drugs;\n       Whereas the lack of understanding by teenagers and parents \n     of the potential harm of\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\n     such powerful medicines makes it more critical than ever to \n     raise public awareness about the dangers of the abuse of such \n     drugs;\n       Whereas when prescription drugs are abused, such drugs are \n     most often obtained through friends and relatives;\n       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives \n     teenagers access to websites that promote the abuse of \n     medicines;\n       Whereas the designation of ``National Medicine Abuse \n     Awareness Month'' promotes the message that over-the-counter \n     and prescription medicines should be taken only as labeled or \n     prescribed, and such medicines can have serious or life-\n     threatening consequences when used to get high or in large \n     doses;\n       Whereas the designation of ``National Medicine Abuse \n     Awareness Month'' will encourage parents to educate \n     themselves about the problem of abuse of over-the-counter and \n     prescription medicines, and talk to their teens about all \n     types of substance abuse;\n       Whereas observance of ``National Medicine Abuse Awareness \n     Month'' should be encouraged at the national, State, and \n     local levels to increase awareness of the abuse of medicines;\n       Whereas educational tools, training programs, and \n     strategies have been developed by the national organization \n     that represents 5,000 anti-drug coalitions nationwide and the \n     association representing makers of over-the-counter \n     medicines, in order to help local coalitions demonstrate the \n     best ways to engage and educate parents and grandparents, \n     teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors, other \n     healthcare professionals, and retailers about the potential \n     harms of cough medicine abuse;\n       Whereas a partnership of nonprofit associations \n     specializing in raising media awareness about substance abuse \n     and organizations that represent the leading makers of over-\n     the-counter drugs have developed a nationwide prevention \n     campaign that utilizes research-based educational \n     advertisements, public relations and news media, and the \n     Internet to inform parents about the negative teen behavior \n     of intentional abuse of medicines, in order to empower \n     parents to effectively communicate with their children about \n     this dangerous trend and to take necessary steps to safeguard \n     prescription and over-the-counter medicines in their homes; \n     and\n       Whereas educating the public on the dangers of medicine \n     abuse and promoting prevention of medicine abuse are critical \n     components of what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb \n     prescription and over-the-counter medicine abuse: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of October 2011 as ``National \n     Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and \n     activities to educate parents and youth about the potential \n     dangers associated with medicine abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5934-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5934-S5936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Mr. President, the United States is considering H.R. \n2608, a continuing resolution to ensure our vital Federal programs can \ncontinue in operation while the Congress completes action on our \nappropriations bills for this fiscal year.\n  As all of my colleagues are aware, I do not welcome the reality that \nwe once again need to approve of stopgap measures as we prepare to \nbegin the next fiscal year, but, unfortunately, that is the position we \nare in now. The acrimonious and time-wasting debate on raising the debt \nceiling has led us to this place. Put simply, we have no choice but to \npass this short-term measure.\n  I wish to point out, however, that unlike last year, we see this as a \nshort-term need, not a long-term remedy, because even though there was \nneither an agreement on spending levels nor an allocation to the \nAppropriations Committee for discretionary spending until the August \nrecess commenced, I am happy to inform my colleagues that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has completed its work on 11 of the 12 bills \nrequired to fund our Federal agencies. In the past 3 weeks, the \nAppropriations Committee has met to review and favorably approve 10 \nbills for fiscal year 2012. Eight of those bills were reported out of \ncommittee in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, and by that I mean \nsomething like 29 to 1. The Senate has received five of these bills \nfrom the House. The Appropriations Committee is ready to take up any of \nthese bills on the floor when time allows.\n  In the interim, enacting a continuing resolution is essential before \nthe Congress goes on recess. The bill passed by the House provides the \nbare-bones minimum required to ensure that government functions will be \ncontinued without interruption. It also includes a few critical \nlegislative provisions to sustain vital programs which otherwise would \nbe terminated. There were many more items which the administration and \nMembers of this body would have wished to include, but the House did \nnot agree to include them. The House CR also provides a limited amount \nof disaster funding, which has been addressed by others.\n  I want to state for the record that I am particularly disturbed at \nthe position of the House that fiscal year 2011 emergency disaster \nassistance would be offset by canceling the advanced technology vehicle \nprogram. It has long been a tradition of the Congress to approve \ndisaster assistance without need for offset. Others will likely come to \nthe Senate floor to challenge that remark. They will point out that in \nmany, if not most, emergency supplementals the Congress has recommended \nusing rescissions to offset the cost of the bill. They are correct, but \nas usual the details tell the true story.\n  The Appropriations Committee annually reviews unobligated balances \nthat remain in programs and those that are unnecessary are recommended \nfor rescission or reapplication to other programs. However, in the case \nof disaster assistance, I challenge my colleagues to review all \nappropriations bills for the past decade and find a single instance \nwhere the committee paid for disasters by rescinding funds from other \nprograms. No one would find an example because, quite simply, there are \nnot any. Equally important, as noted above, year after year the \nCongress rescinds unobligated funds, but only when they are no longer \nneeded. In the case of the remaining balances for the advanced \ntechnology vehicle programs, these funds are needed. Hardly a day goes \nby that someone does not come to the floor and note the need for job \ncreation. Here is a program that is creating good jobs with a future. \nInvesting in new technologies to make our Nation more competitive in \nthe international marketplace is exactly the type of program where \nFederal Government intervention makes sense. The notion that our \nRepublican colleagues in the House would propose rescinding $1.5 \nbillion in funding from this program in the current economic climate \nborders on the nonsensical.\n  Finally, I would note that today's balances in the disaster relief \nfund are now at $175 million. Our people are in need of assistance now. \nThe Congress cannot wait any longer to address this need. All of my \ncolleagues should come together in a bipartisan agreement to strip out \nthe ATV offset, approve meaningful disaster assistance today, and \nreturn this bill to the House for reconsideration. I hope we have the \ngood sense to resolve this matter.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5936-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 18th \nannual National Public Lands Day, which will be celebrated on Saturday, \nSeptember 24. I am pleased to acknowledge the efforts of volunteers \nacross our Nation who will come together to improve and restore one of \nAmerica's most valuable treasures, our public lands.\n  National Public Lands Day started in 1994 with 700 volunteers working \nin just a few locations. This year over 180,000 volunteers will come \ntogether to work at more than 2,000 locations across all 50 States. \nThese people come from all walks of life, holding a shared interest in \nprotecting our public lands for the enjoyment of future generations. \nNational Public Lands Day provides an annual opportunity for the \nAmerican public to devote a day to conservation and to give back to the \npublic lands that give so much to us.\n  Our Nation has a proud tradition of conservation. When Yellowstone \nNational Park was established in 1872, it was the world's first \nnational park. The idea of a national park was an American invention of \nhistoric proportions that led the way for global conservation efforts. \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt, one of our earliest and most energetic \nconservationists, dedicated 194 million acres of national parks and \nnational preserves over the course of his Presidency. As we look ahead \nto enhance our Nation's conservation agenda, Secretary of the Interior \nKen Salazar has enlisted Congress to identify the ``crown jewels'' of \npublic lands that will be part of our legacy for future generations.\n  Public lands make up more than one-third of our country, and are \nplaces of continuous discovery, where we go to find ourselves, to \nuncover our history,\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\nand to explore for resources that help improve our quality of life. Our \npublic lands provide wide open spaces, deep forests, dramatic vistas, \nand opportunities for solitude that not only fulfill us individually, \nbut form a fundamental part of the American character. Our public lands \nare part of who we are and the diversity of their uses, like the \ndiversity of their landscapes, reflects our identity. In many areas, \nthey provide timber, ore, and forage that are the economic bedrock of \nrural America. In other areas, Congress has designated them as \nwilderness, places ``untrammeled by man, where man is a visitor who \ndoes not remain.''\n  Nevada boasts some of the most rugged and diverse landscapes in the \nUnited States. From the vast Black Rock Desert of northwestern Nevada, \nto the alpine peaks of Mount Rose overlooking the shores of Lake Tahoe, \nto the imposing buttes and sagebrush plains of the Sheldon National \nWildlife Refuge, and the Mojave Desert floor covered in Joshua trees \nand yucca plants. Over the past quarter century, home grown \nconservation advocates have worked to protect and preserve 68 \nwilderness areas consisting of 3.4 million acres, an area approximately \nthe size of Connecticut. These advocates continue to work towards \nprotection of the most special places in the Silver State. Currently, \nthere are strong grassroots efforts underway to protect the high alpine \nlakes and thick aspen groves of the Pine Forest Range in Humboldt \nCounty as well as the rich archeological resources and spectacular red \nrock formations in the Gold Butte area just a short drive from Las \nVegas.\n  Our public lands also provide a consistently reliable source of \nnatural resources that fuel our national economy. In northern Nevada, \nmining is a way of life. Although Nevada was well known for silver \nduring the 19th century, miners working in the Silver State now produce \nalmost 80 percent of the gold in the United States, much of which comes \nfrom public lands. Nevada also has a rich history of ranching for both \nsheep and cattle and grazing on federal lands helps feed this family \ntradition. Throughout the state the burgeoning renewable energy \nindustry on public lands has provided a variety of new job-creating \neconomic opportunities. Harnessing the solar, wind, and geothermal \nresources in Nevada and throughout the country will bolster our \ncountry's economic and energy security for decades and centuries to \ncome.\n  I recognize and thank the thousands of Federal employees who manage \nthese lands year-round. The Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, \nFish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and other federal \nland management agencies ensure that public lands in Nevada and across \nthe Nation meet the changing needs of our communities. They provide a \nvital, though rarely reported, service to our Nation.\n  I would also like to acknowledge and thank the many Nevadans that \nwill spend September 24 improving our public lands undertaking 19 \nprojects across the State from the Big Rocks Wilderness Area in \nCaliente to Daggett Summit Trail in Stateline. In northern Nevada, \nvolunteers will be working to improve our public lands at the Mill \nCreek Campground. These people will spend their day installing new fire \nrings, barbeques and lantern hooks as well as cleaning the debris from \nthe stream and placing rocks in parking and camping areas.\n  The focus of National Public Lands Day this year is highlighting the \nopportunities public lands offer young people through the Youth in the \nGreat Outdoors Initiative, launched by the U.S. Department of the \nInterior. This initiative will engage youth from all backgrounds in \nexploring, connecting with and preserving America's natural and \ncultural heritage.

Mr. President, I rise to honor a brave member of the \nU.S. Marine Corps and a fellow Kentuckian who was lost to his family \nand friends 45 years ago when he was killed in action in Vietnam. A \nvery moving article in tribute to this man, CPL Lorenza Gayles, \nappeared in the Middlesboro Daily News recently, and I wanted to give \nthis article and this fine young man's story the attention it deserves.\n  Born in Lynch, KY, on December 28, 1946, as the fourth child of David \nand Virginia Gayles, Lorenza moved with his family to Middlesboro as a \nbaby and grew up with many friends. He was a good student, was popular \nwith his schoolmates, and known for his sense of humor. His sister \nLelia remembers young Lorenza was ``just a charming little boy.''\n  Lorenza, called ``Rennie'' by his friends, attended the Lincoln \nSchool, the only school in Middlesboro for African-American children in \nthose days of segregation. He was a talented athlete who played \nfootball, baseball, and had an exceptional gift for basketball. Bill \nSmith, a longtime friend of the Gayles family, remembers Rennie as ``a \nsolid guy with a good head on his shoulders.'' When segregation in the \narea ended, Lorenza went to Middlesboro High School, where he graduated \nin 1964.\n  Knoxville College offered Rennie a scholarship to play basketball \nafter high school, but Rennie turned them down and chose to enlist with \nthe Marine Corps instead. His older brother David was serving in the \nU.S. Air Force, and his brother Bobby was already in Vietnam with the \nArmy. Within 2 years Rennie had risen to the rank of corporal and took \nhis duties as a marine very seriously.\n  Alvin Simpson, a fellow Marine recruit who went through basic \ntraining with Rennie and later wrote a memoir about his experiences, \nsaid this: ``There was no question who could outfight whom; I knew, he \nknew, and the entire platoon knew Lorenza was the real deal.''\n  Corporal Lorenza Gayles was deployed to Vietnam on June 21, 1966. On \nSeptember 3 of that year, while on reconnaissance patrol, he was on \npoint with his squad when they walked into an ambush. Corporal Gayles \nwas killed instantly. He was 19 years old.\n  Several weeks later his parents were presented with Corporal Gayles's \nposthumously awarded Purple Heart Medal. Corporal Gayles is buried in \nthe Lynch Cemetery in Middlesboro.\n  ``When Rennie was killed in action in Vietnam,'' the author of this \narticle writes, Mr. President, ``I remember my mother saying, `that \npoor little Gayles boy.' This is something that I have carried with me \nmy entire life.''\n  That is the author of this article speaking. Forty-five years later, \nthis author's memories still affect him, and I think anyone who reads \nthis piece will be affected too. CPL Lorenza Gayles's life may not have \nbeen long, but he made an indelible mark on the people who love and \nremember him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article remembering CPL \nLorenza Gayles, a proud marine and a brave Kentucky hero who deserves \nall of our respect, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Middlesboro Daily News, Sept. 2, 2011]\n\n                            Forgotten Marine\n\n       (Editor's Note: This article was written by a Daily News \n     reader who wishes to honor the memory of one of Middlesboro's \n     finest--Lorenza Gayles--yet remain anonymous.)\n       ``Once upon a time in America, when I was colored, two \n     adventurous, young boys, both black, but from very different \n     backgrounds; one boy was from Ky., the other boy hailed from \n     Northern Ohio. The kid from Ky. was killed September 3, 1966, \n     in South Vietnam. His name was Lorenza Gayles, he was twenty \n     years old when he was killed, he was my friend. I loved him \n     then--and I love him more today.''\n       --From ``Together We Served'' By Alvin L. Simpson.\n\n       To most, Rennie Gayles is a public housing development in \n     Middlesboro. To others, he was a son, a brother and a friend; \n     but most importantly to me, he was Corporal Lorenza Gayles, \n     United States Marine. Though I didn't know him, and was only \n     five years old at the time of his death, his life and death \n     have always held a special meaning to me.\n       Born in Lynch, Ky., on December 28, 1946, he was the fourth \n     child of David and Virginia Gayles. Soon after his birth, the \n     Gayles family moved to Middlesboro where he and his\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\n     older brothers and sister were raised in a loving home by \n     parents that worked very hard to provide for their children. \n     Rennie, as he was affectionately known, grew up like most of \n     us. He had many friends, loved playing basketball, just a \n     normal childhood growing up. He is described by his sister \n     Lelia as ``just a charming little boy.''\n       Rennie attended school at the Lincoln School in \n     Middlesboro, long since gone. In the days of segregation, it \n     was the only school in Middlesboro for black children. He was \n     a good student, very popular among his classmates and known \n     for his sense of humor. Bill Smith, a longtime friend of the \n     Gayles family, described Rennie as ``a solid guy with a good \n     head on his shoulders.''\n       Rennie was also a very talented athlete who played \n     football, baseball, and was an especially gifted basketball \n     player. With the end of segregation, he then attended \n     Middlesboro High School, where he graduated in 1964.\n       Offered a scholarship by Knoxville College to play \n     basketball, he declined. Instead, young Gayles enlisted in \n     the United States Marine Corps. With his older brother David \n     serving in the U.S. Air Force, and Bobby serving in Vietnam \n     in the U.S. Army, I suppose he felt he was obligated to \n     enlist. He received his basic training at Parris Island, \n     South Carolina, and upon completion was stationed at Camp \n     Lejeune, North Carolina. He later transferred to a Marine \n     base in California. He quickly rose through the ranks and \n     became a corporal in just two years. He was an attentive \n     soldier and took his obligation to the Corps very seriously. \n     He was a ``textbook'' Marine. Tough, no-nonsense and cared \n     deeply about those he served with.\n       ``Everybody in our platoon knew the outstanding recruit was \n     a black kid from Middlesboro, Ky., Lorenza Gayles,'' writes \n     Alvin Simpson, author of ``Distant Shore: A Memoir,'' and \n     fellow Marine recruit in basic training with Rennie.\n       ``There was no question who could outfight whom; I knew, he \n     knew, and the entire platoon knew Lorenza was the real \n     deal.''\n       With the war in Vietnam escalating, Rennie was deployed on \n     June 21, 1966. Just over two months after arriving in \n     Vietnam, while on a reconnaissance patrol, Rennie was on \n     point (front man in the squad) when he and the other members \n     of his squad walked into an ambush. He was killed instantly.\n\n\n                                the war\n\n       With the war in Vietnam so many years behind us, many have \n     tried to put it out of their minds. But for those who served \n     and the family members who lost loved ones there, it haunts \n     them every day. Deemed an unpopular war, many returning \n     Vietnam veterans were scorned, cursed, called ``baby \n     killers,'' and spat upon. The truth is, no war is popular. \n     War is, sometimes, just a necessary evil. This great nation \n     has long carried the obligation to protect and defend those \n     who cannot defend themselves against oppressions that exist \n     in this world. And to the over 58,000 soldiers that died and \n     1,300 still listed as missing in action, we owe our eternal \n     gratitude.\n       As a child growing up in the 1960s and early 1970s, the war \n     in Vietnam to me was sitting beside my father watching the \n     nightly news with Walter Cronkite. With the end of each \n     broadcast came the body count, the dead, the wounded and the \n     missing in action. Today, newscasts are filled with coverage \n     of brave men and women memorialized who have given their \n     lives, and those troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan \n     as they are met at airports across the country by cheering \n     crowds and hailed as heroes and glorified as they should be. \n     They have dedicated their lives to protect and serve this \n     nation as soldiers, and are prepared to give their lives for \n     it.\n       We owe the same gratitude to those who served in Vietnam. \n     We all know someone who served there and the memories of \n     these heroes are fleeting. These men and women served with \n     the same courage and dedication as do the brave soldiers of \n     today. We see them every day. Take just a moment to thank \n     them for their service and their sacrifice; just a pat on the \n     back and a thank you would mean so much. Most of all, take a \n     moment to remember, honor and mourn those who gave their \n     lives for this great nation. Our community lost too many fine \n     young men in Vietnam and it's up to us to pass on their \n     heritage so that they are not forever lost to posterity. \n     Remember that many of these men and women sacrificed their \n     ambitions so that we wouldn't have to. They died for the very \n     freedoms we enjoy every day.\n       When Rennie was killed in action in Vietnam I remember my \n     mother saying ``that poor little Gayles boy.'' This is \n     something that I have carried with me my entire life. And \n     with the passing of time and generations we owe it to them to \n     carry on their memories. This tall, handsome, young Marine \n     with his broad beaming smile, with his whole life ahead of \n     him, he was one of those men.\n       Rennie Gayles is not just a housing project; United States \n     Marine Corporal Lorenza Gayles was a guardian of freedom.\n\n\n                              remembrance\n\n       Forty-five years ago, on September 3, 1966, just before \n     your twentieth birthday, in a country, half a world away from \n     home, in the Quang Nam Province of South Vietnam defending \n     your nation with a profound sense of duty and exemplary \n     conduct becoming a United States Marine, you made the \n     ultimate sacrifice. Every day of my life I will thank God for \n     you, I will honor you, and I will remember you . . . Semper \n     Fi\n       On October 26, 1966, Corporal Lorenza Gayles was \n     posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. It was presented to \n     his parents by Major F.C. Fisher, U.S.M.C. Corporal Gayles is \n     buried in the Lynch Cemetery in Middlesboro.\n       Sincerest appreciation to those who contributed to this \n     article: Rennie's brother, Bobby Gayles of Middlesboro; Bill \n     Smith, U.S. Army (Ret.), of Middlesboro; sister Lelia Gayles-\n     Cammon, Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Alvin L.

Mr. President, 10 years ago, I introduced the DREAM Act, \nlegislation that would allow a select group of immigrant students with \ngreat potential to contribute more fully to America.\n  The DREAM Act would give these students a chance to earn legal status \nif they came to the U.S. as children, are long-term U.S. residents, \nhave good moral character, graduate from high school, and complete 2 \nyears of college or military service in good standing.\n  The DREAM Act would make America a stronger country by giving these \ntalented immigrants the chance serve in our military and contribute to \nour economy.\n  Tens of thousands of highly-qualified, well-educated young people \nwould enlist in the Armed Forces if the DREAM Act becomes law.\n  And studies have found that DREAM Act participants would contribute \nliterally trillions of dollars to the U.S. economy during their working \nlives.\n  These young people have overcome great obstacles to succeed. They are \nvaledictorians, star athletes, honor-roll students, and ROTC leaders. \nNow they want to give back to their country. The DREAM Act would give \nthem that chance.\n  For the last 10 years I have been working on the DREAM Act, there has \nbeen one constant: strong support from the faith community. The DREAM \nAct is supported by almost every religious group you can imagine: \nCatholic, Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, and Evangelical Christians; \nOrthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jews; and Muslims, Hindus, and \nSikhs.\n  The faith community supports the DREAM Act because it is based on a \nfundamental moral principle that is shared by every religious \ntradition--it is wrong to punish children for the actions of their \nparents.\n  These students were brought to this country as children. They grew up \nhere pledging allegiance to the American flag and singing the only \nnational anthem they've ever known. They are American in their hearts \nand they should not be punished for their parents' decision to bring \nthem here.\n  For the next several weeks, people of faith all across this country \nwill show their support for the DREAM Act by celebrating the first-ever \n``DREAM Sabbath.''\n  On the DREAM Sabbath, at churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples \naround the country, Americans of many religious backgrounds will offer \nprayers for the immigrant students who would be eligible for the DREAM \nAct. At many of these events, these DREAM Act students will tell their \nstories.\n  The DREAM Sabbath will take place over several weekends in September \nand October, and so far, there are more than 320 DREAM Sabbath events \nplanned, in 44 States.\n  In June, when I announced the DREAM Sabbath, I was joined by \nreligious leaders from a great variety of faith traditions, including: \nCardinal Theodore McCarrick, a good friend who has been a leader in the \nfight for immigration reform for many years; Bishop Minerva Carcano, \nthe first Hispanic woman to be elected bishop in the Methodist Church; \nReverend Samuel Rodriguez, the president of the Nation's largest \nHispanic Christian organization, with more than 30,000 member churches; \nReverend Derrick Harkins, the pastor of one of the most prominent \nAfrican-American churches in our Nation's Capitol, who was representing \nthe National Association of Evangelicals; Bishop Richard Graham of the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America; Bishop David Jones of the \nEpiscopal Church; Rabbi Lisa\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\nGrushcow of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society; and Imam Mohamed Magid, \nthe head of the Nation's largest Muslim organization.\n  The DREAM Sabbath events reflect this great religious diversity. Let \nme give you just a few examples of the congregations who are observing \nthe DREAM Sabbath: the First Presbyterian Church of Cheyenne, WY; the \nCentral United Methodist Church in Fairmont, WV; the Unitarian Church \nof Lincoln, NE; Galloway Memorial Episcopal Church in Elkin, NC; Grace \nUnited Methodist Church in Missoula, MT; Trinity Episcopal Church in \nWinner, SD; the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops; the Florida \nCatholic Conference of Bishops; and the following Catholic dioceses, \njust to name a few: Cincinnati, OH; Cleveland, OH; Davenport, IA; \nEvansville, IN; and Salt Lake City, UT. Just last night, in Tucson AZ, \nthe DREAM Sabbath was recognized at the National Hispanic Evangelical \nImmigration Summit, a gathering of 1,200 Evangelical ministers. This \nsummit was convened by Reverend Sam Rodriguez and the National Hispanic \nChristian Leadership Conference and I want to thank them for their \nleadership.\n  In my home State of Illinois, I plan to observe the DREAM Sabbath at \na number of places, including: Anshe Sholom B'nai Israel Congregation, \na Modern Orthodox temple, where, by the way, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel \nis a congregant; Old St. Pats Church, my home parish in Chicago; and \nthe Church of the Holy Spirit in Schaumberg.\n  I would like to invite all of my colleagues and everyone listening \ntoday to participate in the DREAM Sabbath. If you are interested in \nbecoming part of this important national movement, you can visit \nwww.dreamsabbath.org for more information or call my office at 202-224-\n2152.\n  The DREAM Sabbath will put a human face on the plight of undocumented \nstudents who grew up in this country and help build support for passage \nof the DREAM Act.\n  DREAM Act students need our prayers, but they need more than that--\nthey need our help to pass the DREAM Act.\n  These young people are American in their hearts. They are willing to \nserve our country, if we would only give them a chance. Passing the \nDREAM Act is the right thing to do and it will make America stronger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5939-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HUNGER AWARENESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nover 50 million people, including over 17 million children in the \nUnited States, who face the day not knowing if they will have enough to \neat.\n  Millions of families live each day not knowing if and how they will \nput food on the table.\n  Rather than thinking about what the next meal will be, these parents \nworry if there will be a next meal.\n  Rather than concentrate on homework, these children are trying not to \nthink about their hunger pangs.\n  According to the USDA in 2010, 14.5 percent of households--or 1 in 6 \nAmericans--experienced hunger. This is the highest level of hunger in \nour Nation since the government began tracking food insecurity in 1995.\n  No State or county is immune to the reality of hunger. In Illinois' \nthree wealthiest congressional districts an average of 13.2 percent of \npeople--or nearly 281,000 people--experienced hunger in 2009.\n  Hunger is a reality in all of our communities. We see it in the long \nlines at our food pantries. We have heard from seniors forced to choose \nbetween groceries and medication. And children are in our schools who \nhave not had a decent meal since the previous day's school lunch.\n  The U.S. Census Bureau reported this month that more than 1.82 \nmillion people lived in poverty in Illinois last year. That's up from \n1.69 million in 2009--making 2010 the third straight year the poverty \nrate in Illinois has risen.\n  According to Feeding America in Illinois, nearly 1.9 million people--\nincluding over 740,000 children--are food insecure and often rely on \nsafety net programs for their next meal.\n  Hunger is a symptom of poverty, and where this is poverty we see \ngreater demand for emergency food programs and support. Federal food \nassistance programs have responded to the growing need by helping low \nand middle-class families, children, and seniors maintain a healthy \ndiet.\n  Throughout the country, food banks and pantries that rely on Federal \nassistance are the front line of the fight against hunger--providing \nemergency food assistance to hungry families.\n  Unfortunately, business at food banks has never been better. Over the \npast 2 years, Illinois food banks have seen a 50 percent increase in \nrequests for food assistance. In 2009, Illinois food banks provided \nfood to 1 in 10 residents.\n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food \nstamps, is one of the Nation's most important antihunger programs. SNAP \nhas provided over 46 million Americans with essential food assistance.\n  In Illinois, 1.8 million people--that is 1 in 7 residents--rely on \nSNAP benefits to buy the food they need.\n  The benefits of SNAP reach far beyond helping households maintain a \nhealthy diet. SNAP is a powerful tool in fighting poverty, and has \nlifted nearly 2.5 million children out of poverty, more than any other \ngovernment program.\n  According to the USDA's Economic Research Service, $5 of SNAP \nbenefits can generate $9 in economic activity through retail demand, \nfarm production, and jobs.\n  At a time when families are having trouble making ends meet, food \nstamps meet a basic human need.\n  The people using food banks or food stamps to get by are people you \nknow--your neighbor and coworker.\n  I recently heard from a single mother of a 4-year old daughter who \nreceives emergency food assistance from the Eastern Illinois Food Bank.\n  This young mother is also a full-time college student, who plans to \nuse her education to provide a better life for her family.\n  Without the extra support from food stamps, this woman says she would \nhave to drop out of college and work at a minimum wage job just to make \nends meet.\n  She credits food stamps for not only providing food assistance, but \nfor allowing her to get an education so she can move her family out of \npoverty.\n  As Congress works to rein in our Nation's debt, we will hear from all \nsides. The millions of Americans who rely on safety net antihunger \nprograms like SNAP will not have the loudest voice in the debate or big \nPR firms, but we can't forget them.\n  We must protect Federal food assistance programs. These programs are \nnot a giveaway or a handout. They are strengthening our economy and \nimproving the lives of vulnerable families, children, and seniors at \ntheir time of need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5939-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5939-S5940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MORETOWN POST OFFICE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate a notable development in the community of Moretown, VT. \nMoretown is located near the confluence of the Mad River and the \nWinooski River, just down the road from my home in Middlesex, and the \ncommunity was hit particularly hard by the flooding caused by Tropical \nStorm Irene. Homes were flooded, the town offices were inundated, and \nthe Moretown School was damaged. Bridges were washed away, cutting the \ntown off from central Vermont's highway system, and leaving some \nresidents stranded. But through this disaster, the town pulled \ntogether, in yet another of the many stories that can be told of the \ngreat resilience shown by Vermonters in the storm's terrible aftermath.\n  As flood waters rose, the postmaster in charge of the Moretown Post \nOffice, Naomi Tilton, and the two carriers who work in the Moretown \nPost Office managed to save every piece of mail from the rising flood \nwaters. Every single piece of mail in their charge. Water eventually \nfilled the entire post office lobby, and as water damage left by the \nflooding in Moretown demonstrated, as much as 8 feet of water filled \nthe first floors of structures surrounding the post office.\n  When my staff visited the Moretown Post Office a week later, workers \nhad already begun renovating the building.\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\nThey had shoveled out the mud and muck deposited by the river, and they \nhad torn out the mold-prone sheetrock. Yet even in disrepair, the post \noffice was not in disarray or disorder: The Moretown Post Office \ncontinued to operate. A sign made out of a plain sheet of white paper \ndirected customers to the side of the erstwhile post office, up a set \nof crooked stairs and into an office on the second floor. In that \nmakeshift temporary post office, customers could still buy stamps, pick \nup their mail, and share their stories of survival and community \ntogetherness.\n  The postal employees of Moretown did all this on their own time, \noutside of normal business hours, and on their own initiative. I \nunderstand that Ms. Tilton's manager was stranded dozens of miles to \nthe south in Rochester, VT, a town similarly cut off from the outside \nworld. Professionalism and dedication to the community motivated the \nemployees of the Moretown Post Office to keep the area's postal system \nworking. Their efforts offered a glimmer of hope to their neighbors as \nthe community realized the extent of the devastation caused by the \nflood and the tremendous effort it would take to rebuild Moretown. And \nwhat a powerful testament to the currency in modern times of the proud \ntradition of this Nation's venerable postal system and its dedicated \npublic servants.\n  The Moretown Post Office is just one story of the hundreds of stories \nI would like to tell to remind everyone how determined we are to \nrecover from Tropical Storm Irene. The determination of our Moretown \npostal workers reminds us all of what it means to be a Vermonter and an \nAmerican.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5940-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5940-S5941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING SUVASH DARNAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken over the years about the \npolitical transformation that has been taking place in Nepal since \n2005, from a corrupt, autocratic monarchy to an emerging democracy.\n  That process has moved forward by fits and starts, plagued by \npolitical infighting and the seeming inability of political and ethnic \nfactions to unite for the good of the people. We are struggling with \npartisanship and divisiveness in this country, so I understand the \nproblem, but Nepal is at a historic crossroads and cannot afford for \nthis process to fail.\n  Key issues that were at the heart of the internal armed conflict, \nsuch as impunity for crimes against civilians by both sides, have not \nbeen addressed. Shielding perpetrators of gross violations of human \nrights from punishment is incompatible with a democratic society based \non the rule of law.\n  There are many other challenges, like reform of the army, \ndemobilization of former Maoist combatants, improving literacy, \nbuilding effective, transparent government institutions, and reducing \npoverty. The United States is helping, but Nepal's competing political \nleaders must point the way forward by making the necessary compromises.\n  Today I want to speak briefly about caste discrimination, which is at \nthe core of Nepal's feudalistic history. I do so by paying tribute to \nan extraordinary leader of Nepal's Dalit community, Suvash Darnal, who \nwas tragically killed in a motor vehicle accident in Virginia on August \n15, 2011.\n  Mr. Darnal was only 31 years old when he died, but he had already \nachieved far more than most people, even people with every advantage, \ndo in a much longer life.\n  Mr. Darnal was of humble beginnings, with nothing but hardship and \nunfairness to look forward to. Yet he managed to overcome daunting \nobstacles to become a respected leader with boundless energy, a \nquenchless thirst for knowledge, extraordinary vision, and a tireless \ndetermination to help improve the lives of his people.\n  As I have said before in this Chamber, Nepal's democracy cannot \nsucceed without the inclusion of minority castes, including Dalits, in \npolitical and economic decisionmaking. Mr. Darnal devoted himself \npassionately to that cause through journalism, research, and advocacy.\n  He was an inspiring example of why caste discrimination has no place \nin the 21st century, and his death is a tragic loss not only for Dalits \nbut for all of Nepal. He had the humility, integrity, intellect, and \ndedication to his people that Nepal needs in its leaders, and I hope \nothers of his generation are inspired by his life and work to continue \nhis legacy.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan August 16 article in the Kathmandu Post about Mr. Darnal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Kathmandu Post, Aug. 16, 2011]\n\n                   Bidushi Dhungel, ``Palpali Flame''\n\n       The tragic death of 31-year-old Dalit activist and media \n     entrepreneur Suvash Darnal is a huge setback to Nepal's Dalit \n     movement. Well known for being the founder of Nepal's first \n     ever Dalit-focused media organisation, Jagaran Media, co-\n     founder of the Collective Campaign for Peace and most \n     recently, the Dalit-focused think tank, Samata Foundation, \n     Darnal made undeniable contributions to a burgeoning rights-\n     sensitive society.\n       Born in Mujhung in Palpa, and one of four siblings, Suvash \n     was schooled ``by accident,'' at a local school that just \n     happened to be in close proximity to his home. He was never \n     told to go to school, nor did he initially see it as \n     necessary, ``it just kind of happened,'' he would say. \n     Darnal's perseverance meant that he became the first Dalit to \n     pass the SLC from his village. That achievement, and the \n     positive reaction it garnered from the upper echelons of \n     society that once treated him as untouchable, gave him the \n     motivation to work harder.\n       But behind every success story, there is a long, hard \n     struggle. Looking at Suvash in his last years, one could \n     never guess that he'd come to Kathmandu with nothing except \n     the fire of convictions. He spent months selling watches \n     immersed in a bucket of water on the Ratna Park roadside. And \n     having made a few contacts here and there, Darnal ventured \n     into writing for small media houses. The ideas for the \n     foundations of the Jagaran Media Centre came in these days. \n     It was to be the largest Dalit-led media outlet in South \n     Asia. Even now, Jagaran media has a radio station that \n     produces a radio magazine that is broadcast throughout India \n     and Nepal.\n       These were turbulent times. By the time the media centre \n     was established and running smoothly, King Gyanendra took \n     over and attempted to reverse the course of history. Public \n     outrage was growing and so was the demand for the return of \n     democracy. At this crucial juncture, Darnal and his close \n     friend founded the Collective Campaign for Peace (COCAP). ``I \n     wanted to play my part in what I knew would be a momentous \n     time in Nepal's history,'' said Darnal. He often recalled \n     those days saying that at the heart of the uprising, it \n     became an unofficial ``secretariat'' for the civil democratic \n     movement in Nepal.\n       It was after this that Darnal set off to undertake the most \n     mammoth of his life's work. He realised that democracy would \n     be of little use to Dalit society unless there was a way to \n     bridge the gap between politics and caste. This was where \n     Darnal's deep frustrations with society resided. The idea \n     that discourse at the policy level was necessary gave way to \n     the Samata Foundation. Initially called the Nepal Center for \n     Dalit Studies, late in 2009, the name was changed and became \n     an officially registered organisation.\n       The Samata Foundation is now the hub of Dalit research. \n     Last year, under Darnal's direction, Samata held Nepal's \n     first ever International Dalit conference. An avid reader and \n     fan of B.R. Ambedkar, Darnal had set out to establish caste-\n     based policies in the country. His book, A Land of Our Own: \n     Conversations with Dalit Members of the Constituent Assembly, \n     came out in 2009. Although enthused by the 2008 elections \n     that ushered in some 40 Dalit Constituent Assembly (CA) \n     members, it didn't take long for Darnal to realise it wasn't \n     going to be enough. He often said that it was only natural \n     that the Dalit CA members wouldn't be educated, but that it \n     was then his task to give them the information and competence \n     to stand out and be clear about their demands. In this \n     endeavour, he decided to publish a Nepali translation of \n     Ambedkar's book. The translation was done by Dalit leader and \n     CA member Aahuti, and was published earlier this year. Darnal \n     held a special prominence in his head and heart for the \n     personality and works of Ambedkar and the translation of the \n     book and its subsequent publishing was a source of joy to \n     him.\n       The Dalit movement has a long history in this country, but \n     with Suvash Darnal it rose to new heights. From raising \n     national awareness to travelling abroad for guest lectures, \n     Darnal had the conviction to make Nepali society aware, not \n     only of the harsh realities of caste, but of the \n     repercussions of its perception in politics and society. \n     Suvash's Samata Foundation was in the process of achieving \n     precisely this. The organisation is now without its founder, \n     and the Dalit movement without a capable leader. The work he \n     undertook was as much professional to him as it was personal, \n     and that's what allowed for his success. Suvash Darnal's \n     close friends refer to him as very much of a family man. And \n     with only a few close friends, he maintained very close ties \n     with his family. He is survived by his wife and two year old \n     daughter.\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5941-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        VETERANS HEALTH CARE FACILITIES CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 2646, as \namended, the Veterans Health Care Facilities Capital Improvement Act of \n2011. I urge our colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, \nwhich would allow for new construction projects in five States and \nPuerto Rico and would extend several VA programs, including vital \nhomeless programs.\n  Last year, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, Public \nLaw 112-10, Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing \nAppropriations Act, and provided an advanced appropriation of fiscal \nyear 2012 funding for veterans' health care. Enacting H.R. 2646, as \namended, would avoid interruptions in VA programs and would allow VA to \nuse the full amount of funding provided through Public Law 112-10.\n  VA has worked tirelessly to get veterans off the streets and into \nhousing. Their efforts are commendable, but there is still work to be \ndone. H.R. 2646, as amended, contains critical extensions to many of \nVA's programs to end homelessness among veterans. This bill would allow \nVA to continue to operate the drop-in resource centers that help \nconnect homeless veterans to services; provide grants to transitional \nhousing programs for the most vulnerable homeless veterans, such as the \nfrail elderly, terminally ill, women with children, and seriously \nmentally ill; and continue its street outreach and emergency care \nservices for homeless veterans. These programs are on the front line of \nVA's services for homeless veterans.\n  One of the best ways to end veteran homelessness is to prevent it \nfrom happening. This bill would support VA's homelessness prevention \nand rapid rehousing programs by extending the Supportive Services for \nVeteran Families Program, a critical resource for stopping homelessness \nbefore it begins. H.R. 2646, as amended, also extends the Homeless \nVeterans' Reintegration Program, which helps homeless veterans find and \nmaintain employment. Extending these programs will decrease the number \nof veterans who may become homeless in these tough economic times.\n  VA has a long list of construction projects that have yet to be \nfunded. H.R. 2646, as amended, would allow VA to make critical upgrades \nto its facilities and infrastructure to ensure that we can provide care \nto veterans in a safe environment. For instance, this bill would allow \nVA to begin a $51 million project to seismically strengthen the nursing \ntower and community living center at the VA Puget Sound Healthcare \nSystem in Seattle, WA. Built in 1985, this building does not meet the \ncurrent seismic code for Washington State. Located in an area of high \nseismic activity, it is vital that this building be upgraded so that \nthe VA Puget Sound Healthcare System can continue to deliver world-\nclass healthcare to veterans in a safe environment.\n  We must allow VA to continue work on projects such as seismic \ncorrections in San Juan, PR; construction of new Polytrauma and Blind \nRehabilitation Centers in Palo Alto, CA; medical center improvements \nand cemetery expansion in St. Louis, MO; and additional parking \nfacilities and nurse education opportunities to ongoing projects in \nFayetteville, AR and Orlando, FL, respectively. Additionally, it would \nauthorize VA to lease space for outpatient clinics in Columbus, GA; \nFort Wayne, IN; Mobile, AL; Salem, OR; San Jose, CA; South Bend, IN; \nand Springfield, MO.\n  This bill helps us honor the legacy of heroic veterans by dedicating \nVA medical facilities in their names. With the endorsement of every \nmember of the Texas congressional delegation, the West Texas VA Health \nCenter in Big Spring, TX, would be renamed in honor of George H. \nO'Brien, a hometown hero. With similar support from the Colorado \nCongressional delegation, the Telehealth Clinic in Craig, CO, would be \nrenamed in honor of MAJ William Edward Adams.\n  Our Nation's veterans have sacrificed much in their service to this \ncountry, we must make sure they receive the care and benefits they \nearned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5941-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MIKE DAVIDSON\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to commend and thank Mike \nDavidson for his decades of extraordinarily dedicated and consequential \nservice to our Nation, most recently as the general counsel for the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence over the past 8 years.\n  Many others have praised the wise, discerning, and sound counsel that \nhas characterized every step of Mike's distinguished career, from his \ntime in the Peace Corps in Kenya in the mid-1960s throughout his \ndecades of service since then: as a litigator for the NAACP Legal \nDefense Fund, as a professor of clinical law at the State University of \nNew York at Buffalo, as chief staff counsel for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia, as the first legal counsel of the \nSenate, and, following his first retirement from the Senate in 1995, as \ncounsel for several important public initiatives--including, most \nprominently, serving as general counsel for the Joint Inquiry into \nIntelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist \nAttacks of September 11, 2001.\n  This exceptionally distinguished record speaks for itself, and in \n2003 it led me to recruit Mike back to full-time service in the Senate. \nAs the Intelligence Committee's vice chairman at the time, I asked Mike \nto serve as the committee's minority counsel, a position he held from \n2003 through 2006. When I became the committee's chairman in 2007, I \nasked Mike to undertake the duties of general counsel. He agreed to \ntake on this role, and he continued to serve me and the committee well \nthroughout the 2 years that I was chairman. After I passed on the gavel \nto Senator Dianne Feinstein in 2009, Mike stayed on for nearly 3 more \nyears, until his quiet retirement earlier this month.\n  Throughout this time on the committee, Mike's calm and unflappable \npresence; his evenhanded, understated, and fair approach to even the \nmost contentious issues; his painstaking attention to detail and \nunfailing memory; and, above all, his dedication to the law and to the \nsecurity interests of the United States, have served this committee and \nour Nation well. Day in and day out, we knew we could rely on Mike's \ncounsel. Whether it was a situation involving routine oversight or a \nmatter of great sensitivity and historical importance--of which there \nwere many during those years, including our investigations into the \nintelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, our efforts \nto end the CIA's coercive interrogations, our drafting and passing the \nlandmark Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act of 2008, \namong others--Mike Davidson's legal acumen and advice were invariably \nexcellent, and also indispensable to the work of the committee.\n  My colleagues and I trusted Mike's judgment implicitly. His example \nof dedicated public service and his exceptional day-to-day performance \non the job earned our respect and admiration, and it inspired a \ngeneration of staff who had the privilege to work alongside him.\n  We will miss Mike dearly, but his legacy will remain a part of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence for years to come. We wish him \nwell in his second retirement, even as we leave the light on for him \njust in case he decides to serve again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5941-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5941-S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize \nSeptember as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Prostate cancer \nis one of the most common types of cancer in men. Approximately one in \nsix men will be diagnosed with this disease during their lifetime and \nit is estimated that over 240,000 men will be diagnosed with and over \n33,000 men will die from the disease this year. While no cure has been \nfound, early detection presents our best chance at saving lives. Public \nawareness of prostate cancer is improving but statistics demonstrate \nthat more can be done to make awareness and early detection of this \ndisease a national priority.\n  The odds of successfully treating this disease improve with early \ndetection, and health experts recommend that men begin receiving yearly \nscreenings at age 50 or sooner for those men at\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\nhigh risk for the disease. In fact, studies have found that \napproximately 98 percent of men diagnosed with early stage prostate \ncancer are still living 10 years later, while only 18 percent of those \ndiagnosed at advanced stages of the disease survive the first decade. \nMore than 2 million men in the United States who have been diagnosed \nwith prostate cancer at some point in their lives are still alive \ntoday. National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is a reminder that \nearly detection is vital in successfully treating this disease and, \nthrough screening, we truly can save lives.\n  I am proud to add my voice to those who are working to fight prostate \ncancer, and I take this opportunity to recognize the families, \nprofessionals and advocates who work day after day to be a powerful \nvoice for prostate cancer patients. I commend them on their tireless \nefforts to raise awareness of the risks, to promote early detection and \ntreatment, and to further our efforts to understand and eliminate this \ndisease. I urge all citizens to promote the use of early detection \nscreening tests and to help advance the search for a cure of prostate \ncancer while supporting those individuals and families who face this \ndevastating disease.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to increase awareness about the \nimportance of early detection in our efforts to defeat prostate cancer \nand express my support for those Americans fighting the battle against \nthis disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5942-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES IMPROVEMENT AND INNOVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Child and \nFamily Services Improvement and Innovation Act, which this Chamber \nadopted late last night by unanimous consent. The bill demonstrates \nthat improving the lives of vulnerable children remains a national \npriority. In the midst of deficit panels and continuing resolutions and \nfear of government shutdown, Congress came together to pass this \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation and that is illustrative of our \nconcern for the needs of children.\n  This legislation also reinforces our recognition of the need for \nflexibility and accountability. We must enable public agencies to be \nresponsible stewards of public funds, manage performance, innovate and \nenhance their ability to achieve positive outcomes. The underlying law \nwe reauthorized could not be more aptly named: Promoting Safe and \nStable Families. I am particularly pleased that this bill continues to \nstress the importance of kinship care. This is something I know a \nlittle bit about. In the 1996 welfare reform bill, I successfully \nfought for the inclusion of an amendment with, Senator Coats, to ensure \nthat relatives be given preference over stranger caregivers when the \nstate determined where to place a child who had been removed from the \nhome. Having worked with senior citizens and with the Gray Panthers \nbefore I came to Congress, I often heard the frustration of \ngrandparents whose grandchildren--as far as they knew--disappeared into \nthe state child protection system and literally vanished from their \nfamilies' lives. I realized the immense potential in making it easier \nfor grandparents and other family members to care for children and \nintroduced legislation to recognize that. We ought to have policies \nthat make it easier, instead of more difficult, for families to come \ntogether to raise their children. And as we continue to rethink our \nchild welfare system, we need to rededicate ourselves to looking to \nfamilies, including extended families, for solutions. When children are \nseparated from their parents, it is usually a painful and traumatic \nexperience. Reading over the Record from that fight in 1996 reminded me \njust how far we have come since then to recognize that fact.\n  The following year, in 1997, other provisions of my kinship bill were \nincluded in the Adoptions and Safe Families Act. And subsequent bills \npassed by this Chamber, including the 2008 Fostering Connections to \nSuccess and Increasing Adoptions Act, furthered our progress promoting \nkinship care by allowing relative caregivers to receive foster care \npayments just as a stranger would. We know that sometimes, all the \ngoodness in a grandparent's heart can't buy their grandchild basketball \nshoes or school books. And I am grateful to Senators Baucus and Hatch \nfor continuing to draw attention to the value of kinship care. The bill \nwe passed last night again moves the ball forward by rewarding States \nfor operating kinship guardianship programs as well as kinship \nnavigator programs that help brothers and sisters stay connected should \nthey enter the child welfare system.\n  Slowly but surely, we are learning what works--and we are learning it \nfrom States. Through innovative approaches like kinship care, we have \ndramatically reduced the number of children in foster care. In roughly \na decade, the number of children in foster care has declined about 20 \npercent, and that's something to be proud of. But we must continue our \ngoal of safely reducing the number of youth in care, while constantly \nasking ourselves, ``what comes next?''\n  Earlier this year I introduced the Promoting Accountability and \nExcellence in Child Welfare Act, legislation that took a number of \nideas from the States and from the advocates and from experts in Oregon \nand around the country for ways to improve the well-being of all \nvulnerable children and their families, just like we did last night. \nAnd one thing we can all agree on is that our Federal spending must \ndrive positive outcomes. It is time we develop some consensus as to \nwhat those outcomes are, though. When we talk about child welfare, we \ntypically measure success in terms of reducing the number of days a \nchild spends in foster care. But what about those children who never \nenter foster care but still are involved in the juvenile justice \nsystem? Or aren't attending class regularly? Or don't have access to \nhealth care? And what about the child that, for one unfortunate reason \nor another, spends the majority of her childhood in foster care and \nages out of that system at age 18? How do we gauge whether we have \nlived up to our responsibility, as a society, of preparing that child \nfor adulthood?\n  My bill gets at these very issues. It seeks to improve the well-being \nof all at risk children and their families by tracking outcomes on the \nindividual level. Importantly, it asks States to be the pioneers by \ntelling us what will work, and then proving it. If we don't check up on \nvulnerable kids until they are in foster care, or worse--until they are \nin the emergency room or in prison--we are missing opportunities not \nonly to save the government money, but missing opportunities to save \nlives and preserve families. My bill also asks for a report to Congress \non recommendations on how to update Federal foster care financing so \nthat eligibility is no longer tied to the obsolete AFDC program.\n  When the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act \npassed out of the Finance Committee earlier this month, I withdrew two \namendments to ensure its passage move quickly. And I was pleased to \nhave the assurances of Chairman Baucus that we could work together to \nfurther explore this idea of child well-being through a roundtable in \nthe Finance Committee as well as take the lead on a request to the GAO \nasking for policy options to modernize Federal child welfare financing. \nI commend the chairman and ranking member as well as congressional \nleadership for their hard work to ensure passage of this bipartisan \nbill and I look forward to continuing to work together to improve the \nlives of vulnerable children and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5942-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5942-S5943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the job market these days is tough. I \nhave heard from countless Rhode Islanders who have worked all their \nlife, but who have lost their jobs and are now struggling to make ends \nmeet. Sadly, many of these jobs have been lost because big companies \nare taking advantage of cheaper labor overseas.\n  We should take action to stop this pattern, and I have introduced \nlegislation to end tax giveaways to companies that ship jobs overseas \nthat I hope we will pass. In the meantime, we need to do everything we \ncan to help those displaced workers get back on their feet.\n  Therefore, I am pleased that the Senate has acted to extend the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program for American workers who have lost their\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\njobs due to the effects of international trade. TAA benefits are \ndesigned to help displaced workers transition back into the job market, \nand that is precisely what we need during this prolonged period of high \nunemployment. In my State of Rhode Island, the unemployment rate has \nbeen over 10 percent for 30 straight months and currently stands at \n10.6 percent.\n  TAA benefits will help advance our economic recovery and get \nAmericans back to work. In the past 2 years, over 1,400 Rhode Islanders \nhave been helped by the job training services provided through, and the \nreadjustment allowances have offered those workers a modest bridge \nuntil they can get back on their feet.\n  I have said throughout the economic downturn that we need to stand up \nfor people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and \nthis is especially true for trade-displaced workers. President Kennedy \nmade this point when he signed TAA into law in 1962. He said then, \nregarding the effects of U.S. trade policy on our workers, that ``those \ninjured . . . should not be required to bear the full brunt of the \nimpact. Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in \npart by the federal government.''\n  I know that American workers can compete and succeed in the global \nmarkets when given a level playing field. But for too long, our policy \nhas been to encourage cheaper imports from countries with lax \nenvironmental standards and few protections for their workers.\n  TAA benefits help workers in the manufacturing and service sectors to \nadjust to a rapidly changing global economy. This legislation will \nensure that this help remains available, especially with so many people \nstill out of work in Rhode Island and throughout the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5943-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   BECHTEL BWX TECHNOLOGIES IDAHO LLC\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I recognize Bechtel BWX \nTechnologies Idaho LLC's, BBWI, legacy at the Advanced Mixed Waste \nTreatment Project, AMWTP.\n  Under the leadership of Jeff Mousseau, appointed manager of the \nproject in November 2007, and with the commitment and dedication of the \nskilled workforce, the AMWTP has flourished. Jeff Mousseau led the \nBechtel team efficiently and safely to exceed benchmarks. AMWTP went \nfrom being 3 years behind to more than 3 years ahead of scheduled \nrequirements to move waste out of Idaho. No other site in the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, DOE, Complex has enabled the permanent disposal \nof as much radioactive waste at the DOE Waste Isolation Pilot Plant \nmore safely and compliantly than AMWTP.\n  The company's dedicated employees have achieved a record of removing \nthe waste safely. BBWI employees have worked more than 12.4 million \nhours and 2,839 days without a lost-time injury. In 2010 and 2008, the \ncompany earned national safety awards that included an Occupational \nExcellence Award, Perfect Record Award, Safety Leadership Award and \nMillion Hours Worked Award. In 2007, the company earned the first-ever \nIntegrated Safety Management Systems verification following assumption \nof the AMWTP contract.

ROBB BRADY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \ndistinguished Idahoan, J. Robb Brady. I join his family and friends in \nmourning his passing and paying tribute to his legacy.\n  Robb Brady is well known for his work as a journalist and publisher \nof the Idaho Falls Post Register, my hometown newspaper. Starting at \nthe Post Register in 1941, he advanced in his field and served as \npublisher for more than 10 years. Throughout his career, he was a \nrespected and knowledgeable voice. He earned a reputation as being a \nprofessional and principled journalist who was devoted to his wife of \n69 years, Rose, his family, work and community. His talent and \ndedication have been noted by many who worked with him. He was also \nknown for being humble, committed and compassionate.\n  In addition to his exemplary hard work, Robb Brady demonstrated a \ncommitment to the community and maintaining Idaho's natural resources. \nHe supported local charitable efforts, including his purchase and \ndonation of the Idaho Fall's Haven shelter. As an outdoorsman, who \nbackpacked and camped with his family, Robb Brady had an appreciation \nfor our natural resources, and he worked to conserve them.\n  With Robb Brady's passing, we have lost a kind and valued member of \nour community, but his example will not be forgotten. He has left an \nindelible mark in the lives of the many people who knew him, worked \nwith him and learned from him. I extend my condolences and prayers to \nhis family, friends and loved ones. Robb Brady's legacy will endure as \na significant contribution to Idaho's strength and history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5943-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5943-S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JUDGE GREENE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to note a special \noccasion next week, the unveiling of a portrait at the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for Veterans Claims to honor a dedicated public servant and a \nkeen legal mind, Judge William P. Greene, Jr.\n  Judge Greene is a prime example of an American who has dedicated \nhimself to the well being of our country and its veterans. He was born \nin Bluefield, WV, a small coal town in the Appalachian mountains. His \ngrandfather worked on the rail cars transporting coal, but also was a \nschool teacher and instilled in his family the value of education and \nhard work. Judge Greene's father continued that example, working on the \nrailroads while pursuing a degree from Bluefield State College--an \ninstitution originally founded to train African-American teachers who \nwould then instruct in the segregated schools. Judge Greene's parents \nboth graduated from that institution and went on to teach in their \ncommunity. His father was then drafted after the attack on Pearl Harbor \nand went on to become a commissioned officer and serve with the famed \n``Buffalo Soldiers''--the only African American infantry unit to see \ncombat in Europe during World War II. Judge Greene's affinity and pride \nfor the Buffalo Soldiers became a life-long passion, as demonstrated by \nhis involvement in the construction and dedication of the Buffalo \nSoldier Monument in Fort Leavenworth, KS. In the portrait being \nunveiled, one of Judge Greene's many Buffalo Soldier paintings can be \nseen in the background.\n  As a result of his father's military career, Judge Greene moved a \nnumber of times during his formative years, and learned from an early \nage to get along with a wide variety of people under varying \ncircumstances. He subsequently put those skills and abilities to good \nuse as a citizen, a servicemember, and a leader in the legal field.\n  Before joining the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Judge \nGreene graduated with a bachelor of arts in political science from West \nVirginia State College, where he participated in Army ROTC and accepted \nan\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\nArmy Commission. He was designated to serve with the Armor Branch, but \nwhile awaiting orders to jump school, Judge Greene was offered \nacceptance to the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps on the \ncondition that he take the LSAT and be admitted to a law school which \nwas scheduled to start in just a few weeks. Three years later he \nreceived his law degree from Howard University School of Law, passed \nthe West Virginia Bar, and became an officer in the Army JAG Corps. He \nmarried his West Virginia childhood sweetheart and spent the next 25 \nyears serving his country and gaining lifelong respect for the men and \nwomen in uniform. He received countless awards and honors for his \nservice and expertise in both the law and the military, and he \nrepeatedly demonstrated his great ability to bridge racial tensions and \nbrings more African Americans into the Judge Advocate General's Corps.\n  As he is known to say when speaking publically, one of Judge Greene's \nlife mottos is: ``When opportunity knocks, you can't say `wait, let me \npack my bags.' '' So when in 1993 another opportunity presented itself, \nGreene took it, and left the Army to serve as an immigration judge for \nthe U.S. He worked tirelessly in that position, handling thousands of \nimmigration matters in the 3 years he served in that capacity.\n  Then, opportunity knocked again. It was a proud day in 1997, when \nPresident Clinton appointed Judge Greene to the Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims. Until 1988, the Veterans Administration, now the U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, was the only Federal agency that was \nnot subject to judicial review. In a long overdue decision, the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs created the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims with my full support. Veterans deserved judicial \noversight and the creation of the court was a major accomplishment \nduring his first term in the Senate. As a skilled attorney and a \nveteran, Judge Greene brought a keen understanding of veterans' issues \nto the bench. He served as the court's chief judge from 2005 to 2010, \nand was known for his character and leadership during a time of \ntremendous growth and change at the court.\n  Although he officially retired last year, his commitment to hard work \ncontinues and Judge Greene currently serves as a senior judge on the \nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Judge William P. Greene, Jr., is \na soldier, a jurist, and an American to be respected, and I am proud to \nrecognize and honor his service today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5944-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5944-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/23/senate-section/article/S5944-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:14 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2608) to \nprovide for an additional temporary extension of programs under the \nSmall Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and \nfor other purposes, with an amendment, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate.\n  The message also announced that the House agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A bill to restore the financial solvency of the United \nStates Postal Service and to ensure the efficient and affordable \nnationwide delivery of mail; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Postal \nReform Act of 2011, which will restore the financial health and long-\nterm viability of the United States Postal Service, USPS. This bill is \nthe companion to the bill Representative Issa introduced in the House \nof Representatives in June of this year. I would like to thank him for \nhis leadership on this important issue.\n  According to the USPS, by 2020, they are expecting to face up to a \n$238 billion shortfall. Even with dramatic cost savings of $12 billion \nand workforce reduction of 110,000 postal employees in the past four \nyears, the Postal Service is expected to end this fiscal year with a \n$10 billion loss.\n  First-Class mail, which makes up more than half of the Postal Service \nrevenues, continues to fall at alarming rates and shows no signs of \never recovering. This combined with 80 percent labor costs and labor \ncontracts that contain ``no-layoff' clauses points to the fact that the \nPostal Service is broken.\n  Congress can no longer enact temporary fixes that avert financial \ncrisis for only a brief period. Congress, the Postal Service, labor \nunions, and the mailing community must be willing to lay everything on \nthe table and make hard choices now to save the Postal Service for the \nfuture. I believe the Postal Reform Act of 2011 will do just that.\n  Two key provisions in this bill alone would save the Postal Service \nbillions of dollars annually. First, the bill would create a Postal \nService Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, \nwhich is modeled after the District of Columbia control board Congress \ncreated to address the fiscal crises the city was facing in the mid \n1990s. This authority, triggered by a USPS default on its Federal \nobligations, would replace the Postal Board of Governors with mandates \nto cut costs, and put the USPS back on the path to financial solvency.\n  The second key provision would create a Commission on Postal \nReorganization that would use a BRAC like process to consolidate and \nclose post offices and mail processing facilities. According to the \nPostal Service the ``current mail processing network has a capacity of \nover 250 billion pieces of mail per year when mail volume is now 160 \nbillion pieces of mail. Right-sizing the network is vital to the future \nof the Postal Service and its customers.'' Congress, however, continues \nto put up political road blocks that prevent these closings and \nconsolidations. This proposal will take the politics out of the process \nand allow the USPS to right-size its operations.\n  Other provisions in the bill would require arbitrators to take into \naccount the financial health of the Postal Service if labor contracts \nmove to arbitration. It would also exempt USPS from the Davis-Bacon \nAct, the Service Contract Act, and other wage rules that increase USPS \ncontracting costs.\n  The bill would require certain types of mail that Postal Service \nloses money on to cover their cost. In Fiscal year 2010, USPS lost \nnearly $1.7 billion on these type of ``underwater'' postal products \nthat failed to cover their costs. For example, the Periodicals class of \nmail, which includes newspapers and magazines, has not covered its \ncosts for 14 consecutive years, generating total losses of $4.3 billion \nover that period.\n  The bill also contains common sense language that would mandate that \nUSPS employees pay the same health and life insurance premium \npercentage as other Federal workers. This is estimated to save the \nPostal Service $700 million annually.\n  Finally, this bill will allow the Postal Service to move to 5-day \ndelivery, at a savings of anywhere from $1.7 to $3.1 billion annually.\n  We can no longer choose to support temporary fixes to the Postal \nService. If we continue to act in this irresponsible way, the American \ntaxpayer will be the one that ultimately suffers in the form of higher \npostage prices and taxpayer bailouts. We must make hard choices now so \nfuture generations of Americans will have a viable Postal Service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. \n        Coons):\n  S. 1628. A bill to provide for improvements in the Federal hiring \nprocess, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Carper, Cardin, \nand Coons, I am introducing the Federal Hiring Process Improvement Act \nof 2011. This bill will help agencies fix the broken recruitment and \nhiring process in the Federal Government. I am pleased that \nRepresentative Sarbanes is also introducing a companion bill in the \nHouse today and I thank him for his work and his commitment to the \nFederal workforce.\n  Every day, talented people interested in working for their government \nare turned away from Federal service because of the frustrating and \nantiquated hiring process. Too many Federal agencies have built \nbarriers for new workers, done too little to recruit the right \ncandidates, and invented an evaluation process that discourages \nqualified candidates.\n  In the past, many agencies have tried to find exceptions to the \ncompetitive hiring process, rather than making sure the competitive \nprocess works. The competitive hiring process should be our most \neffective tool to ensure that the Federal workforce is composed of the \nmost qualified and able individuals, who are appointed through a fair \nand open process that is free from political interference. As agencies \nface budget reductions and restricted hiring, it is critical that they \nare able to attract top-notch candidates who are up to the challenge of \nmeeting agency missions with limited resources. We must strengthen the \ncompetitive hiring process so that agencies do not look for ways to \navoid it.\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, I have \nheld multiple hearings on the hiring process and worked closely with \nthe administration on its reform efforts. While the administration has \nbeen making some good progress, we still hear stories of talented \nindividuals who seek employment with the Federal Government, only to \ngrow frustrated with the archaic hiring process and find work \nelsewhere.\n  Applying for a job in the Federal Government should be accessible and \nstraightforward. Agencies still require too much information upfront \nfrom candidates instead of an approach that requires more information \nas the employee moves through the process. The Federal Hiring Process \nImprovement Act will require agencies to streamline their hiring \npractices. Agencies will be required to stop using the dreaded \n``knowledge, skills, and ability'' essays and accept resumes and cover \nletters, as is standard in the private sector. Additionally, the bill \nrequires job postings to be written in plain writing, so that \ncandidates can readily understand what the job is and how to apply, and \ncandidates would be notified of their status at key points in the \nprocess. Agencies will have to speed their hiring processes to average \nno more than 80 days.\n  Agencies need to continuously reassess their needs and strategies in \norder to maximize their recruitment and hiring efforts. This bill \nrequires agencies to develop strategic workforce plans that include \nhiring projections and identify critical skills gaps. It also requires \nagencies to measure the effectiveness of hiring efforts and reforms.\n  The Federal Government is the largest employer in the United States, \nand Federal service is a noble profession. Within the next 5 years, the \nFederal Government is expected to face one of the largest retirement \nwaves in the Nation's history, making the development of a new \ngeneration of workers even more vital. Agency leadership must make \nreforming the recruitment and hiring process a top priority. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important bill.\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1628\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 282, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 282) to authorize testimony in \n     Kanelos v. Mohave, et al., and Zanna, et al. v. Mohave \n     County, et al.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony in related civil actions pending in Arizona Federal district \ncourt. In these actions, plaintiffs claim that Arizona local officials \nhosting a Senator McCain town hall meeting allegedly violated \nplaintiffs' rights by prohibiting their distribution of political \nliterature at the meeting and subsequently enacting a policy limiting \nthe use of county facilities to the conduct of official government \nbusiness. The defendants have requested a declaration from a member of \nSenator McCain's staff who witnessed relevant events. Senator McCain \nwould like to cooperate with this request. This resolution would \nauthorize testimony in connection with these actions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider laid upon the \ntable, without any intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 282) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 282\n\n       Whereas, in the cases of Kanelos v. County of Mohave, et \n     al., Civ. No. 10-8099 (D. Ariz.) and Zanna, et al. v. Mohave \n     County, et al., Civ. No. 10-8149 (D. Ariz.), pending in \n     federal district court in Arizona, the defendants have \n     requested that a declaration be submitted by Gina Gormley, an \n     employee of Senator John McCain;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from \n     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate; \n     and\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate may promote the \n     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action \n     as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the \n     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, \n     That Gina Gormley is authorized to testify in the cases of \n     Kanelos v.
