I am supportive of that. It is an \nissue where I think we should not try to fix something in that area of \npatent reform that is not broken. But the patent reform bill is \nimportant. We have 750,000 patents that have been applied for, and \nthere has been no response from the Patent Office.\n  One of the big issues we had was how we are going to pay for this, \nthe work they have to do. We had a novel idea. Senator Coburn, it is my \nunderstanding, came up with the idea first: have the Patent Office pay \nfor it with the applications people file. That money would go to the \nPatent Office to get rid of that backlog.\n  In the past, as I understand it, those moneys have gone to the \ngeneral fund. So that issue was going to be a big debatable issue on \nthis bill. But there was a bipartisan agreement that we should take \ncare of that. That is in the managers' package. So that is good.\n  So the other issue is on the first-to-file. Senator Feinstein offered \nthat amendment. We will have a vote on that as soon as we can. I would \nhope if there are other amendments, we can get to them quickly.\n  There will be a period of morning business from 2 to 4 p.m. today. \nThe majority will control the first hour, and the Republicans will \ncontrol the next hour.\n  Senators should expect rollcall votes in relation to amendments on \nthe America Invents Act to occur throughout the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1171-7", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for 2 years now Washington Democrats \nhave taken fiscal recklessness to new\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nheights. They have spent trillions of dollars we do not have on things \nwe do not need and cannot afford. The amount of red ink Democrats plan \nto rack up this year alone would exceed all the debt run up by the \nFederal Government from its inception through 1984.\n  This recklessness is the reason we have seen a national uprising \nagainst their policies. Americans have demanded we reverse this \nrecklessness and restore balance. Democrats have resisted at every \nturn.\n  To conceal the extent of their spending plans, they did not even pass \na budget last year. After a nationwide repudiation of their policies in \nNovember, they proposed a massive spending bill loaded with new \nspending that amounted to a slap in the face to the voters.\n  Following the outrage that provoked, they tried to get a spending \nfreeze past the public. They said: How about we just lock in place the \nout-of-control spending levels we set last year?\n  To them, this entire debate is not about how to respond to the \nAmerican people. It is about seeing what they can get away with.\n  Well, Republicans have taken a different approach. Responding to our \nconstituents, we have insisted the status quo simply will not cut it \nanymore. We have insisted on actually shrinking the size of government. \nAnd yesterday we delivered, by forcing the first actual cut in \ngovernment spending in recent memory.\n  While it was just a small first step, yesterday we showed it is \nactually possible to change the status quo in Washington. Not bad.\n  What about the White House? The White House responded to all of this \nby announcing they want to have a meeting. We are happy to go to the \nmeeting, but putting a meeting on the schedule does not change the fact \nthat neither the White House nor a single Democrat in Congress has \nproposed a plan that would allow the government to remain open and that \nwould respond to the voters by reining in spending.\n\n  All we get is talk. The President made an audacious assertion \nyesterday after the 2-week CR was passed. He said he wants his advisers \nto come up with a plan that ``makes sure we are living within our \nmeans.'' Live within our means?\n  Let me remind you, Mr. President, that the President's budget has us \namassing a national debt of more than $20 trillion within the next 5 \nyears--amassing a national debt of over $20 trillion within the next 5 \nyears. We are projected to spend this year $1.6 trillion this year more \nthan we are taking in. That is a $1.6 trillion deficit this year.\n  Does this mean we can expect the President's Budget Director to \npresent us with a piece of paper that outlines $1.6 trillion in cuts \nfor the current fiscal year? If so, that is great news.\n  If the President's measure of success, as he said, is a plan that \nmakes sure we actually live within our means, the way most people do, \ncount on me showing up early for this meeting. Unfortunately, I suspect \nthe President is once again just saying something he thinks people want \nto hear.\n  The fact is, if Democrats had a plan of their own that would cut one \ndollar in spending, I think we would have seen it by now. But we have \nnot. Democrats have abdicated all responsibility for their own \nrecklessness over the last 2 years. They have left us to do something \nabout it.\n  We made a step in the right direction yesterday after months of \nresistance on their part. Now we look forward to their plan. It is time \nfor Democrats to present a serious plan of their own that addresses \nthis crisis. It is time for Democrats to take the concerns of the \nAmerican people seriously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1172-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor another great \nFederal employee and a constituent of mine from Fredericksburg, VA.\n  As we debate this week and over the coming weeks about making sure \nthe Federal Government stays open, I think it is important to realize \nwhat we are talking about are the real lives of many of our great \nFederal employees who provide the services day-in and day-out to make \nsure many important public purposes are served.\n  I know the Presiding Officer realizes this is an initiative that our \nformer colleague, the Senator from Delaware, started. I was proud, when \nSenator Kaufman moved on, to pick up that mantle on a regular basis, \ncoming to the floor of the Senate to recognize Federal employees who \nvery often, in an unsung way, do great things for our country.\n  The Federal employee I am going to recognize is someone who the \nPresiding Officer, who I know, spends a lot of time in the air, coming \nfrom the great State of New Mexico, will be particularly interested in. \nMy colleague, the Senator from Illinois, who is also present, spends a \nlot of time in the air as well. That is the subject of what we will \ntalk about today.\n  Nearly 2 million people in the United States take to the skies every \nday. Once in flight, their safety relies on the diligent work of \nindividuals responsible for ensuring that airplanes are well-designed \nand safe. When we reach our destination, as we often do, it is because \nof their tireless work.\n  In the rare moments when accidents happen, we rely on individuals \nlike Robert Benzon who possess the skill and innovative thinking to \nfind the cause of the accident and ensure we don't make the same \nmistake twice.\n  Robert Benzon is a senior air safety investigator with the National \nTransportation Safety Board. His job is to investigate aircraft \naccidents. He analyzes the equipment and data, identifies the cause of \nthe accident and makes recommendations to the industry on how to \nimprove safety.\n  He began his career flying combat missions in Vietnam as an Air Force \npilot. In 1984, he went to work for the National Transportation Safety \nBoard in Chicago.\n  Over his 25-year career, he has served as the lead investigator in \nseveral high-profile cases and is considered the best in his field. \nMore than 80 percent of his team's recommendations have been adopted by \nthe industry.\n  In 1996, Mr. Benzon led the investigation of the TWA flight 800 crash \nin the Atlantic Ocean. His investigation following this crash led to \nthe recommendation that oxygen contained in aircraft fuel tanks be \nreplaced with another nonburning gas, like Nitrogen, to prevent fuel \ntank explosions.\n  In 2001, Mr. Benzon led the investigation of the fatal crash of \nAmerican Airlines flight 587 in Queens, NY. His investigation led to an \nindustry-wide redesign of the rudder system, as well as changes to the \npilot training program for similar aircrafts.\n  Mr. Benzon also led the investigation of U.S. Airways flight 1549, \nknown nationwide as the ``Miracle on the Hudson,'' which made Captain \nSullenberger a household name. His investigation included an analysis \nof the engine damage and black box flight recorders,\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\ninterviews with the pilots, cabin crew, air traffic controllers and \npassengers, and meetings with the manufacturers of both the airplane \nand its engines.\n  Mr. Benzon has also been a strong advocate for the collection of more \nin-flight data points from flight recorder black boxes, which he \nbelieves is critical to understanding what exactly may have gone wrong \nduring a flight. His efforts have led to a significant increase in \ndata: from less than 10 data points collected in-flight to over 1,000.\n  In an interview, Mr. Benzon said, ``[My work] is a way of giving \nback--I get a good feeling after every one of these investigations is \nover. It's service to the country.''\n  It is this sentiment that inspires me to highlight great Federal \nemployees on the Senate floor. There are countless Federal employees \nwho dedicate their lives to making the rest of our lives better and \nsafer.\n  Each day we set foot on an airplane and arrive safely at our \ndestination, we have Robert Benzon and his team to thank. I hope that \nmy Senate colleagues will join me in honoring Robert Benzon and all \nthose at the National Transportation Safety Board for their dedicated \nservice and important contribution to our Nation's aviation safety.\n  I know Senators share the regard for this Federal employee and the \nmany others who make our country a better place. It is my hope that in \nthe coming weeks we can come to some resolution so these Federal \nemployees can know that for the balance of this fiscal year the Federal \nGovernment will stay in operation and that they can continue to do \ntheir work.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1173-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1173-S1174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SOMALI PIRATES\n\n  Mr. KIRK. With the cold-blooded murder of four Americans by pirates, \nour country faces a dangerous enemy as old as the second Washington \nadministration and the earliest days of the U.S. Navy.\n  This danger now stretches across our vital oil supply lanes and \nthreatens not just Americans handing out Bibles at Indian Ocean ports \nof call but our vital supply of energy. I think it is time to recall \nthe tough choices made by the Jefferson administration to suppress the \n21st century's pirates in this new chapter.\n  We may forget that as much as 10 percent of all Federal revenues were \npaid by the Washington administration to the Barbary pirates operating \nin what became Libya. Payments continued under the Adams and Jefferson \nadministrations, but as always with kidnappers and pirates, ransoms \nonly led to more danger on the high seas.\n  In 1801, President Thomas Jefferson decided that payments of tribute \nto the Barbary States in exchange for the safe passage of American \nshipping vessels had gone far enough. Over the next 5 years, Jefferson \nsent the new U.S. Navy--ironically built over his objection--to attack \nand defeat the pirates. In the conflict that followed, new American \nheroes were made, especially Captain Stephen Decatur. Decatur's \nexploits were dangerous and involved close quarters in combat. In his \nhonor, my State of Illinois named one of its major cities after him, \nplacing his statue in the city's center.\n  In the end, piracy was defeated and the flag of the United States was \nnot strongly challenged by pirates until this century.\n  In the wake of the murder of four Americans by Somali pirates, we \nneed to recall Jefferson's policy under what I would call the ``Decatur \nInitiative'' against Indian Ocean pirates.\n  Since 2006, pirates attacked more and more vessels. There were over \n400 attacks just last year. According to the New York Times, the \nmodern-day pirates of the 21st century currently hold 50 vessels and \nmore than 800 hostages. According to the International Maritime Bureau, \npirates murdered 379 people with an additional 199 individuals reported \nmissing between 1993 and 2009.\n  According to reports, the typical pirate ransom in 2005 was between \n$100,000 and $200,000. By 2008, the average ransom grew to between \n$500,000 ad $2 million. One year later, in 2009, the average ransom \nreportedly grew again to a range between $1.5 million and $3.5 million, \nIn late 2010, ransoms now hover around $4 million per vessel. Ransom \npayments as large as $9.5 million for a tanker carrying crude oil have \nalso been reported by the media.\n  Recently, pirates captured a supertanker worth $200 million carrying \n2 million barrels of oil bound for the U.S. Its ransom may become the \nmother load for pirates to extend their reach across the Indian Ocean \nand into the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. We would be naive not to expect \nprofits from piracy will not be used to support terrorism against the \nWest.\n  The Horn of Africa is of crucial importance, not only to the U.S. \neconomy, but also to the global market as it serves as a major artery \nof international shipping. The oil tankers that cruise these waters \nprovide much of the world's energy supply and we cannot risk the safety \nof those shipments. This region is a potential incubator for the growth \nof two burgeoning al Qaida franchises: al Qaida in the Islamic Magreb, \nAQIM, and Somalia's al-Shabaab group, which has pledged its loyalty to \nOsama bin Laden.\n  Yesterday, I raised this issue with our Secretary of State, Hillary \nClinton. She hinted that our policy may be changing and that is welcome \nnews. I asked, ``if we can't be tough on pirates, who can we be tough \non?''\n  Today, I am announcing the start of an effort here in the Senate to \ndraft legislation and support administration action along the lines of \nJefferson's policy on pirates.\n  These legislative concepts shall be collectively referred to as the \n``Decatur Initiative,'' Decatur, whose most daring mission involved \nrecapturing the U.S.S. Philadelphia from pirates.\n  The time has come for us to advance the following: 1. A defined \n``Pirate Exclusion Zone'' that would allow the immediate boarding and/\nor sinking of any vessel from Somalia not approved and certified for \nsea by allied forces; 2. an expedited legal regime permitting trial and \ndetention of pirates captured on the high seas; 3. a blockade of \npirate-dominated ports like Hobyo, Somalia; 4. broad powers and \nauthority to on-scene commanders to attack or arrest pirates once \noutside Somalia's 12-mile territorial limit--this would include the \nsummary sinking of pirate ships if a local commander deems it \nwarranted.\n  Additionally, I will explore actions to attack the financial links \nbetween pirates and the terrorist groups such as al Shabaab and target \npirates with financial sanctions in the same way as other terrorist \nnetworks.\n  In the wake of the recent tragedy in the Arabian Sea, where American \nmissionaries were gunned down in cold blood, I am hopeful that many of \nmy colleagues will be willing to join me in taking bold action against \nthe pirates who have been operating in the waters off East Africa. It \nis ironic that the United States and our allies station substantial \nnaval forces against pirates in this region but take little aggressive \naction against them. While the pirates have substantial strength on the \nground in Somalia, once they're put to sea, we can be their masters and \nthey have very weak means to oppose us. A set of vessels blockading \npirate-dominated ports with aggressive orders to attack and sink any \nvessel leaving Somalia should make quick work of pirate operations.\n  The cost of oil and the price of gas is high enough. Further \nincreases could endanger our slowly recovering economy. As part of the \neffort to stabilize the price of gas in America, we need to recover \nJefferson's policy and attack and defeat Somali pirates as soon as they \nleave Somalia's territorial waters.\n  In addition, as this body begins to finalize spending legislation for \nthe remainder of the year, I would like to highlight the growing danger \nto the U.S. economy and our country.\n  We all know that the national debt now tops $14 trillion but we \nshould note that this means we are adding $35 billion to our debts each \nweek or over $5 billion borrowed each day.\n  That $4 billion cut represents just .3 percent of this year's annual \ndeficit or just three one-hundredths of 1 percent\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\nof the current money we owe. The famous Harvard economic historian \nNiall Ferguson said you can mark the decline of a country when it pays \nmore money to its lenders than to its army. We have already crossed \nthat point. This year the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \ninterest payments we will pay to our money lenders will top $225 \nbillion. That is more than the cost of our Army, which we currently \nestimate costs about $195 billion, or our Air Force, which we estimate \ncosts $201 billion, or even our Navy, which will cost $217 billion this \nyear.\n  Our money lender costs now are higher than the entire gross domestic \nproduct of the country of Denmark, at $201 billion. We must pay $4 \nbillion per week in interest or $616 million per day to our money \nlenders. What is worse, interest payments are expected to more than \ndouble over the next decade and will top $778 billion. That means soon \nwe will have to pay our money lenders more than it costs to operate our \nArmy, Navy, and Air Force combined at $623 billion.\n  Remember also that interest payments on the debt are a form of wealth \ntransfer from hard-working middle-class Americans who pay Federal taxes \nto wealthy lenders, many of whom live abroad. For those in the Senate \nwho are opposing budget constraints put in by the House, we should \nforce them to admit that they are either for higher taxes for the \nAmerican people or more borrowing that transfers wealth from hard-\nworking middle-class Americans to high-income money lenders, most of \nwhom now live abroad.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. KIRK. I withhold.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to speak on the pending business \nbefore the Senate. We are hoping in maybe 45 minutes or so we will \nactually be able to vote on the Feinstein amendment to the patent bill. \nI am hoping that my colleagues will vote against the Feinstein \namendment and support the authors of the legislation.\n  I noted yesterday that every version of the patent bill from 2005 \nforward has included the primary, centerpiece reform of the bill, which \nis the so-called first-to-file system. It may seem strange, but it has \nnot been the case before this bill that you have a patent's priority \nfrom when you file it; that is to say, the first person to file on the \npatent is the one who has the patent; that the patent dates to the day \nit is filed. That is what we do in law and virtually every other \nsituation I can imagine.\n  Instead, what has been the law is called the first-to-invent system. \nOne of the reasons the whole patent reform movement began 5 or 6 years \nago was that this system is very costly and difficult to administer \nbecause it relies on a lot of legal discovery and legal process to \nresolve questions or disputes between who actually conceived of the \nidea first and then did they apply the necessary diligence to get it \npatented. As a result, every other industrialized country uses the \nfirst-to-file system. Most of the companies in the United States are \nobviously used to that system because of their patents that are \nworldwide in scope.\n  The fundamental reform of the patent legislation to simplify, to \nreduce costs, to reduce the potential for litigation was to conform our \nsystem to that of the rest of the world--the first-to-file system.\n  What the Feinstein amendment would do is to throw that over and say: \nNo, we are going to go back to the concept of this first-to-conceive-\nof-the-idea or first-to-invent notion. Whether intended or not, that \nwill kill the bill. It is a poison pill amendment because the whole \nconcept of the legislation and everything that follows from it is based \non this first-to-file reform.\n  As I will note a little bit later, the bill simply would not work \notherwise. We would have to scrap it and start from scratch. In fact, \nmost of the reforms that are in the bill would not exist because we \nwould have to go back to that concept of first-to-invent. So all of the \nsavings and simplified procedures would simply not be possible.\n  Unfortunately, I note that if my colleagues have any notion of \nsupporting the Feinstein amendment, they should realize that were it to \nbe adopted, it would kill the bill. I do not think that is what we want \nto do. There have been so many improvements made in the bill. So many \ngroups--all three of the major groups that have been working on the \nlegislation are in support of the legislation and oppose the Feinstein \namendment because they want us to move forward. We have not had patent \nreform in many years. Everybody recognizes it is time.\n  First and foremost, the administration and the Patent Office itself \nsupport the legislation and oppose the Feinstein amendment. In fact, \none of the good changes made by the bill from the Patent Office's point \nof view is that it will stop fee diversion. In the past, the fees that \nhave been collected, the filing fees from the inventors, have not all \ngone to the Patent Office. They are woefully understaffed and \nunderfunded in working through the tens and hundreds of thousands of \npatent applications that are filed every year.\n  As we can all appreciate, our competitiveness in the world depends, \nfirst, on the ability of our people to invent and, second, to acquire \nthe legal rights to those inventions so they have a property interest \nin them, and investors can then count on a return of their investment \nif they supply the capital for the invention to be brought to market.\n  What we are talking about is critical. I urge my colleagues who \nperhaps have not focused as much on this amendment and on the patent \nreform legislation to understand that we are talking about something \nvery important, something that can create jobs, that is important to \nthe competitiveness of our country.\n  The beauty is, unlike a lot of what we do around here, this is \ntotally bipartisan. I am a Republican. The administration supports the \nlegislation. It has Senator Leahy's name on it as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. In the House, it is supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans. It is important we move this legislation through.\n  As I said, unfortunately, the Feinstein amendment would result in \nhaving to scrap the bill. There is no point in enacting it if we are \nnot going to include the change to first to file.\n  Let me be a little more specific. One of the reasons we would not be \nable to move forward with the bill is the bill's entire post-grant \nreview process, which is a big part of the bill, would be impossible \nfor the Patent Office to administer under the discovery-intensive \ninvention date issues that arise under the first-to-invent system. That \nis because, as I said, under that system you come before the Patent \nOffice and say: I realize nobody else had a record of this, but I \nactually thought of this idea way back in 1999. I have a couple of \nnotes that I made to myself. I dated them. One can see that all of a \nsudden they are getting into a big discovery and legal process. That is \nwhat we are trying to get away from. The whole post-grant review \nprocess would be turned upside down if we went back to the first-to-\ninvent principle.\n  Also, striking the first-to-file provisions would greatly increase \nthe workload for the Patent and Trademark Office. What we are trying to \ndo is simplify procedures so they can get their work done, get the \npatents approved so our businesses can better compete in the world, and \nalso provide more money for them to do that job. That also would be \njeopardized as a result of this amendment. We will just add backlogs \nand delays and not enable our Patent Office to do what we are asking it \nto do.\n\n  As I said, that is one of the reasons the Patent Office opposes the \nFeinstein amendment and supports the underlying legislation. It is \ninteresting; many American companies already use first-to-file. It is \nthe easiest, most direct way to confirm you have the patent. It is very \nhard to win a patent contest through what is called an interference \nproceeding if you were not the first to file, which, of course, is \nlogical. And because all the other countries in\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\nthe world use a first-to-file system, if you want your patent to be \nvalid outside the United States you need to comply with first-to-file \nin any event.\n  Among many of our most innovative companies, 70 percent of their \nlicensing revenues come from overseas. Obviously, they are already \ngoing to be complying with the first-to-file rules. This bill does not, \ntherefore, so much switch the system with which Americans are complying \ntoday as it simply allows American companies to only have to comply \nwith one system rather than two. As I said before, the first-to-file \nconcept is clearer, faster, more transparent, and provides more \ncertainty to inventors and manufacturers.\n  On the other hand, the first-to-invent concept would make it \nimpossible, in many instances, to know who has priority and which of \nthe competing patents is the valid one. To determine who has priority \nunder first to invent, extensive discovery must be conducted and the \nPatent Office and courts must examine notebooks and other evidence to \ndetermine who conceived of the invention first and whether the inventor \nthen diligently reduced it to practice.\n  Under first-to-file, on the other hand, an inventor can get priority \nby filing a provisional application. This is an important point. It is \neasy. It is not as if the first-to-file is hard to do. This provisional \napplication, which only costs $110 for the small inventor, only \nrequires you to write a description of what your invention is and how \nit works. That is all. That is the same thing that an inventor's \nnotebook would have to contain under the first-to-invent concept if you \nare ever going to prevail in court by proving your invention date.\n  Because a provisional application is a government document, the date \nis clear. There is no opportunity for fraudulently backdating the \ninvention date. There is no need for expensive discovery: What did the \ninventor know and when did he know it? You are essentially not \nrequiring anything in addition. You file a provisional application. You \nhave an entire year to get all of your work together and file your \ncompleted application, but your date is as of the time you file the \nprovisional application.\n  As I said, for a small entity, the fee is only $110. That grace \nperiod makes it clear that the patent will not be invalid because of \ndisclosures made by the inventor or someone who got information from an \ninventor during 1 year before filing. That is important.\n  A lot of academics and folks go to trade shows and begin talking \nabout their concepts and what they have done. If you disclose this, you \nhave a year to file after you disclose the information. And under the \nbill's second, enhanced grace period, no other disclosure, regardless \nof whether it was obtained from the inventor, can then invalidate the \ninvention.\n  The bill has been very carefully written to protect the small \ninventor or the academic. That is what it is designed to do. This is \nnot a case of big versus small, although people both big and small \nsupport the legislation. If anybody suggests the Feinstein amendment \nwill protect the small inventor, it does not protect the small \ninventor. In fact, as I said, the legislation is very carefully crafted \nto give the small inventor a variety of ways to ensure that he or she \nis protected.\n  The first coalition to bring the whole idea of patent reform to the \nCongress, the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, is very \nstrongly in support of the legislation and in opposition to the \nFeinstein amendment. In fact, it noted in a statement released \nWednesday that not only does it oppose the amendment, it would oppose \nthe entire bill if the amendment were to be adopted and this first-to-\nfile concept were stricken from the bill.\n  In fact, here is what they said:\n\n       The first-inventor-to-file provisions currently in S. 23 \n     form the linchpin that makes possible the quality \n     improvements that S. 23 promises.\n\n  Here is what the Obama Statement of Administration Policy says. It \nlays out exactly what is at stake:\n\n       By moving the United States to a first-to-file system, the \n     bill simplifies the process of acquiring rights. This \n     essential provision will reduce legal costs, improve \n     fairness, and support U.S. innovators seeking to market their \n     products and services in the global marketplace.\n\n  I am continuing the statement:\n\n       Most of the arguments in opposition to the bill and FITF \n     appear to be decades-old contentions that have been fully and \n     persuasively rebutted. As one example, the National Research \n     Council of the National Academies assembled a group of \n     leading patent professionals, economists, and academics who \n     spent four years intensely studying these issues and \n     concluded in 2004 that the move to FITF represented a \n     necessary change for our patent system to operate fairly, \n     effectively and efficiently in the 21st century.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Without retaining S. 23's current FITF provisions, the bill \n     would no longer provide meaningful patent reform.\n\n  Let me repeat that. If the Feinstein amendment would prevail, ``the \nbill would no longer provide meaningful patent reform.''\n\n       As an example, the new provisions on post-grant review of \n     patents, an important new mechanism for assuring patent \n     quality, could no longer be made to work. Instead of a patent \n     reform bill, what would remain of S. 23 would be essentially \n     an empty shell.\n\n  Let me finish the statement:\n\n       Thus, we could not continue our support of passage of S. 23 \n     without the first-inventor-to-file provisions present in the \n     bill. It would place us in the unfortunate position of \n     opposing moving forward with a bill where we have been among \n     the longest, most ardent supporters.\n\n  Just to conclude, the National Association of Manufacturers, which \nrepresents both large and small manufacturers in every industrial \nsector, has also made it clear that it strongly opposes the amendment. \nI will conclude by quoting from that group's statement in opposition to \nthe Feinstein amendment.\n\n       The NAM supports transitioning the United States from a \n     ``first-to-invent'' system to a ``first-to-file'' system to \n     eliminate unnecessary cost and complexity in the U.S. patent \n     system. Manufacturers large and small operate in the global \n     marketplace and the United States needs to move toward a \n     system that will provide more patent protection around the \n     world for our innovative member companies. The ``first-to-\n     file'' provision currently included in S. 23 achieves this \n     goal.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will pay close attention to the \narguments made by Chairman Leahy and the arguments I have made in \nopposition to the Feinstein amendment. Whether intended or not, it \nwould be a poison pill. It would kill the legislation if it were \nadopted. We need to move this important legislation forward, as the \nadministration notes in its statement of policy, and therefore I urge \nmy colleagues, when we have an opportunity to vote on the Feinstein \namendment, to vote against it and to support the legislation as \nreported.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona for his words here this morning. He is part of the small \ngroup of Republicans and Democrats who have worked very hard over the \nlast couple of years on this bill with the idea of giving us something \nthat would allow inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs in America to \nbe able to compete with the rest of the world.\n  I am one American who believes we can compete with anybody anywhere \nprovided we get a level playing field. Other countries have set up \nenough barriers for us of their own. We shouldn't be setting up \nbarriers here in the United States. One thing we can do is to make some \nmajor, long-overdue changes in the patent laws to give us that level \nplaying field. Inventors and innovators in America who will take \nadvantage of this will be better off for it and will create jobs, but \nmost importantly, we will show the rest of the world that America is \nopen for business.\n  Americans can be the innovators they have been from the time the \nfirst patent was issued--and I say this with pride--to a Vermonter back \nwhen then-Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson reviewed the application, \nwhich was then signed by the President of the United States, George \nWashington. Now, of course, they are not reviewed by the Secretary of \nState and signed by the President, thank goodness, because there are \nover 700,000 applications pending.\n  We need legislation to bring us up to date, and this act will promote \ninnovation, it will create new businesses and, as a result, new jobs. \nThis is bipartisan legislation that will allow inventors to secure \ntheir patents more quickly and to have better success commercializing \nthem.\n  The pending amendment would gut the reforms intended by the bill. \nWith all due respect, it would destroy all the work we have tried to do \nin this bill. It would eliminate a major piece of this effort--the \ntransition to a first-inventor-to-file patent system. First-inventor-\nto-file is a necessary component of this legislation and enjoys support \nfrom every corner of the patent community.\n  The administration, the Secretary of Commerce, and the head of the \nPatent and Trademark Office all oppose this amendment. A vast array of \nindividuals, independent small inventors, small businesses, and labor \noppose this amendment. The four senior Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee who have worked so hard on this bill--Senators Grassley, \nHatch, Kyl, and Sessions--oppose this amendment. Needless to say, I \noppose this amendment. It would be a poison pill to these legislative \nreform efforts.\n  Supporters of the legislation before us--ranging from high-tech and \nlife sciences companies to universities and small businesses--place \nsuch a high importance on the transition to the first-inventor-to-file \nsystem that many of them, including those who reside in just about \nevery State, would not support a bill without those provisions.\n  A transition to first-inventor-to-file has been part of this bill \nsince its introduction four Congresses ago. Yet, until very recently, \nfirst-inventor-to-file was never the subject of even a single amendment \nin the Judiciary Committee over all those years. This legislation is \nthe product of eight Senate hearings and three markups spanning weeks \nof consideration and numerous amendments. Never was first-inventor-to-\nfile a contentious issue. Now some well-financed special interests that \ndo not support the America Invents Act have decided to kill the bill by \na last-minute campaign to strike these vital provisions.\n  I urge Senators to support the goals of the America Invents Act and \nvote against this amendment to strike first-inventor-to-file.\n  Mr. President, the United States is the only industrialized country \nstill using a first-to-invent system, and there is a reason for that. A \nfirst-inventor-to-file system, by contrast, where the priority of a \nright to a patent is based on the earlier filed application, adds \nsimplicity and objectivity into a very complex system. By contrast, our \ncurrent outdated method for determining the priority right to a patent \nis extraordinarily complex, it is subjective, it is time-intensive, and \nit is expensive. The old system almost always favors the larger \ncorporation and the deep pockets over the small independent inventor.\n  This past weekend, the Washington Post editorial board endorsed the \ntransition, calling our first-inventor-to-file standard a ``bright \nline.'' They went on to say it would bring ``certainty to the \nprocess.'' The editorial also rightly recognizes the ``protections for \nacademics who share their ideas with outside colleagues or preview them \nin public seminars'' that are included in the bill.\n  The transition to a first-inventor-to-file system will benefit small \ninventors and inventors of all sizes by creating certainty. Once a \npatent is granted, an inventor can rely on its filing date on the face \nof the patent.\n  The reduction in costs to patent applications that comes with a \ntransition to this system should also help the small independent \ninventor. In the current outdated system where more than one \napplication claiming the same invention is filed, the priority of a \nright to a patent is decided through an ``interference'' proceeding to \ndetermine which applicant can be declared to have invented the claimed \ninvention first. It is lengthy, it is complex, and it can cost hundreds \nof thousands of dollars. Small inventors rarely, if ever, win \ninterference proceedings. In a first-inventor-to-file system, however, \nthe filing date of the application is objective and easy to determine, \nresulting in a streamlined and less costly process.\n  The bill protects against the concerns of many small inventors and \nuniversities by including a 1-year grace period to ensure the \ninventor's own publication or disclosure cannot be used against him as \nprior art but will act as prior art against another patent application. \nThis encourages early disclosure of new inventions regardless of \nwhether the inventor ends up trying to patent the invention.\n  The transition to first-inventor-to-file is ultimately needed to help \nAmerican companies and innovators compete globally. As business and \ncompetition increasingly operate on a worldwide scale, inventors have \nto file patent applications in both the United States and other \ncountries for protection of their inventions. Since America's current \noutdated system differs from the first-inventor-to-file system used in \nother patent-issuing jurisdictions--all our competitors--it causes \nconfusion and inefficiencies for American companies and innovators. \nHarmonization will benefit American inventors.\n  Commerce Secretary Gary Locke highlighted the importance of the \nfirst-inventor-to-file provision to the bill in his column published in \nThe Hill yesterday. He noted that it ``would be good for U.S. \nbusinesses, providing a more transparent and cost-effective process \nthat puts them on a level playing field with their competitors around \nthe world.''\n  Secretary Locke went on to confront the erroneous notion that the \ncurrent outdated system is better for small independent inventors, and \nhe did it head-on by explaining that in his ``strong opinion that the \nopposite is true.'' The first-inventor-to-file system is better for the \nsmall independent inventor. As the Secretary noted:\n\n       The cost of proving that one was first to invent is \n     prohibitive and requires detailed and complex documentation \n     of the invention process. In cases where there's a dispute \n     about who the actual inventor is, it typically costs at least \n     $400,000 in legal fees, and even more if the case is \n     appealed. By comparison, establishing a filing date through a \n     provisional application and establishing priority of \n     invention costs just $110.\n\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\n\n  Secretary Locke explained how the 125,000 provisional applications \ncurrently filed each year prove that early filing dates protect the \nrights of small inventors. He reiterated that during the past 7 years, \nunder the current outdated, cumbersome, and expensive system, of almost \n3 million applications filed, only 1 patent was granted to an \nindividual inventor who was the second to apply.\n  Our reform legislation enjoys broad support. I have already mentioned \nsome of those supporters, but let me highlight a few more:\n  Just yesterday, the National Association of Manufacturers urged every \nSenator to oppose the effort to strike the first-to-file transition, \nwriting, ``The NAM supports transitioning the United States from a \n`first-to-invent' system to a `first-to-file' system to eliminate \nunnecessary cost and complexity in the U.S. patent system.''\n  The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council has expressed its \nstrong support for the first-inventor-to-file system, writing that \n``small firms will in no way be disadvantaged, while opportunities in \nthe international markets will expand.''\n  The Intellectual Property Owners Association calls the first-\ninventor-to file system ``central to modernization and simplification \nof patent law'' and ``very widely supported by U.S. companies.''\n  Independent inventor Louis Foreman has said the first-inventor-to-\nfile transition will help ``independent inventors across the country by \nstrengthening the current system for entrepreneurs and small \nbusinesses.''\n  Six university, medical college, and higher education associations \nhave urged the transition to first-to-file, saying that it will ``add \ngreater clarity to the U.S. system.''\n  And, in urging the transition to the first-to-file system, the \nAssociation for Competitive Technology, which represents small and mid-\nsize IT firms, has said the current outdated system ``negatively \nimpacts entrepreneurs'' and puts American inventors ``at a disadvantage \nwith competitors abroad who can implement first inventor to file \nstandards.'' That is why it is so important to move to a first-\ninventor-to-file system.\n  I ask unanimous consent copies of the Washington Post editorial, \n``Patenting Innovation,'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also ask letters from the National Association of \nManufacturers, higher education associations, the Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship Council be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will conclude with this: If we are to continue to lead \nthe globe in innovation and production, if we are to win the future \nthrough American ingenuity and innovation, we must have a patent system \nthat is streamlined and efficient. The America Invents Act, and a \ntransition to a first-inventor-to-file system in particular, is crucial \nto fulfill this promise. I urge all Senators on both sides of the aisle \nto oppose the Feinstein amendment and support the important provision \nof first-inventor-to-file, which is at the heart of the America Invents \nAct.\n  As I said, I submit the list of stakeholders across the spectrum from \nhigh-tech and life sciences to universities and small inventors in \nsupport of a transition to the first-to-file system, and ask unanimous \nconsent that list be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware who has been so helpful on this legislation on the floor, so I \nyield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 26, 2011]\n\n                          Patenting Innovation\n\n       More than 60 years have passed since a major overhaul of \n     the U.S. patent system has taken place. And it shows.\n       The U.S. patent system lags woefully. One example: Patents \n     in the United States are given to those ``first to invent.'' \n     This approach is out of step with the rest of the world's \n     ``first to file'' approach and is highly inefficient. It \n     invites people to come out of the woodwork years after a \n     product has been on the market to claim credit and demand \n     royalties.\n       The secretive and lengthy U.S. process also too often \n     results in patents for products that are neither novel nor \n     innovative. It leaves manufacturers vulnerable to \n     infringement lawsuits and damage awards long after their \n     products have gone to market.\n       The Senate is poised to take up a bill on Monday that would \n     eliminate these defects and bring the U.S. system into the \n     21st century.\n       The Patent Reform Act, introduced by Sens. Patrick J. Leahy \n     (D-Vt.) and Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), would recognize the \n     ``first inventor to file'' standard, creating a bright line--\n     the date on which a patent application was filed--and \n     bringing certainty to the process. Yet the bill is not \n     inflexible and wisely keeps in place protections for \n     academics who share their ideas with outside colleagues or \n     preview them in public seminars.\n       The bill also would increase protections for those with \n     legitimate gripes. Third parties, currently shut out of the \n     process, would be given clear rules and time limits to \n     challenge patents that have not yet been approved. They'd \n     also have a chance to lodge objections after a patent has \n     been granted; the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) \n     would resolve these disputes. This safety valve should reduce \n     the litigation costs associated with court challenges.\n       The PTO has long been overwhelmed and underfunded. The bill \n     would allow the agency to set the amount it charges for \n     filings while providing discounts to solo inventors and small \n     companies. An amendment likely to be introduced by Sen. Tom \n     Coburn (R-Okla.) would allow the agency to keep all of its \n     fees, thereby ensuring it the resources it needs to carry out \n     the bill's mandates.\n       The president made much of ``winning the future'' in his \n     State of the Union address. A patent system that protects \n     innovators and encourages meaningful breakthroughs would help \n     achieve that goal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2011.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM), the nation's largest industrial trade association \n     representing small and large manufacturers in every \n     industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to oppose \n     amendment 133 offered by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to S. \n     23,The America Invents Act.\n       The amendment would remove a key provision in S. 23, The \n     America Invents Act, which is strongly supported by \n     manufacturers, the creation of a ``first-inventor-to-file'' \n     system.\n       The NAM supports transitioning the United States from a \n     ``first-to-invent'' system to a ``first-to-file'' system to \n     eliminate unnecessary cost and complexity in the U.S. patent \n     system. Manufacturers large and small operate in the global \n     marketplace and the United States needs to move toward a \n     system that will provide more patent protection around the \n     world for our innovative member companies. The ``first-to-\n     file'' provision currently included in S. 23 achieves this \n     goal.\n       Thank you for your consideration and your support for the \n     ``first-to-file'' system.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dorothy Coleman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We write as the presidents of six \n     university, medical college, and higher education \n     associations to express the strong support of our \n     associations for S. 23, the Patent Reform Act of 2011, which \n     was reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 15-0 vote \n     and is scheduled to be considered by the Senate this week. \n     This bipartisan agreement represents the successful \n     culmination of a thorough, balanced effort to update the U.S. \n     patent system to support more effectively the nation's \n     economic competitiveness and job creation in the increasingly \n     competitive global environment of the 21st century.\n       Our universities and medical colleges are this nation's \n     principal source of the fundamental research that expands the \n     frontiers of knowledge, strengthening the nation's innovative \n     capacity. The patent system plays a critical role in enabling \n     these institutions to transfer the discoveries arising from \n     university research into the commercial sector for \n     development into products and processes that benefit society.\n       S. 23 will:\n       Harmonize the U.S. patent system with that of our major \n     trading partners, enabling U.S. inventors to compete more \n     effectively in the global marketplace;\n       Improve patent quality by allowing third parties to submit \n     information to the USPTO concerning patents under \n     examination, and by creating an efficient, effective post-\n     grant opposition proceeding to challenge patents for nine \n     months after they have been granted, allowing challengers to \n     eliminate weak patents that should not have been granted\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\n     and strengthening those patents that survive the challenge;\n       Reduce patent litigation costs by establishing the new \n     post-grant procedure noted above, and by significantly \n     improving the current inter partes review procedure, which \n     will provide a lower-cost alternative to civil litigation to \n     challenge a patent throughout its lifetime, while \n     significantly reducing the capacity to mount harassing serial \n     challenges; and\n       Provide USPTO with increased resources by providing this \n     fee-funded agency with critically needed fee-setting \n     authority, subject to Congressional and Patent Public \n     Advisory Committee oversight.\n       We wish to call your attention to two important amendments \n     that may be offered during floor consideration:\n        Senator Coburn is expected to offer an amendment to \n     prevent diversion of fees collective by USPTO. This amendment \n     is a critical accompaniment to the fee-setting authority \n     provided by S. 23, allowing this seriously under-resourced \n     agency to maintain the fees necessary to carry out its \n     critical functions and reduce the backlog of patent \n     applications. We urge you to support the Coburn amendment.\n       Senators Feinstein, Boxer, and Reid are expected to offer \n     an amendment to eliminate the transition to a first-inventor-\n     to-file system. The National Academies, in its seminal report \n     on patent reform, A Patent System for the 21st Century, \n     strongly recommended moving from a first-to-invent to a \n     first-inventor-to-file system. Adopting a first-inventor-to-\n     file system will harmonize the U.S. patent law with that of \n     our trading partners, add greater clarity to the U.S. system \n     by replacing the subjective determination of the first \n     inventor with the objective identification of the first \n     filer, and eliminate the costs of interferences and \n     litigation associated with determining the first inventor. We \n     urge you to oppose the Feinstein, Boxer, and Reid amendment.\n       We believe S. 23 reforms current U.S. law in a way that \n     balances the interests of the various sectors of the patent \n     community and substantially improves the patent system \n     overall, strengthening the capacity of this system to \n     strengthen the nation's innovative capacity and economic \n     competitiveness. We urge you to support this carefully \n     crafted legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert M. Berdahl,\n       President, Association of American Universities;\n     Molly Corbett Broad,\n       President, American Council on Education;\n     Darrell G. Kirch,\n       President and CEO, Association of American Medical \n     Colleges;\n     Peter McPherson,\n       President, Association of Public and Land-grant \n     Universities;\n     Ashley J. Stevens,\n       President, Association of University Technology Managers;\n     Anthony P. DeCrappeo,\n       President, Council on Governmental Relations.\n       This letter was sent to all members of the U.S. Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Small Business &\n\n\n                                     Entrepreneurship Council,\n\n                                    Oakton, VA, February 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Small Business & Entrepreneurship \n     Council (SBE Council) and its members across the nation have \n     been strong advocates for patent reform. We are pleased that \n     you have introduced the Patent Reform Act (S. 23), and we \n     strongly endorse this important piece of legislation.\n       An effective and efficient patent system is critical to \n     small business and our overall economy. After all, the U.S. \n     leads the globe in entrepreneurship, and innovation and \n     invention are central to our entrepreneurial successes. \n     Indeed, intellectual property--most certainly including \n     patents--is a key driver to U.S. economic growth. Patent \n     reform is needed to clarify and simplify the system; to \n     properly protect legitimate patents; and to reduce costs in \n     the system, including when it comes to litigation and the \n     international marketplace.\n       Make no mistake, this is especially important for small \n     businesses. As the Congressional Research Service has \n     reported: ``Several studies commissioned by U.S. federal \n     agencies have concluded that individuals and small entities \n     constitute a significant source of innovative products and \n     services. Studies have also indicated that entrepreneurs and \n     small, innovative firms rely more heavily upon the patent \n     system than larger enterprises.''\n       The Patent Reform Act works to improve the patent system in \n     key ways, including, for example, by lowering fees for micro-\n     entities, and by shortening time periods for patent reviews \n     by making the system more predictable.\n       During the debate over this legislation, it is expected \n     that two important areas of reform will come under attack.\n       First, the U.S. patent system is out of step with the rest \n     of the world. The U.S. grants patents on a first-to-invent \n     basis, rather than the first-inventor-to-file system that the \n     rest of the world follows. First-to-invent is inherently \n     ambiguous and costly, and that's bad news for small \n     businesses and individual inventors.\n       In a 2004 report from the National Research Council of the \n     National Academies (titled ``A Patent System for the 21st \n     Century''), it was pointed out: ``For those subject to \n     challenge under first-to-invent, the proceeding is costly and \n     often very protracted; frequently it moves from a USPTO \n     administrative proceeding to full court litigation. In both \n     venues it is not only evidence of who first reduced the \n     invention to practice that is at issue but also questions of \n     proof of conception, diligence, abandonment, suppression, and \n     concealment, some of them requiring inquiry into what an \n     inventor thought and when the inventor thought it.'' The \n     costs of this entire process fall more heavily on small \n     businesses and individual inventors.\n       As for the international marketplace, patent harmonization \n     among nations will make it easier, including less costly, for \n     small firms and inventors to gain patent protection in other \n     nations, which is critical to being able to compete \n     internationally. By moving to a first-inventor-to-file \n     system, small firms will in no way be disadvantaged, while \n     opportunities in international markets will expand.\n       Second, as for improving the performance of the USPTO, it \n     is critical that reform protect the office against being a \n     ``profit center'' for the federal budget. That is, the USPTO \n     fees should not be raided to aid Congress in spending more \n     taxpayer dollars or to subsidize nonrelated programs. \n     Instead, those fees should be used to make for a quicker, \n     more predictable patent process.\n       Thank you for your leadership Senator Leahy. Please feel \n     free to contact SBE Council if we can be of assistance on \n     this important issue for small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                   Record Submissions--First-to-File\n\n       Mr. President. We have heard from stakeholders from across \n     the spectrum--from high tech and life sciences, to \n     universities and small inventors--in support of the \n     transition to the first-to-file system. These supporters \n     include:\n\n       AdvaMed; American Bar Association; American Council on \n     Education; American Intellectual Property Law Association; \n     Association of American Medical Colleges; Association for \n     Competitive Technology; Association of American Universities; \n     Association of Public and Land-grant Universities; \n     Association of University Technology Managers; Biotechnology \n     Industry Organization; Business Software Alliance; Coalition \n     for 21st Century Patent Reform, a coalition of 50 companies \n     from 18 different industry sectors, such as General Electric, \n     Procter & Gamble, 3M, Pfizer, and Cargill.\n       Council on Governmental Relations; Gary Michelson, \n     Independent Inventor; Genentech; Intellectual Property Owners \n     Association; Louis J. Foreman, Enventys, Independent \n     Inventor; National Association of Manufacturers; The Native \n     American Intellectual Property Enterprise Council; PhRMA; \n     Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council; Software & \n     Information Industry Association.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his leadership on \nthis floor deliberation regarding S. 23, the America Invents Act.\n  I rise to speak in opposition to the Feinstein amendment, which would \nstrike the first-to-file provision, which I think is one of the \ncritical components of this act that will harmonize the patent system \nwith that of the rest of the world, as I heard Chairman Leahy speak to. \nThis is the first comprehensive patent reform bill in 60 years. It is a \nkey piece of our bipartisan work to make sure the United States remains \na competitive country which can once again be in the forefront of world \ninnovation.\n  As someone who, like you, Mr. President, is concerned about \nmanufacturing, is concerned about employment, is concerned about jobs, \none of the ways we can restrengthen, reinvigorate, reenergize \nmanufacturing in this country is by making sure our Patent and \nTrademark Office is as capable, is as strong as it can possibly be. I \ntake quite seriously that the Patent and Trademark Office under the \nvery able leadership of Director Kappos is opposed to this amendment \nand has also raised concern, which I share, that this amendment would \ntear apart the very broad coalition that has worked so hard and has \nnegotiated this particular act, the America Invents Act, over the last \n6 years.\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\n  On an issue that is as important as this, as critical as this to the \nprotection of American innovation and the resulting creation of jobs, I \nthink it is important that we in the Senate not allow this bipartisan \nbill to fall apart over this issue.\n  Transition to first-to-file is an improvement over the current system \nbecause it provides increased predictability, certainty, and \ntransparency. Patent priority will depend on the date of public \ndisclosure and the effective filing date rather than on secret inventor \nnotebooks, secret personal files which may or may not be admissible and \noften lead to long and contentious litigation, as the chairman \nmentioned in his floor comments as well.\n  This predictability, the predictability that the first-to-file system \nwill bring, I believe will strengthen the hand of investors, inventors, \nand the public. All will know as soon as an application is filed \nwhether it is likely to have priority over other patent applications.\n  In contrast, the current system with which we worked for many years \ndoes not provide an easy way to determine priority. That is why \ninterference proceedings can be so contentious, so long, and so \nexpensive. There are some small inventors in particular who I know are \nconcerned that first-to-file will be used by larger companies to steal \naway their rightful invention. This bill contains critical protections \nfor all inventors so the ultimate new system, once this is passed, will \nbe more fair, more predictable, and transparent for all. For those \ninventors who publicly disclose an invention before anybody else, they \nhave a 1-year grace period to claim priority for any patent application \nbased on the subject matter they disclose. Smaller inventors as well as \nlarge inventors will be protected as soon as they publish or otherwise \ndisclose under this America Invents Act.\n  In my view, that will increase the free flow of ideas while still \nprotecting the IP rights of any inventor, large or small.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office commissioned a study of patent and \ntrademark applications filed over the last 7 years. They found only 1 \nout of 300,000 filings would, under the new system, grant a patent to a \nlarge company that might otherwise have gone to a small company or \nindividual inventor. By avoiding cost, the difficulty, the \nunpredictability of lengthy interference proceedings, transition to \nfirst-to-file will neutralize what I think is a big structural \nadvantage to large companies in the current dispute system.\n  First of all, it also gives the holder of a new patent increased \nconfidence in the strength and reliability of this patent, which I also \nthink will accelerate venture capital investment, new company \nformation, and movement toward deployment of critical new technology.\n  I think experience has shown in other countries, in Europe and \nCanada, that transitioning from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file \nsystem will not lead directly to an increase in so-called junk \napplications and will, instead, make patent examination simpler, \nfairer, and more predictable. In short, my view is that it is crucial \nto the success of this legislation. It is crucial for the coalition \nthat has come together over many years to support it. It is crucial for \nthe progress this act will make in strengthening and streamlining the \npatent review and granting process in the United States. So I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment, amendment No. 133.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the \nimportance of passing the America Invents Act.\n  Chairman Leahy and the Judiciary Committee have worked hard to put \nthis product on the floor that will mark the biggest reforms to our \npatent system in 60 years. This bill will create jobs in Colorado and \nacross the country by promoting innovation. By making our patent system \nmore efficient, we are building the foundation for future economic \ngrowth.\n  In my State alone, nearly 20,000 patent applications have been \ngranted between the years 2000 and 2009. These applications have \ncreated the foundation for our clean energy economy and emerging tech \nand bio industries.\n  Having a high quality U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is essential \nto maintaining American leadership in innovation. The America Invents \nAct will help us grow new industries and will help cure the backlog and \ndelay that have stunted the ability of inventors to patent their ideas.\n  Right now, the average pendency period for a patent application is 36 \nmonths. That is unacceptable if we are to compete with the rest of the \nworld. This does not even account for those patents that have been tied \nup in years of litigation after they are granted.\n  And we have improved the bill on the floor by helping solidify \nalternatives to litigation, provide for more efficient resolution of \ndisputes and help create more certainty, which is essential to \ninventors.\n  It is hard to pass a jobs bill without spending money, but that is \nabsolutely what we have done here. The bill does a good job of \nbalancing the interests of innovators across the many sectors of our \neconomy.\n  We have passed a number of bipartisan amendments that have improved \nthis bill. We added amendments promoting the establishment of satellite \nUSPTO offices in regions across the country; creating a discount for \nsmall entities to participate in the accelerated patent examination \nprogram of the USPTO; and addressing concerns with damages and venue \nprovisions. I am proud to have worked with the chairman and the ranking \nmember to get these issues resolved.\n  I also commend Senator Menendez on his amendment to provide a fast \ntrack for patents that are critical for our national competitiveness, \nwhich I cosponsored.\n  The Senate has come a long way toward improving our patent system \nwith this legislation and harmonizing our system with the rest of the \nworld. There are a lot of people in my State who are interested in \nfurther improvements. I pledge to continue to work with them to help \nmake sure we continue to fine tune this legislation where we can.\n  The America Invents Act represents significant progress for our \npatent system. We are moving our patent system into the new century, \nwhich is already being defined by the next wave of American innovation. \nThe breadth of support for this legislation across industries and from \nlarge and small businesses, as well as our universities, has provided \nthe momentum to complete this legislation.\n  I would like to close by again thanking the chairman and Judiciary \nCommittee. I urge my colleagues to vote for patent reform.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      SETTING THE Record STRAIGHT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. This morning the Republican leader came to the floor, \nSenator McConnell, and made some pretty strong and sweeping statements \nabout the state of the deficit and responsibility. I would like to have \na chance to respond.\n  Senator McConnell said for 2 years now Washington Democrats have \ntaken fiscal recklessness to new heights. The amount of red ink \nDemocrats plan to wrack up this year alone would exceed all the debt \nrun up by the Federal Government since its inception through 1984.\n  I would like to set the record straight. Understand what the national \ndebt of America was when President William Jefferson Clinton left \noffice. We were running surpluses. We had not done that for decades--\nsurpluses in the Federal Treasury.\n  What did we do with all this money? We put it in the Social Security \ntrust fund. We bought more longevity and solvency for Social Security \nand, if you remember, the economy was never stronger.\n  William Jefferson Clinton left office, and at that moment in time, \nthe national debt, the accumulated debt of\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\nAmerica, from George Washington until he left office, $5 trillion. \nRemember that number, $5 trillion. Fast forward 8 years after the end \nof President George W. Bush--8 years later--where were we? The national \ndebt was now $12 trillion.\n  Fiscal recklessness by Democrats? Under President Bush, the national \ndebt more than doubled. Instead of leaving a surplus for President \nObama, he said: Welcome to an economy that is hemorrhaging hundreds of \nthousands of jobs lost every single month, and we anticipate next \nyear's deficit--he told President Obama--to be $1.2 trillion. That was \nwhat President Bush handed to President Obama.\n  I do not mind a selective view of history. I guess we are all guilty \nof that, to some extent. But to ignore the fiscal mess created that \nmore than doubled the national debt in 8 years, to ignore that we waged \ntwo wars without paying for them, to ignore that we cut taxes in the \nmidst of a war, which is something no President in the history of the \nUnited States has ever done, is to ignore reality.\n  The reality is, we are here today, in the midst of this Titanic \nstruggle, about whether we are going to continue to keep the Federal \nGovernment functioning. We are being asked whether, 2 weeks from now, \nwe want to have security at our airports, air traffic controllers, \nwhether we want to have Social Security checks sent out, people \nactually sending a check, answering questions at the Internal Revenue \nService, whether we want the Securities and Exchange Commission still \nworking on Wall Street 2 weeks from now.\n  We cannot lurch forward 2 weeks at a time without doing a great \ndisservice to taxpayers of this country, as well as to the men and \nwomen who work hard for our government every single day.\n  What is the answer in the House of Representatives? Well, the House \nof Representatives says we need to cut $100 billion this year. They \nstarted at $60 billion, incidentally, and then decided that was not \nenough for bragging rights; let's get up to $100 billion this year.\n  You say: Well, out of a budget of $3.7 trillion, how big is that? \nWhoa. They did not look at the budget of $3.7 trillion. They looked at \none 14-percent slice of the pie, domestic discretionary spending. That \nis it. Nothing to be taken out of the Department of Defense, nothing to \nbe taken away in terms of tax breaks for the wealthiest corporations, \nthe most successful corporations, nothing out of oil and gas royalties \nand the like--nothing out of that. We will take it all out of domestic \ndiscretionary.\n  So what did they take away? I looked in my State last week. I went up \nto Woodstock, IL. We have an office there with counselors who are \nbringing in unemployed people, sitting them in front of computers, with \nfax machines and copy machines. They are preparing resumes and trying \nto get back to work. These are people who want to work. They need a \nhelping hand. This place has been successful. It places people in jobs. \nWhat would happen to that office under the House Republican budget \nresolution? It would close its doors--more unemployed people, more \nunemployment checks. Is that the answer to putting America's economy \nback on its feet? Is that how we are going to get 15 million Americans \nback to work?\n  How about the House Republicans' proposal to eliminate $850 a year in \nPell grants. Senator Leahy knows what that is all about. These are kids \nfrom the poorest families, many of them for the first time in their \nfamily have a chance to graduate from college, but they can't make it; \nthey don't have enough money. We give them a helping hand. The \nRepublicans take it away. What will that do? The President of Augustana \nCollege in Rock Island, IL, told me what it will mean. It will mean \nthat 5 percent, 1 out of every 20 students, will not finish the school \nyear. That is what the Republican cut means. To cut job training, to \ncut education when we have 15 million people out of work, what are they \nthinking?\n  Not bad enough, I went to a medical school in my hometown of \nSpringfield, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, and met \nwith researchers. They get a few million a year to do medical research \nin fields of cancer therapy, dealing with heart issues, dealing with \ncomplaints of returning veterans. What do the House Republicans do? \nThey virtually close down research for the remainder of the year, close \ndown this medical research. Is that right? Is that what we want? Have \nwe ever had a sick person in our family and we went to the doctor and \nasked: Is there anything, is there a drug, is there something \nexperimental, a clinical trial, is there anything? Have we ever asked \nthat question? If we did, we know this cut by House Republicans is \nmindless, to cut medical research at this moment in history.\n  Then I went to a national laboratory, the Argonne National \nLaboratory, on Monday. What do they do there? A lot of people can't \nanswer that question. I learned specifically. Are Members aware of the \nChevy Volt, a breakthrough automobile, all electric? Where did that \nbattery in this automobile come from? The Argonne National Laboratory. \nHow about the latest pharmaceutical breakthroughs? Virtually every one \nof them uses the advanced photon source at the Argonne National \nLaboratory. I met a man from Eli Lilly who was there experimenting with \na new drug that can save lives. How about computers? Where is the \nfastest computer in the world today? I wish it was in the United \nStates. It is in China. We are now working on the next fastest computer \nso we don't lose that edge. Where? At the Argonne National Laboratory. \nSo what would the House Republican budget do to that laboratory and \nmost every other laboratory? It would eliminate one-third of the \nscientists and support staff working there and cut their research by 50 \npercent for the rest of the year.\n  So what? So what if we don't move these pharmaceuticals forward to \nmarket sooner to save lives, if we don't compete with the Chinese on \nthis computer, if we don't deal with battery technology so we don't \nlose that edge in the world? What will it mean? Lost jobs.\n  The House Republicans weren't thinking clearly. They were performing \nbrain surgery with a hacksaw. As a result, they have cut what is \nessential for the future: infrastructure projects, education, research. \nTo have the Republican leader come and tell us we have to accept that, \nthat that is the future of America--no, it is not. Time and again, when \nwe sit down to deal with budget challenges, whether it is in the \ndeficit commission, on which I was honored to serve, or whether it is \nin past negotiations, we open the table to all Federal spending, not \njust 14 percent, that tiny slice of the pie.\n  Senator McConnell can remember--and I can, too--under President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush and under President Clinton, we put on the \ntable tax breaks for some of these oil companies and corporations and \nsaid: Is it worth America's future for us to give them a tax break or \nto use the money to reduce the deficit? That is an honest question. \nMandatory spending. All these things need to be brought to the table \nfor conversation, but that is not the position of the Republicans. They \nwould rather see us shut down the government than to open this \nconversation to the entire Federal budget. They would rather see us \nshut down the government than fight to make sure education, training, \nresearch and innovation and infrastructure are there to build a strong \nAmerican economy for the future.\n  I say to my friend Senator McConnell, we don't need any speeches from \nthat side of the aisle about a national debt that more than doubled \nunder the last Republican President. We have to work together in a \nbipartisan way, acknowledging the reality of history, that we all have \nhad a hand in reaching the point we are at today, both positive and \nnegative, and we all need to take a responsible position to move us \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Illinois. I recall great discussions during the administration of \nPresident Reagan. I happened to like President Reagan. We got along \nvery well. But I remember discussions on a balanced budget and all \nthat, as his budget tripled the national debt. I do recall he did veto \none spending bill because it didn't spend as much as he wanted. \nRhetoric is one thing, as the Senator\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\nfrom Illinois points out. Reality is often different. I thank him.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 133, as modified\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 12:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Feinstein amendment No. 133, as modified, with \nno intervening action or debate; that the time until then be divided \nequally between the proponents and the opponents, and no amendments be \nin order to the Feinstein amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, am I correct there is a vote at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The time is equally divided on the Feinstein amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to support the Feinstein \namendment and to ask my colleagues, who I know have been working \ndiligently on the legislation for several years now, to respect the \nvery tough balance that has been sought in this legislation as this \nlegislation came out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I know we adopted a managers' amendment yesterday, and I know that \nmanagers' amendment now is catching a lot of people off guard because \nthere are far more changes than people realized in that managers' \namendment that I think upsets that apple cart of balance that was \nstruck in the Judiciary Committee.\n  So I am urging my colleagues to support the Feinstein amendment and \nexpressing my concern for the underlying bill that is something that, \nat this point in time, I cannot support.\n  I do not come to that decision lightly nor because of the fact that I \nhave many high-tech companies in the State of Washington that might say \nwe need patent reform and that this is good innovation. But large high-\ntech companies are not the only ones that know something about \ninnovation. In fact, most of the people who have helped build those \norganizations were once the small inventors themselves of key \ntechnology.\n  What is at stake is unbalancing the apple cart as exists today to \ninnovation--not just innovation in general but innovation in an \ninformation age. The meal ticket for all of us is going to be the \ninvention and creation of new products and services. So that is the \ngreat time and age we live in.\n  But if in this legislation we all of a sudden upset that apple cart, \nwhere we are tilting the playing field in support of large corporations \nthat have already made their mark and made their markets and made their \nsuccess and have slowed down on the rate and progress of innovation \nwithin their companies and do a lot to acquire technology from smaller \ninventors--and now, all of a sudden in this underlying bill, \nparticularly in the area of damages, make sure the big corporations can \nwin in any kind of legal dispute against the technology holder or \ncreator because they are able to outlast them in a legal battle because \nthey are more well financed, more well heeled, with the ability to draw \nout this battle--because of that change in the underlying bill, we \nleave the small guy without many resources.\n  The only thing the small inventor has is their intellectual property \nand a fair day in court. If now we take that away from them, I \nguarantee you, they will have less success. Then, when you have less \nsuccess of having 5,000 flowers bloom, we have a problem.\n  This is not about what five or six or seven large corporations can \ncreate. This is about what thousands and thousands of innovators are \ngoing to create in the future and whether they are going to be incented \nor disincented to do that.\n  The Feinstein amendment tries to protect the current process, to \nprotect what are the rights of those inventors today under current law. \nI am sure my colleagues will say: Well, that is not the way the rest of \nthe world does it. I would say to my colleagues: I am not sure the way \nthe rest of the world does it is the mark we are trying to hit. What we \nare trying to preserve is the entrepreneurial spirit that has been \ncreated in the United States. I am not saying that is not based on just \nraw creativity of individuals--it is--but it is also based on financial \nincentive and the incentive those individuals have that their \nintellectual property can be protected.\n  But if this is going to be a game about the big boys coming to \nWashington and squashing the small inventors, count me out. This has to \nbe a level playing field. I get it is tempting to want to, in the last \nminute, stick into the managers' amendment language you could not get \nout of committee. But if we want to get this legislation through this \nprocess, then we have to take into consideration the rights of the \ninventors along with the rights of those larger companies that are \ntrying to acquire or integrate or be part of the manufacturing on a \nlarger scale of that inventor's technology.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, the Feinstein amendment, in keeping the \nrights of the inventors where they are, gives them at least a modicum \nof holding on to that. I think the underlying bill has changed so much \nin the managers' amendment that we are going down a road that is going \nto make it very difficult for us to finally get a piece of legislation. \nWe have to respect the rights of the small individuals, and we can't \nhave carve-outs for specific jurisdictions such as Wall Street who \nthink they can have their cake and eat it too.\n  This has to be about how we move forward on a smoother patent \nprocess. We need to take into consideration that we have gotten to this \ngreat place in our country because we have had a balance and an \nempowerment of these technologies. We should not all of a sudden in one \nfell swoop take that away on the Senate floor and basically undermine \nwhat is the creative opportunity for the U.S. economy, which is an \ninvention. We want thousands and thousands of inventors--not just \ninventors who work for big corporations--thousands of inventors who \nhave their rights.\n  So I support the Feinstein amendment.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nfor her comments. We welcome her support. I was pleased to be able to \nlisten to her comments.\n  What is the current status of the time allocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand the opponents have 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that our 3\\1/2\\ minutes be \nextended so that Senator Risch, who will speak next, has the time he \nrequires, and I have the time for a few brief closing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I am proud to come to the floor today to \nspeak on the amendment to which I am a cosponsor.\n  This is simply a matter of fairness. With all due respect to my \ncolleague from Washington, referencing her comments about the big boys \nversus the small inventors and what have you, I don't view it as that \nat all. I view it as a fairness issue: The person who created the \ninvention gets the benefits of that creation, not the person with the \nfastest tennis shoes. That is what we are doing.\n  We are creating what is called a race notice statute, which is \nsimilar to what is in place in many States on real estate filings. It \nhas a legitimate place in the real estate market but not here. With so \nmuch on the line, with creativity on the line, it should be the person \nwho actually does the invention who reaps the benefits of that \ninvention, and that is all this does.\n  The other thing I think is so important is it preserves the situation \nwe\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nhave had for many years in place. I have heard people say: Oh, well, \nthis is a poison pill. If you take this out, it kills the bill. That \nisn't the case at all. It simply preserves the situation we have in \nplace today. It is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing to do.\n  I urge an affirmative vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Madam President. I thank Senator \nRisch for his cosponsorship, and, of course, I agree exactly with his \nstatement.\n  At this time I wish to briefly summarize the arguments in favor of \nour amendment to strike the first-to-file provisions from this bill. \nThis amendment is cosponsored, as I said, by Senator Risch, Majority \nLeader Reid, Senators Crapo, Boxer, Ensign, and I ask unanimous consent \nto add Senator Begich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Proponents of the first-to-file argue that the rest of the world \nfollows this system and making this change will harmonize our system \nwith theirs, and that is true. But under our first-to-invent system, \nour Nation has been by far the leader in the field of innovation, the \nleader in the field of new patents, new discoveries, new inventions. \nThe other first-to-file countries have been playing catchup with our \ntechnological advances. I wouldn't trade our record of innovation for \nany of theirs, and I doubt many Members of this body disagree with me \nif they really think about it.\n  Think about the history of innovation. What sets America apart is so \nmany of our great inventions start out in small garages and labs, with \ndriven, inspired people who have great ideas, develop them, and then \nthey take off. I mentioned companies that have started this way \nyesterday, including Hewlett Packard, Apple, and Google, and there are \nhundreds and perhaps thousands of others. They started from humble \nbeginnings, and they grew spectacularly, creating jobs for millions of \nAmericans and lifting up our economy and standard of living.\n  I know an inventor who invented Skyy vodka. The vodka he drank \ndisturbed his stomach, so he figured out biologically and chemically \nwhat it was, and he invented a vodka called Skyy vodka--a small \ninventor. I think that company was subsequently sold for a great deal \nof money. But it started with one man who had a stomachache from \ndrinking vodka.\n  Now, this may be just one type of example, but Apple is certainly \nanother example. It started in a garage many years ago in California, \nand out of that emerged this giant company. So these companies started \nfrom humble beginnings. They grew. This created jobs for millions of \nAmericans. They lifted our economy and our standard of living.\n  The National Small Business Association is a supporter of this \namendment, and just last week other small business inventor groups have \njoined them in saying that first-to-file ``disrupts the unique American \nstart-up ecosystem that has led to America's standing as the global \ninnovation leader.''\n  First-to-invent has served our country well. Here are the main \nproblems, as I see them, with the bill's first-to-file system: First, \nthe grace period. It ``guts'' the current grace period, in the words of \na letter from 108 startups and small businesses that protect inventors' \nrights to their inventions for 1 year from offering them for sale or \nmaking a public use of them, among other things, before they have to \nfile a patent application with the Patent Office. So there is this 1-\nyear grace period for them to get their act together.\n\n  Now, under the present system, instead of preparing a costly patent \nfiling, they can concentrate on developing their invention and \nobtaining necessary funding.\n  The majority leader just circulated a statement to Members which \nspeaks to this grace period. I wish to quote one part of that \nstatement:\n\n       The grace period comports with the reality of small entity \n     financing through friends, family, possible patent licensees, \n     and venture capitalists. The grace period allows small \n     inventors to have conversations about their invention and to \n     line up funding before going to the considerable expense of \n     filing a patent application.\n\n  The grace period allows them to not have to race to the Patent Office \nbecause they are afraid somebody else might have heard the \nconversation, might have stolen it from them, and moved on.\n  Senator Reid goes on:\n\n       In fact, in many ways, the one-year grace period helps \n     improve patent quality--inventors find out which ideas can \n     attract capital, and focus their efforts on those ideas, \n     dropping along the way other ideas and inventions that don't \n     attract similar interest and may not therefore be \n     commercially meaningful.\n\n  So this first-to-file essentially replaces this critical innovation-\nprotecting provision with a more limited and murky grace period that \nonly runs from the undefined term of ``disclosure.'' There is no \ndiscovery. Litigation is sure to ensue as courts interpret this term, \ncreating uncertainty that I believe will chill investment in startups \nwhich in turn will damper innovation and job growth.\n  Unfortunately, first-to-file incentivizes inventors to race to the \nPatent Office, to protect as many of their ideas as soon as possible, \nso that they are not beaten to the punch by a rival. Thus, first-to-\nfile will likely result in significant overfiling of dead-end \ninventions, unnecessarily burdening both the Patent Office and \nespecially small inventors.\n  The third reason, difficulty of proving copying. The third major \nproblem with this bill's system is the difficulty of proving that \nsomeone copied an invention. Currently, you as a first inventor can \nprove that you were first by presenting evidence that is in your \ncontrol--this is under first-to-invent--your own records \ncontemporaneously documenting the development of your invention. But \nunder this bill, to prove that someone else's patent application came \nfrom you, was derived from you, you would have to submit documents \nshowing this copying. Because there is no discovery, you wouldn't have \nthose documents in your possession, so it makes proving your invention \nmuch more difficult. The bill doesn't provide for any discovery in \nthese ``derivation proceedings.'' Therefore, the first inventor can't \nprove his or her claim because he or she does not have access to the \ndocuments of the alleged copier.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, how much time \nis remaining?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will just take 2 minutes more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California by consent is \nusing the opponent's time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is using my time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. I have asked to extend our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are supposed to vote at 12:30. I \nrealize the Senator couldn't be here when her amendment was brought up \nand couldn't be here when her amendment was modified. We did that for \nher. But I am in opposition to it, and I should at least have some of \nmy time to be able to use.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be very happy to--I was here yesterday. I did \nspeak on the floor, Mr. Chairman. I did, in a rather lengthy speech, \nindicate the arguments. I have asked for just a short period of time. \nMy remarks are no more than five pages, which should take me 1\\1/2\\ \nmore minutes to conclude. I hope I would be offered that time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, at the hour of 12:30 we are supposed to \nvote. I would ask unanimous consent, so far as my time has been used by \nthose in another position, that Senator Grassley and I have 4 minutes \nback of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has consent.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Fine. Then I would ask that my time on this side be \nextended for another 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  So I have outlined the difficulty of proving copying under the first-\nto-file system.\n  Disputes about who is the first to invent are resolved by the Patent \nOffice in what is called an interference proceeding, which number only \nabout 50 a year out of 480,000 patent applications.\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\nThe opposition infers that this is a huge problem. Fifty a year out of \n480,000 patent applications is a very small percentage.\n  As I said in the beginning, America leads the world under the first-\nto-invent system. I don't think we should fix what isn't broken. This \nworks for people who have great ideas but don't have money, who begin \nin a garage or in a lab. It has worked well for our system.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Risch, Majority Leader Reid, \nSenators Crapo, Boxer, Ensign, Begich, and myself in voting yes on this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as I said earlier, Secretary Locke \nconfronted the notion that the current outdated system is better for \nsmall independent inventors. He said the cost of proving that one was \nfirst to invent is prohibitive and requires detailed, complex \ndocumentation of the invention process. In cases where there is a \ndispute about who the actual inventor is, it typically costs at least \n$400,000 in legal fees and even more if the case is appealed. By \ncomparison, establishing a filing date through provisional application \nto establish priority of invention costs just $110.\n  I appreciate the work of the Senator from California, but her \namendment is a killer amendment. It would kill this bill. Our bill is \nset up so that it will allow us to compete with the rest of the world. \nRight now, we are behind the rest of the world in our patent system. \nOur bill as it is written allows us to compete with the rest of the \nworld. Her amendment would hold us back and give an advantage to those \ncountries with which we have to compete.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe chairman of the committee. I ask that people on my side of the \naisle not support the Feinstein amendment.\n  At this point, I move to table the Feinstein amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Feinstein \namendment, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 87, nays 13, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 31 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--87\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burr\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--13\n\n     Begich\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Crapo\n     Ensign\n     Feinstein\n     Inouye\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Rockefeller\n     Tester\n     Wyden\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 126\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I will call up amendment No. 126. I \nunderstand it will be agreed to. I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside and I call up amendment No. 126.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself and \n     Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 126.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 126) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and our ranking member and those who are \nworking very hard on a very important jobs bill today. On behalf of the \npeople of Detroit, the people of Michigan and Senator Levin and myself, \nI thank very much the Members for their support of this amendment.\n  Madam President, just few months ago, we learned that Detroit, MI, \nwill be home to the first-ever satellite office of the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office. This office is such great news for Michigan, where we \nhave a proud tradition of innovation and invention.\n  Every day, we are looking to innovate and create ``the next big \nthing.'' The decision to locate this satellite office in Detroit shows \njust how much new invention is happening in Michigan. Thanks to some of \nthe best research universities in the country, with an incredibly \nskilled workforce, we have become third in the nation in terms of clean \nenergy patents. And we are getting new patents every single day.\n  In addition to clean energy, Michigan is home to groundbreaking \nresearch in fields such as agriculture, defense technology, medical \ntechnology and pharmaceuticals, advanced batteries, and, of course, \nautomobiles.\n  This patent office will help us continue that tradition of \ninnovation, while reducing the backlog of patent applications so those \nnew products can get to the market faster.\n  It makes perfect sense to locate this new satellite office in \nDetroit.\n  Today I am offering, along with Senator Levin, amendment No. 126 to \nthe America Invents Act to name this new facility after a great \nMichigan inventor, Elijah McCoy.\n  His life captures the spirit of Michigan ingenuity and \nentrepreneurship. His parents escaped slavery and fled across the \nborder to Canada. After training as an apprentice in Scotland, he came \nto Ypsilanti, Michigan and set up a home-based invention shop.\n  Over the course of his brilliant life, Elijah McCoy secured more than \n50 patents, but he is best known for his inventions that revolutionized \nhow our heavy-duty machinery, including locomotives, function today. In \nJuly of 1872, he invented the automatic lubricator, a device that kept \nsteam engines working properly so trains could run faster and longer \nwithout stopping for service.\n  His invention was incredibly effective and many tried to copy his \nidea,\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\nbut nobody could match McCoy's idea. Machinists started asking if the \nengines were using the ``real McCoy'' technology, and people still use \nthat phrase today when they want the best quality product.\n  He did not have an easy journey. As an African American, he was kept \nout of many of the histories of the industrial revolution. Despite his \nbrilliance, he was only ever allowed to work in menial jobs on the \nrailroad tracks.\n  But despite the racial prejudice, Elijah McCoy never gave up and \ncontinued inventing. In 1976, the city of Detroit celebrated Elijah \nMcCoy day and dedicated his home as a historic site. In Detroit, Elijah \nMcCoy Drive runs between Trumball and the Lodge, near Henry Ford \nHospital. He is buried in Warren, MI.\n  It is a great honor for Michigan that the first-ever Patent and \nTrademark Satellite Office will be named for this great leader and \ngreat inspiration for Detroit.\n  It is a great honor for us to have this first-ever patent and \ntrademark satellite office in Detroit and to have it named after a \ngreat leader who has provided great inspiration.\n  I thank my colleagues very much for supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Blaming Workers\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, we have all watched the news \nstories--from Madison, WI; Columbus, OH; Trenton, NJ, and other places \naround the country--where public employees, when you really analyze it, \nare paid more or less, including benefits and depending on the place, \ncomparable to the private sector worker. Whether they are high school \ngraduates or college graduates or whatever, the overall pay and \nbenefits are pretty similar. We have seen around the country that these \npublic employees are in most cases willing to share in the sacrifice of \nbalancing budgets and share in the sacrifice of fighting back against \nthis bad economy. In fact, we know that workers--teachers, police \nofficers, nurses, people working at the unemployment bureaus, people \nworking at the Department of the Interior, wherever--have taken pretty \nbig hits already in terms of lost jobs, in terms of no raises, in terms \nof paying more for their health benefits.\n  So we know that even though these are not the people who caused the \nrecession any more than the workers at Lordstown, OH, assembling cars \nor Defiance, OH, building engines or Northwood, OH, making bumpers for \nthe Chevy Cruze are responsible for the failure of the automobile \nindustry, there just seems to be, as we have seen from these \nideological conservative Governors, an assault all over the country \nblaming workers, whether they are public or private workers, for the \nproblems in this economy.\n  They continue to want to give tax cuts to the richest people on Wall \nStreet, as they take their bonuses and make big dollars and see their \nincomes go like this, but as workers have pretty much had no real \nincrease in the last 10 years--wages have been mostly stagnant--how can \nyou blame the workers for this? That is what we have seen around the \ncountry.\n  It has been so interesting. Two days ago in Columbus, OH, 8,500 \npeople demonstrated not against budget cuts, because they know those \nare coming, but against this direct assault by the government--by the \nGovernor and legislative leaders--on the right to organize and bargain \ncollectively. That is a right that has been part of Americana, a part \nof our values for 75 years.\n  Why do they think we have a middle class? We have a middle class \nbecause workers have been able to band together and say to a company \nthat is very profitable: We should get some of that profit you are \nmaking because we are your workers and we have made your company more \nprosperous.\n  Management is important and crucial, but workers are important and \ncrucial. As worker wages go up, management wages typically go up. But \nwe have seen worker wages remain stagnant, in part because of a lack of \nunionization or a decline in unionization.\n  Now we are also seeing in Madison, Columbus, Trenton, Harrisburg, \nIndianapolis, Lansing, in these capital cities, especially in my part \nof the country, a real play on fear. They are trying to turn private \nsector workers against public sector workers. They blame the UAW--the \nauto workers--for the problems in the auto industry. Now they are \nblaming public workers for problems with State budgets and trying to \nwork the private sector and union workers against each other, fighting \nwith each other. That is the most base Karl Rove-type politics, to turn \nworking-class people against one another. It is wrong. It is morally \nwrong, it is politically wrong, and it is very wrong for our country.\n  What has also been interesting about these protests is that they are \nnot all steelworkers and electricians and American Federation of \nGovernment Employees and AFSCME and SCMU. There are people of faith \nalso involved.\n  I did a roundtable at an Episcopal church right off statehouse \nsquare, and the leaders of the church and some of the volunteers of the \nchurch were there. Now, I don't preach or wear my Christianity on my \nsleeve, but these people of faith understand that the Bible talks a lot \nabout poverty and a lot about fairness and equality and egalitarianism, \nif you will, but for them to go against workers on behalf of the \nrichest people in our country--and that is really what they are doing \nin the Governors' offices in Columbus and Madison and Trenton and other \nplaces--runs counter at least to my faith. I will not judge their \nfaith. They worship what God they worship and read what scripture they \nread. But when I look at what my faith means--and as I said, I am a \nLutheran, I am not a Catholic--but when I look at Leo the XIII and what \nhe said about what Catholicism means for workers and fairness, it is \npoint, set, match. That clearly spoke definitively about this.\n  Mr. President, I have said this on the floor before today, but I wear \nthis pin on my lapel. It is the depiction of a canary in a birdcage. \nOne hundred years ago, miners took a canary down in the mines. If the \ncanary died from lack of oxygen or from toxic gas, the miner got out of \nthe mine. He only had himself to depend on. He didn't have a government \nthat cared much in those days to write safety laws, particularly child \nsafety laws, on the mines. He didn't have a union strong enough in \nthose days to fight back.\n  Too many people who are ultraconservative--and there are many in both \nthe Senate and the House--want to go back to those days. They want to \neliminate worker safety laws, and they want to eliminate minimum wage. \nThey are clearly going after collective bargaining and so many of the \nthings we hold dear.\n  Again, it wasn't the UAW workers, it wasn't the Service Employees \nUnion workers at the State capital who caused this financial crisis. \nThey have been the victims of it, just as a whole bunch of nonunion \nworkers have. This financial crisis was caused by greed, by people \noverreaching, by the richest in our society grabbing and grabbing and \ngrabbing for more wealth. Yet they are going to turn this--let's change \nthe subject--against those workers. That has happened far too many \ntimes in our country.\n  I am a new member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and I am \nlucky enough to serve on Senator Leahy's Subcommittee on State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs. We brought the Secretary of State \nin--Secretary Clinton--to talk to us about the State Department's \nbudget.\n  One of the things she said--and I mentioned Madison and Columbus \nafter she said it--but one of the things she said is, it has been \nunions in Egypt, it has been workers in Egypt and Tunisia and around \nthe world, it has been workers who so often, sometimes through their \nunions--if they are allowed to have unions, sometimes through a more \ninformal collection of people in what might look like a union but is \nnot formalized--fought for freedom, fought for equality. A lot of the \nproblems in Tunisia and Egypt were because people were hungry--not just \nbecause they want freedom, but they also\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\nwant fairness and a chance to make a living.\n  But one of the things Secretary Clinton talked about is, yes, this \nadministration is actually enforcing labor laws in Guatemala, this \nadministration will enforce labor laws in the labor component of our \ntrade agreements across the world because we as a country stand for a \nmore egalitarian workforce. We stand for workers rights. We believe \nworkers should organize and bargain collectively, if they choose. We \nbelieve in a minimum wage. We believe in workers' compensation. We \nbelieve in workers' safety. We believe in human rights. All of that is \nabout the labor movement.\n  You can support labor rights in Guatemala, but you better be damned \nsure you are supporting labor rights in Wilmington and Columbus and \nCleveland and Detroit and Dover, DE, and everywhere else. Those were \nsome of the words Secretary Clinton said. I am obviously expanding on \nthem.\n  I looked back in history and some of the worst governments we ever \nhad, do you know the first thing they did? They went after the trade \nunions. Hitler didn't want unions. Stalin didn't want unions. Mubarak \ndidn't want unions. These autocrats in history did not want independent \nunions. So when I see Egypt or I see old Soviet Russia and history \ntells me about Germany--I am not comparing what is happening to the \nworkers in Madison or in Columbus to Hitler and Stalin. But I am \nsaying, history teaches us that unions are a very positive force in \nsociety that creates a middle class and that protects our freedom.\n  So don't tell me you support unions internationally but you don't \nsupport unions here. Don't tell me you support collective bargaining in \nPoland but you oppose collective bargaining in Zanesville or Dayton, \nOH, because, frankly, that is inconsistent and ultimately it is not \ntaking the side of people whom we are supposed to represent.\n  I am proud of my State. About two or three blocks from the capitol, \nin 1876, the capitol in Columbus, the American Federation of Labor was \nformed. What we know now as the AFL/CIO began in Columbus, OH, in 1876, \nwhen some workers got together thinking there was some strength and \nsome safety in numbers and they were going to have a better standard of \nliving and better country and more freedom for all if they began to \ncoalesce in a group of people--not to bust a hole in the State budget, \nnot to hurt companies but to make sure the workers were represented and \nget a fair shake in the society.\n  It is all pretty simple. We have a strong middle class in this \ncountry because we have the right to organize and bargain collectively. \nWe have a strong middle class in this country because we are a \ndemocracy, because workers can share in some of the wealth they create \nfor their employers. So I hope 10 years from now--I know in Delaware \nthis is something we fought for with manufacturing and middle class and \nall--we will see, as productivity goes up and profits go up, that \nworkers' wages will go up too. It is the American way. It is what we \nstand for. Nothing in our society, frankly, is more important than a \nprosperous middle class and what it brings to us in terms of freedom \nand equality.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, I am here representing 150 million women \nin the United States of America, and they are bewitched, bothered, and \nbewildered by what the Congress, particularly the House of \nRepresentatives, in H.R. 1, has done to women.\n  Women all over America have to balance their family budgets, so they \nknow our United States of America needs to get its fiscal act together. \nThey also know we need to live in a more frugal time. They understand \nthat. But what they do not understand is that in H.R. 1, with what the \nHouse did, the entire burden has come from a very limited amount in \ndiscretionary spending. When you take off defense, homeland security, \nwomen and children are actually thrown under the bus. Well, they are \nmad as hell, and they don't want to take it anymore. So the Democratic \nwomen today, in the hour we have been given, are going to lay out the \nconsequences of what H.R. 1 means.\n  Now, we in the Senate, and we, your appropriators--of which there are \nmany women on the committee: Landrieu, Feinstein, Mikulski, Murray--we \nknow we have to bring about fiscal discipline. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee has already worked to reduce the \nappropriations in the Senate by $41 billion. Now that is really meat \nand potatoes. So we feel we have already given an option, but, my god, \nenough is enough.\n  Let me give you just the top 10 reasons why H.R. 1 is bad for women \nand children and examine why we are ready to negotiate so we do not \nhave a shutdown of the government. We need a final settlement on the \nbudget for 2011.\n  Let's just go through them. One, it defunds the entire health care \nreform law. That is bad for saving lives and saving money. It also \neliminates title X family planning money. It jeopardizes breast cancer \nand cervical cancer screenings for more than 5 million low-income \nwomen. They even went after Head Start. Even little kids in Head Start \nhad to take it on the chin. It is going to cause 218,000 children to be \nkicked off of it. But they go further. For the group who says they are \npro family, family values, and that they have to defend life, yet they \nslash the nutrition programs for pregnant women by $747 million, \naffecting 10 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers, and \nchildren. They also cut funding for prenatal care, and they went after \nafterschool programs.\n  They cut funding for Pell grants. They terminate funding that helps \nschools comply with title IX. They cut funding for job training, which \nhurts over 8 million workers, many of them getting new training for the \nnew jobs for the new economy. And something very near and dear, I know, \nto the Presiding Officer: they went not after Social Security in terms \nof the benefits but went after the people who work at Social Security--\nthe Social Security offices where they work on everything from the \nregular Social Security benefit to the disability benefit. If H.R. 1 \npasses, over 2,500 people at Social Security will be laid off. In my \nhome State, they were out in the streets in front of the Social \nSecurity headquarters saying: What about us? We come every day. We give \nyou the actuarial information on how to keep it solvent. We make sure \nchecks are out there on time, and in snowstorms we are showing up to \nmake sure everything works. But at the end of the day, we are going to \nbe told we are nonessential.\n  This whole nonessential drives me crazy because, ironically, Members \nof Congress are considered during a government shutdown. Well, if we \nare going to be essential, we need to get real about how we come to an \nagreement on this Continuing Resolution.\n  So, Mr. President, we in the Senate feel we have given $41 billion \nalready, and we think H.R. 1 just goes too far. It goes too far by \nleaving so many things off the table.\n  Now I want to talk about health care reform. We had many goals during \nhealth care reform, one of which was to expand universal access. Again, \nthe Presiding Officer has been a champion of that, a stalwart defender \nof the public option, and a stalwart defender of the single-payer \nsystem. As we worked on it and came up with a compromise, what was very \nclear was that there were certain things we just had to do. One was--\nwhether you were for the public option or not, whether you are for a \nsingle-payer system or the system\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\nwe have now--we knew we had to end the punitive practices of insurance \ncompanies.\n  We knew in the health care reform bill we also had to improve quality \nmeasures that would actually save lives and save money. We also knew \nthat if we had a strong preventive care benefit, we, once again, \nthrough early detection and screening, could minimize the cost to the \ninsurance companies and the Federal budget and also the terrible cost \nto families who face all kinds of problems but particularly cancer. So \nthat is why we passed the health care reform.\n  Over in the House, they thought it was going to be really cool to \nsay: We could repeal health care--remember, they said ``repeal and \nreplace.'' They have only talked about repeal because they do not know \nhow to replace. So they decided, through H.R. 1, to defund it, to take \nthe money away. So let me just outline very quickly what we think it \nmeans to women and children.\n  First of all, we ended gender discrimination by the insurance \ncompanies. Before we reformed health care, women were charged 40 \npercent more in many instances for health care premiums as compared to \nmen of comparable age and health care status--40 percent more. There \nwas a gender tax of 40 percent put on by the insurance companies. We \nended that.\n  The second thing is that the insurance companies were treating simply \nbeing a woman as a preexisting condition. So we went to the floor, and \nwith the great guys of the Senate we passed the preventive health care \namendment. We wouldn't let them take our mammograms away from us. We \nalso made sure our children could have early detection and screening in \nschools. And, because it is not about gender, it is about an agenda--we \nincluded men in these preventive health services as well.\n  Now, if we agree to that element in H.R. 1, we will take away the \npreventive health care benefits. They guarantee coverage of preventive \ncare and screenings, such as mammograms for women under 50. We cannot \ngo back.\n  It would also repeal the quality measures, such as the famous \nPronovost checklist developed in Maryland by a Hopkins doc. When used \nat just Michigan hospitals alone, it is a simple, low-tech way to lower \nin-house infections in hospitals. In Michigan hospitals, it has saved \n2,000 lives and has saved the State $200 million each year.\n  We can do this. There are so many things that are important in the \nhealth care reform bill. We cannot defund it.\n  As we move ahead in what we hope will be a negotiation and a \nsettlement, we, the women of the Senate, will not surrender the women \nand children of this country. We will not let them be thrown under the \nbus and run over by H.R. 1.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the floor to one of our very able \nadvocates, someone who has been a stalwart defender of childcare in our \ncountry, Senator Patty Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nbeing our fearless leader and making sure women have had a voice at the \ntable for many years. I wish to thank her for leading this important \ndebate and discussion today about how H.R. 1 will affect women and \nchildren in this country in a very dramatic and very troubling way.\n  Since Wall Street came crashing down on Main Street, I have been very \nproud to work with so many of my colleagues on efforts to get our \neconomy back on track and our workers back on the job. We all know we \nhave a long way to go. So many families in our country today are \nfighting to stay in their homes. Small businesses are struggling to \nkeep their doors open. Many of our workers are still trying desperately \nto find work or they stay up at night wondering what would happen to \nthem and their families if they are the next ones to get a pink slip. \nSo that is why I am so disappointed that at the very moment we need to \nbe working together to invest in our future, cut spending responsibly, \nand support those American families, House Republicans have decided to \ntake a slash-and-burn approach to the budget that would devastate our \neconomy and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  While many Republicans came to this Congress this year promising to \nwork with Democrats to focus on the economy, they have now chosen \ninstead to push their extreme, antichoice agenda of a minority of \nAmericans who want to go further than ever to restrict health care \noptions for women and families. So I am here this afternoon with my \nwomen Senate colleagues to talk about that aspect of the budget \nproposal they sent to us because this assault on women's health will be \ntruly devastating if it is acted, and this extreme agenda does \nnothing--nothing--to further our goals of getting our economy back on \ntrack.\n  The House Republican-proposed budget they sent to us completely \neliminates title X funding. That is funding for family planning and \nteen pregnancy prevention. And it includes an amendment that completely \ndenies funding for Planned Parenthood. That is so wrong. It would be \nabsolutely devastating for 3 million men and women across the country \nwho depend on those services.\n  I recently got a letter from a woman named Elizabeth. She lives in \nBellingham, WA. She is 28 years old. Elizabeth told me she is \nuninsured, and she depends on her local Planned Parenthood for her \nannual checkups and for family planning. She told me that cervical and \nbreast cancer run in her family, and she does not know what she and her \nhusband would do if she was not able to access this care that Planned \nParenthood provides.\n  Elizabeth is not alone. I have received hundreds of letters just like \nhers, women telling me about the health care they got at Planned \nParenthood and the critical services title X allows them to access.\n  Title X supports cancer screenings, family planning, and preventive \nservices for more than 5 million low-income men and women and families \nacross this country. In my home State of Washington, more than 100,000 \npatients who otherwise would not have access to care are able to \nreceive treatment thanks to these services. The House Republican plan \nwould devastate this for women, and honestly, it just does not make \nsense. In my home State alone, family planning services at title X-\nfunded health care centers prevent over 21,000 unintended pregnancies \nevery year. Without these services, our States and the Federal \nGovernment would end up spending far more in services for low-income \nfamilies over the long run. So cutting off these important programs \nwould be wrong, and I am going to do everything I can to stop it right \nhere in the Senate by fighting alongside my women colleagues.\n  That is not all the House Republicans are proposing in their extreme \nbudget. They want to slash nutrition programs for women and children by \n$747 million. That would end support for close to 10 million pregnant \nwomen, new moms, and infants in the country. That is not what we stand \nfor.\n  They want to cut funding for prenatal care by $50 million. That is \ngoing to jeopardize care for 2.5 million women and 31 million children. \nThat is not what we stand for.\n  They want to cut $39 million from the childcare and development block \ngrant that would end the child support many low-income families need so \nthe parents can go out and work and put food on the table. That is not \nwhat this country stands for.\n  They want to slash $1 billion from Head Start. That not only cuts off \ncomprehensive early childhood services for nearly 1 million children, \nbut it puts tens of thousands of teachers and staff out of a job. Guess \nwhat. Most of them are women.\n  The House antifamily agenda is wrong, and we are not going to stand \nfor it. We do need to cut the budget. We do need to work together to \nbring down the deficit. But we are not going to do it on the backs of \nwomen and children. We are going to do it responsibly. We are going to \ndo it right. I have said many times on this floor a budget is a \nstatement of our values. It is a reflection of our priorities as a \nnation. I feel very strongly that we do need to work together to invest \nin our future and get our economy back on track, put people back to \nwork, and make sure families get the support they need so they feel \nsecure again. The House Republican spending fails to meet those goals. \nIt\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\nfails our women, it fails our families, it fails our communities, and \nit fails our Nation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject the House Republican slash-and-burn \napproach on the backs of women and children and families and work with \nus to propose a responsible long-term budget reduction plan that \nreflects the values for which this country stands.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New York, \nMrs. Gillibrand. Although our newest Democratic Senator, she has been a \nstrong advocate, and she is not new to being a strong advocate. I yield \nher 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her \nleadership.\n  I rise today to join my colleagues and speak out about the failure \nthat is taking place on the other side of Capitol Hill right now in the \nRepublican-controlled House. The election last November was not a \nmandate for any one political party or extreme ideology. It was a \nmandate for action--for solutions that will create jobs and get our \neconomy moving again. But rather than focusing on jobs and responsible \nbudgeting, House Republicans have engaged in an all-out assault on the \nhealth and well-being of women, children, and families in America.\n  The American people voted overwhelmingly for debate on economic \nsolutions that will create jobs. That is what many of my colleagues and \nI have been trying to focus on during this Congress. But what are the \nHouse Republicans focused on? Not creating jobs, not creating ideas for \nhow we are going to create economic growth, but undermining the health \ncare rights of millions of American women and families.\n  We have an undeniable job crisis on our hands and they are ignoring \nit. Unemployment is still far too high. Having a national rate of close \nto 10 percent means real unemployment is closer to 15 or 20 percent \nwhen we look at all of those who are underemployed, working less hours, \nor who are no longer looking for work. Twenty-two percent of our \nyoungest veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan are unemployed. \nThat is more than one in five. What are they doing to address those \nproblems?\n  Rather than debating the solutions for how we create this economic \ngrowth or how we spur growth among small businesses and how we help our \nmiddle-class families, they are focused on degrading women's rights--\nbasic privileges and health care priorities and safety nets for the \nwomen and children who are most at risk in this country. They have \nshown a heinous disregard for the health and safety of women and young \ngirls, and they have worked to undermine their ability to buy \naffordable, accessible health care.\n  Republicans lament at length that government is too intrusive, too \nlarge, too overblown. But tell me: What is more intrusive than telling \nevery woman in America that their decisions are going to be made in \nCongress, not by them, not by their doctors, not by their families?\n  Let's look at the facts. The temporary budget bill that came out of \nthe House slashes critical funding for prenatal care, that unbelievably \nimportant care when a woman is expecting. They have cut nearly $750 \nmillion from nutrition programs for pregnant women and their children. \nThey have cut access to lifesaving breast and cervical cancer \nscreenings for more than 5 million American women. Their budget \ndestroys early childhood education, taking nearly $1 billion from Head \nStart and nearly $40 million from childcare, robbing nearly 370,000 \nAmerican children of early childhood learning. They have even cut more \nthan $2 billion from job training programs that we need to prepare \nAmerica's workforce for the jobs of today and the jobs of tomorrow.\n  What kind of priorities does that demonstrate? It demonstrates a \ndisregard for the future of this country--for our children, for our \nwomen, for their health, their well-being, their education, for job \ntraining, for the future. This debate is much more than about where the \ndollar figures lie. It is about what will happen to the women and \nchildren they are now disregarding.\n  Let's look at the single mother who has two jobs and needs this \nsupport to feed her children. Let's look at the young women in every \nState of this country who will now get cancer because they were denied \nthose precancer screenings. Let's look at the children who will never \nwalk through the door of a university because they were denied access \nto the early childhood education that would have prepared them so that \nthey could achieve their God-given potential.\n  We cannot slash and burn our way to a healthy and growing economy. It \nis time these Members of the House get serious about economic growth, \nabout our small businesses, creating access to lending, creating a tax \npolicy that is going to create economic growth. Those are where the \nsolutions lie, not undermining the health, well-being, and future of \nour women and our children and America's prosperity.\n  I now yield the floor to my colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Mikulski has asked that I control \nthe time for our side, so I will stay on the Senate floor. What time \ndoes that time expire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 37\\1/2\\ more minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to speak out along with my colleagues \nfor the women and children in our Nation who would be gravely harmed by \nthe House budget, H.R. 1. I hope we get the chance to vote on that \nHouse budget because I think the American people need to look at what \nis going on with my Republican friends who are in charge of the House \nof Representatives.\n  We all know we need to reduce the deficit, but we also know the right \nway to do it. We did it with President Bill Clinton. We did it with a \nmix of revenue-raisers and smart cuts, plus investments that paid \ndividends. We did it in such a way that we actually had a surplus at \nthe end of the day, and 23 million new jobs.\n  When George W. Bush took over, the surplus was gone and the job \ncreation was gone. Compared to 23 million new jobs, under President \nGeorge W. Bush there were 1 million jobs created, and he left us with \nsoaring deficits and the deepest recession since the Great Depression. \nThat is the story. It has a beginning, a middle, and we are about to \nwrite the end.\n  I will be honest. I will stand with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle who are willing to fight for the people of this country and \nthe middle class of this country.\n  According to leading experts, the budget bill, H.R. 1, would destroy \n700,000 jobs, hurt our families, and, to me--this is my personal \nopinion--it looks as though they have a political vendetta against \nwomen, children, and a healthy environment on which they rely because \nthey need to breathe clean air and drink clean water. All of this is on \nthe chopping block in the House.\n  Let's look at the title X family planning program. It is zeroed out. \nIt is zeroed out in H.R. 1, the House Republican budget. What does \ntitle X do? Title X provides contraceptive services for 4.7 million \nwomen nationwide, almost 5 million women nationwide. It helps prevent \nalmost 1 million unintended pregnancies. Now, here are my friends on \nthe other side joining with us. We are all saying let's make sure we \ncut down on the number of abortions. What is one proven way to do it? \nContraception. They would prevent almost 1 million people from getting \nthat kind of service.\n  Planned Parenthood operates 800 health care centers nationwide. I \nknow my colleagues are very aware of health centers. They provide \n720,000 breast exams nationwide, 730,000 pap tests. What does this \nmean? Hundreds of thousands of women just in California, and millions \nnationwide, go to Planned Parenthood to make sure they don't have \nbreast cancer, they don't have cervical cancer, they don't have an STD, \nthey don't have AIDS. And if, God forbid, it turns out they have any of \nthese things, they can get treated. Without this, they are in deep \ntrouble. Everyone in America knows early detection is where it is at. \nSo if I said the impact of the Republican budget would mean more \nabortions, more breast cancer, more cervical cancer, more STDs,\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nmore AIDS left untreated, that is not hyperbole. It is not an \nunderstatement. That is a fact.\n  I wish to talk about Nicole Sandoval from Pasadena, CA. She wrote to \nme and said: Please support Planned Parenthood because--by the way, our \ncolleagues eliminate Planned Parenthood getting $1 of Federal funding. \nWhat are they implying? That the funds are used for abortion services. \nThat is an outright lie. Since the 1970s, the Hyde amendment has said \nnot one penny of Federal funds may be used for providing abortions, so \nthey know that is an untruth. Yet they let it hang out there. The money \nPlanned Parenthood gets is for just what I said: cancer prevention, \nsexually transmitted disease prevention, and contraception.\n  So what does Nicole say? She was 23 years old. She had no insurance. \nPlanned Parenthood was there for her and caught her cervical cancer \nearly enough to save her life. So I stand with Nicole Sandoval.\n  I am here to stand with Leah Garrard from Torrance. She wrote to me \nabout a horrific incident in which a member of her family was raped. \nThis young woman went to Planned Parenthood. She didn't know where else \nto go. She wrote and said: Planned Parenthood directed her family \nmember to a local hospital, got in touch with the local sexual assault \nnurse examiner, and contacted her family to come and take care of her. \nHad her family member not gone to Planned Parenthood, she truly, she \nwrote, would not have survived that experience. I stand with Leah and \nher family and with Planned Parenthood.\n  Zero out Planned Parenthood? Where are we going? We are certainly not \ngoing forward. We are going backward. I remember the years when George \nHerbert Walker Bush was on the board of Planned Parenthood. Planned \nParenthood is a bipartisan operation. If you walk in the door, they \ndon't ask whether you are a Democrat, Republican, registered voter, or \nwho you are. You get taken care of, and the community is healthier.\n  Now, in the remaining time I wish to talk about the attack on the \nenvironment in which women and children have to live. The attack on the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is the biggest cut of any agency in the \nFederal Government by our Republican friends over in the House.\n  Seventy percent of the American people say the Environmental \nProtection Agency should do its job. Sixty-nine percent think the EPA \nshould update EPA Clean Air Act standards with stricter air pollution \nlimits. Sixty-eight percent believe Congress should not stop EPA from \nenforcing Clean Air Act standards.\n  Sixty-nine percent believe that EPA scientists--not Congress--should \nset pollution standards. Look at this. In this tough time, when the \ncountry is divided, almost 70 percent of our people say leave EPA \nalone. But, no, our Republican friends whack that agency by one-third--\nbillions of dollars--and not only that, instruct that agency with \nriders telling them they can't enforce air pollution standards for \nsoot. We know what happens when you are exposed to soot. We are looking \nat other exposures as well--small particulate matter which gets into \nour lungs and is lodged in our lungs.\n  They say we can't look at cement manufacturing and go after the \nmercury that comes out of those stacks--the mercury and arsenic. Do we \nthink the American people want dirtier air? Is that what the election \nwas about? I just came out of a tough election. I have to tell you that \nnot one person ever came up to me and said: Please, I want more soot. I \nneed more smog. It is missing out of my life. Oh my God, when my kids \ndrink water, I want them to get contaminated.\n  Forget it. That is not what the election was about. It was about \njobs, jobs, jobs. OK. Let's look at a photo of a child who pays the \nprice when the air is dirty. Children's exposure to air pollution \nworsens asthma attacks and causes lost days at school, emergency room \nvisits, and for older people, it causes heart attacks, stroke, cancer, \nand premature death. According to the American Lung Association--and we \nhave another picture--asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases \nin children. It affects 7 million children. Here is a photo of another \nbeautiful baby. I am showing you this as a grandma. I am going to take \nanother 2 minutes and then turn it over to Senator Shaheen.\n  Look at this picture, this face. Look at those eyes. I wish to say to \nour friends in the House, what are you doing? You are throwing women \nand children under the bus. You are throwing the middle class under the \nbus. I, for one, am going to tell the truth. During my campaign, people \nwould say: What are you going to do to win? How are you going to win? I \nsaid: I have a secret plan. I am going to tell the truth. I am going to \njust lay it out there.\n  Look, the truth is, EPA released a new report that was asked for by \nCongress. Congress demanded to know the benefit of the clean air law. \nThey said that, in 2010 alone, 160,000 cases of premature deaths were \navoided. Can you believe that? They want to turn all this back. The \nAmerican Lung Association says H.R. 1 is toxic to the public health. \nThey say it would result in millions of Americans, including kids, \nseniors, and people with chronic disease, such as asthma, being forced \nto breathe air that is unhealthy. It can cause asthma, heart attacks, \nstrokes, cancer, and shorten lives.\n  A Republican President set up the EPA--a Republican President--\nRichard Nixon. What are you doing over there? I already said that \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush was on the board of Planned Parenthood. \nRichard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act. They don't either seem to have \na sense of history or they have moved so far away from some of the \nproud traditions of their party that they have lost total touch.\n  In closing, we have to stop this war against women and against \nchildren. We are going to have to stop this war against the \nenvironment. We are going to come forward with deficit reduction that \nwill equal what they do, but we will do it in a way that doesn't hurt \njob creation and doesn't hurt our kids, our families, and the \nenvironment we all depend upon.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the devastating \nimpact that H.R. 1, the House Republican continuing resolution, would \nhave on women, children, and families nationwide.\n  House Republicans would eliminate the $317 million title X Family \nPlanning Program, which provides critical health care services to over \n5 million Americans each year, including 1.2 million in California.\n  House Republicans would also exclude Planned Parenthood, which serves \nover 2.9 million women annually, from Federal funds. These services \nprovide necessary preventive health care including: contraceptive \nservices, education, cancer screening, annual exams, STD and HIV \ntesting, smoking cessation, flu vaccines, and well baby care.\n  It is ironic for people who do not believe in abortion to propose \nthese cuts, when in fact, through family planning, contraception, and \neducation, title X programs prevented 406,000 abortions nationwide in \n2008 alone; 83,600 of those were prevented in California. So by cutting \nthese programs, the numbers of unplanned pregnancies and abortions will \nincrease.\n  How does this make sense? These cuts are not about deficit reduction. \nThey are biased, politically motivated cuts that will result in \nincreased Federal spending. These cuts hurt women. In California alone, \nthese programs helped save $581 million in public funds in 2008.\n  Nationwide, title-X supported family planning centers saved taxpayers \n$3.4 billion in 2008. Every dollar invested in helping women avoid \nunintended pregnancies is estimated to save taxpayers $4.02. Some might \nnot think these programs are important, but I judge they are.\n  In the past 3 weeks alone, I have received 28,000 letters urging me \nto oppose eliminating title X and Planned Parenthood.\n  Over 153,000 Californians have signed a petition to express their \nopposition towards defunding Planned Parenthood.\n  I have heard from uninsured college students, who only make $10,000 a \nyear and cannot afford basic preventive care without title X and \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  I have heard from outraged constituents who point out title X family \nplanning programs have been in place since\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\n1970, and have provided cancer screening, annual exams, and prenatal \ncare for millions of women.\n  I have heard from young women who went to Planned Parenthood for STD \nscreening and birth control, when they had no other place to go. Half \nof all pregnancies in the United States every year--about 3 million \npregnancies--are unplanned.\n  I have heard from women pleading with me to preserve Federal funding \nto Planned Parenthood; telling me that the cancer screenings they \nreceived saved their lives. I have heard from women all over my State, \nwhose primary source of health care is a women's health center like \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Eliminating this funding will also cause a rise in another epidemic: \nteen pregnancy. Teen pregnancy costs taxpayers an estimated $9.1 \nbillion annually. Without title X programs in California, teen \npregnancy levels would have been almost 40 percent greater.\n  House Republicans would also eliminate the $110 million Teen \nPregnancy Prevention Program, which has the potential to serve 800,000 \nteens by 2014. In California, the estimated cost from teen pregnancy to \ntaxpayers in 2004 was at least $896 million. From 1991-2004, unintended \nteen births in California cost taxpayers a total of $17.3 billion.\n  California has managed, through programs like the Teen Pregnancy \nPrevention Program, to reduce the rate of teen birth in the State by 46 \npercent from 1991 to 2004. This saved California taxpayers an estimated \n$1.1 billion in 2004 alone. The House Republicans plan to slash funding \nall but guarantees the rate of teen pregnancy will go up, and costs for \ntaxpayers will increase.\n  Almost 9 in 10 adults believe there should be direct efforts in \ncommunities to prevent teen pregnancy. Once again, this is not about \ndeficit reduction; it is about harming women's health, and taking away \ncomprehensive education.\n  House Republicans would also cut $1.3 billion from Community Health \nCenters, which is 45.8 percent below fiscal year 2010 levels. Community \nHealth Centers serve over 20 million patients nationwide, who otherwise \ncannot receive care.\n  Almost one-third of patients are women of childbearing age, 37 \npercent are age 19 and under, and 13 percent are children under 6. \nNinety two percent of this patient population is low income, meaning \nthey may not have anywhere else to go. With these cuts, 11 million \npatients are at risk of losing access to primary and preventive care \nprovided by these health centers.\n  In California, almost 458,000 patients would immediately lose access \nto care, and $31.8 million in funding would be immediately lost. By \ndefunding the health reform law, House Republicans block critical \nconsumer protections in the law.\n  The health reform law will decrease costs for everyone, but \nparticularly for women who have been charged more for insurance, simply \nbecause of gender. In 2014, insurers will not be able to charge women \nhigher premiums than they charge men. Additionally, the medical loss \nratio requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 or 85 percent \nof premium dollars on actual medical care, not on profits. With these \nand other benefits in the law, women make great strides towards \nequality in the insurance market.\n  The House Republicans plan would allow women to be charged more for \ninsurance than men, and prohibit enforcement of this medical loss ratio \nrequirement. This would allow insurance companies to discriminate \nagainst women, charging more for health premiums simply because of \ngender, while companies continue to rake in enormous profits.\n  The assault on women's health from Republicans in the House is \nastounding to me. Obliterating family planning services that have been \naround for 40 years, slashing teen pregnancy prevention, prohibiting \nfunds for primary health services is nothing short of irresponsible.\n  We need to look carefully at our spending and we need to make cuts, \nbut those cuts can't be politically motivated and they shouldn't put us \nat risk of another recession. I do not support any biased cuts that \nharm women and children.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my honor to yield to Senator Shaheen for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer for her \nleadership. I thank Senator Mikulski for the work she has done to \norganize us this afternoon, to point out just what is being proposed by \nour colleagues in the other Chamber.\n  We need to address our long-term deficit. We all know that. We need \nto make some hard choices to balance the budget. But there is a right \nway and a wrong way to do that. The right way is to first look at \nthings such as eliminating the billions of dollars in duplicative \nprograms that were identified just this week by the GAO. The wrong way \nis to address the deficit by doing what our colleagues in the House did \nwhen they slashed funding for services that are critical to middle-\nclass families and our future prosperity.\n  The House Republican budget cuts include a $1.1 billion cut to Head \nStart and childcare. This is money that is critical to so many working \nfamilies in New Hampshire and across the country. Let me put it into \nperspective. A cut this size would mean that nationally over 200,000 \nchildren would be kicked out of Head Start and an additional 360,000 \nchildren would lose childcare opportunities.\n  I have three daughters and seven grandchildren. So I understand, like \nso many mothers do, how difficult it is to juggle work and family \nobligations. I appreciate how important it is for working parents to \nunderstand that their children are being supervised by quality \ncaregivers. I also understand that a working parent can be a productive \nmember of the workforce only when they know their children are safe.\n  When I was Governor, we asked for a report to be done on childcare in \nNew Hampshire. We found in that report that there is a direct result \nbetween quality childcare and the productivity of their parents in the \nworkforce. Childcare is expensive. Quality childcare can easily top \n$10,000 per child per year--an amount that is out of reach for so many \nworking families who are trying to make ends meet--especially in this \neconomy.\n  The unemployment rate in this country is 9 percent. We should be \nputting our focus on creating jobs today and helping to build a strong \nworkforce for the future. The proposed budget that the House \nRepublicans have done would do the opposite.\n  Research shows that the quality care and early childhood development \nis critical to preparing our children for tomorrow's jobs. We know that \nthe first 5 years are the most important in the development of a \nchild's brain. During these years, children develop their cognitive, \nsocial, emotional, and language skills that form a solid foundation for \ntheir lives.\n  Economists point to the strong return on investment we get for \nintervention early in life. For every $1 we spend on quality early \nlearning, we return up to $17. These same experts cite an increase in \nproductivity, workforce readiness, and in graduation rates among \nchildren who are in quality early childhood programs. In addition, they \nhave also found out that for those children there is a decrease in \nspecial education, crime rates, welfare dependency, and in other \nbehavioral problems.\n  One of the things that made me aware of this direct relationship was \ngoing to my first Governors' conference after I got elected. I heard a \npresentation on brain development. The presenter showed that the brain \nscan of a child who had quality early learning looked very different \nthan the brain scan of those children who did not. They showed a graph \nthat demonstrated that the way a child's brain develops is inversely \nproportional to our investment. In other words, we are making the \nsmallest investments in the years when it would make the most impact on \nhow a child develops. This made such an impression on me that I went \nback home to New Hampshire and focused so much of my time as Governor \non the importance of early learning.\n  When I became chair of the education commission of the State in my \nsecond term as Governor, this became the top priority for me and for \nECS. There is no doubt--and we can look at all the\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\ndata--that helping working families afford quality childhood care and \neducation programs has immediate and long-term benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the shortsighted, reckless cuts that \nhave been made in the House Republican budget and, instead, invest in \nour future and the future of our children and families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire. I yield 5 \nminutes to Senator Kay Hagan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I also rise to speak for women and \nchildren across this country but especially in North Carolina.\n  Prenatal and postnatal maternal care translates into healthy moms and \nhealthy families.\n  Children who receive regular well-child visits to their doctors and \nrecommended immunizations live healthier lives. They can go to school \nand just be kids.\n  But the House-passed continuing resolution for the remainder of \nfiscal year 2011 makes draconian cuts to community health centers and \nthe title V maternal child health block grant--two programs that are \nvital in reducing maternal and child mortality.\n  If these cuts go through, nearly 4 and a half million women and \nchildren under age 6 are at risk of losing care.\n  Consider that community health centers account for 17.2 percent of \nall low-income births, but prenatal patients at health centers are less \nlikely to give birth to low birth weight babies compared to their \ncounterparts nationally. It is because they are getting good prenatal \ncare.\n  Moreover, rates of vaccination among children receiving regular care \nat a health center are uniformly higher than those of children with \nanother source of care.\n  With the House-proposed cuts, pregnant women and children, who rely \non community health centers for care, will be left with literally \nnowhere to turn for health care.\n  By slashing $50 million in funding from the maternal child health \nblock grant program, the House bill would dramatically curtail services \nto the 35 million women and children across this country, including the \nnearly half a million women and children in North Carolina who receive \nsuch services as newborn hearing screenings and postnatal care.\n  In North Carolina, infants born to minorities are twice as likely to \ndie as those born to Caucasians. However, the Healthy Beginnings \nProgram is working to reverse infant mortality and low birth weights \namong minorities in North Carolina.\n  Healthy Beginnings provides case management, general health \neducation, and other support for at-risk women throughout their \npregnancy and until their child turns two. In 3 years, this initiative \nreduced infant mortality by 60 percent in participating communities.\n  Also, early detection of permanent hearing loss is essential for \nchildren to progress at age-appropriate rates.\n  Research shows that by the time a child with hearing loss graduates \nfrom high school, more than $400,000 per child can be saved in special \neducation costs if the child is identified early and given appropriate \neducational, medical, and audiological services.\n  The North Carolina Early Hearing Detection and Intervention, EHDI, \nProgram was established in 1999 as part of the State's title V Maternal \nand Child Health Program.\n  Since the establishment of the EHDI Program, there has been a \nremarkable increase in the percentage of infants screened in the State. \nAll neonatal facilities in North Carolina offer initial newborn hearing \nscreening prior to infant discharge.\n  In 2009, 96 percent of infants completed newborn hearing screening--\nabout 100,000; 450 children receive hearing aids or cochlear implants \nannually through a contract funded by the maternal and child health \nblock grant.\n  I heard from three families in North Carolina--all whose children \nfailed the screening tests. Their stories were heartwrenching as they \ndescribed their hours-old babies not being able to hear their parents' \nfirst words to them.\n  But in all three families, the hearing loss was detected as part of \nthe newborn screening, and the North Carolina EHDI program immediately \nprovided them with followup and hearing aids or cochlear implants. As a \nresult of these programs, in each of these families, the child is ahead \nof their peers verbally.\n\n  These are just two critical programs that are funded by the title V \nmaternal and child health block grant. As we can see, these are not \njust statistics but real women and kids and families who benefit from \nthis important program.\n  I strongly believe we have to work together to get our country back \non solid fiscal ground. I am very much concerned about it and want to \nwork on it. But the path we are on is obviously unsustainable. In fact, \nI was one of the Senators who advocated for the creation of the Bowles-\nSimpson fiscal commission. But our fiscal challenges require a \nthoughtful bipartisan solution that gets us on the right track and \nencourages economic growth. These cuts are simply counterproductive. We \ncannot balance the budget on the backs of our Nation's future--our \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hagan for her remarks. She \nis one of the leaders in the Senate in finding solutions to the deficit \nthat do not kill jobs and do deficit reduction in the right way. I \nthank her.\n  She made the point that when we attack kids and pregnant women, at \nthe end of the day it is morally reprehensible, but in addition to that \nit costs money. That point was made beautifully.\n  It is an honor to yield 10 minutes to a great colleague, Senator \nMaria Cantwell from Washington State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher leadership and her articulation on the floor earlier about the \nrider that is on H.R. 1 that would undo what the Supreme Court said EPA \nshould do, which is to make sure the Clean Air Act is enforced.\n  I thought the comments of the Senator from California about no one in \nCalifornia telling her they wanted more smog was a very profound \nstatement because that is what people are saying when they try to do a \nrider: EPA, do not enforce the law the Supreme Court told you to \nenforce. It is as if they are jamming down small children across the \ncountry air and air quality that is something less than sufficient. We \nknow that. We know that because it is based on science. That is what \nEPA has said, and that is what the Supreme Court has said they should \nenforce. Yet here we are, in the middle of all of this, the solution to \nour economy is to have a rider on legislation basically saying: Do not \nenforce what the Supreme Court says is the Clean Air Act.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her leadership on this issue.\n  I come to the floor to join my other colleagues because I think the \nAmerican people sent a clear message. They want us to focus on creating \njobs, promoting innovation, and putting people back to work. That is \nwhat we are trying to do in the Senate.\n  But in the House, the Republicans seem to be saying: Let's cut \nprograms and vital services to working women and families, and somehow \nthat will generate economic growth. Instead of creating jobs, all they \nhave done is launched a war on women.\n  H.R. 1 would eliminate funding for title X, which would provide \nhealth services, including family planning, breast and cervical cancer \nscreenings, and other preventive health care. This certainly would \nimpact low-income women. It does not create jobs. There is nothing in \nwhat I just said with regard to these cuts that would create jobs. How \nare jobs created out of cutting those services? It is actually an \nattack on access to health care. When we do not have healthy people, I \nguarantee you, Mr. President, we end up with bad economic consequences.\n  The bill also cuts funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs and \nfunding for Planned Parenthood centers that serve more than 3 million \nwomen each year, jeopardizing, again, access to critical preventive \nhealth services.\n  Just in the State of Washington, we have 39 centers and serve over \n130,000\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\npatients annually and administer over 170,000 tests for sexually \ntransmitted infections. One of my constituents was diagnosed at age 22 \nwith abnormal cell growth on her cervix wall. She went to a Planned \nParenthood clinic. Why? Because she did not have health insurance. In \nfact, quoting her, she said:\n\n       I would not have scheduled an annual exam on my own. \n     Without Planned Parenthood, I may have died or lost my \n     ability to have children in the future. . . . Aside from \n     these personal effects, as an uninsured student, I would have \n     been a huge financial burden to my family and my community.\n\n  There it is. Planned Parenthood has been effective in preventing over \n40,000 pregnancies and diverting $160 million back to the State, which \nwe need in these tough economic times.\n  Instead of supporting women and families so they can be productive \nparts of our economy, Republicans are continuing to turn the clock back \non hard-fought access to healthy services and attacking a woman's right \nto choose. Their proposal would deny women using flexible spending \naccounts, from using pretax dollars for insurance to cover a wide range \nof reproductive choices; deny small businesses their tax credits if \nthey choose employee health coverage that includes reproductive health \ncare; and would disallow tax deductions for health insurance for the \nself-employed if the insurance included reproductive health care.\n  The Republican answer to the economy is attack reproductive health \ncare? It seems to me that these proposals are just about attacking the \nmost vulnerable in our society, including the elderly where they would \nhave an impact on services for the elderly, including meals, housing, \nand employment services.\n  Women comprise two-thirds of our elderly, and they would be harmed \nmost by these cuts. For example, in 2009, 25 percent of all families \nwith children were female head of households, and 78 percent of mothers \nwith children between the ages of 6 and 17 were in the labor force. \nThat is a big percentage. Therefore, cutting programs that support \nworking mothers, such as job training, childcare, education, and health \ncare will impact those families' ability to be productive members of \nour economy.\n  I personally do not understand why in the world at this point in \ntime, with this high unemployment rate, we would ever cut job training \nprograms. I can tell you, I travel the State of Washington and I \nconstantly hear, even in these hard economic times, employers who \ncannot find the workforce they need to do the jobs. When one thinks \nabout that, when a company cannot find the workforce it needs because \nthere is a skills gap, that is holding that company back from producing \nhigher revenues, from meeting their goals, and from adding stimulus to \nthe economy, all because they cannot find the workforce.\n  Yet we in the Senate are trying to promote workforce training and to \nhave programs that have been tested successes, such as the Workforce \nInvestment Act. For every dollar invested by the Workforce Investment \nAct, it is $10 in stimulating our economy. It is a 1-to-10 ratio. Why \nwould we cut such a program?\n  In Washington State, our local WorkSource Centers have helped over 78 \npercent of job seekers find jobs. It is a high percentage of helping \npeople and placing them.\n  I look at the example of this big decision on Boeing winning the \nrefueling tanker decision. Here we are with 11,000 jobs in Washington \nState and a supply chain that is going to also have more jobs created. \nYet if we do not make an investment in workforce investment that supply \nchain will not be able to find the people to fill those jobs to help \nfulfill this contract. Something as big as a $35 billion contract we \nare involved in because it is the Department of Defense, and yet at the \nsame time the Republicans in the House are saying: Let's cut the \nWorkforce Investment Act--even though we know we have a plane to \ndeliver, even though we know it has a military purpose we support, and \nwe are going to say let's cut programs because somehow that is going to \nmake our economy healthier.\n\n  I can give an example. General Plastics would not have been able to \nkeep its current staff level or grow its business in the past year \nwithout the help of workforce investment dollars. They were in partner \nwith Tacoma Community College and trained a workforce in improvement \ntechniques that allowed the company to streamline its production and \ngrow its business effectively.\n  In the last year, they grew 10 to 15 percent and became more \ncompetitive. They also added about 22 new employees because of \nadditional new business.\n  These are programs that would be cut by the proposal in H.R. 1 that \nthe House Republicans are trying to push. I do not think it would \nimprove our economy. I think it would stall what is a very fragile \nrecovery. Workforce development is economic development, and when \npeople are trained and skilled, the employers get what they need, the \ncommunity prospers, and everybody truly wins--what the President has \ncalled for in winning the future.\n  We need to make sure that we in the Senate stand and say no to these \ncuts, such as in the Workforce Investment Act, in family health, cuts \nin the Pell Grant Program which would be cut by more than $800 per \nstudent or Head Start or Early Start that, again, would impact \nthousands of children in Washington State.\n  In addition, we should not cut what are the healthy elements of our \neconomy but make sure we are helping women and families do what will \nhelp them survive and help them help us with economic recovery.\n  I know some people think this is the way to get our economy going \nagain. But I can tell my colleagues, our economy certainly hit the \niceberg in 2008. But what H.R. 1 does, instead of saying women and \nchildren first, they are basically cutting them off the lifeline they \nneed and cutting off what are essential programs to help us grow jobs \nand have a healthy economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, after consulting with my friends, Senator \nCollins and Senator Sessions, I give Senator Lautenberg until 6 minutes \nafter the hour and then add 6 minutes to the time of the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hope it is noted that I stand here \nas a male Member with my colleagues who comprise a significant part of \nthe women Members of the Senate. They do the mothering, they do the \nfamily raising, but it is pretty obvious to all of us that fathers and \ngrandfathers have an active interest in what happens with our children, \nwhat it takes to make sure they grow up healthy, that they grow up with \nthe tools they will need in their future lives for them to contribute \nto themselves, their families, and the country at large.\n  What we are witnessing in America today is an assault by House \nRepublicans in trying to ram through a reckless, unhealthy spending \nplan that will ultimately bring shame to our country as it causes pain \nfor little children who come from families who do not have the means, \nwho do not have the stability of family life, in many cases, that will \ngive them an opportunity to establish themselves with a cycle that will \nbring them to successful lives later on, to be able to hold jobs of \nsignificance and create a family environment.\n  It is hard when we look at this to figure out the mission. I come \nfrom the business community. I have been here a lot of years--27--but I \nspent 30 years in the business community. I learned something about \nfinancial statements. I learned you have to sometimes cut costs here or \nthere and that sometimes you have to make investments so you can expand \nyour business, you can make it more competitive.\n  As we look at the plan that is being offered, to cut, cut, cut, it \ncauses us to rethink what is taking place, to think outside the box, as \nthey say. There is a lot of applause for cutting costs. There is a \nwhole group of people in the House of Representatives who have targets \nfor cost cutting that will leave America without the tools in the \nfuture to remain competitive and to remain a place where great things \ncan happen. Why is that? A lot of it is because they are cutting \neducation programs--Head Start, for one thing.\n\n  I think every Senator ought to pledge to take a trip through a Head \nStart facility and see what it is like.\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nSee what it is like when you have children, even 1 and 2 years old, in \nthe early Head Start Program or 3, 4 and 5 in the full Head Start \nProgram. See the enthusiasm that exists with these children.\n  I have an indication of that here--this card. It was Valentines Day \nwhen I went to the city of Perth Amboy. Oddly enough, Perth Amboy is \nwhere the first signature on the Bill of Rights was made, in New \nJersey--the Bill of Rights. Here is an opportunity that is certainly a \nright, to be able to learn. I get notes from these children--\nflattering, by the way, and not because of my looks. They say:\n\n       Dear Representatives: We love coming to school. We learn \n     languages. We can be scientists. We can be artists. We can be \n     authors and illustrators. We are lifetime learners.\n\n  Here they talk in less precise handwriting about how nice it is to be \nable to come to school. The design of this makes it a little tougher \npresentation:\n\n       Dear Mr. Representative: We love our preschool class. We \n     learn to write. We explore science. We explore changing \n     things in the world. We love to be here in school.\n\n  We love it when they are there because we know that not only are \ntheir lives going to be improved substantially, but also they are going \nto be contributing citizens to the society we live in.\n  So this is amazing and often neglected. I asked for some indication \nof what happens at Head Start. But let me say, first of all, all those \nchildren are beautiful. I never saw so many beautiful children in my \nlife. I am a professional grandfather. I have 13 grandchildren. My wife \nbrought 3 to the marriage and I had 10. There is nothing like seeing a \n1\\1/2\\-year-old learning, a 2-year-old learning.\n  What we have found is that by the age of 1, most children begin \nlinking words to meanings. They understand the names used to label \nfamiliar objects--body parts, arms, legs, animals, and people. At about \n18 months, they add new words to their vocabulary at the astounding \nrate of one every 2 hours. By age 2, most children have a vocabulary of \nseveral hundred words and can form simple sentences, such as ``Go \noutdoors'' or the traditional ``All gone.'' Between 24 to 30 months, \nchildren speak in longer sentences, and from 30 to 36 months kids can \nusually recite the alphabet and count from 1 to 10. The fact is, they \nare learning something.\n  By kindergarten, kids are beginning to turn the pages of the book, \nand they start learning to read by about 5 years of age. There is a \nreal reward for the country when they do that. Our society receives \nnearly $9 in benefits for every $1 invested in Head Start children. It \nleads to an increase in achievement and lots of good things.\n  I learned a little bit the hard way about what Head Start means when \nI and a business partner of mine went back to a school we went to as \nkids. We went to the sixth grade and offered a scholarship program to \nyoungsters in the sixth grade to pick up a large part of their college \ntuition. For 28 young people in our class, we would contribute toward a \nlarge part of their college tuition if they were accepted at any one of \n30 colleges picked at random. We had counselors, and we brought them \ndown here. I was able to take them on a visit to the White House, where \nVice President Dan Quayle was very generous with his time, and I took \nthem to the company I was running so they could see.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). All time dedicated to the \nmajority has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, you say there is no time left on our \nside for a presentation?\n  I will wrap this up very quickly, if I might. Just a couple words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator continuing?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, if the Senator is truly going to wrap \nit up, I don't object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my colleague and friend from Maine.\n  Very simply, we now see what the problem was. We analyzed it \nthoroughly. The problem was we started too late. In the sixth grade, it \nwas too late to get a learning habit. Now we see these little tots and \nhow quickly they are learning, how quickly they talk, and how quickly \nthey adapt.\n  These children will suffer the pain created by Republicans' cuts--and \nshame on us if we don't stop them. You have to wonder why children are \ntheir No. 1 target? Did children cause the financial crisis? Were Head \nStart kids engaging in credit default swaps with mortgage-backed \nsecurities?\n  You have to wonder if House Republicans think this is the case. They \nwant to decimate Head Start by cutting its funding by $1 billion. If \nthey have their way, roughly one-quarter of all children in Head Start \nwill be kicked out of the program. This includes 3,700 kids in my State \nof New Jersey, like the kids at the Head Start Center I visited last \nweek and the kids who sent these Valentines Day cards. How can we tell \nthese children: Forget about getting a head start. You must go to the \nback of the line.\n  The fact is, the House Republican budget will poison our future. \nTheir prescription for America's kids is toxic. If we want our country \nto succeed, we must invest in its future--and that means protecting and \ninspiring our children. So let's reject shame and pain. Let's reject \nthe disastrous House Republican budget plan. Let's invest in our kids \nand win the future. Our country's children deserve nothing less.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maine for the courtesy, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1192-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1192-S1193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DOD FUNDING AMENDMENT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to express my deep concern that \nthe Senate has yet to consider the Defense appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2011.\n  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, we should have completed work \non this bill and every other appropriations bill before October 1 of \nlast year. But with the Department of Defense, this is becoming \nincreasingly problematic. For this reason, along with two members of \nthe Republican leadership, Senator Alexander and Senator Barrasso, I \nhave filed an amendment to the patent reform bill that would fund the \nDepartment of Defense for the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  Just think what we have done the last 3 weeks. We took up an FAA \nreauthorization bill. Then we went on recess for a week. And now we are \non a patent reform bill. I don't mean to suggest that FAA and patent \nreform are not important--certainly we could have gone without having a \nrecess--but both of those bills pale in comparison to the urgency of \nproviding our service men and women with the resources they need to \ncarry out their mission.\n  Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, and other military leaders have \nrepeatedly and clearly warned us about the dangers of failing to pass a \nfull-year Defense funding bill. It is hurting our national security and \nharming our readiness. Secretary Gates' put it bluntly, saying: ``The \ncontinuing resolution represents a crisis at our doorstep.'' Deputy \nSecretary of Defense William Lynn testified that ``a year-long CR will \ndamage national security.''\n  At no time in recent memory has Congress failed to pass a Defense \nappropriations bill. Even when there was a year-long continuing \nresolution for most of the government during fiscal year 2007, the \nCongress passed a separate bill funding the Department of Defense. With \ntroops in harm's way, now is not the time to break with that precedent.\n  If we do not provide the authority for the Air Force to buy unmanned \naerial vehicles to fly combat air patrols over Afghanistan, the \nfighting there will not be halted until we do so. If we do not act to \nprovide the $150 million that has been requested to meet the very \nspecific and urgent requirements of our special forces, we will be \nfailing those who are truly on the frontlines.\n  Secretary Gates has made it clear, military readiness will suffer \nbecause of fewer flying hours for our pilots, fewer steaming days for \nour ships, and cutbacks in training for home-stationed forces.\n  A full year's CR will also delay much needed modernization of our \nmilitary equipment. This would come at a time when our Navy is at its \nsmallest size since 1916 and at a time when the aircraft and our Air \nForce inventory are older than at any time since the Air Force was \ncreated. The Navy will not\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\nbe able to procure a second Virginia class submarine nor a DDG-51 \ndestroyer needed to keep costs down and to achieve the minimum size \nfleet--313 ships--that the Navy has stated is the absolute minimum.\n  Operating under a full-year's CR also means that the taxpayers are \ngoing to end up paying more for less. The Navy would likely have to \nrenegotiate some of its procurements. The Army has already shut down \nwork on the Stryker Mobile Gun System that will likely incur additional \ncosts to restart.\n  It is also important to recognize that at a time when the American \npublic is most concerned about jobs and the economy, the Defense \nappropriations bill provides funds that are the source of thousands of \njobs in the United States--jobs that will be lost or at least deferred.\n  The Secretary of the Navy has said that the combined effects of \nfailing to fund the Defense Department will directly affect the \nstrength of the industrial base and that more than 10,000 private \nsector jobs at shipyards, factories, and Navy and Marine Corps \nfacilities across the country will be jeopardized.\n  I could go on and on listing the ways our servicemembers and our DOD \ncivilian workforce and the private sector contractors will be affected \nby our failure to act. There is simply no excuse for this Senate not to \nhave acted last year on a Defense appropriations bill. Surely, we \nshould turn our attention to focusing on the needs of our military \nimmediately, and we should heed the warning of Secretary Gates, who \nsaid:\n\n       That is how you hollow out a military--when your best \n     people, your veterans of multiple combat deployments, become \n     frustrated and demoralized and, as a result, begin leaving \n     military service.\n\n  Let's do what is most important and let's do it now. Let's pass the \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  I wish to thank the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator \nSessions, for yielding me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1193-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1193-S1195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to share some remarks about the \nbudget. I note how pleased I have been to work in this past year with \nthe Presiding Officer on some legislation that I think, had we had just \na couple more votes, we would have made progress and done something \nworthwhile to help ensure that our spending does not range above our \nbudget, as too often has been the case in our country.\n  The fact is the American people, by large numbers from polling data, \nbelieve we are on the wrong track, and the intelligentsia, the \nwitnesses we have had before the Budget Committee--I am ranking member \nof that committee--keep telling us we are on an unsustainable path. \nWitnesses called by the Democrats or Republicans, the professional CBO \nwitnesses from all walks of intellectual and business life, say we are \non an unsustainable debt path. They are not kidding. They meant that, \nand the words mean something. We cannot continue what we are doing.\n  Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently \nsaid:\n\n       I believe that our debt is the greatest threat to our \n     national security. If we as a country do not address our \n     fiscal imbalances in the near-term, our national power will \n     erode and the costs to our ability to maintain and sustain \n     influence could be great.\n\n  He said if we do not address it in the near term--not just in the \nlong term, in the near term.\n  Recently, on February 17, Secretary Geithner, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, appeared before the Budget Committee, and we went over the \nPresident's budget. He was, I will have to say, more candid than was \nOMB Director Jack Lew. I was asking him about the situation we are in \nand the effect of the budget that allows the debt to double in the next \n10 years--causes the debt to do so. He said, ``It is an excessively \nhigh interest burden.''\n  I was asking about the fact that the money we borrow, the debt we \nassume we have to pay interest on.\n\n       It is unsustainable . . . with the President's plan, even \n     if the Congress were to enact it, and even if Congress were \n     to hold to it and reduce those deficits as a percentage of \n     GDP over the next 5 years, we would still be left with a very \n     large interest burden and unsustainable obligations over \n     time.\n\n  It is pretty clear we are on an unsustainable path, and it is pretty \nclear the American people are exactly correct--we are on the wrong \ntrack. We are headed the wrong way. We need to get off of that.\n  So what is it that we have been presented with? We are presented with \na plan. We call it a budget, but it is really the administration's plan \nfor what we are going to collect and spend over the next 10 years. They \ncan plan to raise taxes, they can plan to cut spending, they can plan \nto increase spending and borrow more money. They can plan. That is \ntheir plan.\n  So we got a plan 2 weeks ago. In that, the President told us this:\n\n       What my budget does is put forward some tough choices, some \n     significant spending cuts, so that by the middle of this \n     decade our annual spending will match our annual revenues. We \n     will not be adding more to the national debt.\n\n  That is a pretty clear statement, right? It is actually a \nbreathtaking statement to me because I know how hard it is to do that, \nbut he said it flatly and plainly:\n\n       Our annual spending will match our annual revenues. We will \n     not be adding more to the national debt.\n\n  Jake Tapper, the ABC reporter, at a White House press briefing a \ncouple of weeks ago asked Mr. Carney, the press flack, about this \ndramatic statement. He asked him if he thought ``we will not be adding \nto the national debt'' is a statement that will withstand scrutiny.\n  ``Mr. Carney: Absolutely.''\n  I don't know what world people are living in. Are we communicating in \nEnglish or some other language? This budget that is presented to us \ncomes nowhere close to living within our means, matching expenditures \nand revenues, and not adding more to the debt.\n  Look at this chart. These are the President's numbers, the numbers \nthat have been put out here, and this is what we have been asked to \npass. It is before the Budget Committee. I wish it were not so, what we \nhave. I know it is not easy to offer these numbers. I know Senator \nMcCaskill knows that. She has looked at that. But I think we have to \nbegin to alter them a lot.\n  Look, in 2010 our total debt, the gross debt of the United States, is \n$13.5 trillion. In 10 years, under the President's budget--these are \nnumbers in his budget document that he submitted to us--it goes to \n$26.3 trillion. Not projecting a war, not projecting another recession, \nboth of which, I guess, could occur during that time. We are living on \nthe absolute edge--actually, almost over the edge, what we are doing \nand spending. It is $13 trillion in new debt.\n  Let me make this point. Not 1 year between now and 2021, the 10th \nyear, does the annual deficit fall below $600 billion. This is an \nunbelievable number. President Bush was hammered when he had a $450 \nbillion budget, his highest, and he was correctly criticized for that. \nThe lowest that is projected over 10 years is $26.3 trillion. Last \nyear's budget deficit was $1.3 trillion. The deficit we expect this \nyear is going to be--on September 30, when September 30 rolls around, \nthe estimates are that the total annual deficit this year will be $1.6 \ntrillion, the highest we have ever had in the history of the Republic. \nNothing was ever seen like it. It does project down some. All the \nprojections are showing it will show some drop down, but they are \nheading back up in these outyears of 2019, 2020, 2021. The budget \ndeficits are going up there. So this is not a sustainable budget. It is \nnot a sustainable path for us to be on as a nation. We cannot continue \non this path. It is a great threat to us.\n  This week, Chairman Conrad, the very able Democratic chairman of the \nBudget Committee, knowledgeable and fair, has been having hearings. We \nhave had the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Energy, and the \nSecretary of Transportation testify to us about their portion of this \noverall budget, this budget that would double the debt in 10 years.\n  What do you think Education is asking for? What are they asking for?\n  Think about, back in your States, what you have been reading about \ncities' school systems and county school systems in States cutting \nbudgets, having to do with less, reducing costs, reducing teachers--\nreducing costs in any way they can. They have been doing a lot of \nthings they have had to do. Some of them are probably going to make \nthat system stronger in the future, but\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\nthey are not easy. You would rather not have to make tough choices, but \nthey are doing it all over America.\n\n  Our U.S. Department of Education, however, demands an 11-percent \nincrease this year, after two substantial increases the previous 2 \nyears. I think it is a 38-percent increase in 3 years for the \nDepartment of Education. This cannot be contained? We cannot have level \nfunding for the Department of Education? We have to have an increase of \n11 percent on, what, 2 percent inflation? Five times the inflation rate \nafter 2 previous years? This is living within our means when we are \ngoing to have, next year, a deficit of over $1 trillion?\n  Energy came in yesterday, Dr. Chu. He wants a 9.5-percent increase in \nspending. Basically, all I can see that the Department of Energy does \nis take money, try to mandate programs to require people to use more \nexpensive energy, and participate, I guess with the Interior \nDepartment, in locking up energy sources in the United States that we \nought to be unlocking, creating jobs and prosperity and wealth for \nAmerica. They need to get their act together.\n  The price of gasoline is going up. I traveled in my State last week. \nI finished a talk, and a hand would go up about gasoline prices. You \nknow, you learn something when you are out traveling around. This is on \npeople's minds, and they do not think it is going to stop at $3.40.\n  Senator Murkowski, the former chairman of the Energy Committee, now \nranking on that committee, knows more than I.\n  Transportation today, Secretary LaHood--you have to like Secretary \nLaHood. He is a likable man. He believes in roads and transportation. \nHold your hat. Do you know how much the transportation is going to \nincrease this year if the President's budget is approved? It is 62 \npercent. I am flabbergasted. Sixty-two percent? Is there a State in \nAmerica that is not showing hardly any increase in their budgets, and \nwe are having a 62-percent increase? No, it is an investment in the \nfuture--investment, investment, investment. Give me a break. It is \nspending, spending, spending and debt, debt, debt, debt.\n  It is a pretty serious problem we are dealing with. I think the \nEducation Department needs to be doing some different things instead of \njust spending money. They need to figure out how children learn. We \nhave to quit defining our commitment to education on how much money we \nthrow at the problem, how many new buildings we build. We have to ask \nare children actually improving? Are they learning better? And too \noften that is not the case. Canada, our neighbor to the north, spends \n$7,500 per year, per pupil. We spend $11,500, and they get better \nresults. Is that an investment? It is not a good investment if we are \nspending more and getting substantially less. We need the Secretary of \nEducation to be figuring out how to help education get better, not see \nhow much more money we can spend, because we do not have the money. \nThis year we will spend $3.5 trillion.\n  We will bring in, in income to the United States, $2.2 trillion. That \nis almost unbelievable, but it is an absolute fact. It is undisputed--\n$3.5 trillion we spend, we bring in $2.2 trillion, and 40 cents of \nevery dollar that is spent this year is borrowed. That is why the \nexperts tell us we have a potential debt crisis.\n  Moody's, the bond rating agency, in December wrote a letter warning \nthat they could downgrade our debt within the next 2 years if we do not \nget off this unsustainable path. So we need Education to help get \nbetter education, not see how much more money they can spend. We need \nEnergy to help produce energy. They are the Energy Department. We need \nTransportation to figure out how to use their money wisely.\n  All of this is about the economic health and growth and future of \nAmerica. The fact is, according to the great study by Rogoff and \nReinhart--which Secretary of Treasury Geithner said he agreed with--\nthat study has been completed. They advised their main finding is that \nacross both advanced countries and emerging markets, high debt-to-GDP \nlevels, 90 percent or above, are associated with notably lower growth \noutcomes. Seldom do countries simply grow their way out of deep debt \nburdens.\n  Well, their study says that it is, on average, 1 percent less growth. \nWell, if we are looking for 3 percent growth this year and we get 2, \nthat makes a lot of difference. Three percent would be good growth. If \nwe get 2 percent, we are now going to get 1 because we are being \ndragged down by our debt.\n  In addition, Mr. Geithner said this to us. Not only does he agree it \nreduces growth, he says it puts us in a position where we could more \nreadily have a debt crisis. If something happened around the world, \nanother debt crisis could spread here and we could slip back into a \nrecession.\n  That is why we have to do this, to create a healthy, growing economy \nand get this debt burden off us, to create jobs, empower the private \nsector. By the way, what percent of GDP are we? We are 94 now and are \nprojected to be 100 percent of GDP by September 30 this year.\n  Our gross debt will be 100 percent of GDP by September 30 this year. \nThat puts us way into the danger zone. It is unacceptable. What do we \nhave from the President's budget? A budget that increases spending \nevery year, that has its lowest annual deficit $600 billion, which I \nthink $600 billion would be the lowest deficit--the highest deficit \never achieved prior to President Obama becoming President.\n  It will double the debt in 10 years, and interest on our debt will go \nfrom under $200 billion last year--hold your hats--to $844 billion in \nthe 10th year. We will be paying interest this year, $844 billion. How \nmuch is that? People say they do not know. What does that mean?\n  Well, the Federal highway budget this year, the baseline budget, was \n40, education, I think, is 60. You see, we are going to $800 billion in \ninterest for which we get nothing, and much of that is sent to people \naround the world, places such as China and Saudi Arabia, who are buying \nour bonds and we are having to pay them interest.\n  Not good. So we are on the wrong path. It is true, we have to change. \nI appreciate the House of Representatives, which is going to send us a \ncontinuing resolution that begins to take some steps toward reducing \nthe dangerous path we are on. That is just a first step. We have to do \na lot more things.\n  If we work together, we can do them. But we are going to have an \neffort in which all of us join together, first in recognition that we \nare facing a grave threat to our national security, and, second, a \ngrave threat to our economy but one we can meet. I have looked at the \nnumbers. I know it is not going to be easy. But if we take a tougher \npath, the harder path, maybe the path less traveled, it is the path to \nprosperity and to a rebound in American strength and vitality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we had an election a few months ago. In \nthat election, the American people sent a message, a message that they \nwere concerned about the debt, concerned about our kids and our \ngrandkids and how this debt is going to be handed down to future \ngenerations.\n  I am not only concerned about that, I am concerned about the imminent \nthreat that this debt poses for our economy and for our people. We are \nspending about $10 billion a day. Of the $10 billion a day we are \nspending, we are borrowing about $4 billion.\n  How big is one billion? It is hard for most of us to fathom how big \none billion is. One billion seconds ago I was in high school. One \nbillion minutes ago, Jesus was alive. One billion hours ago, we were in \nthe Stone Age. But $1 billion ago, at the rate the government spends \nit, was only a few minutes ago.\n  The government is spending money like there is no tomorrow. We had an \nelection and we thought as voters we sent a message to this place. But \nit is not getting through. The President gave us a budget. His proposal \nfor 10 years is to spend $46 trillion. How big is $1 trillion?\n  I mean, it is hard to fathom $1 billion, much less $1 trillion. One \ntrillion dollars, it is hard to imagine. It boggles the mind. If we had \nthousand-dollar bills and I stacked them in my hand, a stack of \nthousand-dollar bills 4 inches high would be $1 million. But if I want \nto have $1 trillion in hundred-dollar bills, it would be 67 miles high.\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n  Why do these numbers mean anything to us? Why does the deficit or the \ndebt mean anything to us? Because it is stealing from our future. We \nhave to do something about it. I think I agree with the Senator from \nAlabama, that it is a threat to our future, that we could have a crisis \ncome upon us where we cannot manage our debt.\n  How do we pay for our debt? We can either tax people--most of us \nthink we are already taxed enough already. We are not willing to pay \nmore than 40 percent of our income for taxes. We can borrow. But we \nborrowed an enormous amount. We now owe the Chinese $800 billion, the \nJapanese $700 billion. The list goes on and on. We owe the Russians \nnearly $200 billion. We owe Mexico $20 billion. The list goes on and \non.\n  Where we were once a great nation that exported goods to the world, \nour No. 1 export is our debt. But what happens when foreign countries \nquit buying our debt or when the interest we have to pay them exceeds \nwhat we are able to pay? Most of the estimates on what we will be \npaying or the President's estimates are saying we will have a 3\\1/2\\-\npercent interest rate. I remember 1979, though, when interest rates \nwent to 21 percent.\n  If that happens, interest will consume the budget, and we will have \nvery little left for anything else. As it is, the course we are on, if \nwe do nothing, if we just keep spending the way we are spending, \nentitlements and interest consume the whole budget within a decade. \nThat is with conservative estimates on interest. Imagine what happens \nif interest rates begin to rise such as they did in the 1970s, and some \nare predicting this can happen.\n  Recently, we have been hearing in the newspapers that some members on \nthe other side of the aisle, members of their leadership, are saying: \nWell, this is all well and good, but those over here, we are mistaken \nthat there is any problem with Social Security. They say Social \nSecurity is not adding anything to the debt. They say Social Security \nis not adding one penny to the debt.\n\n  I am pretty new here. But Washington math that says we are not adding \nto the debt with Social Security is flatly wrong. I have a couple \ncharts with me. Over here is what we bring in, in Social Security \ntaxes, payroll taxes, FICA taxes. Here is what we spend on Social \nSecurity recipients. This is what we bring in, this is what we spend.\n  We are now, for the first time, spending more than we take in. Well, \nthe other side will tell us, they will say: Well, it is not so bad. We \nhave interest payments that fill in the difference. They say Social \nSecurity is fine, has all these surpluses. If we go to the Social \nSecurity Office, we will find a stack of paper. These are Treasury \nbills. They are nonnegotiable. They cannot be traded to anyone. We own \nthem, and we pay ourselves interest on the Social Security surplus.\n  How do we pay the interest? We borrow it from China. So to make up \nthis difference, for them to say Social Security is on solid footing \nand that we are simply paying and spending the interest it brings in, \nit is a lie. The interest is paid by borrowing from China. We are \nborrowing nearly $2 trillion a year.\n  The Senator from Alabama showed us the statistics. Even though the \ndeficit, official deficit, will be like $1.5 or $1.6 trillion, the debt \nlimit, if we watch closely, in a month, will go up $2 trillion--all \nkinds of things they do not count, off-budget items, money they \nborrowed from places.\n  The truth is, we have to wake up and say our entitlements are \nunsound. Nobody wants to hear that. People say: You cannot be elected \nby saying that. Well, guess what. It is the truth. If we do not speak \nthe truth to our problems, we will eventually and ultimately encounter \na crisis in our country, and I am for averting that crisis.\n  I think the President has abdicated in his leadership. We have this \nenormous problem, and he is giving us $46 trillion worth of spending, \nannual deficits of $1 trillion that go to the end of time, and he has \nabdicated his duty. The entitlement system is broken. I did not break \nit. I am not responsible for the baby boom. We have all those people \nwho were born after the war, and they are retiring.\n  It just happened. We have fewer workers. Once upon a time, we had \nover 50 workers for every retiree. It worked. Once upon a time, people \nlived with an average life expectancy of 65. Social Security worked in \nthe beginning, worked for many years. We are now down to less than \nthree workers for one retiree. It is not working. We have a huge number \nof people retiring.\n  It is nobody's fault. But what we want is leadership. Where is the \nleadership in Washington to say the entitlements are broken and we have \nto do something about it? It may not be popular, but can we not say \nsomeone should lead? The President is failing us and is not leading. We \nneed leadership. How do we fix Social Security? Here is what happens if \nwe do nothing. Look at the red ink. It piles on. This year alone, we \nwill have to borrow $37 billion to pay for Social Security. It goes up \nto over $100 billion within a decade.\n  How do we fix Social Security? It is very simple. Everybody knows it, \nbut everybody wants to be quiet. No one wants to say it. I will say it. \nThe age for Social Security will have to gradually rise. I have said \nit. I have said it repeatedly. I do not want it, necessarily. I do not \nwant to have to do the things we have to do. But someone has to stand \nand say it has to be done.\n  We can do it gradually. We can raise the age or allow the age to rise \nslowly for those 55 and under, and we can fix Social Security by doing \nthat. That alone fixes at least half or more of the problem. We let it \nrise gradually on the younger people.\n  There is an alternative. If we stick our heads in the sand and say: \nDo nothing; we are not touching Social Security; we are not touching \nMedicare; we are afraid to lead; Wait and let the President lead \nsomeday, if we do that, the system is run into the ground. It is a \nproblem.\n  What happened in Greece when they ran into a debt crisis? They \nchanged the age of eligibility for their entitlements overnight. That \nis much more difficult. When you are 67 and all of a sudden someone \ntells you, you do not get it for another year, and you planned on it, \nthat is very difficult.\n  But what if we say gradually, to those my age and younger, tell them \nthey will have to make adjustments because we do not have enough money. \nYou know what, I think young people already realize it. These young \npeople here, if they are listening to this debate, they know Social \nSecurity is broken, Medicare is broken. It will not be there for them \nunless we fix it. So we need to be the responsible adults. We need to \nfix these problems and they can be.\n  Next week, I and a couple other Senators will present a fix for \nSocial Security that fixes Social Security in perpetuity. That is a \nlong time, forever. We will fix Social Security by allowing the age to \nrise gradually on younger people, and, by saying to those who will \nretire, the younger people, again, that they may not get as much out of \nit as some other people get. Basically, there will have to be some \ntesting that says, when you are in a higher income bracket, your Social \nSecurity payments will not rise as rapidly as some others will.\n  It is the only way we fix it. But those two changes fix Social \nSecurity forever, if we are willing to do it. The question is, If we \nspeak boldly, if we lead, is that a detriment or an asset? I, \npersonally, think it is the right thing to do, but I also think it is \nan asset. I think the people will understand, when we lead, we have to \nmake difficult choices.\n  We have been kicking the can down the road, borrowing and borrowing \nand borrowing. I think we are coming to a point in time where it has to \nend. It is going to end either voluntarily and gradually, if we can \npromote a solution, or it can end with a bang. A bang is a crisis. I do \nnot want that to happen. I want it to happen gradually, in a very \nrational and reasonable manner. I think we can do it.\n  But I think what we are finding from the other side and from the \nPresident is a failure to lead. I propose that we have new leadership, \nand we are going to need new leadership if we are going to get this \ndebt under control.\n  At the very least, we need to have this conversation. I am glad we \nare having it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, clearly some very serious subjects \nare\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\nbeing discussed today. I applaud my colleague from Kentucky for \nbringing up the tough stuff. We cannot escape reality. Our reality is \nin the entitlements; that we will finally grapple with the \ninsurmountable debt we are faced with as a nation, some very difficult \nissues in front of us with equally difficult solutions. As we stand and \npresent them, try to educate one another, much less those we represent, \nthis is a critical time for us to be talking about all the issues that \nneed to be on the table.\n  One of the issues being discussed around family dinner tables is what \nis happening in this country as it relates to the price of oil and how \nthat translates more personally to American families who, every time \nthey go to fill up the tank, it is costing them more and more. Every \ntime we pick up a newspaper, every time we turn on the TV, we see a \nstory about the rising prices of oil. They are asking: What is going \non. They look at the situation in the Middle East and the combination \nof international events that is driving it. It is also domestic \npolicies that have helped to push oil above $100 a barrel.\n  All of us are concerned about what those higher prices mean for us as \na nation. We are committed to protecting the American people and our \nbusinesses and ensuring we have an ability to deal with rising prices \nat the same time we are trying to emerge from this difficult recession \nperiod. This is a tough time for us.\n  I have come to floor to outline several steps I believe we can and \nshould take to improve our energy policy.\n  First, I wish to touch on how we again find ourselves in this \nsituation. The civil unrest we are seeing, the political instability in \nother nations is certainly not new. They are facts of life in many \nnations that provide this Nation's imports. Iran now holds OPEC's \npresidency. They are perfectly comfortable with $100-a-barrel oil. It \nis far from guaranteed that OPEC is even capable of moderating any \nprices in the way it claims it can with spare capacity.\n  With Libya's supply either offline or unreliable, any other \ndisruption anywhere in the world can likely spike global oil prices to \nlevels that will swamp our economic recovery and result in a genuine \nhardship for America's families.\n  It is not only the situation internationally that has brought us to \nthis point. The costs and consequences associated with our dependence \non foreign oil are largely our own fault. We have brought this upon \nourselves. Over the years our lands have been locked up. Many of our \nmost promising opportunities have been put out of reach. In this \ncountry we sit on tremendous oil reserves in the offshore, whether it \nis up in Alaska, in the Chukchi or Beaufort Seas, or whether it is in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. We have onshore opportunities in my home State that \nare considerable. We have them in the Rocky Mountain West. We have \nmassive shale formations that are not even accessible for research and \ndevelopment. We can't even begin to look.\n  Charles Krauthammer, the columnist, wrote last year:\n\n       We haven't run out of safer and more easily accessible \n     sources of oil. We've been run off them. . . .\n\n  I couldn't agree more. Today our energy policy has gone beyond \nfrustrating. It is irresponsible. The American people expect their \ngovernment to help keep energy affordable and to see to it that we can \nbenefit from our natural resource development in a responsible way. \nThat is what they are asking for. They expect us to take an honest look \nat where increased domestic production is possible, how it can protect \nagainst the higher prices we are seeing now, how it can protect against \npotential supply disruption, and what domestic production will do to \nincrease our security and restore our trade balance.\n  That is what we are talking about today: generating government \nrevenues, creating jobs. Right now when we import oil, we are exporting \nthose benefits. It is our loss, and it is their gain.\n  We ignore the positive benefits of domestic production at our own \nperil. About a month ago we had a hearing in the Energy Committee where \nthere was a statement presented by the Bipartisan Policy Center. It is \na pretty sobering reminder to us all. The statement was:\n\n       A one-dollar, one-day increase in a barrel of oil takes $12 \n     million out of the U.S. economy. If tensions in the Mideast \n     cause oil prices to rise by $5 for even just three months, \n     over $5 billion will leave the U.S. economy. Obviously, this \n     is not a strategy for creating new jobs.\n\n  That was about a month ago. Think about what has happened in the \ncourse of a month and where we have seen the price go. About a month \nago, it was sitting at about $82 a barrel. We are now over $100 a \nbarrel. We are looking at a rise of 20 bucks in the past month. What \nthat means to us in terms of dollars that have been sent outside of our \neconomy is about $15 billion.\n  Last year, putting it in context of what went on at that time, we \nspent an estimated $337 billion on oil imports, a huge amount of money. \nAs we are talking about how we deal with budget matters and decide \nwhich programs and services to continue, to terminate, this has an \nincredible impact on the discussion.\n  Today I am renewing my call for a realistic and aggressive approach \nto our energy challenges. For the sake of our national security, for \nthe sake of our economy, and for the sake of the world's environment, \nAmerica should produce as much oil as it uses as possible. It is this \nbalance, in concert with the resulting revenues we will see, the \nbenefits to manufacturing and transportation industries, that will \nallow us to take control of our energy future.\n  I have five concepts that will support greater domestic oil \nproduction. I will speak very briefly because we will have time to \ndevelop this.\n  First, look north, north to Alaska. We used to have that on our \nlicense plates. We have an incredible supply of oil waiting to be \ntapped for the good of the Nation. The National Petroleum Reserve-\nAlaska is sitting there waiting. Two thousand acres of the \nnonwilderness portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the \nChukchi and Beaufort Seas hold at least 40 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil. That is enough to replace crude imports from the \nPersian Gulf for over 65 years. We can do this in one State. We have \nthose opportunities in Alaska. All three areas right now, as we speak, \nare effectively off-limits to new development because of decisions made \nby this administration or prior administrations. We have an opportunity \nif we just look north.\n  Second, end the ``permitorium'' and bring back production in the Gulf \nof Mexico. This administration has slowed permits for new deepwater \ndevelopment to practically a crawl. The Secretary of the Interior \nannounced one new permit a couple days ago. That is a start, but we are \njust barely crawling. This could cost the United States an estimated \n200,000 barrels of new supply if left in place for a year, far more if \nleft in place longer, and tens of thousands of jobs in the meantime. \nCourts have also ruled repeatedly that the administration's \n``permitorium'' is unlawful. A district court judge ruled last year \nthat it was ``arbitrary and capricious.'' More recently the Interior \nDepartment was actually held in contempt for its ``dismissive conduct'' \nand ``determined disregard''--the words of the court--of previous \norders to end this de facto moratorium.\n  The third item we can do is cut redtape. Let's make this work. In \nJanuary the President ordered his executive agencies to review their \nregulations to ensure that they are cost-effective, that they are not \nunduly damaging economic growth and job creation. A great task. The \nInterior Department, though, is sitting in a situation where they have \nan awful lot of work to do.\n  In late 2008, the Interior Department stated that ``the number of \nrequired plan and permit approvals is on the order of about 25 to 30'' \nfor a typical oil lease. Yet over the past 2 years, instead of reducing \nthat, this administration has sought to add even more layers to these \nalready significant requirements which are a major reason leaseholders \nneed years to begin production. We just can't get to it.\n  Fourth, we need to look at how we as a nation consider this all-of-\nthe-above energy policy. The alternatives to conventional oil, to \nnatural gas, to coal should not be limited to the favored sources: \nwind, solar, geothermal. We have so much we can be doing. We recognize \nthat. I have stood before this body on many occasions talking about the \ndifferent ways we can build our energy portfolio, how we can work to\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nmove the transportation fleet to that next generation, whether it is \nelectric vehicles or fleets powered by natural gas.\n\n  The final item in terms of what we can do to help address our \nNation's energy policy is to shelve bad ideas. There is an awful lot of \nbad ideas holding us up. This is the stop-the-bleeding element of the \nproposal. With oil prices on the rise, the administration and many in \nCongress seem to have forgotten that the oil industry actually provides \nAmericans with energy and jobs. Yet sometimes they are viewed as an \nuntapped source of government revenues.\n  Proposals to take more from oil companies have included a range of \ntax increases, the use-it-or-lose-it proposal and similar fees, and \nsubstantially shorter lease terms. All of these antiproduction efforts \ndeprive companies of stable operating environments and reduce their \nwillingness to invest in America. We need to look at what we are doing. \nIf they are bad ideas, let's set the bad ideas aside. Let's adopt a \nconstructive approach instead of seeking to punish. Let's figure out a \nbetter way forward so we can tap into more of America's vast resources \nand then make good use of the resulting revenues.\n  We clearly do have options. I look forward to discussing them more in \ndetail, how we can develop these goals of a national energy policy. For \ntoday, I emphasize that responsible domestic production will reduce our \nenergy prices, create jobs, improve security, raise revenue to pay down \ndebt, and allow America to invest in technologies for the future. We \ncannot afford to wait on any of these benefits.\n  I urge Members, as we talk about ways to reduce our budget, ways to \ncreate more jobs for the country, we need to look critically at what is \nhappening with our energy policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1197-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1197-S1202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, on June 27, 2010, President Obama made \nthe following statement:\n\n       I hope some of those folks who are hollering about deficits \n     and debt will step up, because I'm calling their bluff.\n\n  I am stepping up. At the same time, I also want to call the \nPresident's bluff. I think we are at a serious point in time in our \nhistory, and we need to be realistic about what confronts us ahead of \ntime.\n  The biggest bluff this year in the Congress was the 2012 budget \npresented by the President which did not take any of the \nrecommendations from his own deficit commission--by the way, I was one \nof the Republicans who supported that--and instead locked in a 25.4-\npercent increase in spending over the last 2 years and made it \npermanent by calling it a freeze. It raises taxes in the outyears and \ndedicates a higher regulatory environment in the United States of \nAmerica. None of that does anything to reduce the debt or the deficit. \nIn fact, the President's budget actually makes it worse.\n\n  But it is fair to ask people to step up. The American people are \nasking us to step up. They want us to do what they have been doing in \nthe last 3 years: sit around their kitchen table, reorganize their \npriorities, spend within their means, and reduce their debt and the \ndeficit. The very least they should ask of their country is their \ncountry to do the same thing they have had to do. In large measure, we \nhave been the contributor to the protracted nature of the current \nrecession.\n  Now, everybody knows there are two ways to reduce the deficit in the \nshort run and the debt in the long run. One way is to cut spending. But \nthat is not the only way. Another way is to raise revenue and increase \nincome. And that is not just by raising a tax, that is by improving \nbusiness opportunity and the expansion of opportunity in America. There \nis a third way: by changing the processes by which we regulate and make \ndecisions, by looking at reforms that in the outyears make a difference \nfor all of us.\n  On the spending side, the spending cuts are going to be difficult. \nThey are going to be modest compared to what our deficit really is. But \nthey are going to send a signal to the world that we are finally going \nto get serious about our spending level, and the majority of the rest \nof the world already has--whether it is Great Britain or many of the \nother countries in the European Union.\n  So spending cuts are important. But spending cuts in and of \nthemselves will not solve the entire problem. In fact, H.R. 1, in the \nHouse, which made reductions of $61 billion, was a modest start at a \nlong-term process. But it sent us in the right direction, and it called \nthe bluff the President was talking about by making real, significant \nproposals.\n  Secondly, in terms of raising revenue, we raise revenue by expanding \nopportunity, not by raising the rate of tax, but, as his deficit \ncommission said, by lowering the rate of tax, doing away with \ndeductions that are specialized and targeted in nature and giving \nbusiness the encouragement to expand.\n  A funny thing happened to me on January 3 of this year in Atlanta, \nGA, right after the first of January. I went to the OK Cafe in downtown \nBuckhead, GA, for a breakfast. That is the gathering place for most \nAtlanta businesspeople on the north side of town. I was going to have a \nbusiness meeting, and Steve Hennessy walked in, one of the largest \nautomobile dealers in the United States. He happened to come up to me. \nHe rushed toward me. He had his arms open. I thought I was going to get \na good luck hug, a ``go to Washington and do a good job'' type speech. \nInstead, he put his finger right on my nose and said: Johnny, I just \nhad to hire two compliance officers to comply with Dodd-Frank, and I \nlost a salesman. I am spending more money complying and less money \nproducing.\n  That is one of the things this administration has done in tremendous \nquantity to put us in a very difficult situation. Every agency is \npromulgating rules and regulations at a rapid rate--regulations that to \ncomply with cost new employees, more expense in operating a business, \nand less capital investment in what that business does.\n  It is very important that the President understand what happens; that \nis, regulation has consequences. Right now the regulatory volume of the \nUnited States being proposed by this administration is unsustainable. \nIt is costly, and it increases the debt and the deficit of the United \nStates of America. Quite frankly, it is a reach far beyond where \ngovernment should go.\n  I am the first person to support occupational safety, the first \nperson to support financial security, the first person to support \ntransparency. I will always fight to see that our government is \ntransparent and our rules are fair and our occupational safety is good. \nBut to overreach, to go beyond our reach, is just wrong.\n  I will give you a couple of examples. Georgia is a large agricultural \nState. Yesterday I was with some cotton farmers who were bemoaning the \nfact of the most recent proposal to regulate agricultural dust. The EPA \nactually wants to regulate the dust created by a plow or a tractor or a \ntruck on a dirt road on a farm, to say that the farmer must make sure \nthat dust stays within the confines of his hedge row or his fence \nline--meaning we are going to try to control nature? Well, how is he \ngoing to do it? By hiring water trucks to follow behind his tractor to \ntamp down the dust? That is a reach too far.\n  To categorize milk as oil and to say farmers who run dairies have to \nhave storage tanks for milk that are equivalent to storage tanks for \npetroleum, that is just crazy. It is a reach too far, and it makes the \nability to do business tougher, the ability to make a profit more \nimpossible, the amount of revenue produced less because it is less \nprofitable, and it protracts our debt and our deficit problem.\n  So when the President talks about calling bluffs, I am willing to do \nit. I am willing to sit down and talk about the hard issues. In fact, I \nam willing to tell the story about how in certain measure myself and \neverybody else born after 1943 in America is an example of some of the \nthings we need to do.\n  In 1983, I was 39 years old. Social Security sent out their annual \nreport on the stability of the Social Security fund and said it was \ngoing broke; that if we did not do something we were going to run out \nof Social Security benefits in the early 2000s.\n  Well, that worried everybody. But Tip O'Neill, a great Speaker and a\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\nDemocrat, and Ronald Reagan got together at the White House, and they \nsaid: We have a problem.\n  Ronald Reagan said: Well, I don't want to raise the payroll tax.\n  Tip O'Neill said: I don't want to lower the amount of the benefit.\n  They looked at the actuary and said: What do we do? And he said: \nRecast the eligibility. Push it into the outyears, and that will get \nthe system calibrated and back to actuarial soundness.\n  So they sat down with the actuaries at the table and said: I tell you \nwhat we are going to do. We are going to preserve everybody's Social \nSecurity eligibility today. But for those people born after 1943 and \nbefore 1947, we are pushing them out from age 65 to age 66. I was born \nin 1944. With a stroke of a pen, Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill changed \nmy eligibility by 1 year. But they changed mine and millions of other \nAmericans at the lead of the baby boomers, recalibrated the system, and \nput Social Security in actuarial soundness until 2050. Then they added \n2-month increments for eligibility beyond, where eventually the law now \ntakes Social Security eligibility to 67.\n  The President's commission recommended doing a similar thing over the \nnext 50 to 75 years to push eligibility out so that benefits are not \ncut. Eligibility is changed but taxes do not go up. Eligibility is only \nchanged, and when you become eligible to collect.\n  We already know that when Social Security was formed originally, most \npeople did not live to the eligibility age of 65, and today most \neverybody does. Our lifespans are a longer time, and that is what has \ngotten the system actuarially unsound.\n  So I do not think it is right to say that nobody has answered the \ncall on debt and deficit reduction. I do not think it is right to say \nthat our bluff--we have not been bluffing anybody, neither did the \nPresident's debt and deficit commission. They called our hand by giving \nus consequential recommendations that work and in the long term make \nthe future of America bright.\n  This problem is not a partisan problem; it is a bipartisan problem. \nThe parties have contributed each to the other to cause the problem. We \nneed to sit down together and begin solving it but not making it a \npolitical issue for the 2012 election with no solutions. Instead of \nbluffs, we ought to make constructive proposals. Instead of speeches on \nthe floor that run time, we ought to be offering amendments on the \nfloor that make a difference in terms of the debt and the deficit of \nthe United States of America.\n\n  This is the greatest country on the face of this Earth, and it is \nbecause people trust it. But if we continue to look the other way as \nour debt and our deficit increases, that trust will dissipate and our \ninterest rates will go up, the cost of goods and services will be \ninflated, and America will be in trouble.\n  I close by telling a brief story about a speech I made in Albany, GA, \nlast year in November, when I was talking about the debt and the \ndeficit, talking about some of the solutions we have talked about. I \nkept talking about a trillion this and trillion that, and saying one \nday soon we are going to owe $14 trillion.\n  A farmer at the back of the room at the rotary club raised his hand \nand said: Senator, I only went to Dougherty County High School. I don't \nknow how much $1 trillion is. How much is it?\n  Well, I stumbled and I stammered, and finally, I said: Well, it is a \nlot. I could not think of how to quantify it.\n  I got home that night, and my wife said: What is wrong? I said: Well, \nI got stumped today.\n  She said: What was the question?\n  I said: The question was, how much is a trillion?\n  She said: What did you say?\n  I said: Well, it is a lot.\n  She said: Well, that was stupid.\n  I said: Well, give me a suggestion.\n  And she is always right.\n  She said: Well, why don't you just figure out how many years have to \ngo by for 1 trillion seconds to pass. Then people will understand how \nmuch $1 trillion is.\n  So I did the math. I multiplied 60 seconds times 60 minutes times 24 \nhours times 365 days. I got on the calculator, and the calculator only \nwent to 12 digits. So I had to go to the computer to get something that \nwould go to 13 digits, which is a trillion. I divided that product into \n1 trillion.\n  Do you know how many years have to pass for 1 trillion seconds to go \nby? Madam President, 31,709. And we owe $14 trillion. At a dollar a \nsecond, for over 400,000 years, we could solve our problem. That is a \nhuge problem. But we have the benefit of the time value of money and \nthe hope and opportunity of the greatest country on the face of this \nEarth.\n  So I call the President's bluff. Let's sit down together and talk \nabout the tough things. Let's talk about the shared sacrifice. Let's \ntalk about the benefit that comes from responsibility, frugality, and a \ncommitment to the principles of our Founding Fathers and always \nremember the principle that less debt is better, and we should never be \na country controlled by those we owe. Instead, we ought to be a country \nloved by those we protect.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I understand there are questions about \nwhat the tax strategies portion of the bill does and who it impacts. So \nI want to take a few minutes to address those questions.\n  In simple terms, a tax strategy is any method for reducing, avoiding, \nor deferring tax liability based upon the tax law--including \ninterpretations and applications of the Internal Revenue Code, \nregulations, and related guidance.\n  A tax strategy can be as simple as a plan to buy tax-exempt bonds or \ninvest in an IRA to reduce your tax liability or as complex as some \nsort of sale-leaseback tax shelter involving multiple domestic and \nforeign corporations and partnerships.\n  A tax strategy patent, which is what we are talking about in this \nbill, is just that--a patent on a particular tax strategy.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article from a publication called the Tax Adviser. This \narticle provides some examples of tax strategies that should not be \npatented.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Tax Advisors, Aug. 1, 2007]\n\n                          Patenting Tax Ideas\n\n (By Justine P. Ransome, J.D., MBA, CPA; and Eileen Sherr, CPA, M.Tax)\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       TSPs have been issued in many areas, and many applications \n     are currently pending.\n       Such patents thwart Congressional intent and undermine the \n     integrity of, and the public's confidence in, the tax system.\n       AICPA will continue to work with the IRS, USPTO, Treasury \n     and Congress to handle--and hopefully resolve--this emerging \n     issue.\n       One of the greatest challenges tax practitioners face in \n     providing quality tax services to clients is to keep abreast \n     of the ever-changing complexity of the tax law. Added to this \n     challenge is the burden of determining whether the chosen \n     advice is another party's exclusive property. While this may \n     seem absurd, in the real world of tax consulting, tax \n     advisers must now contend with certain practitioners and \n     companies seeking patents to protect their exclusive right to \n     use various tax planning ideas and techniques they claim to \n     have developed.\n       Tax practitioners may be surprised to find that tax \n     strategies they have used routinely in practice are now \n     patented and unavailable for use without the patent holder's \n     permission. The trend of patenting tax strategies is on the \n     rise. This article explores tax-strategy patenting. It \n     provides an overview of the issue and discusses the AICPA's \n     concerns and activities to keep its members informed, as well \n     as its attempts to seek a legislative remedy that will stem \n     the tide of these types of patents.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The Patent Act of 1952 provided that patents may be granted \n     for innovations that are useful, novel and nonobvious. Under \n     35 USC Section 271, a patent gives its holder the exclusive \n     right to make, use and sell the patented idea. The \n     consequences of infringing a patent can be substantial. The \n     remedies for patent infringement under 35 USC Sections 283 \n     and 284 include injunctive relief and money damages equal to \n     lost profits or a reasonable royalty. Money damages can be \n     tripled in cases of willful infringement, as authorized under \n     35 USC Section 284; under 35\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\n     USC Section 285, attorneys' fees can be awarded to the \n     prevailing party in exceptional cases. Issued patents are \n     presumed valid; under 35 USC Section 282, an accuser must \n     overcome this presumption with clear and convincing evidence \n     to invalidate a patent. Even if an accused is not found \n     liable, defending a lawsuit can be costly.\n       In 1998, the Federal Circuit, in State Street Bank & Trust, \n     held that business methods are patentable. Since this \n     decision, patents for business methods have flourished. In \n     some cases, these patents involve processes that would seem \n     to be neither novel nor nonobvious (i.e., other reasonably \n     intelligent people would come to the same or a similar \n     conclusion when confronted with the same or similar issue).\n       Recently, the Supreme Court held that the long-standing \n     test used by the lower courts to determine whether an idea \n     was nonobvious was not being applied correctly (and, in fact, \n     was being applied too strictly). The opinion stated that for \n     an idea to be nonobvious, it must be (1) one that would not \n     have occurred to persons of ordinary skill and intelligence \n     in the field of endeavor involved; or (2) previously \n     available knowledge that would have caused a person of \n     ordinary intelligence to affirmatively believe that the idea \n     would not work. Since this decision was just handed down, it \n     remains to be seen what effect it will have on the \n     proliferation of patents for business methods in the future.\n       The patenting of business methods has recently crept into \n     the practice of tax planning. At press time, 60 tax-strategy \n     patents (TSPs) have been granted; 86 are pending. There may \n     be additional TSPs; about 10% are generally unpublished, \n     because applicants can elect not to publish a patent if no \n     protection is being sought in a foreign jurisdiction. Also, \n     it can take up to 18 months for a patent application to be \n     published and listed on the USPTO website. As discussed \n     below, many of these patents deal with planning techniques \n     routinely used by tax practitioners in delivering tax \n     services to clients.\n     Reasons for Concern\n       SOGRAT patent: The primary catalyst for the concern of the \n     AICPA and other tax practitioners was a 2006 infringement \n     suit over the ``SOGRAT patent.'' Awarded by the USPTO on May \n     20, 2003, to Robert C. Slane of Wealth Transfer Group LLC, \n     the SOGRAT patent describes an estate planning technique that \n     uses grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) to transfer \n     nonqualified stock options (NQSOs) to younger generations, \n     with few or no gift tax consequences.\n       GRATs are permitted under Sec. 2702 and the regulations \n     there under. Many estate planners are familiar with, and \n     routinely use, GRATs to shift a variety of different types of \n     assets to younger generations. Thus, it came as quite a \n     surprise to many estate planners when an article touting the \n     estate tax benefits of placing NQSOs into a GRAT noted that \n     the technique had been patented by one of that article's \n     authors. This surprise grew into concern when the patent \n     holder instituted the above-mentioned patent infringement \n     suit against a taxpayer who implemented the technique without \n     its permission.\n       Warning letters: As previously stated, money damages can be \n     tripled in cases of willful infringement (which requires \n     knowledge of the patent). Some patent holders have resorted \n     to mail campaigns and/or press releases touting their patents \n     and warning other tax practitioners that they may be \n     infringing on said patents. For example, one patent \n     infringement warning letter addressed a method for financing \n     future needs of an individual or future intentions on the \n     death of such person, and a method for investing long-term \n     assets of tax-exempt charities. The letter noted that the \n     allowed claims in the patent involve investments used for \n     charitable remainder trusts, pooled-income funds, charitable \n     gift annuities, charitable lead trusts and permanent \n     endowment funds.\n       Part of this patent resembles the facts and results of \n     Letter Ruling 90090471 and TAM 9825001. In those rulings, the \n     IRS permitted a net-income charitable remainder unitrust to \n     invest in a tax-deferred annuity contract for the purposes of \n     controlling the timing and amount of income distributions and \n     to otherwise provide a guaranteed death benefit payable to \n     the charitable remainder interest holder. The patent purports \n     to achieve a similar result through the use of tax-deferred \n     arrangements.\n       The patent holder also sent a press release to the Planned \n     Giving Design Center (PGDC), a professional organization that \n     provides advice on charitable planning and taxation. An \n     article written by the PGDC's editor noted that the letter \n     ruling and TAM are well known to members of the insurance \n     community in particular, ``which have since facilitated \n     thousands of annuity invested charitable remainder trusts \n     since 1990.'' The article further noted that these rulings \n     are also well known to the IRS, which issued them and \n     subsequently discussed such arrangements in its 1999 \n     Continuing Professional Education text. The IRS also added \n     these rulings to its annual ``no-ruling'' list as it studied \n     whether they conveyed an inappropriate tax benefit to \n     taxpayers. The article noted that all of these events \n     occurred well in advance of the date the holder applied for \n     his patent (2004).\n       In light of that patent, the AICPA and American Bar \n     Association (ABA) asked the USPTO whether IRS rulings were \n     considered ``prior art'' (and, thus, not novel) if they were \n     not listed in the ``Other References'' section of a patent \n     application. The patent application did not contain a \n     reference to either ruling. The USPTO replied that, although \n     it had not required such information in the past, it would \n     start requesting it for financial-type patents under its Rule \n     105 (which is used to ask applicants for more information).\n       Sec. 1031: A patent relying heavily on Sec. 1031 has also \n     drawn tax advisers' attention. The ``Section 1031 deedshare \n     patent'' involves a method and investment instruments \n     (deedshares) for performing tax-deferred real estate \n     exchanges. The patent follows the result in Rev. Proc. 2002-\n     22. Its exclusive licensee, CB Richard Ellis Investors, \n     L.L.C., has publicized and warned that it will aggressively \n     pursue patent enforcement.\n       Deferred compensation: A patent on hedging liabilities \n     associated with a deferred-compensation plan was granted and \n     assigned to Goldman Sachs & Company. The patent purports to \n     provide a mechanism to hedge the compensation expense \n     liabilities of an employer providing deferred compensation to \n     one or more employees.\n       IRAs: A patent has been granted to evaluate the financial \n     consequences of converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. \n     It describes a computer-implemented process for computing the \n     tax consequences of converting to a Roth IRA and various \n     options for funding the taxes, such as term insurance to fund \n     the Federal tax liability of early withdrawal for premature \n     death, calculating the entire rollover amount and financing \n     the tax and insurance premium.\n       FSAs: A patent has been granted on flexible spending \n     accounts (FSAs). The patent sets forth a method to calculate \n     costs using a ``health cost calculator'' and ``flexible \n     spending account calculator.''\n       FOLIOfn: The trend to patent tax ideas is only in its \n     infancy; however, several individuals and companies already \n     have applied for multiple patents. For example, FOLIOfn, \n     Inc., a brokerage and investment solutions company, holds \n     three TSPs. It has developed methods for tracking and \n     organizing investments and has patented mechanisms and \n     processes that allow users to view and manipulate potential \n     tax consequences of investment decisions. Several of \n     FOLIOfn's other business-method patents are in practice via \n     large licensing agreements. The company is similarly looking \n     for licensing opportunities for its three TSPs but has not \n     yet secured any deals.\n       As far as the AICPA is aware, only one of its members (a \n     sole practitioner) has applied for a TSP. The AICPA Tax \n     Division staff discussed the issue with that member. The \n     AICPA has confirmed that, currently, none of the ``Big Four' \n     accounting firms holds TSPs.\n\n\n                              AICPA Issues\n\n       In a Feb. 28, 2007, letter to Congress, the AICPA outlined \n     its concerns and position on patenting tax strategies. Its \n     position is that TSPs:\n       Limit taxpayers' ability to use fully tax law \n     interpretations intended by Congress;\n       May cause some taxpayers to pay more tax than Congress \n     intended or more than others similarly situated;\n       Complicate the provision of tax advice by professionals;\n       Hinder compliance by taxpayers;\n       Mislead taxpayers into believing that a patented strategy \n     is valid under the tax law; and\n       Preclude tax professionals from challenging the validity of \n     a patented strategy.\n       The AICPA is concerned about patents for methods that \n     taxpayers use in arranging their affairs to minimize tax \n     obligations. TSPs may limit taxpayers' ability to use fully \n     interpretations of law intended by Congress. As a result, \n     they thwart Congressional intent and, thus, undermine the \n     integrity of, and the public's confidence in, the tax system. \n     TSPs also unfairly cause some taxpayers to pay more tax than \n     (1) intended by Congress or (2) others similarly situated. \n     The AICPA believes that the conflict with Congressional \n     intent highlights a serious policy reason against allowing \n     patent protection. Allowing a patent on a strategy for \n     complying with a law or regulation is not sound public policy \n     because it creates exclusivity in interpreting the law.\n       The AICPA is also concerned with tax law simplicity and \n     administration. TSPs greatly complicate tax advice and \n     compliance. Tax law is already quite complex. The AICPA \n     believes that the addition of rapidly proliferating patents \n     on tax-planning techniques and concepts will render tax \n     compliance much more difficult.\n       Because TSPs are granted by the Federal government, the \n     AICPA is concerned that they pose a significant risk to \n     taxpayers. Taxpayers may be misled into believing that a \n     patented tax strategy bears the approval of other government \n     agencies (e.g., the IRS) and, thus, is a valid and viable \n     technique under the tax law. However, this is not the case; \n     the USPTO does not consider the viability of a strategy under \n     the tax law. The USPTO is authorized only to apply the \n     criteria for patent approval as enacted by Congress and as \n     interpreted by the courts. The IRS is not involved in the \n     USPTO's consideration of a TSP application.\n       The AICPA is concerned that tax professionals also may be \n     unable, as a practical matter, to challenge the validity of \n     TSPs as being obvious or lacking novelty, due to their \n     professional obligations of client confidentiality. Tax \n     advisers may also find it difficult to defend patent-\n     infringement lawsuits due to client confidentiality. The\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\n     USPTO will also find it difficult, if not impossible, to \n     determine whether proposed tax strategies meet the statutory \n     requirements for patentability because tax advice is \n     generally provided on a confidential basis.\n       The usefulness of TSPs is also questionable. The AICPA \n     believes that some of these patents may be sought to prevent \n     tax advisers and taxpayers from using otherwise legally \n     permissible tax-planning techniques, unless they pay a \n     royalty.\n       The AICPA is concerned that both tax practitioners and \n     taxpayers may be sued for patent infringement, whether or not \n     the infringer knew about the patent. A taxpayer can infringe \n     a patent without intent or knowledge of it; ignorance of an \n     applicable patent is not a defense. Practitioners must be \n     aware that once they know that a particular tax strategy is \n     patented, using that strategy without the patent holders \n     permission may expose them to claims of willful infringement \n     and triple damages. Unfortunately, the current environment \n     may leave some practitioners with no recourse, other than \n     engaging patent counsel to review and monitor techniques they \n     routinely use.\n     Advocacy Efforts and Communications\n       Background: In November 2005 and February 2006, the AICPA \n     Trust, Estate & Gift Tax TRP discussed this emerging issue \n     with IRS representatives. In addition, AICPA President Barry \n     Melancon discussed this issue with then-IRS Commissioner Mark \n     Everson on Oct. 17, 2006, advising him of the AICPA's concern \n     and desire to take legislative action.\n       In January 2006, the AICPA Tax Division's Tax Executive \n     Committee (TEC) decided to form the PTF. This article's \n     authors chair and staff that task force, respectively. The \n     PTF was formed with both large- and small-firm members, from \n     various technical areas of the AICPA Tax Division, including \n     individual, international, partnership, S corporation, tax \n     policy and legislation, and trust, estate and gift taxes. The \n     task force held several conference calls and meetings, \n     including one call with a patent expert who explained the \n     basis for patents and the application process.\n       In June 2006, the TEC authorized some PTF members to \n     participate in a joint multi-professional organization task \n     force (including the AICPA, the ABA's Real Property, Probate \n     and Trust Law Section and Tax Section, the American College \n     of Trust and Estate Counsel and the American Bankers \n     Association) on the issue. The joint task force had several \n     conference calls; its chair attended a PTF meeting in \n     November 2006.\n       In July 2006, prior to the Congressional hearings on the \n     issue, the PTF discussed its concerns with Capitol Hill \n     staff. This article's authors attended the hearing, then \n     updated AICPA Tax Division members about the issue and \n     hearing via an electronic alert (e-alert) in August 2006.\n       In October 2006, the AICPA up-dated members via an update \n     to state CPA societies. In February 2007, the AICPA sent to \n     the leadership of the House and Senate tax-writing and \n     judiciary committees its position on tax-strategy patenting, \n     including legislative proposals. E-alerts went out to the \n     AICPA membership and were included in the April 2007 issue of \n     the AICPA's The CPA Letter. In addition, PTF members authored \n     Journal of Accountancy articles on the subject.\n       In March 2007, the PTF drafted and submitted comments to \n     Treasury on the regulations for ``reportable transactions.'' \n     These comments recommended that Treasury not require \n     taxpayers to report patented transactions as reportable \n     transactions, but require the patent holder or USPTO to \n     disclose when the patent is issued.\n       The AICPA Congressional and Political Affairs group has \n     made TSPs a top priority and is in discussions with Congress \n     and its staffs, as well as the USPTO's General Counsel and \n     Director of Business Method Patents, to develop and enact \n     legislation designed to bar grants of, or provide immunity \n     for taxpayers and practitioners from liability related to, \n     such patents. Currently, the AICPA's legislative efforts are \n     focused on the judiciary committees, which consider and vote \n     on any patent legislation.\n       Action: The AICPA has taken a pro-active role against the \n     patenting of tax ideas. Most of its efforts are reflected in \n     a website it has created on the subject, which contains:\n       AICPA comments to Congress, Treasury and the IRS, updates \n     to members, and its PTF roster;\n       Comments of other groups and the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation;\n       USPTO links;\n       Information on specific TSPs;\n       Related articles and other information; and\n       Links to additional resources.\n\n\n                           Recommended Steps\n\n       To minimize potential liability until a legislative \n     solution is enacted, tax practitioners should take the \n     following steps, as appropriate, in response to TSPs:\n       Stay current on matters regarding TSPs by continually \n     visiting the AICPA website on the subject.\n       Read articles and attend conferences about TSPs.\n       Continually visit the USPTO website to determine if a tax \n     idea, technique or strategy that a tax practitioner intends \n     to recommend to a client has been issued a patent or if one \n     is pending.\n       If a strategy is either already patented or is similar to a \n     patented strategy:\n       Advise the client about the patent's existence, the options \n     available and the associated risks;\n       Determine whether patent counsel is needed to further \n     investigate the patent; and\n       If there is a relevant patent, determine whether to \n     negotiate with the patent holder to be able to use the \n     strategy.\n\n\n                     Proposed Legislative Solution\n\n       The AICPA has considered various administrative solutions \n     to this issue and concluded that they are insufficient. In \n     its Feb. 28, 2007, letter, it encouraged Congress to develop \n     legislation to eliminate the harmful consequences of TSPs by \n     either (1) restricting the issuance of such patents or (2) \n     providing immunity from patent infringement liability for \n     taxpayers and tax practitioners.\n       HR 2365, legislation sought by the AICPA to limit damages \n     and other remedies with respect to patents for tax-planning \n     methods, was introduced by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA) on May \n     17, 2007, with initial co-sponsors Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) \n     and Steve Chabot (R-OH). Reps. Boucher, Goodlatte and Chabot \n     are senior members of the House Judiciary Committee, which \n     has jurisdiction over patent legislation. The bill was \n     referred to that committee. As of May 30, 2007, 14 cosponsors \n     had signed onto the bill. AICPA efforts and discussions \n     continue with other members of Congress, including members of \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee. On May 16, 2007, Reps. Lamar \n     Smith (R-TX), Boucher and Goodlatte sent a letter requesting \n     a hearing on the issue to Howard Berman (D-CA), chairman of \n     the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Courts, the \n     Internet, and Intellectual Property.\n     The Future\n       The AICPA continues to work with Congress to make \n     legislative changes regarding the patenting of tax \n     strategies. It is also currently working with the USPTO to \n     determine how both organizations might work together to \n     better scrutinize such patent applications. The AICPA will \n     continue to focus its legislative efforts on the judiciary \n     committees and to work with the USPTO, IRS and Treasury, as \n     well as other professional groups, to educate tax advisers on \n     TSPs and to enhance the flow of information among the groups. \n     The PTF and the AICPA will continue to update its website \n     with additional resources for members, develop other \n     educational and practice-oriented tools and study and address \n     related professional ethical issues.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Practitioners and taxpayers need to (1) be aware that TSPs \n     are being granted and (2) review planning approaches and \n     consider consulting with patent counsel, if appropriate. Tax \n     advisers should ask clients about their use of tax \n     strategies, as they may be unknowingly using patented ones. \n     The AICPA will continue to work with the IRS, USPTO, Treasury \n     and Congress to handle--and hopefully resolve--this emerging \n     issue.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Tax strategies are bad because they allow the tax law \nto be patented. A patent gives the holder the exclusive right to \nexclude others from using the patented invention. A tax strategy patent \nmakes taxpayers choose between paying more than legally required in \ntaxes or providing a windfall to a tax strategy patentholder by paying \na royalty to comply with the tax law.\n  Tax strategy patents add another layer of complexity to the tax laws \nby requiring taxpayers or their advisers to conduct patent searches and \nexposing them to potential patent infringement lawsuits.\n  If a tax strategy patent is granted for a tax shelter designed to \nillegally evade taxes, the fact that a patent was granted may mislead \nunknowing taxpayers into believing the obvious: That the strategy is \nvalid under the tax law when, in fact, it might not be.\n  Tax strategies are not like other inventions because everyone wants \nto pay less tax. Tax strategy patents are on the rise, which then means \nmore and more legal tax strategies are unavailable or, obviously, more \nexpensive for more and more taxpayers.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter. This letter, which is from a coalition of 15 consumer \ngroups, including the umbrella group for public accountants, the Tax \nJustice Center, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, provides \nmore information on why tax strategy patents are bad for taxpayers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 2, 2011.\n     Re Tax Strategy Patents.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Gentlemen: On behalf of our 15 national organizations \n     representing consumer, taxpayer, charitable, financial \n     planning, and\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\n     tax advisor groups, we commend you for including a provision \n     in S. 23, The Patent Reform Act of 2011, to address the \n     serious problem of tax strategy patents. Similar to \n     legislation recently introduced by Senators Baucus and \n     Grassley, S. 139, we believe that this pro-taxpayer measure \n     is a critical component of any comprehensive patent reform \n     effort. The ongoing, serious concerns associated with tax \n     strategy patents pose a significant threat to American \n     taxpayers and businesses, and we believe that Congress must \n     prioritize fixing this problem as soon as possible.\n       As the Senate Judiciary Committee moves to mark up S. 23, \n     we ask you specifically to champion this provision, and \n     aggressively oppose any efforts to weaken or remove it. There \n     is too much at stake to allow special interests to try to \n     monopolize methods of Federal tax compliance, leaving \n     American taxpayers potentially subject to lawsuits. \n     royalties, and a much more complicated, expensive tax code.\n       As you know, the problems associated with tax strategy \n     patents are multiple and quite complex. First, such patents \n     may limit the ability of taxpayers to utilize fully \n     interpretations of tax law intended by Congress--effectively \n     creating a monopoly for the patent holders to determine who \n     can and cannot utilize parts of the tax code. Furthermore, \n     tax advisors, who generally are not patent experts, have the \n     burden to be aware of such patents, and either provide tax \n     advice that complies with the patent holder's requirements, \n     risk a lawsuit for themselves and their clients, or \n     potentially not provide the most advantageous advice to \n     clients. Not surprisingly, these patents create a highly \n     burdensome level of cost ultimately borne by taxpayers.\n       These patents already affect a myriad of tax planning \n     vehicles, including retirement plans, real estate \n     transactions, deferred compensation, financial investments, \n     charitable giving, and estate planning transfers. We are \n     concerned that the U.S. Patent Office may permit the \n     expansion of these types of patents into additional areas \n     broadly affecting average taxpayers. For example, there are \n     pending patents that would affect taxpayers' ability to \n     create a financial plan for funding college education, \n     utilize incentive programs for health care savings account \n     cards, insure against tax liabilities, and use life insurance \n     to generate income.\n       As of now, the numbers of tax strategy patents have grown \n     to over 130 issued and more than 150 pending. We fear this \n     trend is likely to continue to grow exponentially without \n     your leadership. Legislation must be passed quickly if we are \n     to provide taxpayers with equal access to all available \n     avenues of federal tax compliance.\n       As you know, there is broad, bipartisan, and growing \n     support for this legislation. In the 111th Congress, \n     Congressmen Rick Boucher and Bob Goodlatte introduced H.R. \n     2584, a similar initiative which ended the Congress with 45 \n     cosponsors. That legislation built off of the passage of \n     comprehensive patent reform legislation, passed by the House \n     in the 110th Congress, which included its own tax strategy \n     patents provision. In addition, Senators Baucus and Grassley \n     previously introduced legislation on this topic in the 110th \n     Congress, garnering 30 cosponsors, including then-Senator \n     Barack Obama. The National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olsen, has \n     also publicly stated her support for a legislative solution \n     to this problem. Clearly, with such overwhelming support and \n     momentum over the last several years, the time has come to \n     finally enact this proposal and send it to the President.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on behalf of American \n     taxpayers. Please contact any of us if we can assist you as \n     you move forward on this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Barry C.

McIntyre, \n           Director, Citizens for Tax Justice.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Section 14 of the bill, which has been before the \nSenate for the last week or more, prevents patenting of tax law. It \nprovides that a strategy that relies on the tax law to reduce, to \navoid, or to defer tax liability cannot be novel or nonobvious.\n  So a strategy for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability will \nbe deemed insufficient to differentiate a claimed invention from the \nprior art for purposes of evaluating an invention under section 102 or \nsection 103 of the bill that is before us. This ensures that taxpayers \nand their advisers will then be guaranteed equal access to the tax \nlaws, and that is obviously the fair way to do it. It is the \ncommonsense way to do it.\n  So I wish to be clear that tax preparation software is not a tax \nstrategy. Senior policy and examination staff from the Patent and \nTrademark Office agree that such software is not a tax strategy.\n  I also have letters from H Block, KPMG LLP, and Grant Thornton that \nstate that the underlying language does not impact their software \npatents. Again, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    H Block,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2011.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Grassley, Our company has reviewed the \n     language in Section 14 of the Patent Reform Act of 2011, now \n     pending in Congress. Although H Block holds and is seeking \n     numerous patents pertaining to methods of delivering tax \n     advice and tax return preparation, H Block's inventions do \n     not, by their nature, reduce, avoid, or defer tax liability. \n     Therefore, at this time, we do not have any major concerns \n     regarding the language in the Act that statutorily deems that \n     all strategies for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax \n     liability are `in the prior art' and not patentable. \n     Nonetheless, we should mention that H Block is concerned \n     about the precedent that this bill will set. Our fear is that \n     Congress is going down the path where, in the future, it will \n     simply declare ``not patentable'' any subject matter it deems \n     to be unpopular or politically unfavorable.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Brian Donohue,\n     AVP, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                     KPMG LLP,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Chairman,\n     Hon. Charles Grassley, Ranking Member,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary 224 Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We would \n     like to commend you on the inclusion of section 14--a ban on \n     the patenting of tax strategies--in S. 23, the Patent Reform \n     Act of 2011, recently approved and reported by the Committee.\n       We agree with the sentiments expressed by Sen. Grassley on \n     February 3rd that ``[i]f firms or individuals were able to \n     hold patents for these strategies, some taxpayers could face \n     fees simply for complying with the tax code.'' Taxpayers \n     should not be forced to choose between paying more tax than \n     they are legally obligated to pay or paying royalties to a \n     third party with a patent on a legal method of complying with \n     tax law. Tax strategy patents create higher costs and produce \n     confusion for taxpayers and their advisors.\n       As noted by the AICPA in its letter to you, tax strategy \n     patents undermine Congressional authority, intent, and \n     control of tax policy, and would create inequalities among \n     taxpayers. No person should hold exclusive rights over how to \n     comply with the Tax Code.\n       We are a firm with extensive experience in the provision of \n     tax advice to clients, and we are a firm that develops its \n     own proprietary tax tools, including computer software. We \n     therefore appreciate the proper balance between the \n     protection of intellectual property rights and the public \n     policy concerns implicated by extending that protection to \n     patents on tax planning. This bill gives proper deference to \n     the rights of the taxpayer and the already complex \n     requirements of a tax advisor. We therefore urge inclusion of \n     section 14 by the Senate in the final version of S. 23.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     KPMG LLP.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Grant Thornton,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2011.\n     Re: Tax strategy patent legislation.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Gentlemen: I am writing to offer Grant Thornton's \n     strong support for the tax strategy patent provision included \n     in the patent reform legislation (S. 23) recently approved by \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee and now poised for full Senate \n     consideration. I would like to commend you for your \n     commitment to addressing the problems created\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\n     by tax strategy patents and for including the tax strategy \n     patent provision in S. 23.\n       Patents on tax strategy methods threaten the integrity, \n     fairness, and administration of the tax system, and Grant \n     Thornton believes resolving this problem must be an essential \n     component of any patent reform legislation. Grant Thornton \n     wants to encourage you to aggressively oppose efforts to \n     remove or weaken the tax strategy patent provision in S. 23.\n       Tax strategy patents grant private legal parties virtual \n     20-year monopolies over particular methods of compliance with \n     U.S. tax laws. Taxpayers cannot satisfy their legal \n     obligations using a patented interpretation of the tax code, \n     allowing patent holders to privatize tax provisions that \n     Congress intended for everyone. This makes a uniform \n     application of the U.S. Tax Code impossible, potentially \n     forcing taxpayers to pay more tax than Congress intended and \n     more tax than similarly situated taxpayers. Tax strategy \n     patents threaten to undermine public confidence in the \n     nation's tax laws, hinder compliance, and mislead taxpayers \n     into believing that a patented strategy has been approved by \n     the IRS solely because a patent was granted. In addition, tax \n     strategy patents increase the costs and burdens of \n     compliance. Preparers and taxpayers must not only determine \n     the proper tax treatment of an item, but also whether that \n     treatment is covered by a patent, whether the patent might be \n     infringed by properly reporting the item, and whether the \n     patent is valid.\n       Grant Thornton believes that no one should have a patent on \n     the application of the law to the facts and that the granting \n     of tax strategy patents should be prohibited by legislation. \n     Grant Thornton supports the provision in Section 14 of S. 23, \n     which is based on the freestanding legislation S. 139. The \n     new provision builds on previous legislative efforts that \n     enjoyed wide bipartisan support in both chambers. In the \n     110th Congress, the House passed a patent reform bill that \n     would have barred tax strategy patents.\n       The new language in S. 23 would designate any claim on a \n     patent application for a ``strategy for reducing, avoiding, \n     or deferring tax liability'' as indistinguishable from prior \n     art, and thus preclude applicants from using a tax strategy \n     as the point of novelty. Grant Thornton believes this \n     provision needs to be enacted quickly. Over 130 tax strategy \n     patents have already ben approved and more than 150 are \n     currently pending.\n       Grant Thornton agrees that patents should continue to be \n     available for tax preparation software, so long as the patent \n     does not extend to tax strategies embedded in the software. \n     Grant Thornton believes the bill sufficiently addresses the \n     serious concerns raised by tax strategy patents without \n     infringing on the rights of others to copyright, trademark or \n     patent software that assists in the implementation of tax \n     planning.\n       Grant Thornton is the U.S. member firm of Grant Thornton \n     International, one of the six global accounting, tax and \n     business advisory organizations. Through member and \n     correspondent firms in over 100 countries, including 49 \n     offices in the United States, the partners and employees of \n     Grant Thornton member firms provide personalized attention \n     and the highest quality service to public and private clients \n     around the globe.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 David B. Auclair,\n               Managing Principal, Washington National Tax Office.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. However, now, in order to allay the concerns of Intuit, \nmakers of Turbo Tax, I have worked with Senator Baucus to make clear \nthat tax preparation software such as Turbo Tax is not a tax strategy.\n  Financial management software, however, is a little murkier. While \nproducts such as Quicken and QuickBooks are not tax strategies, tax \nstrategies can be embedded in financial management products and \nsoftware. The investment banks and the law firms that have patented tax \nstrategies often use software that could be deemed financial management \nsoftware. The Tax Adviser article I mentioned earlier and got unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record describes some of these. With \nfinancial management software, patent claims that include inventions \nthat are severable from tax strategies may be entitled to patent \nprotection, but the tax strategy itself will remain available to all \ntaxpayers.\n  So it is important to protect intellectual property rights for true \ntax preparation and financial management software. However, we must be \nsure to protect the rights of taxpayers to have equal access to legal \ntax strategies.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1202-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1202-S1204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2011\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 662, the surface \ntransportation extension bill; that the bill be read three times and \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill; and that the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 662) to provide an extension of Federal-aid \n     highway, highway safety, motor carrier safety, transit, and \n     other programs funded out of the Highway Trust Fund pending \n     enactment of a multiyear law reauthorizing such programs.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am so pleased the Senate has passed \nH.R. 662, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011. This \nlegislation provides a clean extension of Federal surface \ntransportation programs through the end of the fiscal year.\n  H.R. 662 was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of 421-4. This legislation had previously \nbeen approved by voice vote in the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee.\n  Under this extension, States will receive $23.1 billion for the \nremainder of fiscal year 2011. This equates to over 800,000 jobs \nnationwide that would be created or saved.\n  As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nam working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both sides \nof the Capitol to move forward on a transportation authorization that \nwill put people to work, bring our Nation's highways, bridges, and \ntransit systems up to a state of good repair, and reduce congestion and \nits impacts on commerce and communities.\n  The committee is planning to markup a new authorization by spring. \nHowever, this extension is necessary in order to give Congress time to \nenact this authorization.\n  I have letters from several organizations who urged Congress to pass \nH.R. 662. These letters were signed by AAA; American Association of \nState Highway and Transportation Officials, AASHTO; American Bus \nAssociation; American Highway Users Alliance; American Motorcyclist \nAssociation; Americans for Transportation Mobility, which includes 12 \norganizations; American Trucking Associations; Owner-Operator \nIndependent Drivers Association; and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  This broad and diverse coalition composed of businesses, workers, and \nusers of the highways, recognized the need to enact this legislation \ntoday.\n  Investments in transportation infrastructure are an important part of \nthe solution to the serious economic challenges we are facing. This is \nespecially true in the construction industry, which has been hit hard \nby the economic downturn. According to January data released by the \nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the construction industry has an \nunemployment rate of over 22 percent.\n  Not only will this extension of SAFETEA-LU save jobs in the short \nterm, an extension through the end of the fiscal year will provide the \nopportunity for Congress to enact a new surface transportation bill.\n  I am so pleased that my colleagues did the right thing and approved \nthis legislation that will save hundreds of thousands of jobs, improve \nour nation's infrastructure, and provide a solid foundation for \neconomic recovery.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Gary L. Ackerman,\n     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Ackerman: Our organizations represent \n     drivers, riders, and businesses that pay the federal highway \n     user fees that fund the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). One of our \n     top goals is to ensure that user fees are properly dedicated \n     to federal programs that improve our nation's highway safety \n     and mobility.\n       This year, Congress is expected to consider a major long-\n     term transportation bill that will reform and streamline \n     federal highway\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\n     programs, adopt new performance standards, and take steps to \n     ensure that users of the system see real value and benefit \n     for their investment. We look forward to working with you on \n     this critical legislation over the course of the year.\n       In the interim, Congress must pass an extension of the \n     existing authorization act, SAFETEA-LU. Congressmen Mica, \n     Rahall, Duncan, DeFazio, and Hanna, have introduced H.R. 662, \n     the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, which \n     extends current highway funding through the end of the fiscal \n     year. Two weeks ago, the bill was reported out of the House \n     Transportation & Infrastructure Committee by unanimous voice \n     vote.\n       We hope that H.R. 662 will pass unanimously and we ask for \n     your strong support when it is considered this week. The \n     extension does not include any funding for earmarks and is \n     consistent with the highway spending level proposed in the \n     Continuing Resolution. Moreover, the Highway Trust Fund has \n     more than enough revenue to fully fund this extension of \n     authority. After H.R. 662 is enacted, the continuing \n     resolution on appropriations will continue to set a spending \n     limit on the various authorized accounts.\n       Failure to enact H.R. 662 would create more problems than \n     simply a shutdown of government agencies. It would also halt \n     highway projects from coast-to-coast because contractors \n     would not be able to be reimbursed for their work. As highway \n     users, we'd like to see these projects completed on-time and \n     under budget.\n       Thank you for your support. If you have any questions about \n     H.R. 662, please do not hesitate to contact us prior to the \n     vote.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert L.

While the ATM \n     Coalition continues to support Congressional efforts to enact \n     a well-funded, long-term surface transportation bill, the \n     absence of such a bill makes this extension essential to \n     creating and sustaining jobs and maintaining America's \n     transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, this extension \n     provides much needed certainty for the construction industry, \n     states, and localities as they begin the 2011 construction \n     season.\n       SAFETEA-LU expired September 30, 2009, and has since been \n     operating on a series of short-term extensions--the latest of \n     which expires at the end of this week. The uncertainty \n     created by the lack of a multi-year federal commitment to \n     improving America's highway and public transportation \n     facilities is contributing to a slowdown in transportation \n     development activity in many states. The jobs impact of this \n     situation has rippled throughout the economy. Workers at \n     design and engineering firms, construction companies, \n     equipment manufacturers, and materials providers have lost \n     their jobs and even more positions are on the line due to \n     uncertainty in federal funding, at a time in which the U.S. \n     unemployment rate remains at record highs.\n       Congress must not delay in passing a robust, multi-year \n     highway and transit reauthorization in the 112th Congress. \n     While reauthorization entails a host of challenging policy \n     and revenue issues, this effort should be viewed as a key \n     opportunity to move U.S. infrastructure into the 21st \n     century, bolster economic recovery efforts, and improve all \n     Americans' way of life. If local, state, and national leaders \n     continue to ignore this important issue, commerce will \n     suffer, fatalities will rise, congestion and pollution with \n     grow unabated, and the United States will find itself further \n     and further behind its rapidly expanding international \n     competitors.\n       To help prevent further job loss and ensure vital \n     transportation investments continue, the ATM Coalition \n     strongly urges you to extend SAFETEA-LU and expenditure \n     authority for the Highway Trust Fund through the end of \n     fiscal year 2011.\n           Sincerely,\n     Americans for Transportation Mobility.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2011.\n       To the Members of the United States Congress: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation, \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector and \n     region, strongly supports H.R. 662, the ``Surface \n     Transportation Extension Act of 2011.''\n       The Chamber recognizes that Congress needs time to \n     formulate a long-term reauthorization of the Safe, \n     Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A \n     Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU reauthorization). At the same \n     time, the 2011 construction season is imminent and \n     unemployment in the construction sector is at a staggering \n     22.5 percent. States, localities, and other project sponsors \n     need clarity now regarding the federal funding commitments \n     for this construction season.\n       An extension shorter than the remainder of the fiscal year \n     would delay the job-creating capacity, safety, and \n     connectivity projects that are needed to address the \n     transportation challenges that cost our economy in wasted \n     fuel, lost productivity, and delayed shipments of \n     manufacturing inputs, consumer goods, and other items \n     critical to the underlying growth of our businesses.\n       The Chamber urges Congress to approve H.R. 662 so that \n     agencies and project sponsors can provide highway and public \n     transportation investments during the 2011 construction \n     season that contribute to much-needed economic growth, and \n     support the backbone of business supply chains.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 23) to amend title 35, United States Code, to \n     provide for patent reform.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, since this debate began, we have heard a \nlot about how the America Invents Act will help unleash the American \ninventive spirit. As a matter of personal pride, I point out that \nVermonters have a long history of innovation and invention, and it is \nthat creative spirit which has given rise to some interesting and even \nrevolutionary inventions.\n  Few people may know that Vermont is issued the most patents per \ncapita of any State in the country. Fewer still may know that the \nfirst-ever patent issued in the United States, which was reviewed by \nSecretary of State Thomas Jefferson and signed by George Washington, \nwas granted to a Vermonter in 1790. It was Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford \nwho began the great tradition of American innovation.\n  Throughout America's history, Vermont has contributed to our economic \nprosperity with inventive ideas. Thaddeus Fairbanks of St. Johnsbury \npatented the platform scale in 1830, which revolutionized the way in \nwhich large objects were weighed. Charles Orvis, of Manchester, the \nfounder of the well-known sporting goods retailer Orvis, patented the \nopen fly fishing reel in 1874. Many other inventions originated from \nVermont in the early years of America, including an electric motor, an \ninternal combustion engine, and the paddle wheel steamship.\n  Today, that innovative Vermont spirit continues. Vermonters have been \ncontributing to the American economy through innovation and invention \nevery year.\n  Exploring new ways to modify existing products to limit the \nenvironmental impact is a quintessentially Vermont idea. Researchers at \nthe University of Vermont have developed and are now seeking a patent \nfor a wood finish that releases fewer toxins into the air than standard \nfinishes. They do it by utilizing whey protein instead of petroleum. In \nthe State of the Union Address, President Obama noted that advances in \ngreen technology will be a key driver of our economy in the 21st \ncentury. Vermont inventors have been and will continue to be out in \nfront in this area.\n  Computer technology will also be a driver of our 21st-century \neconomy. Vermonters are active in producing the next generation of this \ntechnology as well. Viewers across the country were fascinated by the \nrecent appearance of IBM's Watson supercomputer on ``Jeopardy.'' \nComponents used to power Watson were invented by IBM researchers in \nVermont, and I am sure those Vermonters watched proudly as Watson \ndefeated Jeopardy legends Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in the recent \nman-versus-machine matchup.\n  Modernizing the patent system will help to ensure Vermont inventors \nwill still be able to compete, not just on a national stage but in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Much has changed since Samuel Hopkins received the first U.S. patent \nin 1790, but the need for a flexible and efficient patent system has \nremained constant. Inventors from Burlington to the Bay Area require \nthe appropriate incentives to invest in the research required to create \nthe next platform scale or the next Watson computer or the next \nlifesaving medical device.\n  Over the last 6 years, I have worked on meaningful, comprehensive \npatent reform legislation. During that time, I have kept in mind the \ntradition of great Vermont innovators such as Thaddeus Fairbanks and \nCharles Orvis. I was also pleased that we had key Republicans and \nDemocrats working together to get this legislation before the Senate.\n  The next generation of Vermonters is as eager as the last to show \nAmerica and the world what they can produce. Vermont may be one of the \nsmallest States in our Nation, but it is busting with creativity. The \nAmerica Invents Act will ensure that the next Samuel Hopkins can \nflourish well into the 21st century.\n  Senator Grassley and I had a couple of matters we were going to take \ncare of. I see a distinguished colleague seeking recognition. Before I \nyield the floor, might I ask my friend how much time he may need?\n  Mr. CORKER. I will speak briefly. I apologize. The chairman has done \nsuch a wonderful job working this bill through. I came down earlier, \nbut I wasn't able to speak.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield so my colleague can speak, and then the \nSenator from Iowa will be back, and we can continue with our other \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                         Funding the Government\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, as in morning business, I rise to speak \non another topic that is actually related to us being competitive.\n  I think everybody understands that we had another bipartisan event \nthat just occurred recently where we kept government funded, if you \nwill, for another couple of weeks beyond the deadline that was coming \nin the next day or so. I applaud the efforts of both sides to work \ntogether to make that happen.\n  Speaking of competitiveness, it is very difficult for a government to \nfunction having short-term CRs every 2 weeks. What I urge, while this \nwork is going on on the floor, is that the House and the Senate, both \nsides of the aisle, work toward a longer term CR. I know we are working \non reductions in spending which have to take place to keep our \ngovernment in check and keep our country in the place it needs to be, \nbut the work we need to do to fund the government for the rest of the \nyear is actually the easy work we are going to be facing as it relates \nto spending.\n  Today, I saw where Vice President Biden has been asked by the White \nHouse--the President--to take the lead on this issue. I take that as a \ngood sign. I saw Secretary Geithner today. He is planning on engaging \non this issue.\n  I urge that we do the work we need to do. We all know there are going \nto be painful and tough decisions coming. A lot of people have been \narguing and debating against spending cuts and are talking about the \nhavoc it is going to create for government. I imagine that Secretary \nGates over at the Defense Department is trying to deal with overseas \noperations and trying to deal with investing in the future, and other \nagencies of government would much rather see what these cuts are going \nto be and plan accordingly versus working on a 2-week CR.\n  I am just urging that we do the tough work we have to do. All of us \nknow it will be painful. All of us know we are going to have to \nprioritize. All of us know there will be a number of constituencies \naround the country that will be less than happy. But for the good of \nour country, let's go ahead and together, Democrats and Republicans, \nIndependents and the administration, work together toward a solution.\n  I know the House sent over a continuing resolution bill that takes us \nthrough the rest of the year. We have not yet seen what the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate might offer. It is my hope that something is \nbeing worked on. I think the American people in the functioning of this \ngovernment--those who cause this government to function--need to know \nwhat those cuts will be, where we are going.\n  Speaking on that note--and I will close with this--one of the things \nmost frustrating to me as a Senator who came from the world of business \nis that we never know where we are going. We debate the current issues. \nWe never plan for the future.\n  I hope that as a part of all we are doing this spring, this \nincredible opportunity we have in this body to deal with the issue of \nspending, with the issue of deficits, it is my hope that as a part of \nthis, what we will do is pass a global cap on spending, a comprehensive \ncap that takes us from where we are today into a place that has been a \n40-year historic average. Senator McCaskill and many others have joined \nme in something called the CAP Act. It is the type of responsible \nlegislation we need to pass to get our country back where it needs to \nbe.\n  We know we have a huge spending problem today. There are many \nexplanations for that. But as a country, to\n\n[[Page S1205]]\n\nmake ourselves competitive, as the Senator from Vermont talked about \nand I am sure the Senator from Iowa is getting ready to talk about, we \nalso need to make sure we keep our fiscal house in order.\n  Let's deal with these tough issues and solve this problem for this \nyear and move on to the longer term issues.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent to bring up and agree to amendment \nNo. 132, the Cardin-Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do we report it first and then object or \ndo we object even to the reporting of it? I heard the Presiding Officer \nsay report the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can object to laying aside the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK. I object on behalf of Senator Coburn of Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we revert to \nthe pending amendment, which I believe was the Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Delivery System Reform\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to speak about a report that \nwas released by the Centers for Disease Control, which I think is \ninstructive for the American health care system. We are currently in a \nprocess of change in health care. Changing the way health care is \ndelivered in our country is going to take years of hard work, of \nexperimentation, and of learning. There are stakeholders on both the \nFederal and State level who are out there right now, working to \nimplement models of care that increase the coordination and efficiency \nwith which health care is delivered, improve the quality of the care \nthat is delivered, improve the outcomes that patients experience, and \ncontrol costs--bring down costs. This delivery system reform is the \nreal issue of health care reform in our time. I emphasize, it is a win-\nwin for system--improving the quality of care while lowering the cost \nfor the system.\n  This report, called ``Vital Signs,'' released this week by the \nCenters for Disease Control, illustrates how just one type of quality \nreform, reducing hospital-acquired infections, has already improved \nhealth outcomes and resulted in significant cost savings. Hospital-\nacquired infections are a tragic reality of our health care system. \nNearly 1 in every 20 hospitalized patients in the United States is \naffected by a hospital-acquired infection each year. The most deadly of \nthese infections occurs when a tube inserted into a patient's vein is \neither not put in properly or not kept clean. Bloodstream infections \nresulting from these tubes--what are called central line infections--\nkill as many as 1 in 4 patients who become infected.\n  I suspect, if we sat all the Members of the Senate down, there would \nbe very few of us who could not identify a friend, a loved one, a \nfamily member, somebody we knew who had been exposed to a hospital-\nacquired infection.\n  The deaths from hospital-acquired infections are not only numerous \nbut tragic and particularly tragic because they are largely \npreventable. These are what should be considered a zero event.\n  Studies have shown that when providers follow a strict checklist of \nvery basic instructions, including things as simple as washing your \nhands with soap, cleaning a patient's skin with antiseptic, and placing \nfull sterile drapes over the patient, those rates of hospital-acquired \ninfection plummet.\n  The CDC's ``Vital Signs'' report is further evidence of how effective \nthese guidelines are at reducing and in some cases nearly eliminating \ncentral line bloodstream infections from intensive care units. The \nreport's findings show that from 2001 to 2009, State and Federal \nefforts to promote and adopt CDC guidelines and best practices for \npreventing hospital-acquired infections contributed to a 58-percent \ndecrease in the number of central line bloodstream infections among ICU \npatients--58 percent decrease in just 8 years, from 2001 to 2009.\n  A percentage is a fine thing, it is a statistic, but it does not have \na lot of meat on its bones. What does this 58 percent mean? It \nrepresents up to 27,000 lives saved, 27,000 families who got their \nloved one home from the hospital instead of having that terrible \nconversation with the doctor, explaining to them why their loved one \npassed away. If that were not enough, it also represents approximately \n$1.8 billion in cost savings to our health care system--27,000 lives \nand $1.8 billion saved from reductions in just one type of hospital-\nacquired infection in just one type of care setting.\n  The promising news from the CDC report is that the steps health care \nproviders are taking to prevent this type of infection are working. The \nbad news is, we are not doing enough to reduce the occurrence of \nbloodstream infections in other health care settings. The report found \nthat in 2009, approximately 60,000 central line bloodstream infections \noccurred in nonintensive care unit settings such as hospital wards or \nkidney dialysis clinics. This should not be acceptable to us, \nespecially given the tools we know we have to prevent these infections \nfrom happening.\n  Simply put, we can do better. We can save more lives. We can improve \nthe quality of care people receive and, in the process, save billions \nof dollars in our health care system. The CDC is already working to \nsupport partnerships between health care providers to more broadly \nimplement these now-proven quality reforms. This is a good start.\n  In my home State, I have very proudly watched the Rhode Island \nIntensive Care Unit Collaborative, a partnership of health care \nstakeholders led by an organization called the Rhode Island Quality \nInstitute, take the lead in implementing similar quality reforms to \nreduce the rate of hospital-acquired infections in our intensive care \nunits. Rhode Island is the only State in the country to have 100 \npercent of its adult intensive care units participating in a \ncollaborative of this kind, and I commend it to any one of my \ncolleagues. It began years ago in Michigan with the Keystone Project \nand it spread across the country to the Pronovost principles, and in \nRhode Island we have run with it. It has only been a few years, but the \nresults, much like those reported by the CDC, are eye-opening. I will \nquantify this by saying we began with very first-rate hospitals in \nRhode Island. We are in that high-tech Northeast corridor. We are near \nthe Boston medical centers, so we are starting from a very high base of \ncare in Rhode Island hospitals. But even from that good base, the \ncollaborative reported significant improvements in two types of deadly \ninfections: central line bloodstream infections and pneumonia, among \npatients on ventilators.\n  The collaborative estimates from 2007 to June 2010, just over 7 \nyears, the effort had saved 73 intensive care unit lives--73 lives of \nintensive care unit patients--it eliminated the need for over 3,200 \nexpensive hospital days, and it saved hospitals, patients, and insurers \n$11.5 million.\n  This evidence underscores the potential for similar types of delivery \nsystem reforms which, by improving the quality of care, lower the cost. \nAn array of different strategies can lead to these savings, quality \nreforms such as this that avoid errors and adverse consequences; \nprevention programs that save lives and money by getting in there \nbefore the disease takes off; a robust health information \ninfrastructure that allows for safer and better coordinated care \nbetween your primary health care provider, your specialists, your \nimaging place, the laboratory, the hospital where you had to be \nadmitted; payment policies that reward better results, not just more \nprocedures; and, finally, better administrative efficiency\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\nso more health care dollars actually go to health care instead of being \nburned up on bureaucracies and battles over who gets paid and all the \nrest that weighs down our health care system.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisers noted recently that up \nto 30 percent of health care costs, or about 5 percent of GDP, could be \nsaved without compromising health outcomes. Five percent of GDP is \naround $700 billion. Mr. President, $700 billion a year saved through \nthis kind of win-win is a target worth fighting hard to achieve. I \nagree with the Council's observation, but from my experience, I think \nwe can achieve these savings not just without compromising health \noutcomes, I think we can achieve these savings while improving health \noutcomes.\n  Implementing these reforms and achieving these reforms will not be \neasy. It is not just flipping a switch, it is a journey and that \njourney will have turns and it will have obstacles. It is a process, as \nvery expert reviewers have said, of learning, of experimentation, of \nadaptation. But we have been down paths such as that before with great \nsuccess, and the evidence I presented today shows how well it can work \nin health care.\n  So I urge my colleagues, I urge the administration and State leaders \nto continue working together in all of these areas to make reforming \nour health care delivery system a priority. The future of our health \ncare system and the good health of our constituents and the good health \nof our country's fisc all depend on it.\n  I will conclude by saying something I have said before, which is that \nI give great credit to the Obama administration for working in this \narea. I believe our health care reform bill put every possible pilot, \nexperiment program, and model for testing these different types of \ndelivery reform systems on the table. Very expert reviewers have looked \nat it and said: I cannot think of a thing they did not try. Everything \nis in there. On top of that, the Obama administration has put first-\nrate people who really get this side of the equation, people such as \nDon Berwick and David Blumenthal, in charge. So a lot of very good \nthings have lined up to take full advantage of these kinds of win-win \nsavings.\n  The only thing that I think is missing is that the administration has \nnot yet set a hard goal for itself to hit. It still talks about bending \nthe health care cost curve. Well, fine, but that is not a measurable \ngoal.\n  We are coming up on the anniversary of President Kennedy's pledge to \nput a man on the Moon. Way back then, when we feared losing the space \nrace to the Soviet Union, if the President of the United States had \nsaid: I am committed to bending the curve of the rate of America's \nspace exploration, that would have been an unmemorable and an \nineffective Presidential intervention. Instead, President Kennedy put a \nhard benchmark out there that everybody in the world would know we had \nfailed at if we missed it. That was to put a man on the Moon within a \ndecade and bring him home safely. We did not know then how we could do \nit. We believed we could. We are optimists. We are innovators.\n  This is a country of innovation and of the ``big idea.'' By putting \nthat marker out there, President Kennedy drove what was then a smaller \nFederal bureaucracy toward that goal. I believe we need an equally \nspecific goal from the administration on this front in order to make \nsure our considerably larger Federal bureaucracy is fully purposed \ntoward achieving that because the goals are going to be so significant.\n  I congratulate the CDC on their report. I wish to remind my \ncolleagues how valuable this kind of health care reform is. It is not \nwhat we yell about here, but it is out there right now saving lives and \nsaving money. We need to encourage it and we need to expand it, and the \nmore the administration can put a hard goal out there for itself, the \nquicker we will get where we need to be, to the great benefit of \nourselves as a country and our individual fellow American citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Whitehouse pertaining to the introduction of S. \n486 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 142\n\n  Mr. Whitehouse. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendments and, on behalf of Senator Bingaman, call up \namendment No. 142.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that this \namendment is agreeable to both sides; therefore, I ask for its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 142) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                             Budget Choices\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as you well know, Congress is now engaged \nin a debate of huge consequence; that is, the budget. The budget of a \nnation, like the budget of a family, expresses who we are as a people \nand what our priorities are. Where you spend your money, where you make \nyour investments tells you everything about what we believe in.\n  I am more than aware that this country faces a $1.6 trillion deficit \nand a $14 trillion national debt. And these are enormously important \nissues, but they are issues that have to be dealt with in a sensible \nway, and they are issues that have to be dealt with within a broader \ncontext.\n  So I think the very first question we have to ask is, How did we get \nto where we are today? Is the problem, in fact, that we spend too much \nmoney on Head Start and childcare, that we just shower so much on our \nchildren, or is the converse the truth in that we have the highest rate \nof childhood poverty of any major country on Earth?\n  How did we get into the deficit? Well, let me tick it off. And when \nwe discuss how we got into the deficit situation, the irony here is \nthat those people who are yelling loudest about the deficit, who are \nfighting hardest to make savage and Draconian cuts on basic programs, \nare precisely the people who led us to where we are today.\n  I voted against the war in Iraq for a number of reasons, one of them \nbeing that it was not paid for. Do you happen to recall that as we went \ninto the war in Iraq--which will end up costing us about $3 trillion by \nthe time we take care of our last veteran--do you recall much \ndiscussion about how that war was going to be paid for? In fact, do you \nremember one word of how that war was going to be paid for? I don't \nremember that. I was in the middle of that debate. Mr. President, $3 \ntrillion, and no one said: Oh, we cannot afford it.\n  When the crooks on Wall Street, through their illegal behavior, their \nreckless behavior, drove this country into the recession we are in \nright now and they came begging to the Congress for their welfare check \nof some $800 billion, do you recall too many of the people who voted \nfor that saying: Gee, we cannot afford to do it. It is going to drive \nup the deficit. How are we going to provide Wall Street with an $800 \nbillion bailout? I don't recall that discussion.\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\n  When I was in the House a number of years ago, Congress passed an \ninitiative from President Bush for a Medicare Part D prescription drug \nprogram. I believe seniors must have prescription drugs, but that \nlegislation, which was written by the insurance companies and the drug \ncompanies, was not paid for.\n  When our Republican friends fought vigorously for tax breaks for \nbillionaires, which would result in significantly less money coming \ninto the Treasury, driving up the deficit, do you recall much \ndiscussion about how we were going to pay for that? I don't recall that \ndiscussion.\n\n  I find it ironic that when we give tax breaks to billionaires, no \nworry about the deficit. When we bail out Wall Street, no worry about \nthe deficit. But suddenly when we provide childcare to low-income \nchildren who are in desperate need of help in the midst of a recession, \nsuddenly everybody is concerned about the deficit. Frankly, I call that \nabsolute hypocrisy. It is hypocrisy to say we can give tax breaks to \nbillionaires and not worry about the deficit, but we have to cut back \non the needs of working families, the middle class, the sick, the poor, \nand the elderly.\n  This country, at this particular moment, has to make some very basic \ndecisions. The decision we must make is whether, in the midst of this \nhorrendous recession, when the middle class is hurting, when poverty is \nincreasing, do we go after, as our Republican friends in the House want \nus to, programs that are virtually life and death for millions and \nmillions of working-class and lower income people.\n  I don't know about West Virginia, but I can tell my colleagues that \nin Vermont it is very hard for working families to get adequate, \naffordable, and good-quality childcare, early education for their \nchildren. It is a major problem all over the country. Yet our \nRepublican friends say we should balance the budget by cutting Head \nStart $1.1 billion, a 20-percent cut from 2010, and throwing over \n200,000 kids off Head Start. If you are a working mom who sends her \nkids to Head Start now, it feels pretty good that your kid is getting a \ngood quality, early childhood education, getting nourishment. They \nwatch these kids for health care problems. We are going to throw over \n200,000 kids off Head Start.\n  I worked very hard to expand the community health center program, \nwhich I know is so important in West Virginia and Vermont. The \nPresiding Officer and I argue about which State has the greater \ncoverage. It is enormously important. A few years ago, about 20 million \npeople accessed the community health center program. We are now working \nso that in 5 years 40 million Americans will be able to walk in the \ndoor, regardless of their income, get health care, dental care, low-\ncost prescription drugs, and mental health counseling. It is working. \nPresident Obama has been very strong on this issue. Secretary of HHS \nKathleen Sebelius has been very strong on this issue. It is working.\n  Here is the irony. When we give people good quality primary health \ncare, they don't have to go to the emergency room. The emergency room \ncosts 10 times more than treatment at a community health center. When \nwe open the doors for primary health care, people do not get very sick. \nThey don't end up in the hospital. Study after study shows that when we \ninvest in community health centers, we save the taxpayers money. We \nsave Medicaid money and Medicare money because people have access to \nmedical care when they need it. The Republican House wants to cut \ncommunity health centers by $1.3 billion, denying 11 million Americans \nthe opportunity to receive the health care they need.\n  In my State--and I am sure all over the country--people who are \napplying for disability help, for Social Security are upset about how \nlong the process takes. Our Republican friends want to make major cuts \nin the Social Security Administration, which means that half a million \npeople are going to find delays in getting their claims processed.\n  Everybody in America knows that one of the great problems we face is \nthe expense of college. We know hundreds of thousands of bright young \npeople can't even afford to go to college. We know that many people are \ngraduating deeply in debt. One of the accomplishments we have managed \nto bring about in the last few years is to significantly expand the \nPell grant program so low- and moderate-income families will find it \neasier to send their children to college. Our Republican friends in the \nHouse have decided, in their wisdom, that what they want to do is \nreduce by 17 percent Pell grants, which means that 9.4 million lower \nincome college student would lose some or all of their Pell grants. \nHere we are, trying to compete with the rest of the world. We are \nfalling, in many cases, further and further behind in terms of the \npercentage of our young people graduating college. The costs of college \nare soaring. The Republican solution is to cut the major program which \nmakes it easier for working families to send their kids to college.\n  The Community Services Block Grant Program is the infrastructure by \nwhich we get emergency services, food, help to pay for emergency \nservices for lower income people, housing needs, making sure people \nkeep the electricity on. That would be decimated by the Republicans.\n  In the midst of a recession, what they want to do is to cut $2 \nbillion from the Workforce Investment Act and other job training \nprograms when we desperately need that job training to make sure our \npeople can get the jobs that are out there and available. Often they \ndon't have the skills to do that.\n  My point is a pretty simple one. As a nation, we have to make some \nchoices. The top 1 percent today are doing phenomenally well. That is a \nfact. Our friends on Wall Street whom we bailed out are now making more \nmoney than they did before they caused this recession. The top 1 \npercent now earns about 23 percent of all income in America, more than \nthe bottom 50 percent. The top 1 percent, the richest people in terms \nof their effective tax rate, what they pay is now lower than at any \ntime in memory. So we have the wealthy doing phenomenally well, tax \nrates going down. We have showered huge tax breaks on them. Then we \nsay, to balance the budget, we have to cut nutrition programs for our \nkids, Social Security Administration, Pell grants, Head Start, and many \nother programs which millions of people depend upon.\n  The question we as Americans have to decide is, When the rich get \nricher, do we give them more tax breaks while the poor get poorer and \nwe cut programs for them? I don't think, frankly, that is what the \nAmerican people want.\n  There was a poll that came out yesterday or today. It was an NBC News \nand Wall Street Journal poll. The questions dealt with the deficit and \nhow the American people think we should go forward in dealing with the \ndeficit. Here are some interesting results. When asked what do \nAmericans want the Federal Government to do to reduce the deficit, the \nhighest percentage said it is totally acceptable or mostly acceptable \nto impose a surtax on millionaires to reduce the deficit. Eighty-one \npercent of the people said that for obvious reasons. The rich are \ngetting richer. Given the choice of asking people who are already doing \nwell to pay a little more in taxes or to cut programs that working \nfamilies need, the choice is not terribly hard.\n  Seventy-four percent of the American people believe it is totally \nacceptable or mostly acceptable to eliminate tax credits for the oil \nand gas industry. Sixty-eight percent of the public believe it is \ntotally acceptable or mostly acceptable to phase out the Bush tax cuts \nfor families earning over $250,000 a year.\n  What the American people are saying in this poll, and I believe all \nover the country, is obvious. Given the choice of decimating programs \nthat working families depend upon or asking the wealthiest people who \nhave been receiving huge amounts of tax breaks to start paying their \nfair share, it ``ain't'' a tough answer. The answer the American people \nare saying is: We cannot move toward a balanced budget just by cutting, \ncutting, and cutting. A budget has two parts. Everybody in America \nunderstands that. It is the money we spend; it is the money that comes \nin. In the case of the U.S. Government, we have to address our budget \ndeficit in both ways. We have to raise revenue. We do that primarily by \nasking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more in taxes. Yes, we do \nhave to cut some programs. There is waste out there. There\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\nare programs that can and should be cut. That is what we do. We don't \njust cut, cut, cut and then give tax breaks to the very wealthiest \npeople.\n  The Senate has, along with our friends in the House, the \nresponsibility, the constitutional responsibility of coming up with a \nbudget. I certainly hope the President intends to play an active role. \nI hope the President is prepared to do the right thing and to \nunderstand that revenue, asking the wealthiest to start paying their \nfair share of taxes, is one important component of how we move forward \ntoward a balanced budget. But if the President chooses not to \nparticipate or if the President chooses not to take that avenue, that \ndoes not mean to say that we in the Senate should not go forward. I \nintend to work as hard as I can to come up with a deficit reduction \nprogram which is fair but responsible. Being responsible means it \nincludes revenue and not only cuts. There are a whole lot of ways to \nbring in revenue in a fair and progressive way. It is not only asking \nthe wealthiest to pay their fair share of taxes, it is ending abusive \nand illegal offshore tax shelters. According to a number of studies, we \nwill lose $100 billion this year because corporations and wealthy \nindividuals are stashing their money in tax havens in the Cayman \nIslands and in Bermuda. Before we cut nutrition programs for pregnant \nwomen, maybe we do away with those tax havens.\n  We have to begin the process of ending tax breaks for big oil and gas \ncompanies. ExxonMobil, the most profitable corporation in the history \nof the world, not only paid nothing in Federal income taxes in 2009, \nbut they received a $156 million tax refund from the IRS, according to \ntheir own shareholders report. Maybe before we start cutting the Social \nSecurity Administration or Pell grants for college students, we might \nwant to ask the most profitable corporation in America to start paying \nsome Federal income tax.\n  On and on it goes. My point is, now is the moment when we have to do \nthe right thing for working families. There is a lot of pain out there. \nA lot of people are hurting. This recession has taken a heavy toll. In \nthe middle of these tough times, we don't stick a knife into the people \nand make it even worse. We have to move toward deficit reduction. I \nbelieve that. But I believe we don't do it on the backs of the sick, \nthe elderly, the poor, and the most vulnerable. I think we need shared \nsacrifice. Some of the wealthiest people are going to have to play \ntheir part in deficit reduction as well.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, there will be no \nfurther rollcall votes today. The next rollcall vote is expected on \nMonday at 5:30 p.m.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to submit for the Record some of the \nmaterials I have quoted from during the Senate's debate on the first-\nto-file provisions of the America Invents Act. These materials are \nproduced by the National Association of Manufacturers and by the 21st \nCentury Coalition for Patent Reform, an industry group that has been \nthe leading advocate for the bill. They offer a detailed explanation of \nand case for the bill's shift from the current first-to-invent system \nto a first-to-file system of establishing patent priority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following materials be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [From the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, Mar. 2, 2011]\n\n  S. 23 America Invents Act Requires First-Inventor-To-File Provisions\n\n       Any language that dilutes, delays or deletes FITF will gut \n     meaningful patent reform.\n       An amendment to dilute, delay or delete the first-inventor-\n     to-file provisions of S. 23 would effectively gut the \n     substance of the America Invents Act. The Coalition opposes \n     any such amendment and, were such an amendment to pass, we \n     would oppose passage of the stripped- down bill that would \n     result.\n       The first-inventor-to-file provisions currently in S. 23 \n     form the lynchpin that makes possible the quality \n     improvements that S. 23 promises. The Statement of \n     Administration Policy lays out precisely what is at stake: \n     ``By moving the United States to a first-to-file system, the \n     bill simplifies the process of acquiring rights. This \n     essential provision will reduce legal costs, improve \n     fairness, and support U.S. innovators seeking to market their \n     products and services in a global marketplace.''\n       Most of the arguments in opposition to the bill and FITF \n     appear be to decades-old contentions that have been fully and \n     persuasively rebutted. As one example, the National Research \n     Council of the National Academies assembled a group of \n     leading patent professionals, economists and academics who \n     spent four years intensely studying these issues and \n     concluded in 2004 that the move to FITF represented a \n     necessary change for our patent system to operate fairly, \n     effectively and efficiently in the 21st century.\n       Without retaining S. 23's current FITF provisions, the bill \n     would no longer provide meaningful patent reform. As an \n     example, the new provisions on post-grant review of patents, \n     an important new mechanism for assuring patent quality, could \n     no longer be made to work. Instead of a patent reform bill, \n     what would remain of S. 23 would be essentially an empty \n     shell.\n       Thus, we could not continue our support for passage of S. \n     23 without the first-inventor-to-file provisions present in \n     the bill. It would place us in the unfortunate position of \n     opposing moving forward with a bill where we have been among \n     the longest, most ardent supporters.\n       After yesterday's 97 to 2 vote, it is time to move this \n     excellent vehicle for comprehensive patent reform--in its \n     current form--through to final Senate passage.\n                                  ____\n\n\nS. 23 Means New Ideas Creating New Products Creating New Manufacturing \n                                  Jobs\n\n       Let S. 23 Make the Patent System Work for the 21st Century \n     U.S. Economy\n       Keep the first-inventor-to-file provisions of S. 23 in the \n     bill to afford all inventors the benefits for a more \n     transparent, objective, predictable and simple patent law:\n       The first-inventor-to-file provisions of S. 23 protect \n     independent inventors--they will particularly benefit from \n     the simplicity of the first-inventor-to-file rule and \n     actually gain patents that they otherwise would forfeit.\n       Eliminate the potential prejudice to U.S. patent inventors \n     arising from the 1994 law that opened our patent system to \n     foreign-origin invention date proofs.\n       Simplify the rules for patent applications so they can be \n     processed more rapidly, at reduced cost, and become more \n     effective patents for investing in new products:\n       Limit ``prior art'' used to bar a patent from issuing to \n     only those disclosures made available to the public before \n     the patent was sought and disclosures in earlier-filed patent \n     applications.\n       Remove all arcane and subjective tests for deciding whether \n     to issue a patent.\n       Repeal the ``patent interference'' provisions that inject \n     delay, cost and uncertainty into the patenting process.\n       Let members of the public provide patent examiners with \n     relevant publications and other public documents, before \n     deciding whether a patent can be granted.\n       Keep and apply rigorous standards for issuing patents, but \n     assure that they are simple, transparent and objective--\n     making patenting rules more predictable.\n       Assure the highest possible quality for patents that have \n     been granted:\n       Permit members of the public to challenge whether newly \n     issued patents meet each of the rigorous standards for \n     patenting--and require the United States Patent and Trademark \n     Office to promptly cancel any patents that do not.\n       Authorize supplemental examination proceedings, before a \n     patent is enforced, to allow patent owners to present the \n     USPTO with information that may be used to assure the scope \n     of the patent is commensurate with its contribution.\n       Allow the USPTO to set fees for the services it performs \n     for processing patent applications sufficient to cover the \n     costs of promptly completing a high-quality examination.\n       Make patent lawsuits fair and just for both patent owners \n     and accused infringers.\n       Limit the ability of a party to recover false patent \n     marking to the amount of the party's actual competitive \n     injuries.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    S. 23 Protects Inventors Once They Publicly Disclose Their Work\n\n       Protections the 1994 WTO Agreement Took Away, S. 23 Puts \n     Back.\n       After inventors publicly disclose their work, competitors \n     should not be able to take advantage of those disclosures by \n     filing for patents on the disclosed work.\n       Once inventors have published on their work--or have made \n     it available to the public using any other means--their \n     competitors should not be able to run off to the USPTO and \n     seek patents on the work that the inventor has already \n     publicly disclosed. The same goes for permitting a competitor \n     to belatedly seek a patent on a trivial or obvious variation \n     of what the inventor had earlier disclosed publicly. This \n     common-sense truth should apply even if competitors can lay \n     claim to having themselves done the same work, but elected to \n     keep secret the work that other inventors have publicly \n     disclosed.\n       In a word, a competitor seeking a patent on what such an \n     inventor has already published can be thought of as being \n     akin to interloping. The competitor who is spurred into \n     action by another inventor's publication can be regarded as \n     interfering with the understandable and justifiable \n     expectation of inventors who have promptly disclosed their \n     work: they expect that they themselves should be the ones \n     able to secure patents on\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\n     the disclosed work or, by publishing without later seeking \n     patents, that they (as well as other members of the public) \n     should remain free to continue to use what they have publicly \n     disclosed.\n       S. 23 would increase the protection for inventors once they \n     make their inventions available to the public by cutting off \n     the potential for any sort of interloping. S. 23 operates to \n     solidify an inventor's ``grace period'' that applies after \n     the inventor has published or otherwise made available to the \n     public his or her work. In brief, under S. 23, interloping in \n     any form is prohibited--an inventor who elects to publish an \n     invention will no longer need to have any concern that the \n     publication will spur a competitor into a subsequent patent \n     filing that could preclude the inventor from obtaining a \n     patent or--even worse--from continuing to use his or her \n     published work.\n       S. 23 better protects inventors than does current U.S. \n     patent law in addressing interloping--by making the one-year \n     ``grace period'' bulletproof.\n       Today, inventors enjoy a one-year ``grace period'' under \n     U.S. patent law. What this means is that inventors themselves \n     can still seek patents on their inventions even if they have \n     made those inventions available to the public before seeking \n     any patents on them. When inventors file for patents during \n     the one-year period after making a public disclosure, their \n     own disclosures are not useable as ``prior art'' against \n     their patents.\n       However, the ``first to invent'' principle of current U.S. \n     patent law makes relying on the one-year ``grace period'' \n     fraught with some significant risk. The risk comes from the \n     ability of a competitor who learns of the inventor's work \n     through the public disclosure to race off to the USPTO and \n     seek a patent for itself on the disclosed invention. The \n     competitor can interlope in this manner by filing a patent \n     application and alleging its own ``date of invention'' at \n     some point before the inventor's public disclosure was made.\n       This makes relying on the current ``grace period'' a risky \n     hit or miss. If an inventor waits until the end of the one-\n     year ``grace period'' to seek a patent on the invention he or \n     she made available to the public, an interloping competitor, \n     spurred into quickly filing a patent application, may be \n     issued a patent before the USPTO acts on the ``grace period'' \n     inventor's patent application. The ``grace period'' inventor \n     may be forced to fight to get into a patent interference \n     against a competitor's already-issued patent, hoping to get \n     the USPTO to cancel the competitor's patent so the inventor's \n     own patent can be issued.\n       Interferences are notoriously difficult to win for an \n     inventor who is not the ``first to file.'' The number of \n     situations where someone other than the first to file for a \n     patent on an invention actually succeeds in proving an \n     earlier invention date are very few and very far between. \n     Indeed, the most recent estimate is that striking down a \n     competitor's earlier filed application or patent in a patent \n     interference is less likely than the competitor being struck \n     down by lightning.\n       What does S. 23 do about this defect in the ``grace \n     period'' under current U.S. patent law? Quite simply, it \n     wholly excises the defect--it will be gone in its entirety. \n     It makes an inventor's public disclosure of the inventor's \n     own work a bar to anyone thereafter seeking to patent that \n     work itself, as well as any obvious variations of what the \n     inventor made available to the public. In short, it is a \n     complete fix to the risk a competitor will use the inventor's \n     public disclosure as a spur to filing its own patents based \n     on its own work.\n       S. 23 closes the door to interloping by foreign-based \n     competitors that was opened in 1995 when the WTO agreement \n     forced changes to U.S. law.\n       Under the World Trade Organization agreement reached in \n     1994, the United States was forced to change its patent law \n     to benefit foreign-based entities seeking U.S. patents. This \n     change allowed foreign-based entities to take advantage of \n     their secret activities, undertaken outside the United \n     States, in order to establish ``invention dates'' that could \n     be used under U.S. patent law to obtain valid patents. \n     Specifically--and for the very first time--foreign-based \n     competitors could seek U.S. patents on products that had \n     already been publicly disclosed by U.S.-based inventors. The \n     Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which took effect in 1995, \n     implemented this treaty obligation.\n       Before this change in U.S. patent law, foreign-based \n     competitors could not use their secret activities outside the \n     United States as a basis for showing that they had made \n     an invention before its publication by a U.S.-based \n     inventor. Up until 1995, once a U.S. inventor published \n     information on a new product or otherwise publicly \n     disclosed an invention, foreign-based competitors were \n     barred from obtaining U.S. patents on the disclosed \n     product and any aspect of it, including trivial and \n     obvious modifications of it.\n       S. 23, if enacted, would put foreign-based entities back \n     into the position they were in prior to 1995--once a U.S. \n     inventor publishes or makes any other type of public \n     disclosure of a new product, the ability for a foreign-based \n     competitor to then file patent applications seeking to patent \n     the disclosed product would be totally cut off.\n       Congress should act promptly to end the potential for \n     interloping by foreign-based competitors once U.S.-based \n     inventors have published on their work.\n       With each passing year, the percentage of U.S. patent \n     filings made by foreign-based entities increases. In 1966, 1 \n     in 5 U.S. patent filings was by a foreign-based entity. That \n     ratio became 1 in 4 in 1969, and 1 in 3 in 1974, before \n     reaching 1 out of every 2 in 2008. Since 2008, the majority \n     of patent filings in the United States came from foreign-\n     based entities. Given the rapid growth in patent filings by \n     Asian (especially Chinese) inventors, this trend may well \n     accelerate in the decade ahead.\n       As foreign-based entities become more sophisticated in \n     their use of the U.S. patent system, U.S. inventors are put \n     at an ever-greater risk that patenting strategies by foreign-\n     based entities will disadvantage U.S.-based inventors, either \n     in electing to use the ``grace period'' or even when they \n     file for a patent before making a public disclosure.\n       How S. 23 operates to protect inventors once they make \n     their work public\n       S. 23 puts an end to any use of ``dates of invention'' in \n     order to determine whether a U.S. patent is valid or not. In \n     addition, S. 23 strips out of the U.S. patent law any grounds \n     for invalidating a U.S. patent based on any type of secret \n     activity undertaken by inventors themselves, such as secret \n     ``offers for sale'' of their inventions before seeking \n     patents. Finally, it further secures the benefits of the one-\n     year ``grace period'' by preventing the contemporaneous work \n     of an inventor's co-workers or research partners from being \n     cited as a basis for barring the inventor from obtaining a \n     patent.\n       The consequence of placing this collection of inventor-\n     friendly features into S. 23 is that, once a U.S. inventor \n     publishes or otherwise makes a public disclosure of his or \n     her inventions, the potential for interloping is entirely \n     removed and the ability of the publicly-disclosing inventor \n     to patent the disclosed invention is fully preserved during a \n     one-year ``grace period.'' The public disclosure by U.S. \n     small business or other U.S.-based small entity, for example, \n     is a bar to anyone else seeking a patent, not only on the \n     publicly disclosed subject matter, but on any trivial or \n     obvious variations of it. Similarly, once a U.S. inventor \n     initially files a patent application (even a provisional one) \n     that subsequently forms the basis for a published patent \n     application or patent, the same protections against \n     competitor efforts to patent the inventor's prior-disclosed \n     work apply.\n       How can Congress accomplish all of this good for the \n     country? Enact S. 23!\n       Reverse the WTO's impact, end interloping threats, and \n     protect U.S. inventors.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                                    March 2, 2011.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM), the nation's largest industrial trade association \n     representing small and large manufacturers in every \n     industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to oppose \n     amendment 133 offered by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to S. \n     23, The America Invents Act.\n       The amendment would remove a key provision in S. 23, The \n     America Invents Act, which is strongly supported by \n     manufacturers, the creation of a ``first-inventor-to-file'' \n     system.\n       The NAM supports transitioning the United States from a \n     ``first-to-invent'' system to a ``first-to-file'' system to \n     eliminate unnecessary cost and complexity in the U.S. patent \n     system. Manufacturers large and small operate in the global \n     marketplace and the United States needs to move toward a \n     system that will provide more patent protection around the \n     world for our innovative member companies. The ``first-to-\n     file'' provision currently included in S. 23 achieves this \n     goal.\n       Thank you for your consideration and your support for the \n     ``first-to-file'' system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dorothy Coleman.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to thank all of the cosponsors who \njoined in support of my amendment, particularly Senators Boxer and \nGrassley, who recognized the importance of this amendment for the \nproper functioning of the PTO and for the underlying legislation. \nFurthermore, I want to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley \nfor including my amendment in the managers' amendment to the patent \nreform legislation.\n  Our Founding Fathers recognized the value that intellectual property \nprovides to this country and sought to protect innovation as they did \nphysical property. Article I, section 8 of our Constitution states \n``The Congress shall have power . . . to promote the progress of \nscience and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and \ninventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and \ndiscoveries.''\n  It is necessary for the Federal Government to protect and enforce \nintellectual property rights domestically and internationally. \nIntellectual property is important to our country, businesses and \nindividual rights holders, and I believe a strong patent system is one \ncrucial element in maintaining our\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\ncountry's leadership in innovation, invention and investments. While I \ndo believe it is the goal of this patent reform legislation to \nstrengthen and improve our patent system, I do not believe that such \ngoals are possible without reform to the financial crisis facing the \npatent office.\n  My amendment would provide an immediate solution to this crisis. The \namendment creates a lockbox--a new revolving fund at the Treasury--\nwhere user fees that are paid to the PTO for a patent or a trademark go \ndirectly into the revolving fund for PTO to use to cover its operating \nexpenses. Congress would not have the ability to take those fees and \ndivert them to other general revenue purposes.\n  I do not think everyone in this body understands what it means for \nthe PTO to be a wholly fee-supported agency. PTO does not receive any \ntaxpayer funds. PTO receives fees through the payment of patent and \ntrademark user fees--fees paid by small inventors, companies and \nuniversities to protect their ideas and technology. While those that \npay these fees expect efficiency and quality from the PTO, they do not \nreceive it. Because of the current PTO funding structure--where PTO \nuser fees are deposited into the Treasury, but PTO is then required to \nask for annual appropriations--Congress, who only has authority over \ntaxpayer funds, maintains control over the user-funded PTO. When PTO's \nfee income is greater than what Congress provides via appropriations, \nwe spend the ``excess'' on other general revenue purposes. As a result, \nthose that pay to use the patent system are not receiving the quality \nservice they deserve.\n  It is more than mere coincidence that the two major problems at the \nPTO, (1) the growing number of unexamined patent applications or \n``backlog,'' and (2) the increased time it takes to have a patent \napplication examined or ``pendency,'' are the result of a ``lack of \nconnection between the monies flowing into the agency and those \navailable for expenditure.'' In fact, the latest data from the PTO \nshows that the patent processing backlog is almost 26 months. That is, \nit takes 26 months for the patent examiner to even pick up the \napplication to take his ``first action.'' Total overall pendency--from \nfiling to final action--is approximately 35 months. The PTO also states \nthe total number of patent applications pending is over 1.16 million, \nwith over 718,000 of those waiting for a patent examiner to take his \nfirst action. One of the primary reasons for these incredibly long \nwaiting periods is a lack of resources at the PTO. By providing a \npermanent end to fee diversion, Congress has the ability to contribute \ngreatly to the enhanced efficiency of this agency.\n  This is not the first time Congress has been confronted with its \ndiversion of PTO user fees. Since the early 1980s, Congress has \naddressed issues related to this issue. Beginning in the late 1990s, \nour own congressional reports have documented the problems with fee \ndiversion from the PTO, and the domino effect it has on PTO's efficient \noperation.\n  In 1997, the House Report on the Patent and Trademark Office \nModernization Act stated: ``Unfortunately, experience has shown us that \nuser fees paid into the surcharge account have become a target of \nopportunity to fund other, unrelated, taxpayer-funded government \nprograms. The temptation to use the surcharge, and thus a significant \nportion of the operating budget of the PTO, has proven increasingly \nirresistible, to the detriment and sound functioning of our nation's \npatent and trademark systems . . . this, of course, has had a \ndebilitating impact on the [PTO].''\n  It is disturbing to me, and should be to all Members, that many of \nthe same practices that this 1997 report notes as those that suffer \nfrom lack of consistent PTO funding still occur today--14 years later.\n  Yet Congress continued to grapple with PTO's funding problem into the \nearly 2000s. In 2003, the House noted in its report on the Patent and \nTrademark Fee Modernization Act that ``by denying PTO the ability to \nspend fee revenue in the same fiscal year in which it collects the \nrevenue, an equivalent amount may be appropriated to some other program \nwithout exceeding their budget caps. Although the money is technically \navailable to PTO the following year, it has already been spent.'' In \n2007, I offered a different version of my current amendment to patent \nreform legislation considered by the Judiciary Committee. My amendment \npassed without opposition. Last year, I offered this amendment in the \nJudiciary Committee, and it was tabled by a vote of 10-9. Yet, in 2008, \nthis body adopted by unanimous consent an amendment by Senator Hatch to \nthe fiscal year 2009 budget resolution that condemns the diversion of \nfunds from the PTO.\n  Clearly, for more than a decade, both Houses of Congress have \nrecognized that many of the efficiency and operational problems at the \nPTO could be remedied by giving the PTO authority over its own fee \ncollections. However, we have yet to take the responsibility to \nrelinquish the control over these user fees that we think we deserve. \nIn fact, in the current arrangement, Congress cannot resist the \ntemptation to take what is not ours and divert it to nonpatent related \nfunctions. This is especially tempting during bad economic times, which \nwe have recently been experiencing. Such an arrangement flies in the \nface of logic, commonsense budgeting and overwhelming support from the \nentire patent industry for providing the PTO with a consistent source \nof funding. Ending fee diversion is one of the only areas of 100 \npercent agreement within an industry that has often been divided on \nother issues in this bill. My amendment is supported by: PTO; \nIntellectual Property Owners Association, IPO; American Intellectual \nProperty Law Association, AIPLA; International Trademark Association, \nINTA; The 21st Century Coalition; Coalition for Patent Fairness, CPF; \nInnovation Alliance; American Bar Association, ABA; U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, WARF; BIO; Intellectual \nVentures; National Treasury Employees Union, NTEU; Intel; and IBM.\n  The PTO cannot effectively manage the changes made in this \nlegislation without permanent access to its user fees. I agree that \nthere are aspects of the patent system that need to be updated and \nmodernized to better serve those that use the PTO, and this bill makes \nreforms to the current patent system. In fact, one of those changes \ninvolves giving the PTO fee setting authority. Section 9 of the bill \nstates that the PTO shall have authority to set or adjust any fee \nestablished or charged by the office provided that the fee amounts are \nset to recover the estimated cost to the PTO for its activities. This \nis a great provision to put in the bill, but it is only one side of the \nfunding story. In fact, providing the PTO with fee setting authority \nalone is at odds with the way Congress currently funds the PTO. If I \nwere the PTO director, why would I take advantage of this provision by \nincreasing fees to a point where I think they would cover my \noperational costs, when I know that Congress has the ability to take \nwhatever it wants of those increased fees and spend it on something \nother than what I budgeted those fees to cover?\n  In fact, PTO Director Kappos has specifically commented on fee \ndiversion at the PTO. During his confirmation hearing in 2009, Director \nKappos stated in his testimony that the PTO faces many challenges and \none of the most immediate is ``the need for a stable and sustainable \nfunding model.'' In his private meeting with me prior to his hearing, \nhe discussed his experience as a high-level manager, officer and \ncounsel at IBM. He acknowledged that, despite the vast knowledge and \nexperience that he can bring to the PTO, he could not run PTO \nefficiently without access to sustainable funding.\n  In March 2010, Director Kappos appeared before the House CJS \nAppropriations Subcommittee and stated the PTO was likely to collect at \nleast $146 million more than its 2010 appropriation. He was right, and \nin July 2010, the PTO had to ask for more funds from Congress in \nseparate legislation, but it was only given $129 million. As a result, \nPTO ended up collecting at least $53 million above that amount, which \nit could not access.\n  In April 2010, Director Kappos made similar comments at a meeting in \nReno, NV. When discussing the pending Senate legislation, Director \nKappos stated, ``I am going to make USPTO much better whether we get \nnew legislation or not . . . There is more than\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\none way to solve our problems. Lack of funding is a real issue . . . \nIt's very hard to cut down on a huge backlog with a lack of funding . . \n. Lack of funding hits you at every corner at the USPTO. Just do the \nmath . . . We'll all be dead and gone by the time we get rid of the \nbacklog of appeals at the current rate. It is so overwhelming and it \nall comes down to the resources you need. It comes down to money.''\n  In January 2011, Director Kappos appeared at a House Judiciary \nCommittee PTO Oversight hearing. He stated, ``uncertainty about funding \nconstrained our ability to hire or allow examiners to work overtime on \npending applications during the last year.''\n  It baffles me that these comments have not been heeded by Congress. \nDirector Kappos believes much progress can be made without legislation \nas long as there is a sustainable funding model.\n  Similar words appear in the House Report on the 2003 Patent and \nTrademark Fee Modernization Act: ``While the agency has demonstrated a \ncommitment to embrace top-to-bottom reform consistent with \ncongressional mandates, it is equally clear that PTO requires \nadditional revenue to implement these changes.'' Yet, our PTO director, \nwho has incredible plans for this agency, cannot accomplish those due \nto revenue shortfalls that have plagued the agency for decades--a \nproblem Congress has the ability to permanently fix.\n  Congress has not ended its diversion of fees from the PTO.\n  On a regular basis, from 1992 to 2004, the amount Congress \n``allowed'' the PTO to keep via appropriations was less than the fees \nPTO collected. At the height of this problem in 1998, Congress withheld \n$200 million from the PTO and diverted it to other general revenue \npurposes. As recently as 2004, Congress diverted $100 million from the \nPTO, in 2007, it was $12 million, and in 2010, it was $53 million. In \ntotal, since 1992, Congress has diverted more than $800 million that \nthe PTO will never be able to recover.\n  Now, beyond the concern that appropriators have with relinquishing \ncontrol over PTO funding, some might say that the practice of fee \ndiversion has ended in recent years, making this amendment unnecessary. \nUnder public pressure from numerous sectors of the American innovation \nindustry, in 2005 and 2006 and 2008 and 2009, it is true Congress gave \nPTO all of the funds it estimated in its budget request. So, some argue \nthat no permanent solution to PTO fee diversion is necessary because of \nCongress's proven restraint.\n  However, it is not entirely true that all fee diversion has ended. \nFirst, it is inaccurate to say there has been no fee diversion since \n2004. According to the PTO, $12 million was diverted in 2007, and $53 \nmillion in 2010--a type of diversion slightly different from the past. \nFrom 1992-2004, PTO provided an estimate of its fees, but appropriators \ndiverted funds by appropriating to the PTO less than its estimate and \napplying the difference to other purposes. In 2007 and 2010, PTO \nprovided its estimate and, it is true, appropriators provided an amount \nequal to that estimate. But, PTO collected more than what appropriators \ngave them, and those fees were diverted to other purposes rather than \nbeing returned to PTO the following year. Without access to those \nfunds, PTO lost $12 million in 2007 and $53 million 2010, for a total \nof $65 million.\n  Second, Congress has engaged in ``soft diversion'' of PTO funds \nthrough earmarking PTO fees. From 2005-2010, appropriators directed PTO \nto spend its user fees on specific, earmarked items in appropriations \nbills totaling over $29 million. Such items included: $20 million for \n``initiatives to protect U.S. intellectual property overseas;'' $1.75 \nmillion for the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement \nCoordination Council, NIPLECC; $8 million for PTO to participate in a \ncooperative with a nonprofit to conduct policy studies on the \nactivities of the UN and other international organizations, as well as \nconferences. While we all agree it is important to protect intellectual \nproperty rights abroad, PTO should be able to have discretion to decide \nhow much of its budget should be directed for those purposes.\n  Third, the PTO faces a huge backlog of unexamined patents, as well as \nan enormous patent pendency problem for those applications already \nbeing processed. Fee diversion from the PTO has exacerbated these \nwaiting periods through a congressional Ponzi-scheme. Even if we were \nto accept that fee diversion stopped in 2005, CBO states that \napproximately $750 million was diverted from 1992-2007. With the \naddition of the $53 million diverted last year, the PTO has lost over \n$800 million due to fee diversion. Thus, PTO has been constantly trying \nto recover from years of a ``starvation funding diet.''\n  So, when the PTO presents a budget of what it needs to process \napplications in the next 1-year period, that money is actually going \ntowards processing applications sitting in the backlog. As a result, \nCongress is really not providing PTO with what it needs for the year in \nwhich it receives appropriations. Rather, it is giving short-shrift to \nthe current year's needs because PTO must apply its fees not to the \ninventor who submitted his application this year, but to those who paid \nand submitted applications years ago.\n  Lack of funding is exacerbated under a continuing resolution. In \nfact, PTO's lack of access to its user fees is further amplified in a \nyear with a continuing resolution, such as this fiscal year. Under this \nCR, the PTO can only spend at the level given to it by the \nAppropriations Committee in 2010, which is approximately $1.5 million \nper day less than the President's fiscal year 2011 budget request.\n  PTO already has to wait on year-to-year funding that may not \nmaterialize, and under a CR the problem is worse since PTO cannot get \naccess to their fees until the CR is lifted. In January, the PTO \nDirector noted at the House Judiciary PTO oversight hearing, ``our \nspending authority under the continuing funding resolutions and the \nlack of a surcharge assessment through early March, however, represent \nforegone revenue of approximately $115 million as compared to what was \nproposed in the President's fiscal year 2011 budget request.''\n  Thus, under the House-proposed CR, without a specific provision \ninserted to allow the PTO to collect all of the fees it collects, PTO \nwill not be able to access its future fee collections. My amendment \nwould solve this problem of constantly using time and resources at both \nthe PTO and Congress to ensure the PTO receives the funding it deserves \nand does not suffer from Congress's inability to properly fund the \ngovernment.\n  As the above problems show, even without direct diversion, PTO still \nfaces the possibility of having its fees diverted by other means. Thus, \nwhile I recognize that some effort has been made by Congress, it is no \nconsolation to me or to the PTO Director that, in recent years, \nappropriators have ``restrained'' themselves and provided the PTO with \nall of the fees that it collected. ``But, such recent restraint does \nnot guard against future diversion.''\n  In 2007, the American Intellectual Property Law Association stated in \na letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ``there is nothing to prevent \nthe devastating practice of fee diversion from returning . . . While \neveryone wishes for a more rapid recovery by the Office, it must be \nremembered that the current situation is the result of a 12 year \nstarvation funding diet. It will take permanent, continued full funding \nof the USPTO . . . to overcome these challenges.''\n  An amendment to permanently end fee diversion is the only effective \nremedy. The only true solution to the problem of PTO fee diversion that \nwill give solace to those in the patent community and to the PTO \nDirector is a permanent end to fee diversion so the PTO can effectively \nand efficiently budget for its future operational needs.\n  The President's fiscal year 2012 Budget also supports a sustainable \nfunding model for the PTO. It states, ``another immediate priority is \nto implement a sustainable funding model that will allow the agency to \nmanage fluctuations in filings and revenues while sustaining operations \non a multi-year basis. A sustainable funding model includes: (1) \nensuring access to fee collections to support the agency's objectives; \n[and] (2) instituting an interim patent fee increase. . . .''\n  In fact, as I stated earlier, in 2008, this body approved, by \nunanimous consent, an amendment to the 2009 budget resolution by \nSenator Hatch that condemns the diversion of funds from the\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\nPTO. My amendment is in the same vein--if we will vote to condemn fee \ndiversion, we should also vote to remedy the problem.\n  I believe we cannot have true patent reform without ending fee \ndiversion and providing the PTO with a permanent, consistent source of \nfunding, which is why I believe very strongly that this amendment \nshould be adopted. As my colleague Senator Hatch so effectively stated \nin Judiciary Committee markup this year, ``fee diversion is nothing \nless than a tax on innovation.''\n  Finally, I would like to point out that nothing in this amendment \nallows the PTO to escape congressional oversight and accountability. \nYou have all heard me talk about the need for more transparency in all \nareas of our government, and this is no exception. Enacting this \namendment will not put the PTO on ``auto-pilot'' or reduce oversight of \nPTO operations. In fact, the amendment requires extensive transparency \nand accountability from the PTO, giving Congress plenty of \nopportunities to conduct vigorous oversight.\n  My amendment provides four different methods by which Congress will \nhold PTO accountable: (1) an annual report, (2) an annual spending plan \nto be submitted to the Appropriations Committees of both Houses, (3) an \nindependent audit, and (4) an annual budget to be submitted to the \nPresident each year during the budget cycle. Furthermore, nothing in \nthis amendment changes the current jurisdiction of any congressional \ncommittee, Appropriations or Judiciary, to call PTO before it to demand \ninformation, answers and accountability. In fact, it has the potential \nto yield more information to Congress via the four reporting \nrequirements than provided by other agencies.\n  This amendment is not about authorizers versus appropriators, but \nrather it is about giving the PTO and its very capable and experienced \ndirector the opportunity to improve the agency and provided top-notch \nservice to PTO applicants. It is also about making oversight of the PTO \na priority for all committees of jurisdiction. It is about stimulating \nour economy because when the PTO is fully funded, patents are actually \ngranted, which creates jobs in new companies and in the development and \nmarketing of innovative new products. It is about fulfilling our \nresponsibility to ensure efficiency, accountability and transparency in \nour government so that we reduce our deficit and provide our \ngrandchildren relief from the immense financial burden they currently \nbear.\n  Thus, to truly reform the patent system in this country, more than \nany legislation, it is necessary for the PTO to be able to permanently \nand consistently access the user fees--not taxpayer funds--it collects. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain in \ndetail the tax strategy patent provision in the pending patent reform \nlegislation that was drafted jointly by Judiciary Committee Ranking \nMember Chuck Grassley and me. As chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I am concerned by the growth in the number of patents that \nhave been sought and issued for tax strategies for reducing, avoiding, \nor deferring a taxpayer's tax liability. Section 14 of S. 23 would \nprevent the granting of patents on these tax strategies so that the \nInternal Revenue Code can be applied uniformly while balancing the \ncritical need to protect intellectual property.\n  Let me explain. Our Federal tax system relies on the voluntary \ncompliance of millions of taxpayers. In order for the system to work, \nthe rules must be applied in a fair and uniform manner. To that end, \neveryone has the right to arrange financial affairs so as to pay the \nminimum amount legally required under the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Patents granted on tax strategies take away this right and undermine \nthe integrity and fairness of the tax system. These patents have been \non ideas as simple as funding a certain type of tax-favored trust with \na specific type of financial product or calculating the ways to \nminimize the tax burden of converting to an alternative retirement \nplan. Rather than allowing these tax planning approaches to be \navailable to everyone, these patents give the holder the exclusive \nright to exclude others from the transaction or financial arrangement. \nAs a result, they place taxpayers in the undesirable position of having \nto choose between paying more than legally required in taxes or paying \na royalty to a third party for use of a tax planning invention that \nreduces those taxes.\n  The patentability of tax strategies also adds another layer of \ncomplexity to the tax laws by requiring taxpayers or their advisors to \nconduct patent searches and exposing them to potential patent \ninfringement suits. And, in situations where a patent is obtained on a \ntax shelter designed to illegally evade taxes, the fact that a patent \nwas granted may mislead unknowing taxpayers into believing that the \nstrategy is valid under the tax law.\n  Section 14 of S. 23 addresses these concerns by providing that any \nstrategy for reducing, avoiding, or deterring tax liability, whether \nknown or unknown by anyone other than the inventor at the time of the \ninvention or application for patent, will be deemed insufficient to \ndifferentiate a claimed invention from the prior art for purposes of \nevaluating an invention under section 102 or under section 103 of the \nPatent Act. Applicants will not be able to rely on the novelty or \nnonobviousness of a tax strategy embodied in their claims in order to \ndistinguish their claims from prior art. The ability to interpret the \ntax law and implement such interpretations remains in the public \ndomain, available to all taxpayers and their advisers.\n  Under the provision, the term ``tax liability'' refers to any \nliability for a tax under any Federal, State, or local law, or law of \nany foreign jurisdiction, including any statute, rule, regulation, or \nordinance that levies, imposes, or assesses such tax liability.\n  Generally, tax strategies rely on tax law to produce the desired \noutcome; that is, the reduction, avoidance, or deferral of tax \nliability. Tax law can include regulations or other guidance, as well \nas interpretations and applications thereof. Inventions subject to this \nprovision would include, for example, those especially suitable for use \nwith tax-favored structures that must meet certain requirements, such \nas employee benefit plans, deferred compensation arrangements, tax-\nexempt organizations, or any other entities or transactions that must \nbe structured or operated in a particular manner to obtain certain tax \nconsequences. The provision applies whether the effect of an invention \nis to aid in satisfying the qualification requirements for the desired \ntax-favored entity status, to take advantage of the specific tax \nbenefits offered in a tax-favored structure, or to allow for tax \nreduction, avoidance, or deferral not otherwise automatically available \nto such entity or structure.\n  Inventions can serve multiple purposes. In many cases, however, the \ntax strategy will be inseparable from any other aspect of the \ninvention. For example, a structured financial instrument or \narrangement that reduces the after-tax cost of raising capital or \nproviding employee benefits is within the scope of the provision, even \nif such instrument or arrangement has utility to issuers, investors, or \nother users that is independent of the tax benefit consequences. No \ntaxpayer should be precluded from using such an instrument or \narrangement to obtain any reduction, avoidance, or deferral of tax that \nattends it.\n  At the same time, there may be situations in which some aspects of an \ninvention are separable from the tax strategy. For example, a patent \napplication may contain multiple claims. In this case, any claim that \nencompasses a tax strategy will be subject to the provision and the \nnovelty or nonobviousness of the tax strategy will be deemed \ninsufficient to differentiate that claim from the prior art. However, \nany other claim that does not involve a tax strategy would not be \nsubject to the provision. In such a case, if the invention includes \nclaims that are separable from the tax strategy, such claims could, if \notherwise enforceable, be enforced.\n  The mere fact that any computations necessary to implement an \ninvention that is a strategy for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax \nliability are done on a computer, or that the invention is claimed as \ncomputer implemented, does not exclude the strategy from the provision. \nIn such a case, the claims, if separable from the tax strategy, would \nbe evaluated under sections 102 and 103\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\nwithout regard to the tax strategy. If those nontax related and \nseparable claims still met the requirements for patentability, a patent \nwould issue, but not on the tax strategy.\n  The provision is not intended to deny patent protection for \ninventions that do not comprise or include a business method. For \nexample, an otherwise valid patent on a process to distill ethanol \nwould not violate the rule set forth in this provision merely because a \ntax credit for the production of ethanol for use as a fuel may be \navailable. Similarly, the mere fact that implementation of an otherwise \npatentable invention could result in reduced consumption of products \nsubject to an excise tax would not make the invention subject to this \nprovision.\n  The provision is also not intended to deny patent protection for tax \nreturn preparation software that is used solely for preparing a tax or \ninformation return or other tax filing, including one that records, \ntransmits, transfers, or organizes data related to such filing. Similar \nto the review of computer-implemented strategies, such software would \nstill be entitled to patent protection to the extent otherwise \npatentable. Such patents, however, could not preclude non-users of such \nsoftware from implementing any tax strategy. No inference is intended \nas to whether any software is entitled under present law to patent \nprotection as distinct from copyright protection. Nor is an inference \nintended as to whether any particular strategy for reducing, avoiding, \nor deferring tax liability is otherwise patentable under present law.\n  In general, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may seek advice and \nassistance from Treasury and the IRS to better recognize tax \nstrategies. Such consultation should help ensure that patents do not \ninfringe on the ability of others to interpret the tax law and that \nimplementing such interpretations remains in the public domain, \navailable to all taxpayers and their advisors.\n  The practical result of this provision is that no one can be granted \nan exclusive right to utilize a tax strategy. The provision is intended \nto provide equal access to tax strategies.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Today I would like to take a few \nmoments to honor Buck's life and the contributions he made to his \ncommunity.\n  Born and raised in southeast Missouri, Buck was imbued from an early \nage with those quintessential American values so prevalent among the \nmembers of the Greatest Generation: integrity, service to others, \ndetermination, and an undying sense of patriotism. Since Buck's family \ndidn't have much money growing up, he learned at a young age to live \nwithin his means and to place little value on worldly possessions. ``My \nfather didn't have a lot of worldly goods,'' Buck once said, ``but he \nwas a rich man in character.'' I know I speak for many when I say that \nBuck, first and foremost, was also a man rich in character.\n  Buck was also a patriot of the highest order. Having served in the \nU.S. Army during the Korean war, he fought for 2 years on the Korean \nPeninsula and earned, among other decorations, the Combat Infantry \nBadge, the Presidential Unit Citation, two Silver Stars, and two Purple \nHearts. Wounded multiple times, Buck never faltered and steadfastly \nmanned his post, whether in a frontline foxhole or as a heavy weapons \ntrainer for new recruits. In light of his outstanding service, Buck was \neven offered a battlefield commission. Though he chose not to accept \nthe commission, Buck returned home and remained an active member in a \nnumber of veterans' organizations, like the American Legion and the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, for the rest of his life. Never forgetting \nthe country that he fought to protect, he raised--every morning--an \nAmerican flag in his front yard.\n  As you can guess, Buck's dedication to others and stalwart work ethic \ncontinued long after his military service ended. For 25 years, he \nworked at the McCrate Equipment store in Caruthersville, MO, and \nretired as the general manager.

Mr. President, the story of human settlement in Arizona is \nin many respects the story of the extraordinary efforts people have \nmade to harness water supplies for their use and benefit. Early \nArizonans were keenly aware of the importance of the State's many \nrivers. Recognizing the immense power and unpredictability of those \nriver flows, settlers devised an ambitious water system known as the \nSalt River Project, SRP. The keystone of their efforts, the Theodore \nRoosevelt Dam, celebrates its centennial this month.\n  More than a century ago, Arizonans understood that water reclamation \nis crucial to life in the Salt River Valley. Arizona farmers organized \nto lobby the U.S. Congress for a Federal reclamation law that would \nthrow the weight of the Federal Government behind local projects. \nTogether with the vision of President Theodore Roosevelt and the \npersuasive power of private citizens, Congress passed the National \nReclamation Act in 1902. The Salt River Valley Water Users' Association \nwas incorporated the following year.\n  SRP was the first major undertaking authorized by the National \nReclamation Act, and Roosevelt Dam was a critical component of SRP's \ndevelopment. Upon its completion on March 18, 1911, the Roosevelt Dam \nwas the largest masonry structure in the world. The dam captured the \nSalt River's flows, providing a secure water supply, flood control, and \nirrigation to communities in central Arizona. In addition to water \nmanagement, the Roosevelt Dam generated power for mining, agriculture, \nand Arizona's growing population.\n  Today, economic growth in the region continues to depend on Roosevelt \nDam and its ability to provide a reliable water storage and delivery \nsystem, as well as power. The dam is still in operation and provides 70 \npercent of the surface water available to SRP water shareholders and \ncustomers in and around Phoenix. While SRP's mission has evolved with \nArizona's population growth, its core function has remained constant to \nprovide a sustainable water resource for central Arizona.\n  As Arizona continues to develop, we will need the same foresight and \nentrepreneurial spirit to serve the water needs of a new generation of \nArizonans. Mr. President, that is why today I honor those who made SRP \nand the Roosevelt Dam a reality 100 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1214-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the continuing \nresolution to keep our government and all its essential services open \nand operating for the next 2 weeks. I cast this vote because I believe \na government shutdown is in no one's interests, but I am deeply \ndisappointed in the political process that has put us in this position \nand my patience is nearly exhausted with yet another short-term \nsolution and band-aid approach. A 2-week extension that merely defers \ntough decisions on funding the fiscal year that started more than 5 \nmonths ago is hardly progress. A 2-week extension is preferable to a \ngovernment shutdown, but it does not provide the certainty that is \nneeded. The American people deserve better than a stalled process which \ndelays important decisions of how we can reduce our Federal budget \ndeficit while maintaining our important investments in infrastructure, \nresearch, education, technology, and clean energy which will result in \nnew jobs and will bolster our long-term competitiveness.\n  The American people deserve a serious dialogue and adult conversation \nwithin the Congress about our fiscal situation, discretionary spending, \nentitlements, and revenues. We need to work towards a long-term \nsolution to reduce both our current budget deficit and our staggering \ndebt. We will need to reduce Federal spending and make appropriate \nchanges to our entitlement programs to meet the fiscal challenges \nfacing our country. To do this appropriately, everything--revenue, tax \nreform, spending and entitlements--needs to be on the table.\n  As we make these difficult decisions, we must keep in mind that this \ncannot be done by just eliminating programs which protect vulnerable \ncitizens or simply by increasing taxes on our wealthiest citizens. \nInstead, we must find a way to share the sacrifices necessary to bring \nour budget into balance over the long-term while continuing to invest \nin scientific and medical research, education, infrastructure and \nenergy that will help create new industries and jobs in the future.\n  I want to be crystal clear about what is wrong with today's dialogue. \nFor the last months we have heard the sound bites. We have heard \nelected officials say they are for small government, lower taxes, and \nmore freedom. But what do they really mean?\n  Do they want a government too limited to have invented the Internet, \nnow a vital part of our commerce and communications? A government too \nsmall to give America's auto industry and all its workers a second \nchance to fight for their survival? Taxes too low to invest in the \nresearch that creates jobs and industries and fills the Treasury with \nthe revenue that educates our children, cures disease, and defends our \ncountry? We have to get past slogans and sound bites, reason together, \nand talk in real terms about how America can do its best.\n  If we are going to balance the budget and create jobs, we can't \npretend that we can do it by just eliminating earmarks and government \nwaste. We have to look at the plain facts of how we did it before, and \nby the way, you don't have to look far. In the early 1990s, our economy \nwas faltering because deficits and debt were freezing capital. We had \nto send a signal to the market that we were capable of being fiscally \nresponsible. We did just that and as a result we saw the longest \neconomic expansion in history, created over 22 million jobs, and \ngenerated unprecedented wealth in America, with every income bracket \nrising. But we did it by making tough choices. The Clinton economic \nplan committed the country to a path of discipline that helped unleash \nthe productive potential of the American people. We invested in the \nworkforce, in research, in development. We helped new industries. Then, \nworking with Republicans, we came up with a budget framework that put \nour nation on track to be debt free by 2012 for the first time since \nAndrew Jackson's administration.\n  How we got off track is a story that doesn't require retelling. But \nthe truth of how we generated the 1990s economic boom does need to be \ntold. We didn't just cut our way to a balanced budget; we grew our way \nthere. The question now is, What are the tough decisions we are going \nto make today? What are the issues we are going to wrestle with \ntogether at a moment of enormous challenge?\n  This process cannot be done in two weeks, but it should have already \nbegun--and it needs to begin today. The American people deserve no \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1214-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1214-S1215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THANKING THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on the morning of March 7, the Prime \nMinister of Australia, Julia Gillard, will take the stage in front of \nthe Lincoln Memorial to announce a $3 million donation on behalf of the \nAustralian Government to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund to help \nbuild the Education Center at the Vietnam Wall. This generous \ncontribution is a testament to the strength of the United States' \nrelationship with the Australian people and is critical to our \ncontinuing efforts to honor the men and women who served in Vietnam.\n  As one who strongly supported legislation to establish the Education \nCenter, I want to recognize and commend the Prime Minister, the \nlegislature and the Australian people for their deep commitment to \nhelping it come to fruition. Australian soldiers made terrible \nsacrifices during the Vietnam war. More than 500 Australian servicemen \nlost their lives, andsome 3,000 were wounded, injured, or struck ill.\n  For years, Australia has been a steadfast ally and friend of the \nUnited States. Besides Vietnam, Australian soldiers fought alongside \nAmericans during many of our struggles in the 20th century, including \nWorld War I, World War II, the Korean war, and more recently in Iraq. \nCurrently, over 1500 Australian troops are fighting alongside our Armed \nForces in Afghanistan, working to train Afghan troops.\n  The Vietnam Veterans Memorial bears the names of the more than 58,000\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\nbrave men and women who gave their lives in service to our great \ncountry during the Vietnam war. It is a memorial, built by the American \npeople, designed to ensure that names of those who made the ultimate \nsacrifice would never be lost to history.\n  By telling the stories of the men and women who fought and died in \nVietnam, the Education Center will help visitors understand their \ncourage, sacrifice and devotion.\n  And through interactive exhibits and primary source materials, \nvisitors will be able to better understand the profound impact the \nVietnam war had on their family members, their home towns, their \ncommunities and the Nation. Visitors will understand the importance of \nThe Wall and the role it continues to play in healing the wounds left \nby the war.\n  The Vietnam Memorial has always been profoundly meaningful to me, \nboth as a moving way to honor those who died and a remarkably effective \nmeans of healing the terrible national wounds from that war. The \nEducation Center will be an important complement for both of those \nefforts. I hope to continue to play a role in making the Education \nCenter a reality and look forward to the day that the United States can \nshare the rich stories there with all visitors. When that time comes, I \nwill be grateful to the Australian people and mindful of their kind \ngenerosity.\n  I wish to thank the Prime Minster, the government of Australia, and \nthe Australian people for their strong support for this worthy \nendeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1215-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING FORT LUPTON MIDDLE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the students \nand staff at Fort Lupton Middle School, whose relentless hard work and \ndedication to improving student achievement and setting students on the \ncourse toward success has earned the school the title of National \nMiddle School of the Year.\n  The award is presented by the National Association of Middle School \nPrincipals to schools that go the extra mile to address the needs of \nstudents at the middle school level through academics and activities. \nAnd Fort Lupton Middle School's teachers and students are willing to go \nthat extra mile and then some.\n  In a story published earlier this year in the Fort Lupton Press, \nsixth-grade language arts teacher Liz McCachren said that most people \nassume that her job as a middle school teacher isn't very fun. ``I want \npeople to know that it's not scary,'' she said. ``There's nothing scary \nabout these kids or this building. It's a really good middle school. . \n. . The students just make my day brighter. Every day, I can't wait to \nbe here. That's why this school is unique. Because we like each other. \nWe work together.''\n  By working together, the teachers at Fort Lupton created Power Hour, \ngiving students time to do their homework while teachers are available \nto assist. And it is not just teachers working together. Students are \ntaking ownership of their education and helping one another succeed. \nThrough the program ``Where Everybody Belongs,'' Fort Lupton eighth \ngraders serve as mentors for incoming sixth graders, so they adjust to \ntheir new school and surroundings and are better equipped for success.\n  Programs like these help lay the groundwork for student success, and \nthey have built a sense of pride and community at Fort Lupton Middle \nSchool. These kids are excited and eager to learn, and they are setting \na wonderful example for their peers across the state of Colorado and \nthe country.\n  As we continue to push forward to do the important work of improving \npublic education and make sure our public schools prepare our kids to \nbe leaders in the 21st century economy, we must continue to listen to \nthe voices, ideas and aspirations of principals, parents and students, \nlike those at Fort Lupton Middle School.\n  I join all members of the Fort Lupton community and the State of \nColorado in congratulating these bright kids and their teachers for a \njob well done and look forward to their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1215-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY, PARKERSBURG\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I recognize and \ncelebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of West Virginia \nUniversity at Parkersburg. For five decades now, West Virginia \nUniversity at Parkersburg has provided affordable and accessible higher \neducation opportunities to the citizens of the Mid-Ohio Valley and the \nState of West Virginia.\n  West Virginia University at Parkersburg began with humble roots. In \n1961, the college opened in an abandoned elementary school as the \nParkersburg Branch of West Virginia University. One hundred and four \nstudents enrolled that fall.\n  West Virginians believed in the ability of West Virginia University \nat Parkersburg to grow and succeed. In 1965, the citizens of Wood \nCounty passed a bond levy to build the college's campus at its present \nlocation, making it the only state-supported school to be funded by a \nlocal initiative. Truly, West Virginia University at Parkersburg is a \ncollege built by its community.\n  In 1971, it became one of the State's first freestanding community \ncolleges. It developed a solid reputation--which continues today for--\nits quality technical programs and transfer degrees. In 1989, when the \nState legislature restructured higher education in West Virginia, it \nwas reestablished as a regional campus of West Virginia University.\n  Today, West Virginia University at Parkersburg is a WVU-affiliated \ninstitution, and is the only community college in West Virginia \naccredited to offer bachelor's degrees. Growing from its modest \nbeginnings with 104 students, the commuter campus now has more than \n4,500 area residents enrolled in classes, making it the fourth-largest \npublic college in West Virginia.\n  Its students are a blend of traditional and nontraditional students \npursuing more than 40 programs of study. Most are the first in their \nfamily to attend college. Many juggle classes, work, and often families \nas well. They may ``stop out,'' and later return. Throughout the \ncampus, you can see pride in pursuing the dream and the reality of \ncompleting a college degree.\n  And, throughout its growth and many changes, the college has stayed \ntrue to its mission and reinvented itself to serve changing educational \nneeds and deliver workforce-ready graduates prepared to excel in a \nglobal economy. As it marks its 50th anniversary, West Virginia \nUniversity at Parkersburg remains committed to serving the Mid-Ohio \nValley region as an accessible, student-centered learning community \nthat is recognized as an exceptional place to learn.\n  Thousands of West Virginians have started or resumed their college \neducations at West Virginia University at Parkersburg. It truly is \n``the community's college.'' I salute Dr. Marie Gnage and the past \npresidents at West Virginia University at Parkersburg for a half \ncentury of excellence in education, training, and community \nengagement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1215-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1215-S1216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING LOST VALLEY SKI AREA\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, outdoor recreational activities are \na staple of Maine's winter, past and present. From skiing to \nsnowmobiling, visitors have flocked to Maine for decades to get a \nchance to enjoy the mounds of fresh snow our State enjoys every year. I \nrise today to recognize Lost Valley Ski Area, located in the city of \nAuburn, which this year is celebrating its 50th year of operation.\n  Lost Valley has been an Auburn staple since it was founded by Otto \nWallingford and Dr. Camille Gardner in 1961, when it first began \nenticing people from the Twin Cities and the surrounding areas to its \nslopes to learn how to ski. It was then that a 700-foot tow rope was \ninstalled in a little known area named Perkins Ridge, where children \nused to navigate through the trees to a clearing, or ``The Lost \nValley,'' as it was called. That clearing now holds ``the Lodge,'' \nwhere after a long day on the slopes, newly minted skiers can enjoy a \nhot cup of cocoa by the stone hearth. Additionally, the 55 acres of \ntrails are now\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\nco-owned by Linc Hayes and Connie King, two small business owners who \nhave dedicated their time to continue the mountain tradition.\n  Mr. Wallingford is not only known for opening Lost Valley for Mainers \nand tourists alike, but is also considered one of the fathers of \nsnowmaking and grooming. He was the originator of the ``fan gun,'' a \npiece of snowmaking equipment that sprays a mist that is fanned to \ncover a large area. His first attempts created more ice than snow, but \nthat was eventually remedied by removing water from the snowmaking \nsystem. He then developed, 30 years before they became a fad, snow guns \non elevated poles.\n  It was not, however, Mr. Wallingford's penchant for creating snow, \nbut his dedication to improving skiing conditions that brought him to \nthe forefront of the ski industry. In order to create a more skiable \nterrain, Otto transformed old farm equipment into the predecessor of \nthe modern ``snow groomer.'' An agricultural engineering graduate from \nthe University of Maine, Mr. Wallingford used a tractor and attached a \nroller with a chain-like material that pulverized the snow. His \n``Powder Maker'' was so successful that he crafted and sold them to \nother ski resorts both in the U.S. and abroad. A majority of his \noriginal snowmaking equipment is still in use at Lost Valley today! \nFollowing the tradition of providing a mountain that caters to all ages \nand skill levels, Lost Valley Ski Area offers the Central Maine \nAdaptive Sports Program, or CMAS. The CMAS provides a disabled person \nthe chance to ski, and ``focuses on student's abilities rather than \ntheir disabilities.'' The program is staffed by volunteers who coach \nskiers one-on-one in order for them to learn the basic skills. It is \nboth the physical activity and the focus on gaining self confidence \nthat keeps students coming back. Through this and other programs at \nLost Valley, students are able to train for the Olympics and ``Go for \nthe Gold,'' like famed skier and three-time Olympian Julie Parisien, \nwho grew up skiing at Lost Valley.\n  Maine is home to scores of innovators and philanthropists. Linc Hayes \nand Connie King are following in that tradition by keeping Lost Valley \nSki area a beacon of history, learning, and fun. Their commitment of \nproviding a place for all to enjoy snow sports is what makes Lost \nValley such a special place. I thank them and everyone at Lost Valley \nfor their efforts, and wish them 50 more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1216-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING RAYMOND ``BUTCH'' SWANSON\n\n Mr. TESTER.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nstrengthen the earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Rockefeller and I are \nreintroducing the Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2011. \nSince 1975, the earned income tax credit, EITC, has been an innovative \ntax credit which helps low-income working families. President Reagan \nreferred to the EITC as ``the best antipoverty, the best pro-family, \nthe best job creation measure to come out of Congress.'' According to \nthe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the EITC lifts more \nchildren out of poverty than any other government program. It lifted \n6.5 million people, including 3.3 million children, above the poverty \nline in 2009.\n  Last Congress, we were successful in making temporary improvements to \nthe EITC by providing marriage penalty relief and increasing the credit \nrate for families with three or more children. Both of these provisions \nhave been part of our legislation.\n  It is time for us to reexamine the EITC and determine where we can \nstrengthen it. The Finance Committee of which I am a member has started \na series of hearings on tax reform. I believe the tax code should be \nthoroughly reviewed to see what is working and not working and what can \nbe made simpler. This legislation expands the EITC permanently, but as \npart of tax reform I would be open to changing the program. However, \nthose currently benefiting from the EITC should not be harmed in tax \nreform and there should still be tax relief which encourages work and \nhelps low-income families with children.\n  We need to help the low-income workers who struggle day after day \ntrying to make ends meet. They have been left behind in the economic \npolicies of the last eight years. We need to begin a discussion on how \nto help those that have been left behind. The EITC is the perfect place \nto start.\n  The Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2011 strengthens \nthe EITC by making the following changes: makes permanent marriage \npenalty relief; makes permanent the credit for families with three or \nmore children; expands the credit for individuals with no children; \nsimplifies the credit; and increases the penalty for tax preparers.\n  The legislation would make the marriage penalty relief included in \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act permanent. Under the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the phase-out income level for \nmarried taxpayers that file a joint return would be $5,000 higher than \nthe income level for unmarried filers starting in 2009 and in 2010. \nThis level would be indexed for inflation after 2009. The Tax Relief, \nUnemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 \nextended this provision through 2012. Without this provision, many \nsingle individuals that marry find themselves faced with a reduction in \ntheir EITC. In Massachusetts, approximately 100,500 children a year \nbenefit from the EITC because of this provision.\n  Second, the legislation makes permanent the credit for families with \nthree or more children. Under prior law, the credit amount is based on \none child or two or more children. The American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act created a third child category for 2009 and 2010 and \nTax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act \nof 2010 extended this provision through 2012. This change benefits \napproximately 116,000 children a year in Massachusetts.\n  Third, this legislation would increase the credit amount for \nchildless workers. The EITC was designed to help childless workers \noffset their payroll tax liability. The credit phase-in was set to \nequal the employee share of the payroll tax, 7.65 percent. However, in \nreality, the employee bears the burden of both the employee and \nemployer portion of the payroll tax. A typical single childless adult \nwill begin to owe Federal income taxes in addition to payroll taxes \nwhen his or her income is only $10,655, which is below the poverty \nline. These changes will result in a full time worker receiving the \nminimum wage to be eligible for the maximum earned income credit \namount.\n  This legislation doubles the credit rate for individual taxpayer and \nmarried taxpayers without children. The credit rate and phase-out rate \nof 7.65 percent is doubled to 15.3 percent. For 2007, the maximum \ncredit amount for an individual would increase from $457 to $929. In \naddition, the legislation would increase the credit phase-out income \nlevel from $7,590 to $12,690 for individuals and from $12,670 to \n$17,770 for married couples. This increase is indexed for inflation and \nincludes the marriage penalty relief. Under current law, workers under \nage 25 are ineligible for the childless workers EITC. The Strengthen \nthe Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2011 would change the age\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\nto 21. This age change will provide an incentive for labor for less-\neducated younger adults.\n  Fourth, the Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2011 \nsimplifies the EITC by modifying the abandoned spouse rule, clarifying \nthe qualifying child rules, and repealing the disqualified investment \ntest.\n  Finally, the legislation includes a provision which increases the \npenalty imposed on paid preparers who fail to comply with EITC due \ndiligence requirements from $100 to $500. Unfortunately, about a \nquarter of EITC returns include errors and more than a majority of EITC \nreturns are prepared by a preparer. This should help ensure that \npreparers comply with the due diligence requirements.\n  This legislation will help those who most need our help. It will put \nmore money in their pay check. We need to invest in our families and \nhelp individuals who want to make a living by working. I urge my \ncolleagues to support an expansion of the EITC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Paul, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 468. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nclarify the authority of the Administrator to disapprove specifications \nof disposal sites for the discharge of, dredged or fill material, and \nto clarify the procedure under which a higher review of specifications \nmay be requested; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Kentucky, \nSenator Paul, and I would like at this time to address the Senate about \na bill we are introducing.\n  Coal is an enormously vital sector of Kentucky's economy. More than \n200,000 jobs in my State depend on it, including the jobs of \napproximately 18,000 coal miners. Coal is tremendously important to our \ncountry as well. One-half of the country's electricity comes from coal. \nYet, as we are faced with a weakened economy and high unemployment, an \noverreaching Environmental Protection Agency in Washington is blocking \nnew jobs for Kentuckians and Americans by waging a literal war on coal.\n  To mine for coal, coal operators must receive what are called 404 \npermits. Those come from the EPA in order to operate. One such mine in \nsouthern West Virginia followed all of the proper procedures and got \nthe green light from EPA to proceed with operations back in 2007.\n  But now, 3\\1/2\\ years later, in an unprecedented reversal, the EPA \nhas retroactively ``reinterpreted'' its authority, withdrawn the permit \nit issued, and shut down the mine. The EPA's reinterpretation cost 280 \nAmericans their jobs.\n  The EPA also announced that 79 of the 404 permit applications still \nbeing considered would be subject to ``enhanced environmental \nreview''--``enhanced environmental review''--effectively putting them \nin limbo along with the jobs and economic activity they could create. \nSome of those permits are for jobs in Kentucky.\n  The EPA's action simply defies logic. Not only are they changing the \nrules in the middle of the game, they are retroactively changing the \nrules to shut down mines they already approved. No mine, regardless of \nwhether it has been operating for years in full compliance of every \nrule and regulation, can be assured that Uncle Sam will not come along \nand shut them down.\n  Thousands of Kentuckians who work in coal mining or have jobs \ndependent on mining are literally in jeopardy. Other industries are at \nrisk also. Farmers, developers, the transportation industry, and others \nalso need permits from the EPA to continue to operate. They, too, could \nsee these permits revoked.\n  The EPA has turned the permitting process into a backdoor means of \nshutting down coal mines by sitting on permits indefinitely, thus \nremoving any regulatory certainty. What they are doing is outside the \nscope of their authority and the law and represents a fundamental \ndeparture from the permitting process as originally envisioned by \nCongress.\n  That is why I rise today to introduce, along with my good friends, \nSenator Rand Paul and Senator James Inhofe, the Mining Jobs Protection \nAct in the Senate.\n  This bill will tell the EPA to ``use it or lose it'' when deciding \nwhether to invoke its veto authority of a 404 permit within a \nreasonable timeframe, giving permit applicants the certainty they need \nto do business.\n  The bill would ensure that all 404 permits move forward to be either \napproved or rejected, so applicants are not left in limbo, unsure how \nto act.\n  The bill also ensures that EPA cannot use its veto retroactively.\n  While being fair to permit applicants, the bill still preserves the \nEPA's full veto authority to protect human health and the environment.\n  Here is how the legislation would work. Once the EPA receives the 404 \npermit, it will have 30 days to determine if it is considering using \nits veto authority. If the Agency is considering doing so, it must \npublish that fact in the Federal Register, cite any potential concerns, \nand detail what must be done to address those concerns within the \ninitial 30 days. The EPA then has an additional 30 days, for a total of \n2 months, to invoke its veto authority. If the Agency does not use its \nveto authority within 60 days, the permit automatically moves forward \nand EPA's veto authority expires. All permits that have already been \napplied for would go through this process, ensuring every permit gets a \nfair shake.\n  Any permits vetoed prior to the passage of the bill would be \nreconsidered by the Army Corps of Engineers. It was important to me \nthat this legislation address every 404 permit, not just one or a few.\n  This is a fair process that allows the EPA to act as vigorously as \nnecessary to protect the environment and those of us living in it while \nalso giving permit applications the certainty of knowing within a \nreasonable timeframe whether to proceed with mining operations and \nknowing that once they have the green light, it is not going to be \nsubsequently revoked. More important, this legislation will allow my \nState and others to protect the coal and related industry jobs we \nalready have and grow new ones in the future.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Kentucky and Senator Inhofe for \nstanding alongside me on this matter that is so important to our States \nbut also to the country as a whole. This is not just a Kentucky issue. \nWe think our bill strikes a fair balance toward conserving the best of \nAmerica's natural beauty while also building toward a brighter future.\n  The EPA's mission is important but so is job creation. Particularly \nwhen unemployment is higher than all of us would like, both sides of \nthe equation must be considered. So I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to make the Mining Jobs \nProtection Act a law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PERMITS FOR DREDGED OR FILL MATERIAL.\n\n       Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1344) is amended by striking subsection (c) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(c) Authority of Administrator to Disapprove \n     Specifications.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Administrator, in accordance with \n     this subsection, may prohibit the specification of any \n     defined area as a disposal site, and may deny or restrict the \n     use of any defined area for specification as a disposal site, \n     in any case in which the Administrator determines, after \n     notice and opportunity for public hearings and consultation \n     with the Secretary, that the discharge of those materials \n     into the area will have an unacceptable adverse effect on--\n       ``(A) municipal water supplies;\n       ``(B) shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning \n     and breeding areas);\n       ``(C) wildlife; or\n       ``(D) recreational areas.\n       ``(2) Deadline for action.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Administrator shall--\n       ``(i) not later than 30 days after the date on which the \n     Administrator receives from the Secretary for review a \n     specification proposed to be issued under subsection (a), \n     provide notice to the Secretary of, and publish in the \n     Federal Register, a description of any potential concerns of \n     the Administrator with respect to the specification, \n     including a list of\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\n     measures required to fully address those concerns; and\n       ``(ii) if the Administrator intends to disapprove a \n     specification, not later than 60 days after the date on which \n     the Administrator receives a proposed specification under \n     subsection (a) from the Secretary, provide to the Secretary \n     and the applicant, and publish in the Federal Register, a \n     statement of disapproval of the specification pursuant to \n     this subsection, including the reasons for the disapproval.\n       ``(B) Failure to act.--If the Administrator fails to take \n     any action or meet any deadline described in subparagraph (A) \n     with respect to a proposed specification, the Administrator \n     shall have no further authority under this subsection to \n     disapprove or prohibit issuance of the specification.\n       ``(3) No retroactive disapproval.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The authority of the Administrator to \n     disapprove or prohibit issuance of a specification under this \n     subsection--\n       ``(i) terminates as of the date that is 60 days after the \n     date on which the Administrator receives the proposed \n     specification from the Secretary for review; and\n       ``(ii) shall not be used with respect to any specification \n     after issuance of the specification by the Secretary under \n     subsection (a).\n       ``(B) Specifications disapproved before date of \n     enactment.--In any case in which, before the date of \n     enactment of this subparagraph, the Administrator disapproved \n     a specification under this subsection (as in effect on the \n     day before the date of enactment of the Mining Jobs \n     Protection Act) after the specification was issued by the \n     Secretary pursuant to subsection (a)--\n       ``(i) the Secretary may--\n\n       ``(I) reevaluate and reissue the specification after making \n     appropriate modifications; or\n       ``(II) elect not to reissue the specification; and\n\n       ``(ii) the Administrator shall have no further authority to \n     disapprove the modified specification or any reissuance of \n     the specification.\n       ``(C) Finality.--An election by the Secretary under \n     subparagraph (B)(i) shall constitute final agency action.\n       ``(4) Applicability.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), \n     this subsection applies to each specification proposed to be \n     issued under subsection (a) that is pending as of, or \n     requested or filed on or after, the date of enactment of the \n     Mining Jobs Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation. I \nthink this is a good first step to reining in an out-of-control, \nunelected bureaucracy. I think the EPA has gone way beyond its mandated \nduty and is now at the point of stifling industry in our country. We \nsee this and hear this across the State of Kentucky, as well as across \nthe country. The President doesn't seem to understand why the country \nthinks he is against business and against progress. One can't be for \njob creation if one is against the job creators.\n  As the minority leader indicated, we have nearly 100,000 jobs and \nhundreds of thousands of other jobs connected to coal. This really \napplies to the rest of the country as well. Over half of the \nelectricity in our country comes from coal. Over 90 percent of the \nelectricity in Kentucky comes from coal. Yet we have mining operations \nthat went through the process, some of them taking up to 10 years. I \nthink the mine in question went through a 10-year process, spent \nmillions of dollars to try to get started to provide electricity for \nthe rest of us. Yet then the EPA comes in at the last minute.\n  There is said to be nearly 200 permits out there languishing. I asked \nthe question of my staff this morning: How many have been applied for \nand how many have been granted? The EPA won't even tell us that. But \nfrom talking to those trying to produce the coal, to produce the \nelectricity for our country, they said they can't get permits. In fact, \nthere is one coal company in Kentucky that is now suing the Federal \nGovernment, saying they have taken his property. They have effectively \ntaken his property because he can't get a permit. This is a real \nproblem. The average expectancy for getting a permit in our country now \nfor all mines is 7 years.\n  We wonder why we are languishing as we depend on everyone else for \nour energy. We want to be energy independent, and we sit on top of some \nof our country's most natural resources in oil and coal. Yet we won't \nproduce our own. We have to become so involved and there are so many \njustifications for war across the world and this and that. Yet we \nrefuse to use our own resources.\n  This is a very good step in trying to make the process better. All it \nis saying is that the EPA cannot have unlimited time to sit on our \npermits. This is saying there have to be rules.\n  I say this is a first step because I think the last election was \nabout saying that unelected bureaucrats should not write law. That is \nwhat has happened. The President and many of his supporters have \nindicated they can't get cap and trade through the elected body, so \nthey are going to go through the back door, through regulations. The \nAmerican people need to stand up and say that unelected bureaucrats \nshould not and cannot be allowed to write law. That is essentially what \nis happening now. I think this is a great first step. I compliment the \nminority leader for bringing this forward, and I wholeheartedly support \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Murkowski, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 472. A bill to increase the mileage reimbursement rate for members \nof the armed services during permanent change of station and to \nauthorize the transportation of additional motor vehicles of members on \nchange of permanent station to or from nonforeign areas outside the \ncontinental United States; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr President, last week I had the privilege to travel to \nthe Army's National Training Center to see the 1st Stryker Brigade \nCombat Team from Alaska train. I was amazed at what our soldiers do to \nprepare for the defense of our country.\n  Despite their upcoming deployment to Afghanistan in May, these Arctic \nWarriors were not thinking about themselves. They were thinking about \ntheir families. Over and over I heard how important their family's \nsecurity and support system was to them, especially as they prepared to \ndeploy.\n  To help out our military families today I am pleased to introduce the \nService Members Permanent Change of Station Relief Act with my \ncosponsors Senator Patty Murray, Senator Barbara Boxer, and Senator \nLisa Murkowski. This bill will improve financial security for our \nmilitary families by increasing reimbursement for out-of-pocket \nexpenses they often incur during government directed moves.\n  First, the bill will provide reimbursement to military families for \ncosts incurred transporting a second car on a change of permanent duty \nstation to or from Alaska, Hawaii or Guam. As with their counterparts \nin civilian life, many military families today own and rely on a second \nvehicle to work, take care of their children and meet day-to-day needs \nof the family. By doing this, we can save our military families $2,000 \nin personal expenses they pay to transport a second car.\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\n  Additionally, the bill increases the gas mileage reimbursement rate \nto $.51 per mile during a move to allow for compensation of all costs \nand depreciation resulting from use of a personal vehicle for a \ngovernment move.\n  Our military families make great personal sacrifices for our country. \nProviding the Arctic Warriors and other military members a little peace \nof mind about the financial security of their families is the least we \ncan do.

A bill to extend the chemical facility security program of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the law granting the Federal Government, \nfor the first time, the authority to regulate the security of the \nNation's highest risk chemical facilities is due to expire on March 18. \nWe cannot allow this to occur. Given the success of this law and its \nvital importance to all Americans, I am introducing legislation today \nwith Senators Pryor, Portman, and Landrieu to extend and improve the \nlaw.\n  More than 70,000 products are created through the use of chemicals, \nhelping to supply the consumer, industrial, construction, and \nagricultural sectors of our economy. The United States is home to \nthousands of facilities that manufacture, use, or store chemicals.\n  This industry is vital to our economy, with annual sales of $725 \nbillion, exports of $171 billion, and more than 780,000 employees.\n  After September 11, 2001, we realized that chemical facilities were \nvulnerable to terrorist attack. Given the hazardous chemicals present \nat many locations, terrorists could view them as attractive targets, \nyielding loss of life, significant injuries, and major destruction if \nsuccessfully attacked.\n  In 2005, as Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I held a series of hearings on chemical security. \nFollowing these hearings, Senators Lieberman, Carper, Levin, and I \nintroduced bipartisan legislation authorizing the Department of \nHomeland Security to set and enforce security standards at high-risk \nchemical facilities. That bill was incorporated into the homeland \nsecurity appropriations act that was signed into law in 2006.\n  To implement this new authority, DHS established the Chemical \nFacility Anti-Terrorism Standards program, or CFATS. The program sets \n18 risk-based performance standards that high-risk chemical facilities \nmust meet. These security standards cover a range of threats, such as \nperimeter security, access control, theft, internal sabotage, and cyber \nsecurity.\n  High-risk chemical facilities covered by the program must conduct \nmandatory vulnerability assessments, develop site security plans, and \ninvest in protective measures.\n  The Department must approve these assessments and site security \nplans, using audits and inspections to ensure compliance with the \nperformance standards. The Secretary has strong authority to shut down \nfacilities that are non-compliant.\n  This risk-based approach has made the owners and operators of \nchemical plants partners with the Federal Government in implementing a \nsuccessful, collaborative security program.\n  This landmark law has been in place slightly more than four years. \nTaxpayers have invested nearly $300 million in the program, and \nchemical plants have invested hundreds of millions more to comply with \nthe law. As a direct result, security at our Nation's chemical \nfacilities is much stronger today.\n  Now we must reauthorize the program. Simply put, the program works \nand should be extended.\n  Changing this successful law, as was proposed last year by the House \nof Representatives in partisan legislation, would discard what is \nworking for an unproven and burdensome plan.\n  We must not undermine the substantial investments of time and \nresources already made in CFATS implementation by both DHS and the \nprivate sector. Worse would be requiring additional expenditures with \nno demonstrable increase to the overall security of our Nation.\n  In the 111th Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives \ndebated a provision that would alter the fundamental nature of CFATS. \nThe provision would have required the Department to completely rework \nthe program. It would have mandated the use of so-called ``inherently \nsafer technology,'' or IST.\n  What is IST? It is an approach to process engineering. It is not, \nhowever, a security measure.\n  An IST mandate may actually increase or unacceptably transfer risk to \nother points in the chemical process or elsewhere in the supply chain.\n  For example, many drinking water utilities have determined that \nchlorine remains their best and most effective drinking water treatment \noption. Their decisions were not based solely on financial \nconsiderations, but also on many other factors, such as the \ncharacteristics of the region's climate, geography, and source water \nsupplies, the size and location of the utility's facilities, and the \nrisks and benefits of chlorine use compared to the use of alternative \ntreatment processes.\n  According to one water utility located in an isolated area of the \nnorthwest United States, if Congress were to force it to replace its \nuse of gaseous\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\nchlorine with sodium hypochlorite, then the utility would have to use \nas much as seven times the current quantity of treatment chemicals to \nachieve comparable water quality results. In turn, the utility would \nhave to arrange for many more bulk chemical deliveries, by trucks, into \na watershed area. The greater quantities of chemicals and increased \nfrequency of truck deliveries would heighten the risk of an accident \nresulting in a chemical spill into the watershed. In fact, the \naccidental release of sodium hypochlorite into the watershed would \nlikely cause greater harm to soils, vegetation, and streams than a \ngaseous chlorine release in this remote area.\n  Currently, DHS cannot dictate specific security measures, like IST. \nNor should it. The Federal Government should set performance standards, \nbut leave it up to the private sector to decide precisely how to \nachieve those standards.\n  Forcing chemical facilities to implement IST could cost jobs at some \nfacilities and affect the availability of many vital products.\n  Last year, the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates \ntestified that mandatory IST would restrict the production of \npharmaceuticals and microelectronics, hobbling these industries. The \nincreased cost of a mandatory IST program may force chemical companies \nto simply transfer their operations overseas, costing American workers \nthousands of jobs.\n  To be clear, some owners and operators of chemical facilities may \nchoose to use IST. But that decision should be theirs--not \nWashington's. Congress should not dictate specific industrial processes \nunder the guise of security when a facility could choose other \nalternatives that meet the Nation's security needs.\n  Last July, the Homeland Security Committee unanimously approved \nbipartisan legislation I authored with Senators Pryor, Voinovich, and \nLandrieu to extend CFATS for three more years.\n  Additionally, the bill would have established voluntary exercise and \ntraining programs to improve collaboration with the private sector and \nstate and local communities under the CFATS program; created a \nvoluntary technical assistance program; and created a chemical facility \nsecurity best practices clearinghouse and private sector advisory board \nat DHS to assist in the implementation of CFATS.\n  Today, along with Senators Pryor, Portman, and Landrieu, I am \nreintroducing this bill. The Continuing Chemical Facilities \nAntiterrorism Security Act of 2011 is a straight-forward, common-sense \nreauthorization of the CFATS program.\n  I am conscious of the risks our Nation faces through an attack on a \nchemical facility. That is why I authored this law in the first place \nand battled considerable opposition to get it enacted. We should \nsupport the continuation of this successful security program without \nthe addition of costly, unproven Federal mandates. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Coburn, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Enzi, and \n        Mr. Brown, of Massachusetts):\n  S. 474. A bill to reform the regulatory process to ensure that small \nbusinesses are free to compete and to create jobs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. Snowe. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senators Coburn, Ayotte, \nEnzi, and Brown of Massachusetts, to introduce the Small Business \nRegulatory Freedom Act of 2011, a vital measure that will help ensure \nthat the federal government fully consider small business job creation \nin the bills we pass here in Congress and in the rules and regulations \nthat agencies promulgate.\n  As the former Chair and now Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I believe there is no more urgent \nimperative than job creation in our country. For the past 21 months, \nthe unemployment rate has stood at 9 percent or above. We cannot allow \nthese outrageous levels of unemployment to become the new normal. \nTherefore, it is essential that we focus like a laser on jumpstarting \nour economy. Now is the time to tear down barriers to job creation, not \nbuild them higher.\n  Unfortunately, recent data suggests that not only is this \nadministration failing to tear down barriers to small business job \ncreation, but rather is actively constructing new obstacles. In fiscal \nyear 2010 alone, this administration embarked on nothing short of \nregulatory rampage, stampeding over small business, through the \npromulgation of 43 new major regulations promulgated in fiscal year \n2010, imposing $26.5 billion in new regulatory compliance costs, and \nthat's on top of the $1.75 trillion in annual compliance costs that the \nSBA Office of Advocacy recently reported.\n  Simply put, this is unacceptable. Too often, the Federal Government \nconsiders the regulatory impact on small firms merely as an \nafterthought rather than a top priority. In my recent street tours and \nmeetings in Maine, aside from taxes, small businesses complain most \nabout the onerous regulations emanating from every agency, every sphere \nof Washington, DC. Consider that, according to the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the health reform law, which I opposed, mandates 41 separate \nrulemakings, at least 100 additional regulatory guidance documents, and \n129 reports. What's most alarming, small firms with fewer than 20 \nemployees bear a disproportionate burden of complying with federal \nregulations, paying an annual regulatory cost of $10,585 per employee, \nwhich is 36 percent higher than the regulatory cost facing larger \nfirms.\n  This must change, and the ``Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act of \n2011,'' aims to do just that. Our bill reforms the flawed rulemaking \nprocess to ensure that federal agencies consider small business impact \nbefore a rule is promulgated, not after. Our legislation, which is \nstrongly supported by the National Federation of Independent Business, \nNFIB, would amend the Regulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, the seminal \nlegislation enacted in 1980 that requires Federal agencies to conduct \nsmall business analyses for any proposed or final regulation that would \nimpose a significant impact on a substantial number of small firms.\n  The first provision in our bill would enhance these small business \nanalyses, by requiring agencies to draw in rules with foreseeable \n``indirect'' economic effects under the definition of rules covered by \nthe RFA. Such rules are currently exempt from the RFA, which currently \nonly applies to ``direct'' economic impact. The RFA has already saved \nbillions for small businesses by forcing government regulators to be \nsensitive to their direct impact on small firms. If billions of dollars \ncan be filtered out of direct regulatory mandates upon small business \nwhile improving workplace safety and environmental conditions, even \nmore can be saved by filtering out unnecessary or duplicative costs to \nthose small businesses indirectly impacted by regulation.\n  The bill would also expand judicial review requirements currently in \nthe RFA to allow small entities to seek review and an injunction at the \nproposed rule stage if agencies fail to fully consider small business \nimpact as they are required to by law. This will help to ensure that \nfederal agencies complete meaningful initial analyses under the RFA. \nCurrently, small entities can only seek review on the date of the final \nregulatory action.\n  In addition, our legislation would amend and clarify the requirements \nunder the RFA for the periodic review of rules. Many questions have \narisen as a result of the ambiguous language in the RFA that have \ncaused some confusion as to what rules require periodic review and \nwhen. Our bill clarifies the requirements for ``periodic review'' under \nSection 610 of the RFA so that both existing rules and rules that are \npromulgated after enactment of the Small Business Regulatory Freedom \nAct of 2011 are periodically reviewed within 10 years and every ten \nyears thereafter. Along with each review, an agency must also create \nand update small business compliance guides to assist small businesses \ncomply with that agencies regulations. The requirements of periodic \nreview would also apply to these compliance guides and must be updated \nwhen the rule is reviewed.\n  Unfortunately, past efforts to encourage agencies to periodically \nreview their regulations have failed because of\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\nthe lack of an enforcement mechanism. Our bill rectifies this issue. To \nensure agency compliance the bill includes a sunset provision. If the \nChief Counsel for the SBA Office of Advocacy determines that an agency \nhas failed to conduct the necessary periodic review of a rule, then \nthat rule will sunset and cease to have effect.\n  Moreover, the bill would expand the small business review panel \nprocess requirement, SBREFA panels, to apply to all agencies. These \npanels currently only apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, and, thanks \nto an amendment that I included in the Wall Street Reform legislation, \nthe new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB. These panels have \nworked well at EPA and OSHA since 1996, so why not apply this \nstipulation to every federal agency, so small businesses are considered \nfirst, and not as an afterthought?\n  Furthermore, our bill would extend the RFA to informal agency \nguidance documents, so that Federal agencies must conduct small \nbusiness economic analyses before publishing informal guidance \ndocuments. Many agencies, including the OSHA, have repeatedly subverted \nthe rulemaking process through the use of guidance documents or \n``reinterpretations'' so that they don't have to adhere to their RFA \nobligations, including small business review panels--this provision \nwill help to end that practice.\n  This legislation also seeks to clarify language included in the RFA \nthat has led to a great deal of confusion regarding RFA applicability \nto the IRS, and would once and for all ensure that indeed the IRS is \ncovered under the RFA ending the longstanding practice of the IRS \nutilizing some unprecedented interpretations to circumvent compliance \nwith the RFA--this bill closes those loopholes. For example, the IRS \nhas argued that paperwork requirements are mandated by Congress and \nthus it is Congress that is creating the requirement, not the IRS. Our \nbill would clarify the definitions so the IRS and other agencies can no \nlonger dodge conducting its RFA obligations.\n  Our bill will also update a dormant provision of the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA, by requiring that federal \nagencies review existing penalty structures within 6 months of \nenactment and every two years thereafter to mitigate penalty provisions \non small firms. Too often agencies, like OSHA, set or update their \npenalty structures without considering small business economic impact. \nOur provision should end this practice.\n  Strengthening how Federal agencies execute their small business \nanalyses is also a central requirement for real reform. This \nlegislation will accomplish this goal through three fundamental \nreforms:\n  First, it would require a calculation of the additional cumulative \nimpact the proposed rule will impose on small entities, including job \ncreation and employment effects, beyond what is already imposed on \nsmall firms by the agency.\n  Second, the bill would require federal agencies to notify the Chief \nCounsel for the SBA Office Advocacy about any draft rule that will \ntrigger an RFA analysis when the agency submits the draft rule to OMB's \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA.\n  Third, our legislation would strengthen final regulatory flexibility \nanalyses under RFA. Currently, small business analyses in final rules \nare only required to produce a summary analysis, general statement, or \nexplanation regarding a rule's effect on small entities. In practice \nthis has allowed agencies to avoid an in depth analysis of a rule's \neffect. Our legislation would enhance reporting so an agency must \ninclude a detailed analysis. It also would require the promulgating \nagency to publish the entire final analysis on its web site and in the \nFederal Register.\n  Our bill will also ensure that before an agency certifies that a \nproposed rule will not impose an economic impact on small business, it \nmust first determine the average cost of the rule for small entities \naffected or reasonably presumed to be affected; the number of small \nfirms affected or presumed to be affected; and the number of affected \nsmall entities for which the cost of the rule will be significant. \nAlso, before a certification statement can be published the agency must \nsend a copy of the certification to, and consult with, the Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy on the accuracy of the certification and \nstatement.\n  Finally, the bill will clarify that the Chief Counsel for the SBA \nOffice of Advocacy to be an attorney with expertise or knowledge of the \nregulatory process. This will ensure that the President nominates a \nqualified individual who will be the most effective advocate for small \nbusiness possible. We also provide additional powers to the Chief \nCounsel by allowing him or her to comment on any regulatory action, not \njust during the notice and comment rulemaking process. In the past, the \nOffice of Advocacy has refused to weigh in on matters outside the \nrulemaking process--e.g., guidance documents--citing a lack of \nauthority to do so.\n  In a November 2010 Senate Small Business Committee hearing, it was \nnoted that if there were a 30 percent cut in regulatory costs, an \naverage 10-person firm would save, on average nearly $32,000, enough to \nhire one additional person. There is no doubt, reducing the regulatory \nburden on American small businesses will create jobs. After 21 straight \nmonths with unemployment at or above nine percent, it is more \nimperative than ever that we finally liberate American small businesses \nfrom the regulatory burden holding them down.\n  It is essential that we pass this legislation. I urge my colleagues \nto support my bill so we can ensure that our nation's small businesses \nand their employees are provided with much needed relief.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\n     for job creation and job loss, of proposed rules, \n     periodically review existing regulations to determine their \n     impact on small entities, and repeal regulations that are \n     unnecessarily duplicative or have outlived their stated \n     purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     creation or job loss.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCLUDING INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN SMALL ENTITY \n                   ANALYSES.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `economic impact' means, with respect to a \n     proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) any direct economic effect of the rule on small \n     entities; and\n       ``(B) any indirect economic effect on small entities, \n     including potential job creation or job loss, that is \n     reasonably foreseeable and that results from the rule, \n     without regard to whether small entities are directly \n     regulated by the rule.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. JUDICIAL REVIEW TO ALLOW SMALL ENTITIES TO CHALLENGE \n                   PROPOSED REGULATIONS.\n\n       Section 611(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (3) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) A small entity may seek such review during the 1-year \n     period beginning on the date of final agency action, except \n     that--\n       ``(A) if a provision of law requires that an action \n     challenging a final agency action be commenced before the \n     expiration of 1 year, the lesser period shall apply to an \n     action for judicial review under this section; and\n       ``(B) in the case of noncompliance with section 603 or \n     605(b), a small entity may seek judicial review of agency \n     compliance with such section before the close of the public \n     comment period.''; and\n       (4) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``, and'' and \n     inserting a semicolon;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) issuing an injunction prohibiting an agency from \n     taking any agency action with respect to a rulemaking until \n     that agency is in compliance with the requirements of section \n     603 or 605.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to enhance and further research into the prevention \nand treatment of eating disorders, to improve access to treatment of \neating disorders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senators \nKlobuchar and Franken to reintroduce the Federal Response to \nEliminating Eating Disorders Act, or the FREED Act. The FREED Act is a \ncomprehensive legislative effort to confront eating disorders in the \nUnited States, to learn more about their devastating impact, and to \noffer support and care to those who suffer from these illnesses.\n  Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge \neating disorder are widespread, insidious, and too often fatal. Today, \nat least 5 million Americans suffer from eating disorders. Because \nthese conditions often go undiagnosed and unreported, the actual number \nmay be closer to 11 million Americans, including 1 million males. These \ndisorders don't discriminate by gender, race, income, or age.\n  Eating disorders are dangerous conditions, though their consequences \nare often underestimated. Eating disorders are associated with serious \nheart conditions, kidney failure, osteoporosis, infertility, \ngastrointestinal disorders, and even death. The National Institute of \nMental Health estimates that one in 10 people with anorexia nervosa \nwill die of starvation, cardiac arrest, or some other medical \ncomplication. Let me repeat that--one in 10. That is deeply disturbing, \nand demands a much more aggressive federal response. Moreover, \nfatalities resulting from eating disorders are grossly underreported, \nbecause deaths are typically recorded by listing the immediate cause of \ndeath, such as cardiac arrest, rather than the underlying cause, which \nis the eating disorder.\n  Nonetheless, despite the prevalence and very serious health impacts \nof eating disorders, we simply do not know enough about the causes of \neating disorders, or how to stop them from developing in the first \nplace. Research suggests a genetic component to eating disorders, but \nwe must learn more in order to effectively prevent these deadly \nconditions before they start.\n  The good news is that eating disorders are treatable. With \nappropriate nutritional, medical, and psychotherapeutic interventions, \nthose who suffer from eating disorders can be successfully and fully \ntreated and go on to live full and healthy lives. But right now, only \none in 10 people receive treatment. We know how to help people with \neating disorders and we need a renewed commitment to do just that.\n  The FREED Act takes an important step forward in authorizing \nresources for research, screening, treatment, and prevention of eating \ndisorders.\n  First, the FREED Act expands research efforts at the National \nInstitutes of Health to examine the causes and consequences of eating \ndisorders. In order to effectively prevent and treat these conditions, \nit is imperative that we understand them. The FREED Act also improves \nsurveillance and data collection systems at CDC so that we will have \naccurate information and epidemiological data on eating disorders. Such \nsurveillance will provide us with the necessary information to be as \neffective as possible with our interventions.\n  Second, the FREED Act expands access to treatment services and \nscreening for eating disorders for Medicaid beneficiaries, and \nauthorizes funds for a patient advocacy network that will help \nindividuals with eating disorders find treatment. Furthermore, the \nFREED Act improves the training and education of health care providers \nand educators so they know how to identify and treat individuals \nsuffering from eating disorders. Too often, eating disorders go \nundiagnosed when health care providers lack the necessary training to \nidentify these illnesses.\n  Finally, we need to step up crucial efforts to prevent these \ndisorders from occurring in the first place. As I have said so many \ntimes, we don't have a genuine health care system in America; we have a \nsick care system. In other words, if you get sick, you get treatment. \nBut we spend just pennies on the dollar to prevent disease and illness \nin the first place and need to place a much more robust emphasis on \nwellness, nutrition, physical activity, and public health. With this in \nmind, the FREED Act authorizes funds to develop and implement evidence-\nbased prevention programs and promote healthy eating behaviors in \nschools, athletic programs, and other community-based programs, where \nwe can reach Americans at risk of developing these conditions.\n  Eating disorders touch the lives of so many of us and our families \nand friends; nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with \nan eating disorder. We must do a better job at the federal level of \nconducting research, understanding treatment, and preventing these \nconditions. The FREED Act builds on the investments we made in \nprevention, wellness, and mental health in the Affordable Care Act and \nmental health parity. Millions of American will benefit from our \nattention to this significant public health problem.\n  I thank Senators Klobuchar and Franken for partnering with me on the \nreintroduction of this bill, and urge our colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this important federal response to eating disorders.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Response to \n     Eliminate Eating Disorders Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Estimates, based on current research, indicate that at \n     least 5,000,000 people in the United States suffer from \n     eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, \n     binge eating disorder, and eating disorders not otherwise \n     specified (referred to in this Act as ``EDNOS'').\n       (2) Anecdotal evidence suggests that as many as 11,000,000 \n     people in the United States, including 1,000,000 males, may \n     suffer from eating disorders.\n       (3) Eating disorders occur in all nations and in all \n     populations, and among people of all ages and races and of \n     both genders.\n       (4) Eating disorders are diseases with grave health \n     consequences and high rates of mortality.\n       (5) Health consequences associated with eating disorders \n     include heart failure and other serious cardiac conditions, \n     electrolyte imbalance, kidney failure, osteoporosis, \n     debilitating tooth decay, and gastrointestinal disorders, \n     including esophageal inflammation and rupture, gastric \n     rupture, peptic ulcers, and pancreatitis.\n       (6) Anorexia nervosa has one of the highest overall \n     mortality rates of any mental illness. According to the \n     National Institute of Mental Health, 1 in 10 people with \n     anorexia nervosa will die of starvation, cardiac arrest, or \n     another medical complication.\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\n       (7) The risk of death among adolescents with anorexia \n     nervosa is 11 times greater than in disease-free adolescents.\n       (8) Anorexia nervosa has the highest suicide rate of all \n     mental illnesses.\n       (9) New research suggests that bulimia nervosa has a much \n     higher rate of mortality than is reflected in current \n     statistics, because of the failure to identify the underlying \n     eating disorder.\n       (10) Binge eating disorder is the most common eating \n     disorder, with an estimated 3.5 percent of American women and \n     2 percent of American men expected to suffer from this \n     disorder in their lifetime. Binge eating disorder is \n     characterized by frequent episodes of uncontrolled overeating \n     and is associated with obesity, heart disease, gall bladder \n     disease, and diabetes.\n       (11) Research demonstrates that there is a significant \n     genetic component to the development of eating disorders.\n       (12) Certain populations, including adolescent females and \n     athletes of both genders, are at higher risk of developing an \n     eating disorder.\n       (13) Different types of eating disorders may affect certain \n     races and genders disproportionately.\n       (14) Despite the serious health consequences and the high \n     risk of death, Federal research funding for eating disorders \n     has lagged behind research concerning other diseases, when \n     compared by the number of individuals affected by, and the \n     relative health consequences of, the diseases.\n       (15) The ability of individuals suffering from eating \n     disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa, binge eating \n     disorder, and EDNOS to access appropriate treatment is \n     unacceptably low.\n       (16) The development of an eating disorder is frequently \n     preceded by unhealthy weight control behaviors commonly \n     identified as disordered eating, including skipping meals, \n     using diet pills, taking laxatives, self-induced vomiting, \n     and fasting. Such disordered eating behaviors should be \n     included in enhanced research prevention and training \n     efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to expand research into the prevention of eating \n     disorders;\n       (2) to expand research on effective treatment and \n     intervention of eating disorders and to support evidence-\n     based programs designed to prevent eating disorders;\n       (3) to expand research on the causes, courses, and outcomes \n     of eating disorders;\n       (4) to increase the number of people properly screened and \n     diagnosed with an eating disorder;\n       (5) to improve training and education of health care and \n     behavioral care providers and of school personnel at all \n     levels of elementary and secondary education;\n       (6) to improve surveillance and data systems for tracking \n     the prevalence, severity, and economic costs of eating \n     disorders; and\n       (7) to enhance access to comprehensive treatment for eating \n     disorders.\n\n            TITLE I--EATING DISORDER DETECTION AND RESEARCH\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to require certain mortgagees to evaluate loans for \nmodifications, to establish a grant program for State and local \ngovernment mediation programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Preserving Homes \nand Communities Act. I introduced an earlier version of this \nlegislation in 2009. I am pleased to again be joined by Senators \nDurbin, Leahy, Merkley, Whitehouse, and Franken as cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  The sheer number of foreclosures across the country is startling. \nSince the beginning of 2009, there have been approximately 5 million \nforeclosures, and the Center for Responsible Lending estimates there \nwill be a total of 9 million foreclosures between 2009 and 2012. In my \nhome state of Rhode Island, the numbers are similarly shocking because \n1 in every 10 mortgaged homeowners is in foreclosure or seriously \ndelinquent on their mortgage payment.\n  Rhode Island families have felt the effects of the recession and the \nnational housing crisis harder than most, which is why I worked with \nthe Obama Administration and led the effort to expand the Hardest Hit \nFund to include Rhode Island. This program is just getting underway, \nand my hope is that it will provide much needed targeted assistance to \nstruggling homeowners and expand the number of loss mitigation tools in \norder to prevent more Rhode Islanders from falling into foreclosure.\n  Unfortunately, additional efforts are needed because the foreclosure \ncrisis has grown in complexity as a result of the revelations last fall \npointing to poorly handled, if not illegal, foreclosure processing. \nCutting these corners at the risk of severe legal consequences raises \nserious questions about not only the value of mortgage related \ninvestments, but also the loan modification efforts of servicers.\n  I will persist in my efforts to fight improper foreclosures and to \nbring Rhode Islanders the relief they deserve, and this commitment \ncontinues today with the introduction of the Preserving Homes and \nCommunities Act. This bill has been updated and enhanced from its \npredecessor in the last Congress to reflect the fact that some \nprovisions have been enacted into law and to address emerging issues \nthat are standing in the way of saving as many homes as possible.\n  Most importantly, this bill, like the one I introduced in 2009, \neliminates the so called ``dual-track'' in which a homeowner is \nevaluated for a home loan modification while simultaneously being \nforeclosed upon. The prospect of losing one's home is daunting enough, \nand unfortunately, too many troubled homeowners have received a \nmodification notice one day followed by a foreclosure notice the next \nday. This is just too confusing and injects additional uncertainty at \nthe most unnerving time for a troubled homeowner. Simply put, there \nshould be no dual track. There should be one track, and while a \ntroubled homeowner is being evaluated for a loan modification, they \nshould have the comfort of knowing that foreclosure proceedings will \nnot be initiated. This bill establishes this single track.\n  Second, in light of the repeated difficulties that troubled \nhomeowners have faced in contacting and remaining in touch with their \nservicers, this bill continues to provide a means for more State and \nlocal governments to establish mediation programs. These programs \nprovide a process by which a neutral third party presides over \ndiscussions between homeowners and servicers to review and discuss \nalternatives to foreclosure.\n  Third, with this bill, I continue my efforts to fund the National \nHousing Trust Fund, which would enable the building, preservation, and \nrehabilitation of affordable rental housing through the proceeds \nreceived from the warrant provisions I crafted for the financial rescue \npackage in 2008. These warrant provisions ensured that as banking \ninstitutions recovered from their near collapse, American taxpayers, \nwho bankrolled their recovery, would also benefit from the upside. To \ndate, more than $8 billion in warrant proceeds have been recouped by \ntaxpayers. As I have stated before, my view is that some of these \nreturns from providing a firmer foundation for our financial \ninstitutions would be put to good use by providing a firmer foundation \nfor affordable rental housing in our country by finally funding the \nNational Housing Trust Fund.\n  This bill also has several new provisions. First, in response to \nrepeated concerns that the loan modification process has been lacking \nin transparency, this bill creates a dispute resolution mechanism \nwithin the loan modification process itself. Under this bill, troubled \nhomeowners and servicers may work out their disagreements with a \nneutral third party on a fair playing field with all the information \nrequired to evaluate whether a home loan modification application was \nproperly evaluated.\n  Second, this legislation addresses the recent robo-signing \nallegations by requiring servicers, if a home loan modification is \ndenied, to prove that they actually have the legal right to foreclose.\n  Third, this bill responds to difficulties faced by individuals who, \nfor example, have come to own and live in a mortgaged home through the \ndeath of a loved one. These unfortunate life events are tough enough. \nAs long as these individuals live in these homes as\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\ntheir primary residences and are having difficulties paying their \nmortgages due to financial hardship, they too would have to be \nevaluated for a loan modification before banks could foreclose under my \nlegislation.\n  Fourth, this bill adds another provision to the section placing \nreasonable limits on foreclosure fees and costly markups by prohibiting \nabusive fees charged in response to lapsed home insurance policies. \nUnder this bill, when a home insurance policy lapses, the servicer may \nonly charge a fee in an amount equal to the cost of continuing or re-\nestablishing the home insurance policy. No more, and no less.\n  Lastly, I think it's important to make one final point about this \nbill. It provides the means for servicers to legitimately evaluate \nstruggling homeowners for loan modifications, but it does not require \nservicers to work with homeowners who have clearly abandoned their \nhomes, as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. \nThis bill is narrowly and responsibly tailored to prevent foreclosures \nthat can be avoided and to ensure that all finalized foreclosures are \nproperly and objectively processed. In short, this legislation is fair.\n  The foreclosure crisis has persisted for far too long, and it is time \nto finally address this issue once and for all. The Preserving Homes \nand Communities Act provides a path to stabilizing the housing sector \nas a means of bolstering and sustaining our economic recovery. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me and Senators Durbin, Leahy, Merkley, \nWhitehouse, and Franken in supporting this bill and taking the \nlegislative steps necessary to address foreclosures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 489\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nlegislation I have introduced with Senators Reed, Merkley, Sanders and \nTester to enhance foreclosure protections for our servicemembers and \ntheir families, and to help ensure that their rights under the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act are not violated.\n  We have all heard horror stories about how servicers treat homeowners \nin distress. When these abusive mortgage practices harm the men and \nwomen who are sent into harm's way to protect our country, it is a \nparticular tragedy and it deserves our urgent attention.\n  Not only are these practices illegal and morally repugnant, they can \nalso be a dangerous distraction from our military mission. Holly \nPetraeus, General Petraeus' wife, leads the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau's Office for Service Member Affairs, and she \ntestified on this issue during a recent hearing before the House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. As she put it, ``[i]t is a terrible \nsituation for the family at home and for the servicemember abroad who \nfeels helpless.''\n  Service members over at the point of the spear in Afghanistan have \nenough to worry about without worrying about the bank foreclosing on \ntheir family.\n  According to recent media reports, it has come to light that \nfinancial institutions have repeatedly failed to comply with the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act or ``SCRA''. These violations led to \nthousands of mortgage overcharges and a number of unlawful \nforeclosures. Under the SCRA, it is illegal to foreclose on a protected \nservicemember unless an authorization by a judge is obtained. Then, the \njudge can only act after a hearing is held in which the military \nhomeowner is represented.\n  One of the most troubling cases is the story of SGT James B. Hurley, \nwho lost his home while he was serving in Iraq. Like many Reservists, \nSergeant Hurley made less money serving on active duty than he did in \nhis civilian job. So, when he was mobilized, it became a real struggle \nfor his family to afford his mortgage and they fell behind in making \nhis payments.\n\n  The SCRA was designed to protect our servicemembers from financial \nchallenges associated with deployments, and it should have prevented \nthe bank from foreclosing on Sergeant Hurley. However, the bank \nviolated the SCRA, foreclosing on Sergeant Hurley illegally, and \nforcing his wife and children out of their home. Sergeant Hurley \nreturned from combat, as a disabled veteran, only to find that the bank \nhad sold the home that he worked so hard to build.\n  The current economic climate has hit our returning veterans \nparticularly hard, adding to the financial challenges our deployed \nservicemembers already face. According to a recent Department of Labor \nreport, the unemployment rate for veterans rose to 9.9 percent overall, \nand 15.2 percent for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  These heartbreaking statistics underscore how difficult it can be to \nreadjust economically to life at home. For our returning servicemembers \nthat need time to get back on financial solid footing, to rebuild what \nthey had to walk away from to defend the rest of us, we should do \neverything we can to accommodate their needs, especially during these \ndifficult economic times.\n  The Protecting Servicemembers from Mortgage Abuses Act of 2011, which \nI am introducing would encourage compliance with the SCRA by doubling \nthe maximum criminal penalties for violations of its foreclosure and \neviction protections. It would also double civil penalties in cases \nwhere the Attorney General has commenced a civil action against the \nlender.\n  In addition, the bill will give servicemembers the time they need \nafter returning from deployment to regain solid financial footing, by \nextending the period of foreclosure protection coverage from 9 to 24 \nmonths after military service has ended.\n  I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will come together and \njoin me in supporting legislation to discourage loan servicers from \nfurther violations and help to protect the financial and emotional \nwell-being of our troops.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA.\n  S. 490. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase the \nmaximum age for children eligible for medical care under the CHAMPVA \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, many dependent children of veterans \nwho permanently and totally disabled from a service connected \ndisability or who died in the line of duty are no longer being covered \nby their health insurance program. I am introducing important \nlegislation that would make a critical adjustment to current \neligibility requirements for children who receive health care under the \nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs program.\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\n  CHAMPVA was established in 1973 within the Veterans Administration to \nprovide health care services to dependents and survivors of our \nNation's veterans. CHAMPVA enrollment has grown steadily over the years \nand, as of fiscal year 2009, covers more than 336,000 beneficiaries.\n  Under the current law, a dependent child loses eligibility for \nCHAMPVA upon turning 18-years-old, unless the child is enrolled in \nschool on a full-time basis. After losing full-time status at school, \nor upon turning 23-years-old, an eligible child of a veteran would lose \neligibility.\n  The landmark health care reform act that was enacted into law last \nyear includes a provision that requires private health insurance to \ncover dependent children until age 26.\n  I believe it is only fair to afford children who are CHAMPVA \nbeneficiaries the same eligibility as dependent children whose parents \nhave private sector coverage. Beneficiaries are already being cut off \nfrom coverage. We need to take prompt action to extend coverage to the \ndependents of these veterans who have given so much to our country.

Mr. President, today I submitted a \nresolution with my friend, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, to \nrecognize and celebrate the importance of cooperatives to our economy, \nand our rural communities in particular. In 2009, the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly officially declared 2012 as ``The International Year \nof Cooperatives'' through a resolution calling on governments to \nrecognize the important role cooperatives play in providing economic \nopportunity for millions of people in the United States and throughout \nthe world. Our resolution highlights the impact of cooperatives and \nencourages the development of programs, both here and abroad, for \ncooperative development.\n  The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 was the first legal protection for \nthe cooperative business model in which a business is democratically \ncontrolled and owned by its members and operates for the mutual benefit \nof its members. The membership of a cooperative is comprised of the \nindividuals who use the business' services or buy its goods. The \nCapper-Volstead Act was originally enacted with the purpose of legally \nempowering farmers to pool their marketing resources and to improve \nfarmers' bargaining power with the buyers of their products. The \ncooperative business model has since expanded to other areas of the \neconomy, and has contributed significantly to economic growth in rural \ncommunities.\n  A recent study from the University of Wisconsin Center for \nCooperatives found that today, 29,000 U.S. cooperatives operate at \n73,000 places of business throughout the country. They have a \nsignificant impact on the economy, employing around 2 million people \nand generating more than $650 billion in revenue annually. \nAdditionally, the member-owned and controlled nature of cooperatives, \nparticularly in rural States like South Dakota, helps to ensure that \neconomic activity remains in the community. Having a membership stake \nin a local business tends to make one more likely to buy goods or \nservices from that business, thereby contributing to local economic \ndevelopment. Research has even shown that when consumers find out a \nbusiness is organized as a cooperative, they are more likely to do \nbusiness with that entity.\n  Overall, Americans hold 350 million memberships in cooperatives. A \nmajority of our Nation's farmers are members of nearly 3,000 farmer-\nowned cooperatives, which provide more than 250 thousand jobs in our \neconomy. There are more than 900 rural electric cooperatives servicing \n42 million people in almost every State, and over 91 million people \nbank at more than 7,500 credit unions throughout the country. In South \nDakota alone, 81 farm supply and marketing cooperatives claim 65,000 \nmemberships, generating $5.3 billion in annual revenue. The 50 credit \nunions located in my home State hold 24,600 memberships and generate \n$2.2 billion in assets. Additionally, there are 125,000 members of the \n30 electric cooperatives and 49,000 members of 11 telephone \ncooperatives throughout the State. Cooperatives clearly take many \ndifferent forms in our communities, providing jobs and opportunities \nfor rural residents, and in the case of agriculture, provide new \nmarkets for the products they produce.\n  My resolution will officially include the United States in \nrecognizing 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives,\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\nand encourage the growth and development of businesses throughout the \nworld. I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing and celebrating \nthe contributions of cooperatives and pass this important resolution \nthis year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1237-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 88--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT \nBUSINESSES OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD RETAIN THE OPTION TO ORGANIZE AS \n THOSE BUSINESSES CHOOSE, INCLUDING THE FLOW-THROUGH ENTITIES, AND NOT \n               BE FORCED TO REORGANIZE AS C CORPORATIONS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n                               S. Res. 88\n\n       Whereas the tremendous growth in businesses organized as \n     flow-through entities, including S corporations, has resulted \n     in the number of flow-through entities far exceeding the \n     number of C corporations;\n       Whereas there are more than 26,000,000 businesses operating \n     as flow-through entities in the United States, representing \n     82 percent of all United States businesses, relative to just \n     5,900,000 C corporations;\n       Whereas these flow-through and small businesses create 70 \n     percent of all new jobs and are responsible for 44 percent of \n     the total private payroll in the United States;\n       Whereas under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as in \n     effect in March 2011, these job-generating businesses are \n     taxed at individual tax rates based on the individual income \n     of the business owners, making these businesses highly \n     sensitive to changes in individual tax rates;\n       Whereas as of March 2011, 50 percent of all income above \n     $250,000 is attributable to flow-through businesses;\n       Whereas, if individual tax rates increase after 2012 in \n     accordance with the proposals set forth by the President, \n     flow-through businesses will face a massive aggregate tax \n     increase, potentially in excess of $800,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the Secretary of the Treasury has proposed forcing \n     flow-through entities to reorganize as C corporations to make \n     them subject to double taxation as a way to impose more taxes \n     on these businesses in order to pay for the budgetary \n     policies of the President; and\n       Whereas forcing corporate reorganizations for purely tax-\n     driven reasons represents a misguided incentive, a \n     misallocation of precious business resources, and a serious \n     threat to job creation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should preserve the \n     organizational options available for businesses to operate as \n     the businesses choose, including as flow-through entities;\n       (2) raising taxes on businesses that create jobs will be \n     detrimental to the economic recovery of the United States;\n       (3) generating increased tax revenue on the backs of the \n     small businesses of the United States is inconsistent with, \n     and will impede, job creation; and\n       (4) any legislative approach to comprehensive fundamental \n     tax reform should include a debate on the individual rates at \n     which most businesses in the United States should be taxed, \n     rather than narrowly focusing on corporate tax rates or \n     forcing small business owners into corporate status for tax \n     purposes.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to submit a sense of the Senate \nresolution that clarifies my opposition to tax increases on the job-\ncreating sector of our economy--small business.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear, and increasingly concerning, that \nthe administration is proposing to raise taxes on America's small \nbusinesses, either by forcing them to reorganize as subchapter C \ncorporations solely for tax reasons and be subjected to new and \nadditional taxes, or, by allowing them to remain organized as flow-\nthrough entities, where they will face massive increases after 2012 \nwhen current tax rates expire. Our Nation simply cannot afford an \nimpending tax increase of over $800 billion. Subjecting small \nbusinesses to the double taxation of corporate-entity status would be a \nmajor mistake.\n  There has been tremendous growth in the number of flow-through \nentities--that is, non-C corporations--over the past 30 years and this \ngrowth has only accelerated in the last decade. Since 1997, S \ncorporations have outnumbered C corporations. Fifty percent of all \nincome above $250,000 currently is attributable to flow-through \nbusinesses. By 2007, only 5.9 million out of a total 32.1 million U.S. \nbusinesses, or just 18 percent, were C corporations, meaning the \noverwhelming number of businesses in this country organize as flow-\nthrough entities.\n  The administration is proposing to eliminate choice and require C \ncorporation formation purely to generate revenue. C corporate form \nhelps generate revenue because it is inherently a double tax, first at \nthe entity then at the individual shareholder level. The Treasury \nSecretary said that this proposed change could subject up to $3 \ntrillion to new and additional income taxes.\n  In this regard, the administration is proposing to raise taxes on \nAmerica's small businesses: either by forcing them to reorganize as C \ncorporations solely for tax reasons and be subjected to new and \nadditional levies, or if the administration deigns to let them remain \norganized as flow-through entities, then they will be hit with massive \nincreased taxes after 2012 when current tax rates expire--an impending \ntax increase of over $800 billion that job creators cannot afford.\n  Individual income tax rates absolutely affect these businesses. The \ngrowth in the number of flow-through businesses is critical to \nunderstanding why the increase in individual rates is so damaging to \nsmall business job generation.\n  When we talk about flow-through entities what we really mean are \nAmerica's small businesses. A discussion of tax reform must not ignore \nthe small businesses that make up the backbone of America. The \nadministration continues to talk about corporate tax reform but it \nshould be talking about business tax reform, which of necessity must \ninclude a real discussion of individual tax rates.\n  Many of America's small businesses choose the flow-through option to \navoid double taxation. Forcing them to convert to C corporate status is \nsimply another way to increase their costs and raise their taxes. This \nwould hurt job creation since 70 percent of our good American jobs are \ncreated by these businesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to review my proposal and join me in telling \nthose who would raise taxes on the millions of businesswomen and \nbusinessmen we are counting on to create the jobs we need to put the \nrecession firmly behind us--no thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1237-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1237-S1238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 89--RELATING TO THE DEATH OF FRANK W.

Yet too often, \n     on these issues and many more, half the world is left \n     behind.'';\n       Whereas the ability of women to realize their full \n     potential is critical to the ability of a nation to achieve \n     strong and lasting economic growth and political and social \n     stability;\n       Whereas according to the 2010 World Economic Forum Global \n     Gender Gap Report, ``reducing gender inequality enhances \n     productivity and economic growth'';\n       Whereas according to the International Monetary Fund, \n     ``focusing on the needs and empowerment of women is one of \n     the keys to human development'';\n       Whereas despite some achievements made by individual women \n     leaders, women around the globe are still vastly \n     underrepresented in high level positions and in national and \n     local legislatures and governments and, according to the \n     Inter-Parliamentary Union, women account for only 19.2 \n     percent of national parliamentarians;\n       Whereas although strides have been made in recent decades, \n     women around the world continue to face significant obstacles \n     in all aspects of their lives including denial of basic human \n     rights, discrimination, and gender-based violence;\n       Whereas according to the World Bank, women account for \n     approximately 70 percent of individuals living in poverty \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas according to UNESCO, women account for 64 percent \n     of the 796,000,000 adults worldwide who lack basic literacy \n     skills;\n       Whereas according to the International Center for Research \n     on Women, there are more than 60,000,000 child brides in \n     developing countries, some of whom are as young as 7 years \n     old;\n       Whereas according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, \n     the majority of women living in rural areas of the developing \n     world are heavily engaged in agricultural labor, yet they \n     receive less credit, land, agricultural inputs, and training \n     than their male counterparts;\n       Whereas according to the International Union for \n     Conservation of Nature, women in developing countries are \n     disproportionately affected by changes in climate because of \n     their need to secure water, food, and fuel for their \n     livelihood;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization, as many \n     as 1 in 5 women report being sexually abused before the age \n     of 15;\n       Whereas March 8 is recognized each year as International \n     Women's Day, a global day to celebrate the economic, \n     political, and social achievements of women past, present, \n     and future and a day to recognize the obstacles that women \n     still face in the struggle for equal rights and \n     opportunities; and\n       Whereas the milestone 100th anniversary of International \n     Women's Day is a testament to the dedication and \n     determination of women and men around the world to address \n     gender inequality: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of ``International Women's Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the significance of the 100th anniversary of \n     International Women's Day;\n       (3) recognizes that the empowerment of women is \n     inextricably linked to the potential of nations to generate \n     economic growth and sustainable democracy;\n       (4) recognizes and honors the women in the United States \n     and around the world who have worked throughout history to \n     ensure that women are guaranteed equality and basic human \n     rights;\n       (5) reaffirms its commitment to ending discrimination and \n     violence against women and girls, to ensuring the safety and \n     welfare of women and girls, and to pursuing policies that \n     guarantee the basic human rights of women and girls \n     worldwide; and\n       (6) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     International Women's Day with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/03/senate-section/article/S1238-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 91--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF MULTIPLE \n                        SCLEROSIS AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mrs. Hagan) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 89.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 89) relating to the death of Frank \n     Woodruff Buckles, the longest surviving veteran of the First \n     World War.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I want to honor the passing of \nAmerica's last surviving veteran of the First World War, Mr. Frank \nWoodruff Buckles. It is important that we as a nation express our deep \nappreciation for the sacrifices that Mr. Buckles and his brothers-in-\narms endured for our country nearly a century ago. Men like Frank have \nfought in numerous battles in the defense of this Nation and have made \nsure that we as Americans are able to enjoy the quality of life that we \nso cherish.\n  Mr. Buckles witnessed the world change dramatically throughout his \nlifetime and had experiences that most of us can only dream about. He \nsaw the metamorphosis that defined the American social and cultural \nrevolutions of the last century. As a young man, he served in the \nArmy's ambulance corps in France and Germany, where he evacuated \nwounded soldiers from the battlefield. As a civilian during the Second \nWorld War, he spent more than three years in a Japanese prison camp in \nthe Philippines.\n  As a tribute to Mr. Buckles and for all the World War I veterans that \nhe represents, we must remember all of his brothers and sisters who \ndefended our country along with him. Nearly 4.5 million U.S. soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and Marines joined forces with over 37 million Allied \nsoldiers to defeat the Central Powers. These service members witnessed \natrocities such as gas warfare that were unprecedented at the time. \nEach and every one of them made their own significant contribution to \nthe war effort that cannot be understated. This generation of dynamic \nand dedicated Americans was able to alter the course of history for the \nbetterment of each and every one of us here today.\n  As a tribute to Mr. Buckles, I have introduced a bipartisan \nresolution so he can lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda on March 14 to \nallow the American people to properly pay their respects. To further \nhonor his generations' sacrifices, Mr. Frank Buckles will be buried at \nArlington National Cemetery with full military honors. President Obama \nhas ordered all flags flown over government buildings be flown at half-\nmast on this day as we mourn the loss of a citizen and a generation who \nwill forever hold a place in our nation's history.\n  I want to conclude by offering my deepest sympathies to Mr. Buckles' \ndaughter, Susannah Buckles Flanagan. She has been the loving daughter \nat his side in recent years taking such good care of him which allowed \nhim to live at home in dignity, surrounded by family and friends.\n  As America's longest surviving veteran of World War I, Frank Buckles \nrepresented our final link to a generation that built a legacy as the \ndefenders of the free world in the first large scale global conflict. I \ncan promise you that his legacy and the legacy of all veterans will \nlive on forever in the ideals and values that make America the \nstrongest nation in the world.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 89) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 89\n\n       Whereas Frank Woodruff Buckles is the last known American \n     World War I veteran, who passed away on February 27, 2011, at \n     the age of 110, and represents his generation of veterans;\n       Whereas America's support of Great Britain, France, \n     Belgium, and its other allies in World War I marked the first \n     time in the Nation's history that American soldiers went \n     abroad in defense of liberty against foreign aggression, and \n     it marked the true beginning of the ``American century'';\n       Whereas more than 4,000,000 men and women from the United \n     States served in uniform during World War I, among them 2 \n     future presidents, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower;\n       Whereas 2,000,000 individuals from the United States served \n     overseas during World War I, including 200,000 naval \n     personnel who served on the seas;\n       Whereas the United States suffered 375,000 casualties \n     during World War I, including 116,516 deaths;\n       Whereas the events of 1914 through 1918 shaped the world, \n     the United States, and the lives of millions of people in \n     countless ways; and\n       Whereas Frank Woodruff Buckles is the last veteran to \n     represent the extraordinary legacy of the World War I \n     veterans: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes the historic contributions of all \n     United States veterans who served in the First World War; and\n       (2) when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned as a \n     further mark of respect to the memory of Frank W.

The Secretary of the Senate is directed to \n     transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of \n     the deceased.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the good fortune a short time ago, \nwhen we had a ceremony in the Rotunda of the Capitol, to meet Mr. \nBuckles and talk to him.
