The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with the new year fast approaching, all \neyes are on Washington and whether the two parties can come together \nand agree on a plan to avoid a massive year-end tax hike. I truly \nbelieve we can. I believe the two parties can avoid the so-called \nfiscal cliff, and in the process I even believe we can agree on a \nframework for a bipartisan plan to address the even bigger problem of \nour Nation's fiscal solvency.\n  But there are clear obstacles to success. If we are going to succeed, \nif we want to avoid a job-killing tax hike and put the country on a \npath to solvency, we need to be clear about what the obstacles are.\n  The first obstacle is a very vocal and very determined group of \nextremists on the left who are rooting for us to go off the fiscal \ncliff. They want this to happen. These are the folks the President \ninvited to the White House earlier this week and who seem to have \ngotten a number of Democrats in the Senate to embrace this reckless \nidea themselves.\n  Make no mistake, the goal of these folks is not to do what is best \nfor the middle class. It is not to create jobs. It is not even to \nbalance the books, since the taxes they would hike would not even come \nclose to covering current spending.\n  What they want is to sock it to those whom they define as rich, \nregardless of the impact on jobs or the broader economy. That is what \nmotivates this crowd. They are not serious about tackling the Nation's \nfiscal problems. If we are serious about helping middle-class Americans \nand helping this economy grow, their radical approach, frankly, should \nbe ignored.\n  The other obstacle to success is a mindset that says the President of \nthe United States is somehow a bit player in this whole thing, that he \nis just a bystander sitting around waiting on other people to act. This \nis a mindset that thinks leadership consists of telling other people to \n``work it out,'' while they continue to run a campaign to make sure \nthey cannot.\n  This is ludicrous. The only way--I repeat--the only way we are going \nto\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\nsolve this present crisis and get past the political stalemate is for \nthe President himself to lead.\n  To illustrate the point, let me remind everyone of something that \nhappened just 2 years ago next month--just 2 years ago next month--\nbecause it says a lot about the power of Presidential leadership in \ncritical moments such as this. Less than 2 years ago, the President \nsaid he was not going to allow tax rates to go up on anyone because, as \nhe put it, you do not raise taxes in the middle of a recession.\n  So let's leave aside for a second that if it was a good idea then, it \nis an even better idea now, since the economy is growing even more \nslowly now than it was in late 2010. Let's leave that aside.\n  The point is that the moment the President of the United States said \nthose words--the moment he signaled he was OK to keep rates where they \nwere--40 Democrats, including many who had spent the previous decade \ncampaigning against them, got in line and followed his lead.\n  That is an example of Presidential leadership, and that is just what \nis needed now. The President is the only person in America--the only 1 \nout of 315 million--who can sign a bill into law. He is the only one \nwho can lead the members of his own party to do something they would \nnot ordinarily do. But first he needs to decide it is time to put away \nthe talking points and do something good, something really good for the \ncountry.\n  Ronald Reagan understood this, Bill Clinton understood this, and \nPresident Obama seemed to understand it, too, in December 2010. So I \nwill say it again. The only way we succeed is if the President steps up \nand leads. It starts by showing that he is serious about success.\n  Let's be clear. An opening bid of $1.6 trillion in new taxes just is \nnot serious. It is more than Simpson-Bowles or any other bipartisan \ncommission has called for. It has been unanimously rejected in the \nHouse and Senate. It is twice as much as the White House seemed ready \nto agree to during last summer's debt ceiling talks and looked at in \nthe context of the spending cuts that are yet to be enacted from the \nPresident's other proposals. It amounts to about 20 cents in cuts for \nevery new dollar in tax hikes. In other words, no cuts at all. It is a \njoke--a joke.\n  Look, people I talk to across Kentucky do not want any more political \nfights. They would like to see us get somewhere. They want the two \nparties to work together to find a solution to our fiscal problems, and \nthat is just what we are proposing. Yesterday, the President said he \nhad an open mind when it came to finding a solution to those things. He \nsaid he is happy to listen to other people's ideas. I think that is a \ngood sign.\n  If the President has an open mind, maybe he will see that Republicans \nare the ones who have expressed a willingness to step out of our \ncomfort zone if it actually leads to a solution. We do not happen to \nthink the government needs more revenue. The government spends too much \nas it is. But if Democrats are willing to reduce spending and \nstrengthen entitlement programs, which we all know are on an \nunsustainable path that threatens their own long-term viability and the \neconomic well-being of our children and grandchildren, then we will be \nthere.\n  What we will not do is raise tax rates and kiss goodbye more than \n700,000 good jobs in the process. What we will not do is embrace a tax \npolicy that disincentivises saving and work. What we will not do is \nagree to revenue in exchange for reforms that we know will not ever \nhappen. That is not a good deal for anybody, certainly not the middle \nclass, which the President says he has a mandate to protect.\n  If the President wants to help the middle class, he will accept a \nbasic outline that Speaker Boehner proposed last week and convince his \nfellow Democrats to do the same. Ignore the reckless voice of those on \nthe far left who are calling for fiscal calamity. Ignore the extremists \nwho want to cover their eyes and do nothing to protect and strengthen \nentitlement programs for the future and propose a plan that both sides \ncan actually accept.\n  That is how we get out of this. That is how we succeed. The scope of \nthis challenge calls for Presidential leadership. That is what the \nAmerican people should be able to expect. That is all Republicans are \ncalling for. It is the President's turn to propose a specific plan that \nbrings both parties together. That is what Presidents are elected to \ndo. That is what he pledged to do. It is precisely the sort of \nleadership we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the \ncloture vote on the Sportsmen's Act (S. 3525). If I were able to attend \ntoday's session, I would have supported cloture on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Reid substitute, S. 3525, the \nSportsmen's Act of 2012, is legislation that has a lot of very good \nthings in it. Senator Reid attempted--although outside the normal \ncommittee process--to put together a package of bills that could do \nsome good things. I generally am supportive of the package. I think it \nhas some very good qualities to it, and I very much want to support it. \nBut there is a problem with it. It is a small but important problem, \nand it needs to be fixed.\n  That is that, once again, after the Budget Control Act agreement \nreached in August, 15 months ago, the majority has brought forth a bill \nthat violates the Budget Control Act, in which we agreed to a deemed \nbudget as part of that process, and we are now spending more than we \nagreed to spend.\n  Fifteen months ago, we agreed to limit spending each year for the \nnext 10 years and to stay within a limited amount of spending. Because \nwe are borrowing virtually 40 percent of every dollar we spend, this \ncountry has a debt crisis staring us in the eye. Without any doubt, the \nmost obvious threat to America's future is the surging debt: $4 \ntrillion-plus increased debt in just 4 years, and the end is not in \nsight.\n  So we agreed, as part of raising the debt ceiling, to limit spending. \nThis bill violates that agreement, and we need not do that. This is not \nthe first one; it is the fourth one. That irresponsibility is one of \nthe things that has placed us into this fix.\n  We looked the American people in the eye 15 months ago and said, \nOkay, we will raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion--because the \nadministration had reached the limit of borrowing that the United \nStates can incur--but we will reduce our projected spending increases \nover 10 years by $2.1 trillion. Part of the agreement in the Budget \nControl Act limited spending in various accounts, and this violates it.\n  You might say, Jeff, that is your opinion. No, it is not my opinion. \nI raised this with Chairman Conrad of the Budget Committee, of which I \nam ranking member. He and his staff have looked at it, and they certify \nthat this budget violation actually occurs; therefore, the legislation \nis subject to a budget point of order. It cannot go forward because it \nviolates the deemed budget that we agreed to.\n  If the budget point of order is raised, which will happen, then my \ncolleagues will have a choice: They can either place the bill on a \nsound financial path that does not violate the Budget Control Act; or, \nthey can say, Well, we won't pay any attention to that objection. We \nwill waive the budget and just spend more than the budget allowed, \nbecause this is really important. It is really important that we raise \nrevenue and spend more on the duck program.\n  I have been supportive, and the duck stamp is important. But this is \nnot the right way to do this. If you are going to spend more money, you \nneed to reduce spending somewhere else.\n  Also, I would point out the legislation was changed from the time it \ncame out of committee. Part of the legislation at least when it was \nproposed in the Committee on Environment and Public Works of which I am \na member, we observed that the proposal was to give bureaucrats--\ngovernment officials, unelected--the power to meet with special \ninterests, or whoever they chose to meet with or not meet with, and set \nthe amount of fees--taxes, you might call it--that would be required of \nAmericans before they could hunt ducks. That has never been so. \nPreviously, the Congress set how much you could charge for a duck \nstamp.\n  So this was raised in committee, and our able chairwoman Senator \nBarbara Boxer agreed and by a voice vote it was accepted that Congress \nwould set the limit on how much you could raise for duck stamps and \nburden duck hunters with. That is an important principle, in my \nopinion. That is violated by the bill that was brought up--not the one \nthat passed committee, but the one brought up by the leader.\n  I grew up in the country. When I go back home, I love to be in the \nwoods. I don't hunt anymore, but I have been a big supporter. Many of \nmy friends are hunters and fishermen and conservationists. So it is sad \nthat we are having a dispute over this legislation, because we are so \nclose to being able to work out the problems. My request to Senator \nReid and to our colleagues would be: Let's fix this. Now it looks as \nthough the bill will not be brought up until Monday when we come back, \nand I hope there will be ample opportunity for us to fix this problem \nso we are not passing a bill that violates the budget.\n\n  Under the bill, it would authorize $142 million in new direct \nspending over the next 10 years. Some may say that is not a lot, but if \nthat is so, they have been in Washington too long. Mr. President, $142 \nmillion is a lot of money, and it is a very important principle because \nthis is not the first time we violated the Budget Control Act.\n  If we stay with our agreement that we made with each other, that we \nmade with the American people 15 months ago when the Budget Control Act \nwas agreed to, we will at least save $2.1 trillion over 10 years. But \nif we keep nibbling away at it and eroding what we agreed to, we not \nonly undermine our own credibility, but we weaken our ability to \nbalance the budget. And if we reach a new agreement--which we need to \ndo as we deal with the fiscal cliff then don't the American people need \nto know we will stand by the agreement we make? Don't they need to know \nan agreement is something more than a momentary event to get past a \ncrisis and then the next year we can just ignore it? There is too much \nof this attitude in this Congress. That is one reason this country is \nin such a dire financial condition. The Reid amendment would violate \nthe committee spending allocations in the deemed budget and would do it \nnot only next year but every year over the next 10 years. This \nviolation does not need to happen.\n  You say: This is technical. It is technical because it is paid for. \nWe raise the revenue and we spend the revenue, but new spending is paid \nfor by revenue--the tax increase on duck hunting--and therefore what \nare you worried about, Sessions?\n  What are we worried about? The agreement was that this whole area of \nspending would be capped at a certain level. The way to do this is, if \nyou are going to spend more on the duck program, then reductions ought \nto be made somewhere else in this vast spending program or else you tax \nand spend. That is what we are doing. It is just tax-and-spend.\n  They say: We cannot cut anything else in the budget in dealing with \ninterior, environment, and those issues. There is no way we can save \nanother dime. We can't save $14 million a year over ten years anywhere.\n  Of course we can. There are plenty of places to save it there and in \nany of the other items of this government that waste money. What are \nthey really saying? What they are saying is that of all the money we \nare currently spending, all of that is more important than finding $14 \nmillion to spend on more duck preservation programs. I am not sure that \nis correct. I am a believer in the duck stamp program, and I would like \nto see if we can figure out a way to do more to make sure we preserve \nthose migratory bird habitats and the duck population in America, and I \nam prepared to be pretty aggressive as a Member of the Senate in \ndeveloping\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\npolicies to do that. But you do not have to tax and spend more. That is \nthe point.\n  If you look at it and say that we cannot cut any other spending in \nthe entire Federal Government to find $142 million for the duck \nprogram, I will just say to my colleagues, that is what we are paid to \ndo. We are paid to make those tough choices. I don't like them \nsometimes, but it should not be hard in this instance to find this kind \nof payment. The idea that we can just up a fee and spend more money and \nviolate the budget and nothing is going to happen and we are going to \njust go along and do that without objection, that time is over because \nwe are in a debt crisis.\n  We have run up trillion-plus deficits for the last 4 years. President \nBush's last deficit was huge. It was one of the largest we had in--\nmaybe ever, $470 billion. We have averaged about $1,300 billion the \nlast 4 years. The year before he left office, there was a $160 billion \ndeficit. So we have $160 billion, $470 billion, a trillion-plus, 4 \nconsecutive years. We are on the road in just a few years to double the \ndebt of the United States again. This cannot be sustained. That is all \nI am saying. We have had similar budget problems on the postal reform \nbill, the highway bill, and the veterans jobs corp bill. We have had \nproblems with spending violations on those bills too.\n  I really hope we will use this period of time to work out some \nlanguage that fixes this problem. My budget staff can provide a long \nlist of things that would save us this much money and have no real \nimpact on the productivity of our government.\n  The Migratory Bird Habitat Investment and Enhancement Act--that is a \ngood name, sounds like something we should be for--would actually give \nthe Interior Department a blank check to increase the price of the duck \nstamp. It gives the Interior Department--unelected bureaucrats--the \npower to set how much we pay. Currently, it is $15. They could make it \nwhatever figure the Secretary decides it should be, without any limit \nwhatsoever. We discussed this in committee. The committee said: No, \nthis is not the way we want to go. We have not done this before. \nCongress has stepped up to the plate and been responsible and decided \nhow much we are going to extract from the American people before we \nallow them to go duck hunting. Granting that power to the Secretary is \na significant change from what the committee voted on.\n  The duck stamp is purchased by all duck hunters in the United States. \nIt was established in 1934. Since its beginning, it has always been set \nby Congress, not somebody in the bureaucracy. This is an unchecked \npower. I think it is a delegation of power to a person not accountable \nto the people, and it might violate the Constitution because only \nCongress can appropriate money and raise taxes. If it doesn't violate \nthe Constitution explicitly, it violates the spirit of the \nConstitution. Moreover, by increasing the price of the duck stamp, if \nyou think about it, in this amendment--it is an amendment, a revenue-\nraising amendment to an S. numbered bill. Senator Reid, therefore, by \ndoing that, has put up a revenue enhancement bill originating in the \nSenate. The Constitution says revenue bills have to originate in the \nHouse. That places the bill in jeopardy. The House is very jealous--\nrightly so--of their constitutional prerogative of commencing all tax \nrevenue bills in the House. The Congressional Budget Office, our \nobjective analysis team, scores the duck stamp provision as an increase \nin revenue. If the House exerted its privilege under the Constitution, \nthis bill would be subject to a blue slip, a rejection based on the \nrevenue clause.\n  Also, amazingly, we have no amendments. There is no process to even \nbring up amendments to vote. So we are stuck with the position of \neither supporting the bill as is in all its complexity or not. If we \nfixed this matter, I would be supportive of the bill. We tried to study \nit. I think it is OK and pretty good, actually. It is a positive step \nin the right direction if we simply fix this. So the proper remedy for \nthis situation is to allow amendments or send the bill back to \ncommittee and figure out how to pass legislation that is within the \nbudget limit.\n  I will not mention all the good things about this bill. There are a \nlot of them: the National Fish and Wildlife Act; the North American \nWetlands Conservation Act has some good provisions in it. A number of \nthe other pieces of legislation are excellent. I do not think that is \nin dispute. It is supported by a lot of great wildlife organizations. I \nsupport that.\n  On September 22 the Senate voted 84 to 7 to invoke cloture on a \nmotion to proceed, with the full expectation that when the Senate \nreturned this month, an opportunity would be provided to address the \nbudget concerns and to improve the bill. But now we see that my friend \nthe majority leader has decided to move forward without confronting \nthese issues.\n  I hope we can figure out a way to avoid this situation. Maybe people \ndid not think about it clearly. Maybe they just thought it is paid for, \ntherefore it cannot be a problem with the budget. But even though it is \npaid for, it really is a problem with the budget, and we do not need to \ndelegate to some unelected official, even if it is constitutional--\nabout which I have doubts--the ability without limit to raise fees for \na normal historic right of Americans to go hunting ducks. I believe \nthat has to be fixed, too, and we should do that.\n  Finally, I understand the intent is to recess for the rest of the day \nand all next week. However, in the Armed Services Committee yesterday, \nwe were told we can get the armed services authorization, the Defense \nauthorization bill up for a vote. We can actually bring it up and we \ncan have a vote, and this is great news, and we have to do it in 3 days \nand very limited amendments, but if you Republicans will agree with \nthat, we can get the bill up.\n  This is the first time in 50 years we have not passed a Defense bill \nprior to the September 30 fiscal year end. We are already into the new \nfiscal year. It should have been passed long ago. More than that, we \ncould have spent 3 weeks on the Defense bill. We did nothing in \nSeptember. We are doing nothing next week.\n  What is this about? It is about the management of the Senate \ndefeating the historic ability of Members of the Senate to actually \nparticipate in the great issues of our time. One of them is the Defense \nDepartment budget and policy. The Defense authorization bill came out \nof the Armed Services Committee unanimously, but several of us in \ncommittee said that we have amendments we want to bring up on the \nfloor. Other Members not on the Armed Services Committee have a right \nto talk about this $540-some-odd billion expenditure, the largest \nsingle expenditure outside of Social Security and Medicare in the \nentire budget. We are supposed to be thankful we did nothing in \nSeptember, we are going to do nothing next week, but you now only have \n3 days and just a very few amendments, and Senator Reid will pick and \nchoose which ones you Republicans get to offer. That is why we are \nhaving problems.\n\n  Senator Reid continues to assert that Republicans are filibustering. \nWhat Republicans are saying is we are prepared to move to these bills, \nbut we would like the leader to tell us how many amendments we can get. \nHe has figured out a way to fill the tree--what we call the amendment \ntree--to a degree that has never been done before, and that allows him \nto pass legislation without any amendment.\n  So we say we would like to have amendments, Mr. Leader. This is the \nSenate.\n  OK. Submit a list of them to me. You can have two, and it can't be \nthis amendment, it can't be this amendment, and it can't be this \namendment. It can only be these kinds of amendments. We will be nice to \nyou. Well, maybe three. Ok, you get three--on a $540 billion defense \nbill that sets the policy for our military, that decides what weapons \nsystems we are going to invest in with billions of dollars?\n  Some people in this Senate have opinions about it and they want to \ncome to the floor. Maybe when they were campaigning they said: I am \nagainst such and such in the Defense bill, and they want to come here--\nand it is in the bill and they are against it and they want to offer an \namendment and explain why it shouldn't be in the bill. They want to \noffer an amendment to take it out.\n  Sorry. We don't have time.\n  I think this is a dangerous trend. I believe we shouldn't be \nrecessing\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\ntoday. I believe we should be working. We have the fiscal cliff. We \nhave the defense sequester. We have monumental tax increases about to \noccur. We have the death tax going to 55 percent of virtually anything \nsomebody has. All these things are going to happen if we don't take \nsome action. We have all these people talking, secretly planning and \ntalking and working, and so about Christmas Eve I suspect they will \nwalk in here with a plan we will be told we have to support or else we \nwill work through Christmas or on January 1 we will be here, and we \nwill have a catastrophe if all these bad things happen.\n  The President will not even say what he is for. He will not even lay \nout a plan. Congressman Ryan laid out a plan. He has defended it all \nover the country and is prepared to discuss it and explain it. What is \nthe President's plan? What is Senator Reid's plan? Does the majority \nleader have any plan to confront our pension programs for Social \nSecurity and Medicare that are going broke? Does he have any plan to \nfix them? What is it? Isn't this important? Does he have any plan to \nget us off this trillion-dollar debt course? What are we going to do?\n  Growth is going down. We were at 2.4 percent in 2010; we had that \nmuch GDP growth. We have had a very slow recovery from the 2007-2008 \nrecession. But then did it go up in 2011? No; it dropped to 1.8. What \nabout the first three quarters of this year? It was 1.77. The growth is \nnot occurring. We are borrowing and spending, but we are not creating \ngrowth. I think we need to deal with this crisis we face and the \nuncertainty of policies is hurting America's economy also.\n  I am disappointed we are not dealing with these important issues. I \nam disappointed we are recessing, and we need to do better.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Today the Senate voted to end debate on S. 3525, the \nSportsmen's Act of 2012. Along with 84 of my colleagues, I voted to \nsupport cloture in an effort to move this bill forward. It is a \ncompilation of almost 20 different pieces of bipartisan legislation \nthat are important to the sportsmen's community. The Sportsmen's Act \nwill increase habitat conservation while improving access to \nrecreational fishing and hunting lands. These are laudable goals that \nare worth supporting. However, the bill also contains troubling \nprovisions allowing the importation of polar bear trophies and lead \nammunition that I hope will be changed before final passage of the \nbill.\n  In its current form, the bill would allow several hunters who killed \npolar bears in Canada before a ban was put in place to bring those bear \nhides back to the United States. This provision would reward hunters \nwho unethically killed polar bears despite multiple warnings of an \nimminent ban on imports and the imminent listing of polar bears as an \nendangered species. If enacted, this provision could easily lead to \noutcomes that no one wants--it could increase demand for polar bear \ntrophies and lead to more poaching or illegal trade of polar bear \nparts. It could also stimulate demand for other exotic and endangered \nanimal parts from around the globe. That is why I am a cosponsor of \nSenator Kerry's amendment to remove this provision from the bill.\n  I also oppose the current bill's exemption of ammunition and fishing \ntackle from regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Many \npeople are concerned that wildlife in heavy-hunting regions is being \npoisoned as they consume prey that contains lead ammunition fragments. \nThe U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service banned the use of lead shot for \nhunting waterfowl nationwide in 1991 because of concerns that lead \nshots were causing sickness and death in migratory birds that end up \ningesting the shots. And several states have banned the use of lead \nammunition in areas where protected bird species live. Exempting \nammunition and tackle from EPA regulation doesn't make sense when we \nknow these products are harmful to game and birdlife. I hope the Senate \nwill adopt Senator Lautenberg's amendment, which I cosponsor, to remove \nthis provision from the bill.\n  Ensuring adequate funding for conservation programs and access for \nsportsmen to recreational lands is important. There is no doubt about \nthat. I support that. But these goals should not be achieved at the \nexpense of animal welfare or public health and safety.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my \ncolleague from Alabama, and I have great confidence that we will have a \nrobust debate on the National Defense Authorization Act over the next \nfew weeks and that we will keep our record intact that has now been in \nplace for some 50 years of putting in place a national defense \nauthorization act. We did so at this time last year and we did so the \nprevious year and I have every confidence that we will have a \ncomprehensive national defense authorization act that will direct the \nPentagon and all the men and women in uniform who serve us so well as \nto the policies of the United States. I know I will work with my \ncolleague from Alabama to see that accomplished.\n\n\n                       Wind Production Tax Credit\n\n  I come back to the Senate floor, as I have on many occasions, to urge \nall of us to take action on a policy that is bipartisan in its support \nand in its ramifications, and that policy is the production tax credit \nfor wind energy. We need to renew that production tax credit. Why? It \nhas encouraged billions of dollars in investment and it has helped \ncreate tens of thousands of good-paying American jobs all across our \ncountry.\n  However, I have to tell my colleagues that our inaction over these \nlast few months is jeopardizing the future of what is a very promising \nindustry. We have literally, over the last months, seen wind industry \njobs in the thousands disappear. That is not just a statistic. That is \nnot just a statement. Those jobs have affected real Americans. These \njob losses were completely preventable. It is time for us to get back \nto work and extend the production tax credit so our wind industry can \nalso get back to work.\n  One of the things I have done is I have come to the floor some 20-\nplus times to focus on an individual State. Today I wish to speak about \na State that has an incredible potential for wind power; that is, \nMontana, the ``Last Best Place'' as Montanans like to describe their \namazing State. Similar to almost every State in the country, Montana \nhas seen the jobs, clean energy, and economic benefits of wind power.\n  I wish to take the viewers on a little bit of a tour of Montana. \n``Big Sky Country'' is home to wind resources that could mean the \nState's current electricity needs 210 times over. When we compare that \nto other States, we see that Montana then has the third highest wind \nresource potential in the country. So it is a prominent player in the \nfuture progress of our Nation's wind industry. Therefore, it is no \nwonder that Montana has seen strong development in the wind industry \nsector.\n  Looking at this map, Toole County, up here in the northwest corridor \nof Montana, is the site of a new wind farm, the Rim Rock Wind Farm, \nnorth of Cut Bank. It has 126 turbines. They completed the project in \nSeptember of this year. What is most important is when we think about \nthe jobs for local workers, the generation of $2 million in tax revenue \nwhich contributes to the $5.7 million in property taxes from wind farms \nacross the State, it all goes to those local communities for schools, \nroads, and social services to enhance the quality of life for \nMontanans. The Rim Rock Wind Farm will power thousands of Montana homes \nand, along with other wind farms across the State, as I have \nmentioned. it provided great construction jobs as the project was \nbuilt.\n\n  So Montana will continue to be an attractive State for wind \ndevelopment. However, with the expiration of the PTC looming--\nliterally, within a few weeks the PTC will expire--the future growth of \nthis important industry in Montana is in jeopardy.\n  We have seen how important this industry is to our energy and \nmanufacturing future. If it is sidelined by partisan wrangling, that \nwould truly be a tragedy. I know--as does the Presiding Officer in his \nState of New Mexico as well as my State of Colorado--and the people in \nMontana know we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy to improve our \noverall energy security, and wind is playing a major role in that \neffort.\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\n  We know Montana's two Senators, Senator Baucus and Senator Tester, \nare hard-working. They are very effective. They have always supported \nthe production tax credit for their State and for the country. Senator \nBaucus, as the chairman of the Finance Committee, pushed forward \nbipartisanly supported tax extenders in early August that included the \nextension of PTC. It is crucial we take up this package as soon as we \npossibly can and pass it. I wish to acknowledge the work of Senator \nBaucus and his focus on creating American jobs and securing true energy \nsecurity. However, his work--our work--isn't finished. We have to get \nthe PTC over the finish line and affirm our solemn commitment in this \nChamber to Made-in-America energy and American manufacturing. It is \nthis simple. If we fail to extend the production tax credit, we are, in \neffect, shipping thousands of jobs overseas to places such as China and \nEurope and our foreign competitors.\n  So I come to the floor again to implore all my colleagues to stop \nthis possibility from becoming a reality. I wish to reiterate this \nisn't a partisan issue. There is broad support in this body for wind \nenergy. There is also support in the House. So there is bicameral \nsupport as well as bipartisan support. We risk losing thousands of jobs \nand crippling an industry that is just now establishing itself as a \nvery important part of our economic portfolio.\n  I think the Presiding Officer would agree we are sent by the people \nof our States to make smart, informed decisions about the future on \nbehalf of the American people. If we let this important production tax \ncredit expire, it would be a decision we would all regret. I wish to \nunderline as well that the tax credit is applied once that power is \nproduced. This isn't a speculative subsidy. This isn't based on hoping \nsomething will happen. It actually is based on power that is produced \nand that tax credit is directed to the utility or the power company \nand, in some cases, the community power agency that provides the power. \nSo it is based on actually producing those electrons through wind \nenergy.\n  Let's show America and the world we are as committed to energy \nindependence and job creation as we often say. Wind is key to reaching \nthat goal. Wind is the path to that goal. Let's put action behind our \nwords and pass the production tax credit as soon as possible.\n  It is as simple as this: The production tax credit equals jobs. Let's \npass it as soon as possible. Let's pass it ASAP.\n  Thank you. I look forward to sharing some perspectives on the great \nState of New Mexico soon in the future, and I thank the Presiding \nOfficer for his attention.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand today to explain my ``no'' vote on \ncloture this morning in connection with the sportsmen's bill, S. 3525.\n  This is a large bill. It is made up of a number of legislative \nproposals that have been put together. In many settings this is a good \nway to legislate. In many respects it is, and we utilize this procedure \non an almost constant basis in order to make the laws of our country. \nLike many other pieces of legislation that come before us that have \nbeen formed in this fashion, this is a bill as to which I can say I \nsupport it in part and I don't support it in part. There are parts of \nit I like a lot, and there are other parts I like a lot less. That is \nexactly why we have an amendment process. True debate in this country, \nespecially in this body, presupposes and depends for its existence on \nthe availability of an open amendment process.\n  You see, when people go into a store, they can decide which items \nthey want to buy. They can decide to buy bread and milk and eggs or any \ncombination of the three or other products they might want. It would be \ndisturbing if they got to the grocery store counter and were told they \nmay not buy bread and milk and eggs unless they also buy a bucket of \nnails, a half a ton of iron ore, a book about cowboy poetry, and a \nBarry Manilow album. Sometimes that is what we are told when we get to \nthe table to vote in the Senate. In order to get some things we want, \nwe have to buy a whole bunch of other things we might not want.\n  That is a reality of the legislative process. It is a reality that \ngoes along with compromise, and it is one we live with every day. But, \nagain, this is why it is important for us to have an amendment process, \nso that we can at least debate the relevant merits of each piece of \nlegislation. More importantly, so that we might figure out how to take \na good piece of legislation and make it better or how to take a bad \npiece of legislation and make it good.\n  In this circumstance, the majority leader has used a procedure known \nas filling the tree. He filled the tree, which means, in effect, that \nwe can't offer amendments. We can't offer any amendments other than \nthose few the majority leader decided could be offered. This shuts down \ndebate. There can be no significant debate beyond that which will lead \nto a vote once the tree has been filled. This is a problem.\n  Now, Republicans in this body, myself included, voted recently to \nproceed to this bill believing in good faith there would be an \nopportunity to amend this bill. The bill is important to me in many \nrespects. One of the things that has gotten my attention is that it \naddresses a number of issues related to Federal public lands. It \naddresses a number of other issues related to wildlife conservation and \nwildlife management and other issues that are important to hunters and \nother outdoor enthusiasts across the country and in my State in \nparticular.\n  One of the reasons this bill is especially important to me is that I \nrepresent the great State of Utah--a State that has a lot of Federal \nland. In fact, two-thirds of the land in my State is owned by the \nFederal Government. For that and other reasons I would like the \nopportunity to address this piece of legislation by offering \namendments--amendments that would make a good bill better.\n  But this process--a process whereby the majority leader rules this \nbody by dictate--is not good for the Senate. We have come to expect the \nSenate will be a great deliberative body. In fact, the Senate has long \nprided itself on being the world's greatest deliberative legislative \nbody.\n  There are a number of realities about the Senate that make this \npossible--far more possible than it might be in the House of \nRepresentatives. Here in the Senate we have only 100 Members. Just down \nthe hall, in the House of Representatives, they have 435 Members. In \nthat body it is not always possible to have an open amendment process. \nIn this body it is assumed this is the usual order. This is how we are \nsupposed to operate, to have an opportunity for Members to offer and \ndebate and discuss amendments in advance of voting for the bill at the \nend of the day. Yet we have not had such an opportunity in this case \nbecause the leader filled the tree.\n  This is significant, and I want to emphasize this point. It is true, \nof course, that majority leaders from both political parties have \nutilized this procedure from time to time, for one reason or another--\nperhaps out of a professed need to expedite the legislative process in \ncertain instances. But this majority leader has utilized this procedure \na lot more than others. In fact, he has utilized it, by my count, a \ntotal of 67 times, more than any other majority leader in history. Why, \nI ask, has he done this? Why did he do it in this circumstance? Why has \nhe done it in so many other circumstances throughout this Congress and \nthroughout his service as majority leader?\n  Is it because the Senate has demonstrated an inability to debate and \ndiscuss bills and amendments to bills in a reasonable, responsible \nmanner? I don't think so. Let's point to a couple of examples. For \nexample, the National Defense Authorization Act, which this body passed \ntoward the end of last year--the NDAA of 2011. It passed out of this \nbody overwhelmingly, notwithstanding the fact there were a number of \namendments introduced. I believe there were dozens of amendments that \nwere introduced, debated, discussed, and ultimately voted upon.\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\n  Another example involved the farm bill. It was passed by this body \nearlier this year. If I am not mistaken, we had over 70 amendments to \nthat bill. I appreciated the majority leader's willingness in that \ncircumstance to allow us to have a pretty open, robust debate and an \nopen amendment process. We still passed the bill, even though we had to \nconduct a lot of debate and have a lot of discussion and have a lot of \nvotes. But this, you see, is what makes this the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world.\n  This is what separates us from other legislative bodies around the \ncountry and throughout this planet. So it is not the case the Senate \nsimply isn't responsible enough to be able to handle something such as \nan open amendment process because it has demonstrated its ability to do \nso time and time and time again.\n  Now, let's talk about some of the things I like in this bill. I \nsupport the fact that this bill would increase access to public lands \nand remove some burdensome regulations on some activities occurring on \nthose lands. On the other hand, I am not as wild about the fact that \nthis bill devotes $6.5 million on neotropical migratory birds on a \nprogram that would require 75 percent of those funds to be spent \noutside the United States. I know in the big picture of things this is \na very small figure in terms of our total national budget. \nNevertheless, this is a lot of money. It is a lot of money to hard-\nworking Americans who are paying their taxes in order to fund programs \nlike this. We ought at least to have an opportunity to debate \namendments so that Americans can feel as if their money is being spent \nin the United States for causes that are important to Americans and not \non birds outside the United States.\n\n  Other Senators have other differences with the bill, other concerns. \nI agree with some of those concerns; I disagree with others. Each of \nthem should have an opportunity to have those concerns aired, to have \nthem debated in connection with amendments they might choose to \nintroduce. We should be debating all of them. Instead, in effect, we \nare debating none of them.\n  That kind of process is especially important in this circumstance \nbecause, you see, this bill, as I understand it, has never gone through \ncommittee. Normally, in committee we have an opportunity to put a bill \nthrough the markup process, to make amendments in committee. This \ndidn't go there. All the more reason we should have an open amendment \nprocess right here.\n  So I have introduced several amendments, and I will refer to just a \nfew of them. One of them would involve a proposal to not spend money we \ndon't have in order to support the conservation of multinational \nspecies. It will cost $150 million over 5 years. In other words, it is \none thing to spend money on habitat preservation and species \nrehabilitation for species that actually exist in the United States. It \nis another thing to spend a lot of money on species outside the United \nStates, on creatures that have never entered our borders and never \nwill. That is something I think Americans are concerned about, and it \nis something I think we ought to have a chance to debate as long as we \nare debating and voting on this legislation.\n  I have another piece of legislation that would require State \nlegislative approval for any new Federal land designations. As I said a \nfew minutes ago, with the Federal Government owning two-thirds of the \nland in my State, I am especially concerned about the possibility of, \nfor example, the President deciding to just designate a new national \nmonument within my State. This happened a few years ago when President \nClinton designated the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument \ninside Utah. He didn't go to Utah to announce it, he went to Arizona to \nannounce it.\n  This is beautiful land. It is beautiful territory. But all of this \nwas accomplished by the stroke of a pen from one Chief Executive \nwithout any opportunity or input from Utah, from its 3 million \nresidents, from its elected officials. I think anytime the Federal \nGovernment takes this kind of action--action that will have a profound \nimpact on the State, on its sovereign rights, on its ability to raise \nrevenue, on its ability to encourage and promote economic activity \nwithin its boundaries--there ought to be input and approval from the \nState legislature. I have an amendment that would address this concern.\n  I have another amendment that would offer certain Federal lands for \ndisposal by a competitive sale process. We have an enormous amount of \nland in this country. Some of it is being put to good use; other land \nis being set aside because of its wilderness characteristics; still \nother land is just sitting there not doing anything. I think some of \nthat land could be sold and some of that money could be used to fund \nour programs--programs that are cash strapped, along with everything \nelse in this country right now.\n  These and other amendments need to receive consideration. I am not \nsaying every one of them has to pass in order for this legislation to \nproceed, but every one of them ought to be debated, and the American \npeople should have an opportunity to have their input through their own \nelected Senators.\n  I would deeply regret it if this were somehow an indication that our \nmajority leader intends to operate the Senate this way, not only \nthroughout the duration of this Congress but into the next Congress as \nwell. I want to be clear that I have great respect and admiration for \nour majority leader. I have known him for most of my life--since I was \n11 years old, in fact. I consider him a friend.\n  I ask him--I implore him--as my friend to reconsider this practice of \nfilling the tree and thereby forestalling the introduction of \namendments. We need an open amendment process. Our status as the \nworld's greatest deliberative legislative body requires nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last evening the majority leader had a \nsecond cloture vote on S. 3414, the Lieberman cyber security bill. This \nvote to end debate on a comprehensive, complex bill that was never \nreported out of committee or subject to a markup came despite the fact \nthat not a single amendment, except for those used to fill the \namendment tree, was allowed to be made pending to the bill.\n  The majority leader had made prior commitments to allowing a free and \nopen debate on cyber security, a matter that Republicans acknowledge \nmust be addressed, especially in the areas of information sharing, and \nproviding some degree of liability protection to those companies that \ndo share cyber threat information with one another and the Federal \nGovernment. Yet, despite this commitment, the majority leader triggered \nthis second cloture vote on the bill and filled the amendment tree \nthroughout floor consideration of cyber security legislation.\n  Now the Senate will hopefully move to a full and open debate of the \nnational defense authorization bill. During the time that that bill is \nconsidered on the floor--and I do expect that bill to be subject to an \nopen amendment process--my hope is that the majority leader will work \nwith me to reach agreement on allowing a debate on cyber security \nlegislation with Republican amendments in order, especially since the \nranking members of Armed Services, Intelligence, Commerce, and \nJudiciary are all cosponsors of a cyber security bill that needs to be \nconsidered as part of this debate.\n  My expectation is that sometime in December after we have completed \nfloor debate on the Defense authorization bill, and then disposed of \nthe Intelligence authorization bill, we will then attempt to get an \nagreement on amendments to the cyber security bill.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Ernie Allen\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a close personal friend of \nmine of over 40 years, a Kentuckian who is a hero to his country and an \ninspiration to many for his work on behalf of children where he has \nmade a national impact.\n  In his 23 years of service as president and chief executive officer \nof the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Ernie Allen \nhas saved thousands of lives and reunited thousands of families.\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\n  Today, November 15, Ernie retires from the helm of the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit center \nwhich he cofounded. Under his leadership, the National Center assisted \nin the recovery of more than 178,000 missing children. They have \ntrained almost 300,000 law enforcement and criminal justice \nprofessionals in policy and protocols for missing children \ninvestigations. And they have achieved a missing child recovery rate of \n97.7 percent.\n  Losing Ernie's talents at the National Center will be a loss for \nKentucky as well as for the Nation. Kentucky was proud to have one of \nour own leading this important cause. I have known Ernie for over 40 \nyears, dating back to our days at Manual High School in Louisville. On \nthe same day I won election as president of the student body of the \nhigh school, he was elected president of the junior high portion of the \nsame school. We both went on to attend the University of Louisville and \nwere actually fraternity brothers there.\n  Knowing Ernie so well, I can assure you that his dedication to \nrescuing missing children runs very deep. Over 25 years ago, when I was \njudge executive in Jefferson County--a position that is the head of the \nexecutive branch of county government--Ernie was the director of the \nLouisville/Jefferson County Crime Commission. Louisville, of course, is \nthe major city located within Jefferson County, and in fact these days \nthe city and county governments have merged. That was not the case, \nhowever, in those days, and we in the county government had to \ncoordinate and work with officials in city government. This Louisville/\nJefferson County Crime Commission was one of the best examples of \ncooperation between city and county government back in those days.\n  That commission was the first of its kind to bring police officers \nand social workers together on behalf of kids. Just one innovation \nErnie came up with back then was to make a fingerprint card for as many \nKentucky kids as possible, and send that card home to the child's \nparents to use to assist investigators in the awful event their child \never went missing.\n  Ernie's work in Kentucky established him as a national leader in his \nfield as early as 1981. At that time, no nationwide organization \nexisted to share and distribute information on missing children. If a \nchild was abducted and taken over a State line, or even a county line, \nthe chances that law enforcement in the new jurisdiction had all the \ninformation necessary to save that child were quite small.\n  Ernie led the effort to lobby Congress to establish laws so that \npolice could talk to each other across boundaries about these missing \nchildren. His work and patience bore fruit in 1984, when President \nReagan signed the bill creating the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children as a public-private partnership.\n  Ernie was an integral part of the founding of the National Center. He \nthen became its president and CEO in 1989. He has been a nationally \nrecognized authority in combating child abduction and exploitation for \ndecades. The U.S. Justice Department sought out his expertise in the \nwake of the tragic child murders in Chicago and Atlanta, Congress has \nsought his expert testimony many times on issues ranging from \ninternational child abduction, to missing children, to online crimes \nagainst children.\n  Ernie worked to secure the passage of the National Child Search \nAssistance Act, which prohibits waiting periods for initiating missing \nchild investigations. Previously, some law enforcement agencies refused \nto take reports of missing children until a certain period of time had \nelapsed. Now, thanks to Ernie, there are no unnecessary bureaucratic \ndelays in cases where any hesitancy can be the difference in returning \nan abducted child to their parents or opening a murder investigation.\n  Ernie advocated for the AMBER Alert Program, which has to date saved \n600 abducted children. Today there is an AMBER Alert plan in every \nsingle State. Ernie has always recognized the critical role technology \nplays in these rescue efforts, from the AMBER Alert, to his \nspearheading the launch of the National Center's CyberTipline in 1998. \nThis so-called ``911 for the Internet'' is a clearing center for \nreports on crimes against children on the Internet, and so far has \nreceived more than 1.5 million reports.\n  Ernie is a lawyer and a member of the Kentucky bar. He is also a \nteacher, having held faculty positions at the University of Louisville, \nthe University of Kentucky, and Indiana University. He has been honored \nby his alma mater, the University of Louisville, as a distinguished \nalumnus of the Louis D. Brandeis School of Law, and as an Outstanding \nAlumnus of the College of Arts and Sciences.\n  I am pleased to report to my colleagues that Ernie will not be \nleaving the fight for America's kids. No, his passion won't allow him \nto take a typical retirement. We are lucky that even as he is stepping \ndown from his role at the helm of the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, he will now focus exclusively on his new role as \npresident and CEO of the International Center for Missing & Exploited \nChildren.\n  If there was some way for me to express the gratitude that literally \nthousands of American families have for Ernie and the National Center, \nI certainly would, but that seems impossible. Imagine the relief of \njust one family who fears the worst about a missing son or daughter and \nthen, thanks to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nis reunited with their child safe and sound. Multiply that by tens of \nthousands, and you will only just begin to see the enormous difference \nErnie has made during his career. I am honored to say that I have \nwatched and admired his work for many years, and I am honored to call \nhim a friend.\n  Thank you, Ernie, for your great contribution to the cause of \njustice.\n  I wrote Ernie a letter congratulating him on his career and wishing \nhim well on his retirement, and I ask unanimous consent to have that \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 15, 2012.\n     Ernie Allen,\n     President & CEO, National Center for Missing & Exploited \n         Children, Prince Street, Alexandria, VA.\n       Dear Ernie: It is an honor to express to you my gratitude \n     for your dedication to protecting America's children. You've \n     brought peace to thousands of families, and your retirement \n     from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children \n     will be a great loss.\n       When you took the reins at the National Center in 1989, it \n     was easier to track down a missing car than a missing child. \n     Now, thanks to your efforts, the National Center boasts a \n     97.7 percent recovery rate.\n       As your friend of over 40 years, I've been inspired by your \n     career and character. Thank you, Ernie, for serving this \n     mission of justice.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                  Mitch McConnell,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 3635 \nare printed in todays Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation? Are \nwe in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on S. 3525.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. I ask \nunanimous consent to proceed for no more than 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness and then resume in the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Vermont Chamber of Commerce's Citizen of the Year\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Vermont is a small State, but it is \nfilled with very big people. Perhaps none are better known or more well \nliked or more respected than Antonio Pomerleau. He is the Vermont \nChamber of Commerce 2012 Vermont Citizen of the Year. Vermonters know \nTony Pomerleau by many names. They either call him Mr. P or Tony. My \nwife\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nMarcelle and I have the good fortune of calling him Uncle Tony. He is \nmy wife's uncle. They have a family bond that I admire. But no matter \nwhat we call him, we all agree that the best term to describe Uncle \nTony is ``generous.''\n  This is not the first time I have come to the floor of the Senate to \nshare stories of Tony Pomerleau's good deeds. Only 6 years ago, the \nBurlington Free Press named him the 2006 Vermonter of the Year. After \nthat editorial, I came to the floor to tell the story of a successful \nreal estate magnate turned philanthropist who touched the lives of \nthousands of Vermonters for the past several decades. At that time, he \nwas 89 years old.\n  This year Tony has undertaken a series of good deeds so substantial \nthat it would be irresponsible if we Vermonters did not acknowledge him \nwith additional recognition and praise. In addition to his unwavering \nphilanthropic commitment to Vermont, this year Tony has demonstrated \nwhy he is seen as a pillar of our community--I might say a granite \npillar of our community. When Tropical Storm Irene destroyed people's \nhomes, Tony immediately donated $1 million to put them back together. \nWhen a decade-long struggle to save a mobile home park in Shelburne, \nVT, seemed destined to fail, Uncle Tony showed up to rebuild the \nneighborhood and donate it to the residents. And when his hometown, \nNewport--Marcelle's birthplace--began discussing plans to reinvigorate \nits beautiful waterfront, Tony offered to lead the way.\n  Any one of these three activities over a lifetime would warrant a \nlifetime achievement award. But Tony Pomerleau did them all in 1 year--\nat the age of 95.\n  This year's very public good deeds go hand in hand with a lifetime of \npublic and private philanthropy. His generosity has touched tens of \nthousands of Vermonters, from college students at St. Michael's \nCollege, where he has been a leading benefactor, to the struggling \nfamilies who attend his community Christmas parties, to the families of \nour deployed Vermont National Guard members who are able to come \ntogether in celebrations with Tony's support.\n  Perhaps the best gift Tony Pomerleau has given Vermont is the sense \nof community and work ethic he has instilled in his family and \nemployees. He and his wife Rita had 10 children, 8 of whom remain with \nus today. And often one of his many grandchildren travels with him when \nhe goes around the State.\n  Vermont is a better place thanks to Tony and his good deeds. On \nbehalf of all Vermonters, I thank the Vermont Chamber of Commerce for \nspotlighting Antonio Pomerleau's good works on behalf of his beloved \nfellow Vermonters.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the American people have spoken, and once \nagain they have given us divided government. In that sense, we can say \nthis was a status quo election. Before the election, just a week or so \nago, we had President Obama in the White House, Democrats controlling \nthe Senate, and Republicans controlling the House of Representatives.\n  After the election, we have President Obama in the White House for \nanother 4 years, Democrats controlling the Senate, and Republicans with \nthe majority in the House. What that tells me is the American people do \nnot completely trust either political party to come up with all the \nanswers. They want those kinds of checks and balances that divided \ngovernment brings; that is, conducive of consultation, deliberation, \nnegotiation, and compromise, not the kind of compromise that violates \none's most fundamental principles.\n  That would be wrong. But as one of my colleagues had told me who \nactually--Senator Enzi, I will use his name, from Wyoming, one of the \nmost conservative Members of the Senate on our side from Wyoming, he \nworked famously with that--I say this with all due respect--liberal \nlion of the Senate, Teddy Kennedy, worked very productively to produce \na lot of legislation out of the HELP Committee.\n  One time I asked Senator Enzi how was it that he and Teddy Kennedy--\nin other words, one of the most conservative Republicans and one of the \nmost liberal Democrats--how did they work together so productively to \ncome together to pass legislation. He said it is easy. It is easy. He \nsaid it is the 80-20 rule. I know it sounds simplistic, but there is a \nlot of wisdom there. If two people are trying to work together in a \nbipartisan way to try to advance solutions to our Nation's problems, \nneither side is going to get all they want. The only way perhaps to \ncome up with moving the ball down the road or advancing solutions is to \nsay: You know what. Do not let the perfect become the enemy of the \ngood, and let's take the 80 percent we can agree upon and leave the 20 \npercent we cannot agree upon for another day and another battle.\n  A lot of wisdom in that it strikes me. The fact is that divided \ngovernment means that neither Democrats nor Republicans are going to \nget everything they want. No legislation can pass. It cannot pass, no \nlegislation can, strictly along partisan lines. It means bipartisan \ncompromise is the only avenue to avoid further gridlock.\n  This Congress has kicked a lot of cans down the road. We have punted \nover into the lameduck session issues that we should have dealt with \nmonths ago in the regular order of things without the imminent pressure \nof the fiscal cliff or other things that threaten to put our country \ninto a recession.\n  But the fact is, divided government has yielded some very positive \ndevelopments for the American people in the past. In 1986, it produced \nlandmark tax reform when Democrats and Republicans--Ronald Reagan as \nPresident, worked together to make our Tax Code more logical, more \nequitable, and more efficient. Ten years later, divided government \nproduced a sweeping overhaul of our welfare system under then-President \nBill Clinton. Conservative Republicans joined with a Democratic \nPresident to help millions of lower income people break free of the \ncycle of dependency and despair.\n  Of course, we know we have divided government. As I said earlier, we \nhad a status quo election in that sense. We have had divided government \nsince January 2011 when Republicans regained the majority in the House \nof Representatives. The result over the last 2 years sadly is it has \nproduced legislative stalemates and bitter recriminations. Why should \nanybody think things will be different going forward?\n  I think what is different now from then is that Republicans and \nDemocrats alike recognize we are at a crossroads, that our current \nfiscal path is unsustainable, and that we are either going to send the \neconomy back into a recession unless we deal with the fiscal cliff and \nthe sequestration or the alternative is--and being an optimist by \nnature I think we have an opportunity to address some of our Nation's \nmost challenging fiscal issues.\n  But the fact is this. I would love to have someone tell me I am \nwrong. I would love to understand any reason they would disagree with \nthis. But I would say it should be stipulated by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike that we cannot continue to run trillion-dollar annual \ndeficits. We cannot continue to run the Federal Government borrowing 42 \ncents out of every $1 the Federal Government spends. We cannot do it.\n  The only reason we can do it now is because interest rates are at \nhistoric lows. Because of what is happening in Europe, the American \ndollar is probably the only safe currency, safe harbor in the world now \nfor people worried about protecting their savings. But we cannot \ncontinue along this path. If, for example, interest rates go up, the \namount of money we must pay to our creditors such as China simply to \nkeep buying our debt--if it were to go up to historic norms, our \nnational debt would spiral out of control.\n  Right now we see this on our savings, on money market accounts or \nsavings accounts. If we want to save some money, about the best \ninterest rate we can get is less than 1 percent return on our savings \nbecause the Federal Reserve has worked to keep interest rates\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nvery low in order to help juice the economy and, hopefully, keep us \nfrom going into recession again. But we cannot continue down this path. \nIf interest rates were to return to their historic norms, we would \nspiral out of control and into a recession or worse.\n  Secondly, we cannot continue to put off structural changes in Social \nSecurity and Medicare. I would think Republicans and Democrats alike \nwould agree that we want to save and preserve Social Security and \nMedicare for our seniors. We may have different ideas about how to do \nthat, but I would think we could agree on the goal. So far we have \nheard nothing from the President to deal with our broken programs such \nas Social Security and Medicare.\n  Unless we are happy with the Tax Code that wastes economic resources, \nthat stifles job creation, and promotes crony capitalism, we cannot \ndelay genuine tax reform. So we have an opportunity. We do not have to \nspeculate on what bipartisan tax reform looks like. We do not have to \nspeculate. We do not have to start from scratch. That is because in \n2010 two separate bipartisan commissions recommended lowering the rates \nand broadening the base and eliminating a lot of tax expenditure \ndeductions and credits which, in order to get the revenue the Federal \nGovernment needs to operate every time we grant a new tax expenditure, \ndeduction or credit, what it means is we need to raise marginal tax \nrates, the percentage of tax people need to pay out of their net worth. \nWhy is that important?\n\n  Because the higher we raise marginal tax rates, it operates as a \ndisincentive on small businesses and individuals whom we are depending \nupon to grow jobs. Many small businesses do not operate as a \ncorporation, a big C corporation, they operate as a subchapter S \ncorporation. They operate as a sole proprietorship or a partnership. \nThe point is they pay business incomes, the people who run those small \nbusinesses, they pay flowthrough income on a personal tax return not on \na corporate tax return.\n  So higher marginal rates disincentivize these smaller businesses from \nspending money to hire new staff or to start or expand their existing \nbusiness. That is why keeping marginal rates down low for as long as we \ncan for everybody is so important. Yet before we get to this important \npoint of dealing with our broken Tax Code, before we can implement \nthis, support this sort of comprehensive tax reform that they did in \n1986 with President Reagan and Democrats in Congress, we need to stop \nAmerica from driving off the fiscal cliff.\n  If we do not act between now and the end of the year, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, we will see the single largest tax increase in \nAmerican history. How is that possible? As you know, the so-called Bush \ntax provisions that were passed are getting ready to expire. Those only \nlasted for 10 years.\n  In 2010, President Obama agreed with Republicans and our Democratic \nfriends agreed with us. As a matter of fact, the extension of the so-\ncalled Bush tax rates was passed with 81 votes in the Senate in 2010. \nAt the time, President Obama made what I thought was a perfectly \nsensible observation. He said, in 2010, with the economy growing so \nslowly, with economic growth down around 3 percent, which was producing \nhigh unemployment because the economy was not growing fast enough, he \nsaid: It make no sense to raise taxes during that kind of fragile \neconomic recovery. That makes me wonder what has changed between now \nand 2010, except for the fact that economic growth is even slower. The \neconomy is even worse today than it was in 2010.\n  President Obama has said--contrast what he said in 2010. He said: \nRaising taxes will help solve our long-term debt problems. He says: \nRaising taxes will help us solve our long-term debt problems. But it is \nhard to take that argument seriously if we look at it closely.\n  First, according to the President's own Treasury Department, the tax \nincreases he is advocating would generate about $85 billion a year in \nnew net revenue. These tax increases would generate about $85 billion \nin new net revenue. By comparison, the monthly budget deficit in \nOctober was $120 billion. The President says raised taxes would \ngenerate $85 billion; Treasury is saying $85 billion doesn't close the \ngap to $120 billion, which is the current level of monthly deficits.\n  As we know, the Federal Government has run annual deficits in excess \nof $1 trillion for at least each of the last 4 years, leading to a $16 \ntrillion national debt, roughly the size of our entire economy. These \nare dangerous waters we are navigating. The President has argued that \nwe need to raise taxes, but he has not provided a prescription for \nclosing the gap between what the Federal Government spends and what we \ntake in, even with these tax increases. He has proposed nothing, \nabsolutely nothing to deal with our unsustainable entitlement programs \nso we can keep the promise we have made to our seniors that when they \nqualify for Medicare and Social Security, those programs will be there \nfor them.\n  I don't believe we can tax our way back to budget surpluses and \neconomic prosperity. I am not a Ph.D. in economics, but I do think it \nis a matter of common sense to say that we cannot tax our way back into \nprosperity without a major reining in of Federal spending and \nentitlement reforms, which will continue to run up huge deficits, which \ncumulatively will add to that $16 trillion of debt. That will happen \nregardless what we do on the revenue side, which is the only part of \nthat equation the President has addressed so far.\n  That brings me to my second point. Nearly 4 years after President \nObama was sworn in--4 years after he was first sworn in--he has not yet \ngiven us a realistic plan for dealing with the deficit and debt \nreduction. You might say: Well, he was unwilling to stick his toe into \nthose difficult waters knowing he was going to have to run for election \nagain because all of this is controversial, no question about it, on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I would think now that the President has been reelected for another 4 \nyears and he doesn't have to stand before the voters again, he would \nfeel flexibility, he would feel as though he has the political freedom \nto try to address this problem in a bipartisan way.\n  Last February Secretary Geithner told the Republican chairman of the \nHouse Budget Committee, ``We're not coming before you to say we have a \ndefinitive solution to our long-term problem. What we do know is we \ndon't like yours.'' That strikes me as a strange response given the \nresponsibility we all have to protect the interests of our country and \nthe American people when it comes to keeping us on a sound economic \npath and hopefully putting America back to work.\n  It is easy in a campaign season for the President to talk about the \nneed for a ``balanced approach'' when it comes to the budget. Of \ncourse, we all have our own ideas about how that balance should be \nstruck, but a truly balanced approach would include reining in Federal \nspending and preserving and protecting Social Security and Medicare. As \na matter of political reality, it should include revenue, and our side \nof the aisle has identified ways that additional revenue might be put \non the table, but that is simply not enough by itself to address the \nwhole problem and is not a serious proposal in terms of solving the \ncomplex economic situation in which we find ourselves.\n  There is nothing balanced, though, about continuing to spend money we \ndon't have and piling up trillions of dollars in new debt. It is \nirresponsible for our generation to impose on the generation of these \nyoung people sitting in front of me the debt they are going to have to \npay. We are kidding ourselves if we think there is not a price to be \npaid for spending money we don't have. We ought to be big enough, we \nought to be responsible enough to these young people, to our \nconstituents, and to the American people to deal with this in a \nresponsible way. That doesn't mean threatening America with a recession \nand almost 1 million people being put out of work if we drive off the \nfiscal cliff. It strikes me as the height of irresponsibility for the \nPresident or anyone else to say: If I don't get what I want, we are \ngoing to put America into a recession.\n  Can you believe that? It is completely irresponsible.\n  If the President is going to claim a mandate for governing, then he \nhas a responsibility to offer a genuine solution to America's fiscal \nchallenges. I am not saying he is going to offer a\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\nplan that this side of the aisle is going to embrace, but what it does \nis it begins the negotiations we know we have to engage in between the \ndifferent sides of the argument to try to come up with that 80/20 \nproposition, that we can actually address these problems and leave some \nof our other fights and differences for a future day.\n  Unless the President offers a plan, his posturing over the national \ndebt cannot be taken seriously. And if he threatens that ``if I don't \nget what I want, we are going to go off the cliff and put America in \nrecession and Americans out of work,'' that is irresponsible and I \nsubmit it would be a violation of the oath of office.\n  A few final thoughts.\n  None of us came to Washington to try to play small ball. We came here \nto try to do important work. I accept the fact that 100 Senators from \nevery part of the country, from all political philosophies came here \nbecause they wanted to do the right thing for their constituents and \nthe American people. I would stipulate to that. Granted, we all have \ndifferent philosophies of government and the role of government that \nmight lead us in different directions. That is what our debate is all \nabout. It is irresponsible for anyone to suggest that we should not \ntackle these problems in an open, transparent, and responsible sort of \nway.\n  Why would we want to play small ball? Why would we want to refuse to \ntackle the Nation's most serious fiscal problems? Why would we want to \ncontinue to see 23 million Americans either out of work or \nunderemployed, with people taking part-time jobs because they can't \nfind full-time employment? Of course, more Americans back to work means \nmore people who actually pay taxes, which is part of the solution to \nclosing that gap between what we spend and what we bring in.\n  I realize and I don't want to minimize the importance of the daunting \nchallenges we face. We were sent here to face them, not go hide under \nour desk, not say: Well, I don't want to do that; I don't want to vote \non that issue because I might get an opponent in the next election. I \nbelieve these enormous challenges are enormous opportunities in \ndisguise. I admit I come from Texas and we are optimists by nature. We \nbelieve that for every challenge, every complication, every problem, \nsomewhere in there is an opportunity for us to deal responsibly and in \nan accountable sort of way to our constituents to pass the long-overdue \nreforms that would balance our budget, revitalize our economy, restore \nAmerican competitiveness, and put Americans back to work.\n\n  None of us came here to play small ball. We now have a momentous \nopportunity to maybe swallow a little bit of our pride, to show a \nlittle humility, maybe. Something you don't think of when you think \nabout politicians is humility. But I think we all have to realize the \nhand we have been dealt, not look back and keep pointing the finger of \nblame. We need to say that this is the hand we have been dealt, this is \nthe job we have volunteered for and gotten a vote of confidence in the \nelection that our constituents have enough confidence in us that we \nwill act responsibly and not kick the can down the road and make the \nprice for our inaction and irresponsibility paid for by the American \npeople or these young people who sit here before me. I hope we seize \nthat opportunity. I want to be part of the solution. I am willing to \ncast tough votes, and I am willing to stand before my constituents and \nsay: You know what, we had to solve this problem. As long as people are \nstill engaged in campaigning rather than governing, as long as we are \nplaying to the television audiences and the peanut gallery rather than \ntrying to solve these problems, we won't do it. But I hope we will \nseize it. I am optimistic we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, in less then 2 months, American \ntaxpayers are set to experience one of the largest tax increases in \nAmerican history. With the elections behind us, it is time for us to \nwork together to reach an agreement that can pass both chambers of \nCongress and be signed by the President.\n  Reaching an agreement won't be easy, but it must be done to avoid \ngoing head first off the fiscal cliff. By this time we are all aware of \nthe Congressional Budget Office warning that failing to come together \nthreatens to send us into another recession.\n  An agreement is certainly doable, but all we hear about is what \nrevenues Republicans are willing to put on the table.\n  We need to hear what the President and my colleagues on the other \nside are prepared to tackle in regard to reforming entitlements that \nare the long-term drivers of our fiscal problems.\n  That being said, we will not be able to reach an agreement if the \nother side continues to insist on punishing entrepreneurs and small \nbusinesses in the name of raising taxes on the ``wealthy.''\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to believe that tax \nincreases, particularly on high-income individuals, do not matter. They \nargue that raising taxes on the so-called wealthy will return us to the \neconomic growth experienced at the height of the 1990s.\n  This defies common sense. If you ask a business owner if raising his \ntaxes will hinder his ability to grow his business, he assuredly will \ntell you they will. He understands that the more the government takes \nfrom him, the less he has to put back into his business.\n  This is in line with the general understanding around here that taxes \ncan be used as both a carrot and a stick to affect behavior. If you \nwant to discourage behavior you impose a tax. If you want to encourage \nbehavior you provide a tax incentive.\n  For example, the excise tax on cigarettes has been increased to \nreduce the number of people smoking. A tax has been imposed on \nindividuals for not purchasing insurance, so more will. Our tax code is \nlittered with tax incentives to get people to do more of the things we \nlike and less of the things we don't like. Individuals and businesses \nhave and do respond to these incentives.\n  Yet, if we are to believe the other side, when it comes to marginal \nincome tax rates the influence of taxes ceases to exist. According to \nthem, we can raise income taxes on the wealthy as high as we want with \nno ill effects for jobs and the economy.\n  Well I have news for my colleagues; high marginal tax rates influence \nmany factors that contribute to economic growth. Capital accumulation \nand the availability of a well trained labor force are two important \nfactors influenced by taxes. Just as an increase in the excise tax on \ncigarettes leads to fewer packs of cigarettes being purchased, \nincreasing taxes on capital reduces capital accumulation. Likewise, the \nmore you tax labor the fewer hours worked you will get. In other words, \ntaxes matter.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side have pointed to a \nCongressional Research Service report they claim proves raising the top \nmarginal tax rate does not impact economic growth. There has been ample \ncriticism of this one analysis that I will not go into here.\n  But, even if one gives any credence to this one analysis, it must be \nviewed in light of a larger body of economic research that indicates \nhigher taxes do hinder economic growth.\n  This research confirms that high marginal rates reduce the hours \nworked and are a disincentive to small business owners and \nentrepreneurs.\n  Among this research is a 2007 study by Christina Romer that found \nthat a tax increase of 1 percent of GDP reduces economic growth by as \nmuch as 3 percent. According to this study, tax increases have such a \nsubstantial effect on economic growth because of the ``powerful \nnegative effect of tax increases on investment.''\n  The last thing we need to do now is discourage business investment. \nBusiness investment has been stagnate. This has directly contributed to \nslower economic growth than in past economic recoveries. It has also \ncontributed to weak job creation and wage growth.\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\n  Raising marginal tax rates on entrepreneurs and business owners, \nthereby reducing their after-tax rate of return is not the answer.\n  We need to give entrepreneurs and business owners the certainty they \nneed to start investing again.\n  The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued \nseveral reports analyzing how different forms of taxation impact \neconomic growth. This OECD research found that income taxes \nsignificantly impact economic growth.\n  According to this research, the most damaging tax was the corporate \nincome tax followed by the individual income tax. The study further \nnoted that highly progressive individual income tax rates are \nnegatively associated with economic growth.\n  The United States of course relies extensively on both corporate and \nindividual income taxes. Our corporate rate of 35 percent is the \nhighest in OECD countries, which is bad in its own right. But a large \nnumber of American businesses are taxed at the individual rate, not the \ncorporate rate. We also already have a highly progressive tax system. \nIn fact, according to a 2008 OECD study we have ``the most progressive \ntax system and collect the largest share of taxes from the richest 10 \npercent of the population.''\n  Currently, the top individual rate of 35 percent is the same as the \ntop corporate rate. Starting in 2013, if the President has his way, the \ntop rate goes up to 39.6 percent with the second highest rate scheduled \nto go up to 36 percent from 33 percent. When you consider the effects \nof the personal exemption phase-out and limitation on itemized \ndeductions, the marginal effective tax rate jumps to over 41 percent.\n  These tax increases will hinder the growth of small businesses, and \nof course, slower business growth means slow job growth.\n  Evidence of this is documented by a 2001 study available from the \nNational Bureau of Economic Research. This study looked at how the \nmarginal rate cuts in the 1986 tax reform affected the growth of small \nfirms.\n  The study showed that businesses that experienced the largest \nmarginal rate cuts saw their businesses grow the fastest. Conversely, \nthe study concluded that when marginal tax rates go up, the growth of \nsmall businesses goes down.\n  Similarly, a 2005 study conducted by the Small Business \nAdministration found that ``lower marginal rates on entrepreneurial \nincome encourage more entrepreneurial entry and lower rates of exit, \nand lengthen the duration of spells of activity.'' This means that if \nmy colleagues are successful in raising the top two marginal rates \nthere will be less entrepreneurial activity. Fewer people will seek to \nstart their own business and more current business owners will be \nlooking to close up shop.\n  Further research confirms that high marginal tax rates leads to fewer \nhours worked. A 2008 study that appeared in the Journal of Monetary \nEconomics and a 2004 study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of \nMinneapolis examined how taxes impact the labor supply across time and \nacross countries.\n  Both of these studies found that countries with higher marginal tax \nrates generally worked fewer hours. Conversely, those with low marginal \nrates worked more hours. In fact, these studies, controlling for other \nvariables, found that the marginal tax rate accounted for the ``vast \nmajority'' or ``preponderance'' of the difference in hours worked.\n  Research by economist Michael Keane has highlighted that high \nmarginal rates have the biggest impact on labor over the long-run. This \nis because of the effect of marginal rates on lifetime decisions.\n  While a sudden increase in taxes may not lead to an immediate shift \nin current hours worked, it will impact future decisions.\n  For instance, higher marginal rates will discourage the accumulation \nof human capital through work experience and training. His review of \nresearch in this area further concluded that the effect of high \nmarginal tax rates is especially pronounced when it comes to women's \nparticipation in the workforce.\n  There are many more examples of economic research that point to high \ntax rates hindering economic growth. For the sake of time, I am not \ngoing to go through all of them. Instead, I will ask unanimous consent \nto place a list of more than 20 studies in the Record. This is by no \nmeans an exhaustive list, but I believe these provide a good starting \npoint for my colleagues who are interested in learning the truth about \ntaxes.\n  In sum, this research suggests that soaking the rich through an ever \nmore progressive tax code will only reduce incentives for work and \nentrepreneurship thereby reducing economic growth. It means that for a \ncouple deciding whether or not a spouse who left the workforce should \ngo back to work, taxes matter;\n  for an Individual who is considering investing in their own human \ncapital through education or training to increase their earning \npotential, taxes matter;\n  for a small business owner considering hiring employees, purchasing \nequipment, or expanding their business, taxes matter;\n  for an entrepreneur deciding whether or not a business venture is \nworth pursuing, taxes matter.\n  Let me turn to another argument used by my colleagues on the other \nside to support increasing taxes. This argument is that tax increases \non the ``wealthy'' are necessary to reduce the deficit and balance the \nbudget.\n  The truth is there are not enough so-called rich people to make this \nhappen. Based on 2009 tax returns, if you raised the top tax rate on \nincome over $200,000 to 100 percent, you would still come short of \ncovering the the $1.1 trillion budget deficit for fiscal year 2012.\n  This back of the envelope calculation assumes that people will not \nwork less or engage in tax planning or fraud to avoid such a \nconfiscatory tax. I imagine my colleagues on the other side would even \nconcede this would be the case with such a high rate.\n  For people out there who think they don't have to worry about the \nPresident's proposals because you are not wealthy, my message to you is \nthis: You should be worried, because in order to tackle the deficit and \npay for all his proposed new spending; the President will have to \nincrease taxes on individuals well under $200,000.\n  The President of course claims that he wants a balanced approach to \ndeficit reduction. He says we should do a combination of tax increases \nand spending cuts. So far he has been rather specific about his tax \nincreases. However, he has not said much about entitlements that are \ngoing to be the main drivers of our national debt over the coming years \nand decades.\n  The President needs to lead in this area to get a serious discussion \nrolling. He needs to begin offering serious solutions, not just \nattacking those that have been offered up by Congressman Ryan in his \nbudget proposal.\n  Given my tenure in Congress, I have learned to be skeptical when \npeople around here start saying we will reduce the deficit by raising \ntaxes now and cutting spending later. Especially when no specifics are \narticulated regarding what programs can be cut or what reforms they \nwill accept for addressing entitlements. It's been my experience in \nthese situations, the taxes always go up, but the spending cuts never \nhappen.\n  Professor Vedder of Ohio University, who has studied tax increases \nand spending for more than two decades, confirms this in recent \nresearch. Professor Vedder looked at tax increases and spending \nspanning from the end of WW II through 2009 and discovered that ``each \ndollar of new tax revenue has been associated with $1.17 in new \nspending''.\n  If we are ever going to get a handle on the deficit, we are going to \nneed to learn to live within our means. Spending as a percent of GDP \nhas averaged about 20.5 percent since 1970. From 1998-2001, when we did \nbalance the budget, spending as a percent of GDP averaged 18.5 percent. \nIn fact we have never balanced the budget with spending as percent of \nGDP exceeding 20 percent. Spending under President Obama has averaged \n24.5 percent of GDP. We must curtail our spending if we ever hope to \nbalance the budget in the future.\n  Some around here insist that cutting spending will be as damaging, if \nnot more so, than increasing taxes. They use the rationale of spending \nmultipliers pushed by some economists that\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\nsuggest for every dollar of spending by the government we will get more \nthan a dollar in economic activity.\n  This theory is deeply flawed. Even if we assume the government spends \nmoney wisely with no fraud, waste or abuse--and that is a big if--it \nmeans one less dollar to be spent by the private sector.\n  If this was solid economic theory our economy should be booming given \nall the money we have been spending around here. The truth is spending \nis not the solution to our problems, it is our problem. It is what got \nus into this mess in the first place.\n  For my colleagues who are still wedded to the idea that tax increases \nare preferable to spending cuts, I recommend reading a recent study by \nHarvard Economist Alberto Alesina. Given the fiscal shape of many \ncountries, Professor Alesina studied the impact of spending and tax \npolicies put in place to address fiscal imbalances.\n  His research concluded that ``fiscal adjustments based upon spending \ncuts are much less costly in terms of output losses than tax based \nones. In particular, spending-based adjustments have been associated \nwith mild and short-lived recessions, in many cases with no recession \nat all. Instead, tax-based adjustments have been followed by prolonged \nand deep recessions.''\n  This research paper comes on the heels of a paper he released in \n2009. This paper similarly found that policies favoring spending cuts \nover tax increases are more likely to reduce the deficit.\n  In the words of Professor Alesina, fiscal adjustments ``based upon \nspending cuts and no tax increases are more likely to reduce deficits \nand debt over Gross Domestic Product ratios than those based upon tax \nincreases.''\n  These studies confirm what through shear common sense Winston \nChurchill knew more than a half century ago, ``for a nation to try and \ntax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and \ntrying to lift himself up by the handle.''\n  In the coming weeks, I hope to work with my colleagues and the \nPresident to reach a bipartisan agreement to help put our country back \non sound fiscal footing. However, as I said in the beginning, it can't \nbe just one side of the aisle that is expected to come to the table. My \ncolleagues on the other side must be willing to put real reforms to \naddress entitlements and our out of control spending on the table.\n  I ask unanimous consent the list to which I referred be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       1.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                            Superstorm Sandy\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to celebrate the people of New \nJersey, many of whom lost everything in Superstorm Sandy but who came \nthrough one of the most devastating storms in our State's history \nbattered but not broken.\n  The storm struck New Jersey with extraordinary force. It was the \nentry point of Superstorm Sandy, and the surge came quickly, destroying \nwhole\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\ncommunities, taking homes from their foundations, changing the \ntopography of the coastline, devastating some of the most densely \npopulated communities in the country, taking lives and taking property, \nleaving New Jerseyans without power but not powerless, without the \npersonal possessions accumulated over a lifetime but with their \nfamilies and their memories intact. Their memories are the foundation \nupon which New Jerseyans are recovering and rebuilding their lives and \ntheir communities. They are rebuilding with the help of FEMA and other \nFederal agencies, including the American Red Cross and countless \nvolunteers from around the country, State and local officials,working \novertime to help. New Jersey will come back stronger and better, and we \nare more determined than ever to rebuild and restore our communities to \nwhere they were.\n  The people of New Jersey withstood the unbridled power of nature--the \npower of nature strengthened by manmade climate change--to create an \nunprecedented storm and unprecedented damage. I wish to share with my \ncolleagues some of the photos showing the devastation and why New \nJersey needs a strong Federal partner if we hope to rebuild.\n  As my colleagues can see, Sandy mixed all forms of transportation \nwith a force we haven't seen in many years. This is a shipping \ncontainer and a large pleasure boat tossed onto the Morgan rail bridge \non the North Jersey coastline along with tons of debris. The photo \nshows the container from the shipping lines and the boat on a bridge \nthat obviously was a rail bridge.\n  You can see, we have a lot of work to do with scenes like this up and \ndown the coast.\n  In this photograph, you can see the kind of damage that our rail \nlines have suffered--heaved from the railroad beds and buckled. This \nagain is along the north Jersey coastline, which had miles of track \ndamaged just like this, as shown in this photograph, and in need of \nmillions of dollars in repairs.\n  In fact, 40 percent of the Nation's transit riders from Washington to \nBoston had their service interrupted. Dozens and dozens of New Jersey \nTransit's locomotives and rail cars were damaged by flooding. So today \nI am proud to announce that we expedited $25 million in transportation \nfunding to help ease that situation.\n  But some commuters into New York, for example, from my home State of \nNew Jersey are still suffering 4-hour commutes, with rail service only \nabout half of what it normally is, largely because there still is not \nenough power for all the trains.\n  In the meantime, New Jersey has added subsidized ferry service to \nmake up the difference, with the Federal Department of Transportation \nproviding over 300 buses to help serve those new ferry lines, including \none out of Liberty State Park.\n  Here is another photograph of the extraordinary power of Sandy's \nsurge that lifted boats on to a rail bridge along the north Jersey \ncoastline. Amazingly, through the hard work of New Jersey Transit \nworkers, this devastated rail line might be able to resume limited \nservice by the end of this week.\n  But this line, like many other commuter lines in New Jersey, will \nneed much more extensive work to get service levels back to normal and \nto make more permanent repairs to ensure long-term reliability.\n  But beyond the transportation damage, it is important to remember \nthat some lost everything in the storm and some lost their lives. Our \nthoughts and prayers go out to all the families who lost loved ones to \nSuper Sandy.\n  I toured some of the worst hit areas with President Obama and \nGovernor Christie and spoke to New Jerseyans who suffered extraordinary \nloss and were hit the hardest.\n  Some of these photos I am about to show now I took myself. They may \nnot be the best photographs and I may not be the best photographer, but \nthey show a small part of the overall destruction my State has \nsuffered.\n  You can see in this photograph from the Coast Guard plane I was \naboard some of the destruction at Sandy Hook, NJ. These homes are \ndeeply under water, many of them rendered impossible to return to for a \nsignificant period of time. There are other homes I will show you where \npeople cannot return to what was their home.\n  This is a photograph of the flooding in the Mantoloking area north of \nSeaside Heights that submerged cars and caused millions of dollars of \ndamage and thousands to be displaced from their homes. This bridge \nactually collapsed at the end there, leaving this whole section in \ndifficulty in terms of exit off the barrier islands.\n  I took the next two photographs while touring northern New Jersey. I \nhave shown most of the pictures from the shore area, which took the \nhardest hit, because that was the entry point largely for Superstorm \nSandy, but it was not just along the shore. Here is an example of the \ntype of flooding that took place in Hoboken, NJ. On the night of the \nstorm, this flooding was just beginning, and it only got worse, so much \nso that it took the National Guard to rescue residents from their \nhomes, days--days--after the storm. It filled the streets with overflow \nfrom sewage plants. Gasoline was reeking in the air--a danger to the \nhealth and well-being of residents. And it made the damage even worse \nthan anyone had imagined possible.\n  The next photograph I took is of Observer Highway. This is a major \nthoroughfare between two significant parts of the metropolitan area, \nbetween the city of Hoboken and the city of Jersey City, the second \nlargest city in our State. I cannot remember ever seeing the area so \nexpansively under water, and I hope to never see it again.\n  All of these cars were floating, some of them crashing into each \nother, rendered largely useless, and, of course, stopping a major \nthoroughfare for days in terms of anybody being able to get through.\n  And if the images do not give you a sense of the destruction and the \nloss families have suffered, then this next photograph encapsulates the \npower of the storm to take away all that people had worked for all of \ntheir lives. It is in the faces of the people I met.\n  Here in Pleasantville, NJ, which is right outside Atlantic City along \na section there, the mayor of Pleasantville took me to meet a series of \nresidents whose homes had been ripped apart.\n  In this picture, I am standing outside of the person's home, almost \nas if it were a dollhouse, looking in. I would love to have said that \nit was only this poor gentleman, but it was an entire community where \nhomes had been ripped apart and you could see into their homes. It \nshows the nature of, the breadth and scope of, the devastation.\n  It is not that this gentleman lost a shingle, it is that he lost the \nwhole side of his home, now exposed to the elements and, of course, \neverything ripped apart.\n  The other aspect about this picture, in addition to the incredible \ndestruction, is the resiliency. When I went to share my sentiments and \nmy concern with this gentleman, he asked me: How are you doing, \nSenator? I said: Well, sir, what is more important is, how are you \ndoing? He said: I'm doing fine. I'm here, I'm alive, and I still have \npart of my home.\n  So sometimes when we think about how difficult our lives might be at \nany given moment, I think about this gentleman and the extraordinary \nresiliency he has had in the midst of probably one of the most \ndifficult times in his life. And there are so many other New Jerseyans \nwhom I met like that.\n  I met a young woman in Hoboken whose entire basement apartment was \nflooded--totally gone. She lost everything she had worked for in her \nyoung professional life. In the midst of that tragedy for her, she was \nat a shelter, running the shelter, helping everybody else who had been \ndisplaced--some not as badly as her, not thinking about her tomorrow, \nbut thinking about her fellow citizens in Hoboken, NJ.\n  I met some poor families who were not badly affected by the storm who \nopened their homes and their kitchen tables to individuals who were \ntheir neighbors who were hurt very badly. And even though they did not \nhave a lot to put around the kitchen table, they were sharing what they \nhad.\n  I saw citizens risk their own lives to save their neighbors' lives in \nthe rushing water and heard their accounts. So I saw the better angels \nof people in the midst of a storm.\n\n  The fact is, despite the damage and displacement, the human suffering \nand loss of property, possessions, personal photographs and family \nmemories, the people of New Jersey held together.\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\n  Neighbors came together to help one another. As much as they were \nshaken and mourned their own loss, they worked together to help each \nother, to save each other, to begin the recovery, to get New Jersey \nback on its feet, and Federal, State, and local governments were there \nto help.\n  The Federal response was quick, and it was effective, but there is \nstill so much more that we need to do, and still more that we can do to \nhelp those families who are still without shelter, still without a \nplace to return to, to call home, and without a clear picture of what \nthe future holds.\n  The storm was unprecedented in the breadth of its devastation. While \nour shoreline was hard hit, that does not begin to describe the full \nimpact. Some of our Nation's most densely populated communities were \nalso hit very hard, requiring one of the biggest rescue and recovery \nefforts we have seen. A response that size, obviously, takes time, but \nwe acted quickly and will continue to do what needs to be done.\n  After surveying Sandy's damage with President Obama and Governor \nChristie on October 31, Senator Lautenberg and I called for increased \nsupport from the Federal Government to deal with the cost of response \nefforts.\n  In a letter to the President, we asked that the Federal share for \ndisaster response be increased from the standard 75 percent to a much \nhigher possibly 100 percent because of the devastating impact of what \nmeteorologists have called a perfect storm.\n  The President initially issued a disaster declaration for eight New \nJersey counties and, along with Senator Lautenberg, we requested \nadditional counties be included, and they were.\n  Before walking with the President and the Governor through \nBrigantine, NJ, I had an opportunity to tour the destruction in \nPleasantville, Hoboken, Jersey City, and communities in Bergen County. \nWhat I saw was unlike anything I had ever seen in my lifetime in those \ncommunities.\n  I am very grateful that the President came to New Jersey with the \nfull force of the Federal Government to see and to respond firsthand to \nthe devastation the hurricane left in its wake.\n  I have proudly lived in New Jersey all of my life, and seeing the \nGarden State in ruin is heartbreaking. The shore of my youth is gone. \nMuch of it lies in the ocean for the ages. But it made me realize that, \nin times of tragedy, in times of storms like Sandy, we need government \nat all levels to come together, all of us rolling up our sleeves to \nhelp our neighbors recover and rebuild and reclaim their lives. We need \nto make certain that we secure all of the resources necessary to help \nNew Jersey, and every community affected by this horrible storm, to \nrebuild and emerge stronger than before.\n  Since the storm, I have requested emergency funding for New Jersey's \ntransportation network--highways, rail lines, ports, and airports--that \nwas devastated by the storm.\n  I asked the President and Secretary LaHood for emergency funds to \nrepair highways and bridges and to expedite assistance to all impacted \nmodes of transportation.\n  I called on the President to dispatch emergency fuel and power \nsupplies to New Jersey to ease the fuel shortage and to keep emergency \nvehicles running in the immediate aftermath of the storm.\n  To ensure critical infrastructure--water treatment and sanitation \nfacilities--we received the help of the Army Corps of Engineers to have \nthese facilities remain operable.\n  The Federal Government also responded with $10 million in emergency \nfunding, with some of those critical transportation needs, freed up 2 \nmillion gallons of fuel from the Northeast Oil Reserve, and the EPA \ntook action that rerouted this fuel to New Jersey when it needed it the \nmost.\n  The Federal response also included a grant for New Jersey to hire \n1,000 workers to help communities clean up from the storm.\n  But, despite all of that, many families in my State are still \nsuffering. They have lost much, and many are displaced, some \npermanently, from their homes. That is why I have called for the \nimmediate suspension of foreclosures and evictions for all New Jersey \nhomeowners who faced financial difficulties before the storm and now \nare suffering additional difficulties in the wake of it; and for swift \naction to expand emergency mortgage payment relief to all New Jersey \nhomeowners who have lost income as a result of Hurricane Sandy.\n  That is why we must work to give them certainty of what the Federal \nGovernment will do to help them rebuild their lives so they can make \ncritical decisions as to their futures.\n  What I take away from this experience is the fact that we are all in \nthis together, one community, each of us dependent on the other--each \nof us working to rebuild and recover for the benefit of all of us in \nNew Jersey, but I believe all of us in the country.\n  That is what community is all about. It is the heart of our motto: E \nPluribus Unum; From Many, One. We have just gone through an election at \nthe heart of which we debated the role of government in our lives. I \nwould submit we need to focus on what government does to rebuild the \nspirit of community that we have seen in action in the aftermath of \nthis devastating storm.\n  Americans across the country were riveted by the stories of the \nimmediate aftermath of the storm--the pictures of communities under \nwater, homes moved blocks down the road, homes and trains blocking \nFederal highways, hospitals closed, gas lines miles long, people \nwaiting hours for fuel to run generators and keep their homes heated, \nweeks of fuel rationing, and no transit or Amtrak service for the \nentire region for people to get to work or visit their families.\n  Without a doubt, those have been trying times for New Jersey. But \nnow, just because those scenes may no longer be showing in living rooms \nacross the country does not mean that the recovery is over.\n  Thousands of families are still displaced from their homes and will \nbe for months to come.\n  Transit lines are still out. Community infrastructure still has to be \nrebuilt. Now is not the time for the Federal Government to walk away. \nIt is more crucial now than ever for the Federal Government to help \ndevastated communities rebuild, help families get the assistance they \nneed to repair their homes, and put their lives back together.\n  I for one will not rest until the rebuilding is done. This is one \ncountry, the United States of America. That is why, when there was \ndestruction in New Orleans with Katrina, in Florida, in Joplin, or crop \ndestruction in the Midwest, I came along with other colleagues to \nsupport those communities. I viewed it as my time to stand with my \nfellow Americans in distress.\n  Now it is time for my fellow Americans to stand with New Jersey. New \nJersey has been battered, but we are not broken. We are stronger and \nmore united in our efforts to work together to recover, rebuild, and \nrecommit ourselves to uniting around our common concerns and shared \nvalues rather than divided by our differences. That is the lesson we \nlearned. And together we will rebuild and the Garden State will bloom \nonce again.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Oversight on Energy Drinks\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over the past few years we have seen a \ndramatic increase in the sale of energy drinks in America. Energy \ndrinks are now common fixtures in grocery stores, vending machines, gas \nstations, convenience stores, and everywhere we turn. They target young \npeople with flashy ads and names such as Monster and Rock Star and with \nclaims to increase attention stamina and even to help with weight loss. \nAccording to one study, 30 to 50 percent of adolescents, teenagers, \nconsume energy drinks.\n  Sadly, as the sale of energy drinks has grown, so has the alarming \nevidence that these energy drinks pose a potential threat to our \nNation's health. Yesterday, the New York Times featured an article that \nfound that the Food and Drug Administration has received 13 adverse \nevent reports for people who died--who died--after consuming 5-hour \nENERGY drinks. Just\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\nlast month, news reports found that five people died--five--after \nconsuming Monster Energy drinks.\n  This last May, I met the mother and family of 14-year-old Anais \nFournier from Maryland. This lovely young teenager lost her life last \nDecember when she went into cardiac arrest--caused by caffeine \ntoxicity--after she drank two--two--24-ounce Monster Energy drinks in \nless than 24 hours. Anais was an honor student. She was a good student \nand a great writer, and she used to watch movies with her mom.\n  An American Academy of Pediatrics study recommends adolescents \nconsume no more than 100 milligrams of caffeine each day. Remember the \nnumber--100 milligrams a day. According to Consumer Reports, a 24-ounce \ncan of Monster Energy drink contains 276 milligrams of caffeine, almost \nthree times the amount this academy recommends as the limit an \nadolescent would consume in a day--276 milligrams in less than 24 \nhours. Anais Fournier consumed 552 milligrams of caffeine by drinking \ntwo Monster Energy drinks within 24 hours. That is the equivalent of \ndrinking 16 12-ounce Coca-Cola sodas.\n  Mounting evidence shows that tragic stories such as the one involving \nAnais Fournier are becoming more common. A recent report by SAMHSA \nshows that energy drinks pose potentially serious health risks. \nEmergency room visits due to energy drinks have increased tenfold \nbetween 2005 and 2009--1,128 ER visits in 2005 to 13,114 emergency room \nvisits in 2009 linked to energy drinks in America.\n  There are serious health concerns about ingesting high levels of \ncaffeine in energy drinks and, I might also add, many added ingredients \nthat are also stimulants and contain even additional caffeine that is \nadded to the drinks. The Food and Drug Administration currently limits \nthe level of caffeine in soda--the kind you would buy over the \ncounter--to no more than 71 milligrams in a 12-ounce can. Remember the \nnumber for the 24-ounce can of Monster--276? That is almost four times \nthe limit of what can be sold legally as a beverage regulated by the \nFDA in America.\n  Let me show this 5-hour ENERGY picture. I really don't have to show \nit. Everyone is pretty familiar with it because they are everywhere--\nliterally everywhere. I watched on television last week when they were \nadvertising promotions of 5-hour ENERGY drinks saying, in the \ncommercials, that some of the sales would go to promote research for \nbreast cancer. There is almost the suggestion there is something \nhealthy about this product.\n  Well, let's talk about that for a moment. Compare that limit of 71 \nmilligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce can of soda or pop to the 215 to \n242 milligrams of caffeine in the small 2-ounce bottle of 5-hour ENERGY \nor the 135 milligrams in a 12-ounce can of Monster Energy. Some energy \ndrinks contain 300 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce serving. As we \nall know, most energy drinks are not sold in 12-ounce cans. They are \nsold in 16-, 24-, and 32-ounce cans. Two 24-ounce Monster Energy drinks \ntook the life of Anais Fournier.\n  These drinks, of course, contain more than caffeine. We don't know \nall the products included, but they include many other stimulants, such \nas guarana and ginseng. The FDA has the authority to regulate caffeine \nlevels in beverages and to require beverage manufacturers, such as soda \npop, to prove additives are safe. But most energy drinks, such as 5-\nhour ENERGY, avoid the FDA's regulation and oversight by marketing \ntheir products not as beverages but as dietary supplements.\n  We will not see it on the front of this little container. We have to \nflip it around and look down at the bottom, and in the tiniest \nlettering we see dietary supplement. Why? Because as a dietary \nsupplement they are not regulated. They can sell what they like. And, \nunfortunately, they sell products that contain so much caffeine they \nare dangerous.\n  Now, my colleague, Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut, who is on the \nSenate floor tonight, and I have sent the Food and Drug Administration \nletters three times calling on this agency to take action to ensure \ncaffeine levels and ingredients in energy drinks are safe, particularly \nfor kids. We have urged the agency to issue final guidance \ndistinguishing beverages and liquid dietary substances to close the \nloopholes that allow some energy drinks to avoid FDA oversight. We have \ncalled on that agency to regulate energy drinks that have caffeine \nlevels well above the 71 milligrams per 12-ounce threshold in soft \ndrinks.\n  Today, Senator Blumenthal and I asked FDA Commissioner Margaret \nHamburg to personally meet with us after Thanksgiving to discuss the \nsteps the FDA is taking to ensure the safety of energy drinks. Every \nother week we are seeing mounting evidence that energy drinks pose \nsafety risks. We learn about young people hospitalized or seriously \nhurt after consuming what they are marketing as innocent little energy \npick-me-ups.\n  We look forward to working with Commissioner Hamburg to discuss the \nFood and Drug Administration's strategy to protect our children and to \nprotect everyone in America from these dietary supplements, whether it \nis 5-Hour Energy or the Monster Energy drink that led to the death of \nthis 14-year-old girl in Maryland.\n  It has been many years since I came to this floor and argued about \ndietary supplements. We all know what is involved. I always preface my \nremarks by saying: When I got up this morning, I took my vitamin pill, \nand I took my fish oil pill. I believe I should have the right to do \nthat. I don't know if it helps, but I think it does, and I shouldn't \nhave to have a prescription to have a vitamin pill. Enough said. But \nwhen it comes to dietary supplements that go beyond that type of \nsupplement, things that include dramatic increases in caffeine, we have \nto take the next step.\n  I managed a few years ago to pass a law--over some objection--that \nrequires the makers of dietary supplements to report adverse events. In \nother words, if people call from getting sick--or worse--from your \nproduct, you have to tell the FDA so we can gather this together and \npick up any trends that are alarming or worrisome. Well, they have been \ndoing it but not as vigilantly as they should, and the companies have \nnot been reporting them as often as they should. But now we know, as I \nsaid at the outset of my remarks, that young people and others are \ndying from these energy drinks, 5-Hour Energy drinks and Monster Energy \ndrinks. They died after they ingested these, and it has raised serious \nquestions as to whether there was causation between them.\n  To find there were 13 adverse-event reports for people who died after \nconsuming 5-Hour Energy drinks and 5 people who died after consuming \nthese Monster Energy drinks--for goodness' sakes, these are for sale to \nkids across America. We wouldn't sell these kids alcohol over the \ncounter without asking how old they were, whether they reached an age \nwhere they are eligible to buy alcohol products, but we are selling \nproducts that could be more lethal than alcohol to these young kids \nwithout the necessary oversight and supervision.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for joining me in this effort. \nWe have to continue it. The New York Times yesterday made a report that \nI think puts us on notice. There is a lot more to be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am very honored to stand with my \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois on this vitally important issue. \nI thank him for his leadership, and I am very proud to work with him on \na problem that really shows dramatically that neglect and disregard by \ngovernment regulators and enforcers can have real-life consequences.\n  The FDA has, very simply, failed to address this issue, and I believe \nit has failed even to respond to the alarms Senator Durbin and I have \nsounded on this issue.\n  Yesterday the New York Times featured an article reporting that the \nFood and Drug Administration received 13 adverse-event reports of \nfatalities following the consumption of 5-Hour Energy, which is a \nhighly caffeinated energy shot. But this report is really only the \nlatest of a series of reports that two popular energy drinks--Monster \nEnergy and 5-Hour Energy--have been cited in deaths and injury. These \ndrinks have been cited in reports of dozens of serious adverse\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nevents such as heart attacks and convulsions. And these events are not \nthe only concern that has been raised about energy drinks. I will cite \na few.\n  A report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration found that the number of emergency room visits due to \nenergy drinks increased tenfold between 2005 and 2009, from 1,128 to \n13,114 visits.\n  More recently, a study of energy drinks by Consumer Reports found \nthat some energy drinks contain high levels of caffeine--in some cases, \ntwice as much as a cup of coffee.\n  The Consumer Reports study found that labels of many energy drinks \ncompletely failed to disclose how much caffeine is contained, and, even \nworse, 5 of the 16 drinks Consumer Reports studied contained more than \n20 percent more caffeine than what was stated on the label.\n  These reports are profoundly and deeply troubling, and the FDA--the \nagency in charge of regulating the safety of these products--needs to \ndetermine whether energy drinks are safe and, if necessary, take action \nabout their safety.\n  Senator Durbin and I have written two letters--one on September 11, \nthe other on October 26 of this year--calling on the agency to take \naction addressing the rising public health concerns around energy \ndrinks and to protect consumers. Have we heard anything back? Nothing. \nNo response.\n  In today's letter, we reiterate our request for the FDA to \ninvestigate the interactions between caffeine and stimulants in energy \ndrinks, to assess the health risks associated with caffeine consumption \nby children and adolescents, and to finalize and issue guidance that \nclearly distinguishes liquid dietary supplements from beverages. This \nissue is as profoundly and deeply important as the combination of \ncaffeine and alcohol, which Attorneys General addressed during the time \nI held that job in the State of Connecticut. Alcohol makers, to their \ncredit, did the right thing and addressed it on their own. Here, the \nindustry has failed in that obligation. The FDA has not just an \nopportunity but an obligation to address this issue.\n  I also believe the FDA has failed to consider the shifting trends in \ncaffeine consumption more generally and broadly that is shown by the \nenergy drink industry, particularly shifting trends in consumption \namong adolescents. The industry has marketed relentlessly and \nrepeatedly, which accounts for that dramatic statistic Senator Durbin \ncited that 30 to 50 percent of adolescents are known and reported to be \nusing these drinks. Marketing and that trend have a clear connection. \nIt is no accident that caffeine consumption and the consumption of \nthese energy drinks is increasing.\n  But the FDA's determination of safe levels of caffeine seems to be \nbased on what is safe for adult consumption, not adolescent. It does \nnot consider consumption patterns among young people or take into \naccount safe levels of caffeine consumption among children. And these \nenergy drinks are marketed to young people, including children. As an \nexample, although the FDA states that adults can safely consume up to \n400 milligrams of caffeine per day, the American Academy of Pediatrics \nrecommends that adolescents consume no more than 100 milligrams per \nday--less than what is contained in one dose of an energy drink. And \nConsumer Reports recommends that children consume no more than 45 to 85 \nmilligrams per day, depending on their weight.\n  I wish to associate myself with the very persuasive and compelling \nremarks made by Senator Durbin today. Again, his leadership on this \nissue has been so valuable.\n  I would close by making this point. There is a lot of rhetoric that \nis purportedly based on principle and conviction that somehow \ngovernment rules and consumer protections are a frivolous nuisance or a \nburden without a benefit or an unwarranted intrusion in the free \nmarket. The experience that was dramatically portrayed in the hearing \nof the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee today offers a \ntragic lesson on how compounding pharmacies and the failure of \ngovernment regulators to act dispositively and promptly led to injuries \nand deaths across the country.\n  My colleague Senator Alexander was present and very perceptively \nasked some of the most pointed questions this morning of the witnesses \nwho came before us from the FDA and other government agencies, \nincluding the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy. That lesson this morning \nought to sound an alarm for us here because the New England compounding \npharmacy in that instance was a known risk to both Federal and State \nregulators--the FDA and the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy--and both \nfailed to take effective action to protect the public.\n  The FDA in this instance has an obligation to protect the public and \ntake action that will safeguard the health of our children and \nadolescents--the health of everyone--in light of the potential dangers \nposed by these energy drinks.\n  I close by again thanking my colleague from Illinois for being such a \nstrong advocate of consumer interests and health in this area. I hope \nwe will have a meeting soon, as we have requested, so that we can work \ntogether to make sure these products are labeled accurately and \ntruthfully, marketed responsibly, and consumed safely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n            Character Attacks Against Ambassador Susan Rice\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to say a word about the tragedy \nthat occurred in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 where we lost a \ndedicated ambassador and three other American lives. It was awful. It \nhas been nearly a decade since we lost an ambassador in service to our \ncountry, and it is something we are looking at with a great deal of \nsadness and sorrow that these individuals who dedicated their lives to \nAmerica were killed in the course of duty. But this has gone from a \ntragedy in Benghazi to a major political debate in America.\n  Part of it was explainable because it was in the closing days and \nweeks of a Presidential campaign when many times issues that don't \nreach national prominence become prominent because of the attention \nbeing paid to the candidates. And a lot has been said back and forth, \nand I have tried, as have other Members of Congress, to understand \nexactly what happened on September 11 in Benghazi. It is difficult \nbecause there wasn't a gathering of evidence immediately. \nInvestigations were undertaken. It was chaotic at the scene that \nevening, and, sadly, many of the witnesses who could help us understand \nhave disappeared into the night. But the effort has been undertaken to \nfind out what occurred, to find out whether there was adequate \nprotection for the Ambassador and his staff and, if not, what we should \nhave done. I understand these tragedies require careful examination.\n  I was a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives when 235 U.S. \nmarines died in a Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon. You \nbet we asked questions of the Reagan administration, as we should when \nwe lose innocent American lives overseas as we did in Lebanon and as we \ndid in Libya. What troubles me is the level the debate has reached. It \nhas now reached a level of vilification and accusation which is \nunwarranted by the evidence.\n  This week we met in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a \nclosed, classified setting and went through meticulously the timeline \nthat led up to the death of the Ambassador and staff as well as what \nfollowed. It is being reported as it is being gathered, and there are \nadditional reports that will be forthcoming.\n  Early next month we are expecting the Accountability Review Board of \nthe Department of State to issue its report. We know, following that, \nother committees of jurisdiction--the Intelligence Committee, Foreign \nRelations Committee, and others--will certainly call in witnesses and \nask questions, as they should, as they must.\n  What troubles me is that on the floor of the Senate during the course \nof this week, there have been accusations made of individuals that have \ngone far beyond anything the evidence could suggest.\n  We owe it to the cause of justice and to the lives that were lost to \ndo this professionally and honestly, without political rancor. The \nPresident was right yesterday when he said of our U.N. Ambassador Susan \nRice, she ``has\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\ndone exemplary work. She has represented the United States and our \ninterests in the United Nations with skill and professionalism, with \ntoughness and grace.'' And ``to go after the U.N. ambassador,'' he \nsaid, ``who had nothing to do with Benghazi, and was simply making a \npresentation based on intelligence she had received, and to besmirch \nher reputation is outrageous.''\n  I agree with him. We owe it to her and to everyone involved in every \nFederal agency to get the facts before us before we point a finger of \nblame. If there is blame, let us make certain it is apportioned to \nthose who deserve it rather than to make wild charges against many \nothers.\n  My good friend Senator John McCain--and he really is my friend; he \nand I debated on the floor many times--but he said something I want to \nquote from 2005, when there were criticisms of Condoleezza Rice who was \nbeing considered for the office of Secretary of State. He said, ``So I \nwonder why we are starting this new Congress with a protracted debate \nabout a foregone conclusion. . . . I can only conclude we are doing \nthis for no other reason than lingering bitterness at the outcome of \nthe elections. . . . We all have varying policy views, but the \nPresident, in my view, has a clear right to put in place the team he \nbelieved would serve him best.''\n  I agree with Senator McCain's statement. Let's get the facts \ntogether. Let us find out what truly occurred. Before we point the \nfinger of blame on any person in our government, let's make certain we \ndo so with the knowledge of the facts and the evidence that we can \ngather. We owe it to the Ambassador, his family, and all the others who \nwere either injured or lost their lives in this occurrence.\n  I urge my colleagues to focus on the report due in December from the \nAccountability Review Board and to attend the hearings that will \nundoubtedly follow on this issue. We need a constructive discussion on \nhow we can ensure that our brave diplomats can work effectively in some \nof the most dangerous parts of the world.\n  Susan Rice is a dedicated public servant who has tirelessly pursued \nthe interests of the United States at the United Nations, ranging from \nsanctions on Iran to advancing the actual effort in the Security \nCouncil to oust former Libyan strongman Muammar Qaddafi. She deserves \nfair treatment, as everyone does in our government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Louisiana. I \nknow she expects to speak about 5:30. I want to say to her through the \nChair I will be finished by then.\n\n\n                           Fungal Meningitis\n\n  I see the Senator from Connecticut I believe is still here. I \ncompliment him on his participation this morning in a hearing in which \nwe both participated. It was a sad hearing, really. It was about the \nfungal meningitis--the Senator from Minnesota was there as well--the \nfungal meningitis outbreak that in our State, Tennessee, has become a \nnightmare. It has claimed thirteen lives, 81 very ill in many cases, \nand a thousand others who worry they might become ill.\n  It became obvious as we went through the discussion that something, \nincredibly, slipped through the cracks. We have more than 60,000 what I \nwould call drugstores, pharmacies in the country; maybe more than a \nthousand in Tennessee. Many of them are doing this pharmaceutical \ncompounding. You go in and get a prescription filled. They might adjust \nthe prescription, or an FDA-approved drug based upon your prescription. \nThat is normal and necessary. Then over here on the other side are the \nbig manufacturers of drugs. As the Senator from Connecticut has pointed \nout, they are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  But then there are these entities in the middle, and there was one in \nMassachusetts that was apparently masquerading as a compounding \npharmacy--it was really a drug manufacturer, but it was not complying \nwith the rules of a drug manufacturer. As a result, it provided tainted \nmedicine all over the country. Had it not been for remarkable work by \nthe Tennessee Public Health Department in conjunction with Vanderbilt \nUniversity and the Centers for Disease Control, there could have been \nmany more deaths and many more injuries.\n  We saw an example of government. We saw an incompetent State Board of \nPharmacy in Massachusetts, a confused Food and Drug Administration, and \nwe saw a textbook model of what ought to be done by the Centers for \nDisease Control and the Tennessee Department of Health.\n  I am committed to work with Senator Harkin, the chairman of our \ncommittee, and other members of our committee throughout the rest of \nthis year on this issue. I hope the Senator from Minnesota and I, and \nthe Senator from Connecticut, and Senators Burr and Roberts, who have \nbeen working on this for some time, can begin the new year with a \nbipartisan bill that can put somebody on the flagpole for this so we \ncan continue, when we go to the hospital or go to the pharmacy or \noutpatient clinic, to not worry about whether the medicines we are \nreceiving are tainted or unsafe.\n  I thought it was an excellent hearing. I look forward to working on \nit. I have some ideas about a model for this regulation.\n  I found as Governor years ago, if you give a committee responsibility \nfor getting something done they often end up pointing fingers at each \nother. If you put somebody on the flagpole, it often gets done because \nyou will know what happened. I think that is why Admiral Rickover \ncreated such a good system with nuclear submarines. We have never had a \nnuclear related death on a nuclear Navy submarine since the 1950s. I \nthink I know why. It is because the Admiral interviewed every one of \nthose captains of the submarines and the Navy made it clear to them if \nthere was a problem with a nuclear reactor that went unfound or unfixed \non their submarines their career was in deep trouble, and so we have \nnever had any trouble.\n\n\n                               Wind Power\n\n  If I may move to another subject, there's been a lot of talk this \nweek about the fiscal cliff. The President and Congressional leaders \nare meeting tomorrow, as they should, about how we can reduce our debt. \nThat will require, in my judgment, reform of our entitlement programs. \nSaving our Medicare Program, for example. The average couple who is 65 \nyears of age when they retire pays $119,000 into the Medicare Program. \nThey will take out $357,000. That kind of program is not sustainable. \nFor the next generation of older Americans there will not be a Medicare \nProgram unless we work on that.\n  We need to work together to find a way to restrain entitlements, \nproduce revenues if that is what is necessary, and come to a result. In \nthe meantime we have to be saving money--42 cents out of every dollar \nwe spend is borrowed--so that is what brings me to the floor today.\n  Supporters of wind power have used this week to proclaim it ``Wind \nWeek'' in Washington, DC, launching an event to try to persuade us to \nextend one more time--this would be the eighth time--the Wind \nProduction Tax Credit which, if we were to do so, just for 1 year, \nwould cost another $12.1 billion over 10 years.\n  I want to suggest a different name for this week. Let's call it the \n``Wind Down Wind Week.'' It is time to end a 20-year-old temporary \nsubsidy that has already been renewed seven times. The reason is very \nsimple. We can't afford it. The Joint Tax Committee says the 1-year \nextension will cost that $12.1 billion--but it is not just a 1-year \nextension. The developers of wind power will get the tax credit for 10 \nyears. That is a lot of money. It is one-third of the Tennessee State \nbudget. It is 2 times what we spend each year on energy research. This \nmoney could be used to help reduce the debt instead of fund this \nsubsidy. The cost $12.1 billion is on top of the $16 billion in Federal \nsubsidies and grants already given to wind developers and their Wall \nStreet backers between 2009 and 2013, according to the Joint Tax \nCommittee and the Unites States Treasury.\n  How can we justify this? We hear a lot about big oil. What about big \nwind? Big wind received, according to the Energy Information Agency, an \n$18.82 federal subsidy per megawatt hour--25 times per megawatt hour as \nall other forms of electricity production combined. Given our fiscal \ncrisis we should\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\neliminate special tax breaks for big oil and big wind.\n  The big wind tax break was put in place in 1992. It was to be a \ntemporary measure. It was intended to boost a new technology. Now, 20 \nyears later, President Obama's respected Energy Secretary says wind is \na mature technology. What do we have after 20 years and billions of \ndollars of subsidies? A puny amount of unreliable electricity. Our \ncountry uses nearly 25 percent of all the electricity in the world. \nWind produces 3 percent of that. And of course it only produces \nelectricity when the wind blows and it is not easy to store it. So it \nis of limited use in a country that needs huge amounts of low-cost, \nclean, reliable electricity. Relying on wind power is the energy \nequivalent of going to war in a sailboat when nuclear submarines are \navailable.\n  The wind subsidy is so large that wind developers are now paying \ndistributors to take their wind power, undercutting the baseload energy \nplants that are necessary to provide the reliable, low-cost electricity \nour country needs. On top of that, there are better ways to produce \nclean electricity, better ways than subsidizing a technology that \ndestroys the environment in the name of saving the environment.\n  For example, it would take a row of 50-story wind turbines along the \nentire length of the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine, 2,178 \nmiles, to equal the energy production of 4 nuclear reactors. The best \nway to produce cheap, clean energy in the United States is to let the \nmarketplace do it. Let the marketplace produce large amounts of clean, \nreliable energy for all businesses and households--not to just \nsubsidize jobs for a technology that can stand on its own and produces \nonly a small amount of unreliable electricity.\n  Let's use this week to celebrate. But let's celebrate the end of the \ntemporary 20-year-old wind production tax credit and use the $12.1 \nbillion saved to reduce the Federal debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                        National Adoption Month\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak \nbriefly about a very exciting opportunity and occurrence that we \ncelebrate and honor every November and that is the opportunity to adopt \nchildren. There are so many children--Mr. President, you know, not only \nin Minnesota but in my State, Louisiana--the Senator from Tennessee is \nhere, in his State of Tennessee--children all over our country and the \nworld who are in desperate need of a family to call their own. There \nare millions of parents and adults who want to be parents who are \nwaiting and hoping for an opportunity to have a family of their own. So \nit would make sense for us to do the very best job we can to try to \nbuild the bridges to make these unions, these really extraordinary \nunions possible.\n  That is what November is about, a month we are getting ready for \nThanksgiving, in anticipation of Christmas and Hanukah, some of the \nother holidays that occur around this time. As families gather, our \nhearts and minds automatically turn to family-related events. So the \ngreat coalition that tries to help educate and encourage people on the \nsubject has chosen November as National Adoption Month. You might \nknow--many people go home at night and turn on their televisions. There \nare any number of television series by Hallmark and Home for the \nHolidays--lots of networks and cable companies are joining in with the \nidea of promoting it because it is so right. It is so natural for every \nchild to need and want a family.\n  I first want to say thank you to Senators who have joined me in this \neffort: Senator Blumenthal, Senator Grassley, Senator Graham, Senator \nBlunt, Senator Johnson, Senator Levin, Senator Murray, and Senator \nMoran, have cosponsored this resolution recognizing and supporting the \ngoals of National Adoption Month and in a variety of different ways, \nnot only by passing this resolution, which we hope will be hotlined \nsometime in the very near future, to go through the Senate and the \nHouse, but by participating in a variety of different events at home \nand here in Washington to raise awareness and call attention to the \nneeds of so many.\n  First of all, call attention and raise the awareness that there are \nin fact orphans in America, children whose parental rights have been \nterminated, or children who literally lost both parents and do not have \nan able or willing relative and are in great need of a family. The \nPresiding Officer knows these children as he has been very active in \nthe issue of child welfare.\n\n  So we have several events throughout this month. One of them is \nNational Adoption Day. That is going to take place this month, always \nthe Saturday before Thanksgiving, where, happily, thousands of \nchildren--I think last year we had over 4,000, and since 2000, when it \nstarted, over 40,000 children have moved from foster care to a forever \nfamily on adoption day, which is quite a happy celebration. I have \nattended several of them myself with my local judges. There is nothing \nmore exciting than a packed room of parents and grandparents and aunts \nand uncles and sometimes siblings waiting to receive these young \nchildren in some cases, and teenagers in some cases, and even young \nadults in some cases being adopted.\n  I like to say one is never too old to need a family. There are \nholidays that happen every year. With whom do we celebrate those? There \nare joys and setbacks in life that occur throughout every decade of a \nperson's life. A person needs a family there with them. I am of the \nopinion that a person is never too old to be adopted. In fact, I have \nknown individuals adopted in their twenties and thirties. I actually \nmet a woman from California, as crazy as this might sound, who was \nadopted in her forties because she was reunited with a woman who used \nto care for her when she was very young. She grew up in foster care, \namazingly became very successful, but when they were reunited, they \nloved each other as they had 40 years earlier and decided to become a \nfamily. It is a bonding of love through adoption.\n  My husband Frank and I are proud to be the parents of extraordinary \nchildren who happen to be adopted. We built our family through \nadoption. My husband was adopted out of an orphanage from Ireland when \nhe was 5 years old. He still remembers the day when the matron of this \nlittle Protestant home for children came up to him and said: Ernest--\nthat was his name--pack your bags. Your mom and dad are here to take \nyou home. He walked to the front of the orphanage and saw his adoptive \nmother and father, brother and sister, and the rest is history. He came \nto America, received an excellent education, and has gone on to be a \nwonderful citizen and, of course, a great father and a loving husband. \nI am so grateful for that opportunity for him.\n  I think about the millions of children in orphanages where no one \never knocks on their door to say your mother and father are here to \ntake you home. No one ever comes to call for them. No one ever provides \nthem an opportunity for loving arms and a comforting and safe place.\n  That is why we fight. That is why we debate. Happily, we never fight \nabout this among ourselves because there is so much unity in the Senate \nand in this Congress about promoting adoption. It is one of the issues \nwhere there is virtually no partisan view.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for joining me in the resolution. We \nwant to recognize this day, the Saturday before Thanksgiving, as \nNational Adoption Day. I thank the hundreds of cities and hundreds of \norganizations, hundreds of communities that are going to be celebrating \nNational Adoption Day, where groups of children--sometimes dozens, \nsometimes hundreds of children--will, in fact, be adopted on National \nAdoption Day, and I thank those who started this day many years ago.\n  We want to remember November as the month. It began in 1995 under \nPresident Clinton and his then-First Lady Hillary Clinton, both of whom \nput such an emphasis on adoption. This is one of their initiatives that \nhas gone on and on and has become bigger and bigger and we are excited \nabout it.\n  Let me say for the record again that there are over 400,000 children \nin foster care in America today, and over 100,000 of them are, in fact, \norphans. Their parents are either deceased or the parental rights were \nterminated. Many of these children have siblings who are still looking \nand hoping to be matched with families. The great thing people might \nnot realize since our efforts of almost 15 years ago is that we have \nincreased the number of adoptions in\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\nAmerica out of foster care from 14,000 children a year out of 100,000 \n15 years ago, and from 500,000 to 700,000 in foster care currently. We \nhave reduced the number of children in foster care which overall is \nvery good but, most importantly, we have substantially increased the \nnumber of children adopted from 14,000 to 50,000 a year. So we are \nmoving in the right direction, but we will not rest until we have \nplaced every child with a responsible and loving family to call their \nown forever.\n  The sad news--and I have to unfortunately have a little sad point of \nthis speech--is that internationally the numbers are going in the wrong \ndirection. America used to adopt about 20,000 children a year from \naround the world. We are the largest receiving country on Earth. \nAmericans feel strongly, Americans of all races and backgrounds and \nreligious affiliations feel strongly that children should be raised in \nfamilies. Americans have such open hearts and room in their hearts and \nin their homes for children and through many of our faith-based \norganizations have stepped up to adopt. Unfortunately, policies within \nour own executive branch of government and decisions that are being \nmade are constricting the number of children who are eligible for \nadoption or who are being adopted by Americans, and that number has \nfallen dramatically, unfortunately, from about 20,000 children down to \n9,000 children. I am going to redouble my efforts every year to find \nthe problem areas and identify them, whether something has to be \nchanged legislatively or whether some additional funding can be found \nto increase efforts not just by the Federal Government but States and \nlocal governments and nonprofits. We are going to turn the corner and \naccelerate this situation.\n  Let me conclude by showing some wonderful examples of families who \nhave stepped up. First, this is the Morrison family. Fran is from \nLouisiana. She has fostered over 22 children. She is a professional. \nThis is what she does in her professional life. She has fostered 22 \nchildren. But these five she has adopted out of the dozens of children \nwhom she has fostered. This one little baby, the latest one whom she \nadopted, has a very special need. He was shaken as an infant. He was \nborn completely healthy, but because an adult lost their temper and \ndidn't know what to do--adults sometimes may shake infants because they \nare angry, because children cry when they are hungry or they are cold \nor they are tired, and sometimes adults don't like to hear that crying. \nSometimes babies get shaken or thrown against walls, and that is what \nhappened to this little child. This child is seriously disabled but has \nnow been adopted by Fran Morrison, and she says she has been blessed. \nThe Lord led her to become a foster parent and then, just one step at a \ntime, she became an adoptive mom. As we can see, she has her hands very \nfull, but she has a great heart and she, similar to so many other \nAmericans, is trying to make a way for these children and give them a \nplace.\n\n  The next family is the Roberts family. Former foster youth Marchelle \nRoberts was one of my interns in my office just last year, so this is \nsuch a personal and touching story. She was a former participant in our \nfoster youth intern program. Her parent is Lisa Roberts from Camden, \nNJ. She is adopted. Marchelle is now 22 years old and is attending \nTemple University studying broadcast journalism. Besides Marchelle, her \nmother has adopted four other children out of foster care. What an \nextraordinary family, built by a mom who just had a great heart, had \nthe will and the opportunity to adopt these four beautiful girls, and \nthey are now a wonderful family, truly loving the children to help them \nsucceed in a world they were born into that had a very sad beginning \nbut a very happy ending.\n  The third family I wish to share with my colleagues is the Johnson \nfamily. This is Senator Thune's 2012 Angel. The parents are Ryan and \nAmber Johnson from Sioux Falls, SD. Two boys were adopted out of foster \ncare. They have one biological child, a little girl. These two little \nboys were adopted out of foster care. What a beautiful family and what \na way to build a family. That is what I am saying; that I wish we could \neliminate every barrier. There are cultural barriers. There are \nfinancial barriers. There are legal barriers. If we could just \neliminate those barriers and let Americans do what they do best, which \nis to love children, we would be a lot better off. So this is a \nbeautiful family from Sioux Falls, SD.\n  Our next family is the Duhon family. The parents, Troy and Tracy \nDuhon, are from New Orleans. I know this family well and I am very \nproud of them. Their little adopted child Annahstasia Grace was born in \nChina last year. They have three biological children, but they traveled \nto China just last month to pick up this little baby girl. They have \nwaited for her for quite some time. We are very grateful that the \nChinese Government has been cooperative. China is placing more children \ndomestically, which is good, because many years ago they didn't have \nany process for domestic adoption. Of course, with their one-child \npolicy, there were literally millions of children in orphanages, many \nlittle girls because they weren't as valued as little boys. But now \nthat is changing. China is doing more domestic adoptions, but there are \nstill children who need to have loving parents and many of them are \nfinding them in the United States.\n  Then, finally, the last family is Jake and Amy Glover from Hays, KS. \nThey have four adopted children, three from Haiti and one from China. \nWhat a cute holiday card this is going to be for all their friends who \nwill receive it. Since adopting three children from Haiti, the Glovers \nare committed to raising awareness about the many daily challenges \nfaced by the Haitians postearthquake. So not only did these individuals \nturn out to be great parents for these children, but they also--I know \nbecause I talk to so many of them--help these children understand and \nappreciate and respect the culture from which they came, and it builds \nawareness in America about the greatness of our whole planet. Of \ncourse, we are proud of America, but there are many other countries \nwhere these children come from, and I know the adoptive parents are \nvery respectful of the sending countries.\n  So on behalf of the children who are still waiting, I hope people who \nhave heard this can respond in some way. There are many opportunities \nfor people to reach out to our national organizations, nonprofits, \nchurches in communities, and people can always go to our Web site and \nwe have some additional information about how to connect if people are \nthinking about how to adopt or people who want to support the work of \nadoption and preservation of families such as these.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to pass S. Res. 595 as quickly as \npossible. I thank those colleagues who have joined with me in \ncosponsoring this. We wish everybody a great day on Saturday for \nNational Adoption Day, and we look forward to the continued work to \npromote laws and policies that help every child find a forever family.\n  Thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/15/senate-section/article/S6848-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I rise today to salute Campbellsville \nUniversity in Campbellsville, KY, for what is quite a long list of \nachievements they have received recently. Campbellsville athletics has \ntaken the country by storm. Recently, four Campbellsville students won \nnational championships in track and field, and the Campbellsville men's \ntennis team won a national championship. A school would be proud of \nhaving any one of these winning student-athletes as part of its \nnumber--for Campbellsville University to have them all is quite a feat.\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\n  Campbellsville's mascot is the Tigers, and the school is part of the \nNational Christian College Athletic Association. Four students on the \nTigers track and field team won five individual national titles this \nyear. P.J. Randles won the triple-jump title at the NCCAA Men's Indoor \nTrack & Field National Championships in February. Tiana Benjamin won \nthe javelin title at the NCCAA Women's Outdoor Track & Field National \nChampionships in May. Nathelie Zetrenne won the 100-meter hurdles title \nat the NCCAA Women's Outdoor Track & Field National Championships this \nMay. And Tiosha Beasley won both the long-jump and triple-jump titles \nat the NCCAA Women's Outdoor Track & Field National Championships in \nMay.\n  P.J. Randles is the first student at Campbellsville to win an indoor \ntrack and field national title. Tiana Benjamin is the first women's \ntrack and field athlete to win a national title. And Tiosha Beasley was \nalso an NAIA All-American at both the NAIA Indoor National \nChampionships and NAIA Outdoor National Championships.\n  The four women's national titles are the most individual national \ntitles won in one meet by any sport. They are also the most individual \nnational titles of any sports program at Campbellsville University. \nSince 2009, Campbellsville's men's and women's track and field has won \neight individual NCCAA national titles.\n  On top of these achievements are the tennis champions. The \nCampbellsville Tigers men's tennis team are the 2012 National Christian \nCollege Athletic Association national champions, and they are the first \nTigers' program to win a team national championship, after the school \nreached the semifinals in 2009 and 2010. They swept through the NCCAA \nTournament in Mobile, Ala., with a 5-0 record in the tournament after \nfinishing the 2012 season with a school-record 19 wins and a 19-7 \noverall record.\n  In addition to its NCCAA championship, this is the first time a \nCampbellsville University men's tennis qualified for the NAIA \nTournament as a team. The team finished runner-up in the Mid-South \nConference.\n  I want to particularly congratulate head coach Kyle Caven, who was \nhonored as the Mid-South Conference Coach of the Year and NCCAA \nNational Coach of the Year. Several tennis team members received honors \nas well. Carlos Anton was named to the NAIA All-America Second Team and \nthe NCCAA All-America First Team. Pablo Numbela and Sebastian Marot \nwere named to the NCCAA All-America First Team. Pontus Blom, Zac \nMaylon, and Alberto Diaz were all named to the NCCAA All-America Second \nTeam. John Harbold was named a Mid-South Conference Champion of \nCharacter.\n  The assistant coaches were Kelly Anderson and Phil Carlisle. The team \nalso includes Terry Caven, Austin Colvier, Alfredo Bencid, David \nCastillo, Tyler Hyatt, Bradley Jeffries, Chase Padgett, and Austin \nSpalding.\n  Campbellsville University is a leading Christian university of more \nthan 3,500 students that is dedicated to educating its students and \npreparing them to be servant leaders. Their excellence in athletics is \nonly matched by their dedication to instilling character and a love of \nlearning. I want to congratulate Campbellsville University president \nDr. Michael V. Carter, the school's faculty and staff, the athletics \ndepartment, and all these wonderful student athletes for representing \nthe very best of what Kentucky has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/15/senate-section/article/S6849-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, each November we \nrecognize National Native American Heritage Month to honor the \ntradition, culture, contributions, achievements, and sacrifices of \nthose that originally inhabited this great Nation. With over five \nmillion individuals of Native American descent in the United States, it \nis important to celebrate the instrumental impact Native American \nculture has had on American history. National Native American Heritage \nMonth is an opportunity to focus our attention on the beliefs of tribal \nsovereignty by ensuring trust responsibilities and strengthening \ngovernment-to-government relationships with tribes across the Nation.\n  Representing a State that is home to nine treaty tribes, this month \nhas added significance to me. I would like to personally acknowledge \nand honor South Dakota's nine treaty tribes: the Cheyenne River Sioux, \nthe Crow Creek Sioux, the Flandreau Santee Sioux, the Lower Brule \nSioux, the Oglala Sioux, the Rosebud Sioux, the Sisseton-Wahpeton \nOyate, the Standing Rock Sioux, and the Yankton Sioux. South Dakota \ngreatly benefits from the rich heritage and culture each tribe brings \nto our State.\n  It is fitting that President Obama has declared November 23, 2012, \nthe day after Thanksgiving, as Native American Heritage Day in an \neffort to fully appreciate the legacy American Indian culture has had \non our Nation since its infancy. I am pleased we have honored our \nNative American Indian and Alaska Native people with a day, week, and \nmonth of observance every year since 1976.\n  During this month's commemoration, we must not only celebrate our \nNative American Indian and Alaska Native's past, but also emphasize \nwhere improvements are needed for their future well-being. I am proud \nthe Indian Affairs Committee has recently approved my legislation to \nreauthorize the Native American Languages Preservation Act, and I hope \nmy colleagues will consider this important measure, as it is critical \nto preserve Native languages that have long influenced our history and \nculture. We should promote diversity rather than suppress it, as the \nfoundation of the United States is built on diverse cultures and \nbackgrounds. While we pause to recognize the strong contributions our \ntribes have made to this Nation, the Federal government must uphold its \nresponsibilities to our tribal communities.\n  I hope students around the United States take the opportunity this \nmonth to learn about the Thanksgiving story from the American Indian \npoint of view. By observing and celebrating National Native American \nHeritage Month, we are reaffirming our Nation's respect for American \nIndian people. I would like to acknowledge and praise the more than \n70,000 American Indians in South Dakota who bring a unique and \nenriching culture to our communities. I urge everyone in America to \nparticipate in our celebration of American Indians, not only during the \nmonth of November, but through a daily commitment to advancing the \nquality of life of American Indians, in an effort for our Nation to \nmove forward with strength and resolve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/15/senate-section/article/S6849-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6849-S6850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Paul Davis, \nwho passed away in his home on Sunday, September 23, 2012, at the age \nof 74. He was an award-winning journalist whose contributions to the \njournalism industry him the deepest respect from his peers and \ncommunity. I am grateful that I was able to call Paul a longtime friend \nand mourn his passing.\n  Born on September 3, 1938 in Clanton, AL, Paul enjoyed a long career \nas not only a journalist and publisher, but as an advocate for those \nwho did not have a voice. He served as the owner and publisher of the \nAuburn Bulletin and Tuskegee News for 25 years and for many years \nauthored a Sunday column in the Opelika-Auburn News. Under his watch, \nthe Auburn Bulletin and Tuskegee News won dozens of awards for their \nquality news coverage.\n  One of Paul's greatest achievements was his impeccable reporting on \ncases of negligence and abuse of mentally disabled patients at the \nPartlow School and Bryce Hospital for the mentally ill. His stories on \nthese injustices led to a decision by the Federal court that required \npatients with disabilities receive an equal standard of care. For this \nwork he was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and appointed by Governor \nBob Riley to the Alabama Department of Mental Health Board of \nDirectors.\n  Throughout his life and established career, Paul was honored with \nnumerous awards, among them the Alabama Press Association's Lifetime \nAchievement Award, the Community Service Journalism Award from Auburn \nUniversity, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alabama Disabilities \nAdvocacy Program, and the Meritorious Service Award from the Auburn \nUniversity Chapter of the American Association of University \nProfessors.\n  Outside of the newspaper business, Paul was one of the founding \nmembers of the Food Bank of Lee County and served as the president of \nthe organization for 2 years. He continued to serve on its board as it \nexpanded into five additional counties. He was also a member of the \nAuburn Church of Christ.\n  Paul was one of my most trusted friends. An outstanding writer, \nthorough reporter, and advocate for the less fortunate, he was a man of \nthe highest integrity and was an inspiration to me and to many in the \njournalism and mental health communities. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith his family and friends, especially his wife, Gayle, his children, \nAlan, Susan, and Chris, and his stepchildren, Roger, Keith, and Scott, \nas they mourn the loss of this irreplaceable man.\n  Paul's legacy will no doubt live on in the community and in the \nhearts of those who knew him. His contributions to journalism in \nAlabama and to the causes that he believed in will forever be \nremembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/15/senate-section/article/S6850-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               RECOGNIZING THE JUNEAU EMPIRE'S CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the Juneau Empire, a Morris Communications publication \nthat has been providing news to southeast Alaska since long before \nAlaska secured statehood. The newspaper was established in 1912, a year \nbefore Alaska's territorial legislature first convened. Originally \ncalled the Alaska Daily Empire, this newspaper has documented Alaska \nhistory as it happened and continues to be a reliable, prominent source \nof information.\n  The city and borough of Juneau is the capital of Alaska and covers \nmore area than the entire State of Delaware. The Juneau Empire is an \nimportant chronicler of government and tribal affairs in this city \naccessible only by airplane or ferry. For decades, there have been \nefforts to move the capital closer to Anchorage, and the Empire has \nbeen a strong and successful advocate of preserving Juneau's status as \nAlaska's capital. In a State with such vast geographic distances, \nresponsible and accurate news reporting from the capital is imperative, \nand the Juneau Empire has risen to that challenge time after time.\n  Over the years, contributors to the Juneau Empire have won journalism \nawards from the Alaska Press Club and the Society of Professional \nJournalism. Past editors and leadership at the paper have included \nterritorial governors and other prominent political figures in Alaska \nhistory, making the Empire an historical figure in its own right.\n  As media has changed, so has the Juneau Empire. Its graceful \ntransition into the digital age has kept the publication relevant and \naccessible. While Alaska develops and builds a national and global \npresence, the importance of reliable news and information about our \ngreat State is vital. Today, I honor the hard work and dedication of \nthe many Alaskans who have worked for and contributed to the Juneau \nEmpire over the past century. I hope the Empire will be documenting \nhistory for another 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/15/senate-section/article/S6850-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JACKIE KERBY MOORE\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

The park has also been recognized with Public/\nPrivate Partnership Awards from the New Mexico State Land Office, Mid-\nRegion Council of Governments, and the International Economic \nDevelopment Council.\n  Moore serves as an advocate for New Mexico State University and lends \nher expertise for the advancement of the Arrowhead Research Park.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nfour national winners of the Council for Advancement and Support of \nEducation and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's \n2012 United States Professors of the Year Award. Since 1981, this \nprogram has saluted outstanding undergraduate instructors throughout \nthe country. In addition to the national winners, a State Professor of \nthe Year was also recognized in 31 States. New York's 2012 State winner \nis Rees Shad, who is coordinator of the Media Design Programs at Hostos \nCommunity College of the City University of New York.\n  These awards are recognized as one of the most prestigious honors \nbestowed upon a professor. To be nominated for this award requires \ndedication to the art of education and excellence in every aspect of \nthe profession. Professors personally vested in each student shape the \nleaders of tomorrow. These individuals and every one of us should be \nproud of their accomplishment.\n  I am also particularly proud that one of the four national winners is \nfrom my State of New York. Professor Todd Pagano, associate professor \nand director of the Laboratory Science Technology Program at the \nNational Technical Institute for the Deaf at the Rochester Institute of \nTechnology, is the 2012 Outstanding Master's Universities and Colleges \nProfessor of the Year. In recognizing Professor Pagano, judges admired \nTodd Pagano's program for deaf students in laboratory science \ntechnology, which he helped to design, implement, and lead, coupled \nwith the opportunities he has created for undergraduate research and \ninternships that are critical to his students' success. Not only has \nProfessor Pagano helped open up a new profession for an under-\nrepresented group, but he is also a scholar of science education for \ndeaf students, an editor of a leading journal in the field, and an \nadvocate in the professional chemistry community for students, \nscientists and technicians with special needs.\n  We need more professors and educators like Todd Pagano. He is a \nnative of Rochester, NY, and decided to come home to educate the next \ngeneration of New Yorkers and Americans. He has instilled not only a \nlove and passion for science, but he has given hope and direction to \nstudents who are deaf or hard of hearing. His work typifies the high \neducational standards at National Technical Institute for the Deaf, \nwhich is a stellar institution that leads the Nation in the technical \neducation of all students, especially those that are deaf or hard of \nhearing.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing and \nthanking Professor Pagano and all the winners for their leadership and \npassion for educating.

A bill to provide for the unencumbering of title to non-\nFederal land owned by the city of Anchorage, Alaska, for purposes of \neconomic development by conveyance of the Federal reversion interest to \nthe City; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto clear the title to three small parcels of land owned by the \nMunicipality of Anchorage, in Alaska, my home State, so that the land \ncan be put to more productive uses in the future.\n  At different times between 1922 and 1982, these three parcels of \nland, located in downtown Anchorage, comprising 2.65 acres in total, \nwere conveyed to either the former ``City of Anchorage'' or more \nrecently the ``Municipality of Anchorage.'' They were transferred by \nthe Federal government to the local government for a wide variety of \nspecific purposes, but all were transferred for the overarching purpose \nof helping the then nascent City of Anchorage, which was, and largely \nstill is, surrounded by Federal lands, have sufficient land resources \nto provide municipal services to the growing community. For reasons \nthat made sense decades ago, all of the deeds for these properties \ncontain reversionary clauses, that should the land not be used for \nvarious general ``municipal purposes'' their ownership would revert to \nthe Federal Government. The problem is that in each case, the tracts \nare no longer useful for the purposes originally intended, the lands \nare not needed by the Federal Government, the public purpose for which \nthe reversion clause was put in price has long ago been fulfilled, and \nin any case, if they\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nwere to be returned to the federal estate, it would cost the Federal \nGovernment substantial sums to maintain the properties or prepare them \nfor future sale.\n  These small tracts are not practical for the federal government to \nrepossess for several reasons: the Federal Government is barely able to \nmanage all the land it currently owns in Alaska, including in \nAnchorage, let alone adding small tracts to burden its responsibility. \nAfter more than 50 years since the Statehood Act, and more than 40 \nyears since the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act's passage, the \nState and our Native People still have not received final patent to all \ntheir lands. The public purposes for which the Federal reversionary \nclauses were put in place have been met. These clauses were added to \ninsure that during its earlier, developmental stages, Anchorage would \nuse the federal land conveyed to it to build the city and the municipal \nand public infrastructure of the community. After decades of dedicated \npublic use of these properties, the ``public purpose'' basis for the \nclauses has been fulfilled. For these properties, my legislation \naddresses the question of how long is long enough for a reversionary \nclause to have served its purpose, by recognizing that after decades of \nliving up to its obligations under what are now outdated restrictions \nfrom the last century, it's time to let the city move forward with its \nvision for the new one. The commercial use of the properties will add \nto the public municipal treasury, and to the Federal treasury, hence \ncontinuing the public benefit of the lands, albeit in a different way.\n  In 1922 the City of Anchorage received a number of properties around \nAnchorage for municipal/school purposes. One of the properties was the \n1.93-acre site in Block 42 downtown that since the early 1980s has been \nthe site of the William A. Egan Convention Center. With the completion \nin 2010 of the larger Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center, the tract \nis surplus to municipal needs, and could best be utilized for sale to \nthe private sector that would then be best able to afford the cost of \nconversion of the property for future use, adding to the Federal income \ntax base and local property tax base.\n  The second tract is a lot of .48 acres at Seventh and I Streets \ndowntown, currently being used as a municipal parking lot. The land, \nobtained by the city as part of a 1982 land exchange that cleared the \nsite for a major office building across the street, is too small for \nmunicipal or federal office space use, or for park construction, but \nmight be properly sized for a commercial enterprise. It is zoned for \nbusiness, but cannot be used for business that would contribute to the \nlocal property tax based or federal income tax base, because of the \ninability of the Municipality to sell the property due to the federal \nreversion clause.\n  The third site at the corner of H Street and Christiansen Drive, .24 \nacres in size and obtained by the city in 1963, again is too small for \nmunicipal or federal office space, and unneeded for park space, but \nmight be of use for a retail establishment given its location near a \nmunicipal parking facility. Likewise, it is zoned for business/\ncommercial, but cannot be used and potentially contribute to the local \nand federal tax bases due to the federal reversion requirement. It \ncurrently sits vacant and idle.\n  In all cases, the best municipal use of the lands would be for sale \nto provide revenues to the Municipality of Anchorage that could be used \nfor provision of municipal social services. In each case, reversion of \nthe lands to the federal government would result in federal ownership \nof tracts unneeded for federal purposes, but lands that would produce \ngreater conveyance and management costs to the federal treasury than \nare likely to be recovered through fair market sales.\n  The Municipality of Anchorage and its Mayor Daniel Sullivan have \nasked that the reversionary clauses be repealed on the three tracts, \nthe city absorbing all costs connected with surveying, recording and \nother costs connected with the properties. In these cases, lifting of \nthe reversionary clauses on three of the literally thousands of acres \nconveyed to Anchorage, partially as a result of the Alaska Statehood \nAct, makes for good land use, and economic and public policy sense for \nboth the local government and the Federal Government. The Municipality \nof Anchorage has already established 223 parks containing 82 \nplaygrounds and 250 miles of trails, encompassing 10,946 acres inside \nits boundaries. There is no shortage of park and open space in the \nmunicipality. There is no public policy purpose in the 21st Century not \nto permit these very limited Federal reversion extinguishments.\n  Passage of this act would cost the Federal Government nothing, but \nwould aid the citizens of Anchorage by allowing lands to be put on the \ncity's tax rolls. I am introducing this bill now to allow plenty of \ntime for everyone to review the merits of this bill prior to hopefully \nserious consideration of this issue in the 113th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 3635. A bill to provide incentives for States to invest in \npractices and technology that are designed to expedite voting at the \npolls and to simplify voter registration; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, like so many Americans, I stayed up late \nlast Tuesday night to watch the election returns come in.\n  It was 11:38 pm on the East Coast when the Associated Press called \nthe election for President Obama, but at that late hour, Andre Murias, \nan 18-year-old first-time voter in Miami-Dade County, Florida, was \nstill waiting in line to cast his ballot. Andre had been in line at the \nSouth Kendall Community Church for nearly five hours by the time he \nvoted, just before midnight. Five hours--that is appalling. Yet, some \nFlorida voters waited even longer--as much as 7 or 8 hours--during the \nState's condensed early-voting period.\n  Rashell Hobbs, another first-time voter, waited for five hours in \nChesapeake, Virginia. ``This is just horrible,'' Rashell said. ``There \nis no reason it should take this long.''\n  Rashell, I agree.\n  Voting machine irregularities were experienced in States across the \ncountry by voters of both political parties. In Colorado, voters said \nthey checked the box on the touchscreen panel to vote for Mitt Romney, \nbut that the machine kept switching their pick to President Obama, \nwhile in Pennsylvania, voters reported the same problem in reverse, \nthat their selection of President Obama was registered as a vote for \nGovernor Romney.\n  It wasn't just new technology that caused issues. Poll-watchers in \nDavidson County, Tennessee, could only stand by as would-be voters saw \nthe long line of people waiting to cast their ballots and drove away. \nIn Philadelphia, long-time registered voters who showed up to cast \ntheir ballots discovered their names simply weren't on the rolls any \nmore.\n  More than a dozen states, including Ohio, Wisconsin, South Carolina, \nNew York and Montana, experienced some kind of breakdown in the \nadministration of their elections.\n  This is the United States of America. The right to vote is in our \nDNA. We have to get this right.\n  That is why today, I am introducing the Fair, Accurate, Secure and \nTimely Voting Act of 2012--the FAST Voting Act.\n  Making it harder for citizens to vote is a violation of voters' civil \nrights. Long lines are a form of voter disenfranchisement. Running out \nof ballots is a form of voter suppression. The fact is, access is \ndenied when registration is cut off months before the election and \nwhere early vote and vote-by-mail options are not widely available. \nThis particularly matters for the men and women of our armed services, \nwho are currently stationed overseas and have no choice but to vote by \nmail.\n  As widespread as the problem is, there are States that are getting it \nright. These states continue to be laboratories of democracy, and we \nneed to learn from them.\n  The FAST Voting Act creates a competitive grant program in the model \nof Race to the Top, which has encouraged states to aggressively pursue \neducation reform. The states that demonstrated the most comprehensive \nand promising reform plans win a greater portion of the grant funding.\n  Instead of spurring education reform, the FAST Voting Act would \ninspire election reform.\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\n  This bill authorizes a federal program that would award grants based \non how well states improve access to the ballot in at least nine ways: \nflexible registration opportunities, including same-day registration; \nearly voting, at a minimum of 9 of the 10 calendar days preceding an \nelection; no-excuse absentee voting; assistance to voters who do not \nspeak English as a primary language or who have disabilities, including \nvisual impairment; effective access to voting for members of the armed \nservices; formal training of election officials, including State and \ncounty administrators and volunteers; audited and reduced waiting times \nat the poorest performing polling stations; contingency plans for \nvoting in the event of a natural or other disaster, such as Superstorm \nSandy, which impacted voting in New York and New Jersey, and would have \nonly needed to take a slight turn to dramatically impact my home State \nof Delaware.\n  The stakes are high, and the importance of achieving these electoral \nreforms is paramount. When tens of thousands, or even hundreds of \nthousands, of Americans have their right to vote denied or compromised, \nwe have to take action.\n  The implications of these voting irregularities are felt far beyond \nour shores. I am the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee \non African Affairs, and I worked and studied in South Africa during its \napartheid regime. One of the most inspiring sights I have ever seen was \nduring the first ever free and fair election in that nation, when South \nAfricans stood in line for up to two days to cast their votes. Members \nof our subcommittee meet regularly with African heads of State, and all \nof us, Democrats and Republicans alike, stress with these leaders the \nvital importance of free and fair elections. So when we still have \nsubstantial voting issues in our own elections, that is a cause for \ndeep concern.\n  We have the opportunity to send a message to first time voters here \nat home, as well as those fighting for democracy overseas, that every \nvote counts and every voter will be counted.\n  When States prevent their citizens from exercising their fundamental \nright of ballot access, whether deliberately through the law or \nregulations, or accidentally because of incompetence or lack of \npreparedness, it is a violation of voters' civil rights.\n  The FAST Voting Act is one way to try to fix our elections and make \nsure what happened across our country last week does not happen again. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues of both parties to move \nthis important solution forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague and \nfriend, the Senator from Delaware, Chris Coons, in introducing \nlegislation that would make voting faster and more accessible to all \nvoters. Here we are, barely a week after a historic election in 2012. I \ncan't speak about North Carolina, but in Virginia it is remarkable that \nin 2012 people had to wait for hours in line to vote. In Prince William \nCounty, folks waited for up to 3 hours. In Chesapeake, VA, folks waited \nfor up to 4 hours. It was remarkable that it was 5 days after the fact \nbefore we even knew the results in Florida. In the 21st century, in the \ngreatest democracy in the world, voting should not be this much of a \nburden.\n  In many ways, when you have those kinds of extraordinary lines, \nparticularly when you are working, what we have in effect created is a \n21st-century poll tax. Those of us in the South have a history where \npoll taxes were used to restrict voters. What you in effect have by \nhaving these extensive lines is when, if you work on an hourly basis or \ncan only get off a bit of time, you cannot afford to wait 3, 4, or 5 \nhours in line to vote.\n  This legislation, the Fair, Accurate, Secure and Timely Voting Act of \n2012--the so-called FAST Act--creates a competitive grant program to \nencourage States to aggressively pursue election reforms. It would \nprovide incentives for States such as Virginia to invest in practices \nand technology designed to expedite voting at the polls and simplify \nvoter registration.\n  The FAST Voting Act addresses this issue in a responsible way. It \ndoesn't add new mandates; it authorizes simply additional resources for \nthose States which step up with commonsense reforms to make voting \nfaster and more accessible to voters. This is a relatively very small \nprogram, but a few dollars spent to both improve the access and \nincrease the number of voting machines at those polling places which \nare so restricted would, I believe, remove some of the embarrassment \nVirginia and so many other States saw last week when people had to wait \nso long.\n  I encourage Virginia's elected leaders to embrace this opportunity to \nimprove access for Virginia voters, who should not have to wait in line \nfor hours to exercise their most basic constitutional right--the right \nto vote.\n  As I mentioned, this bill authorizes a Federal program that would \naward grants based on how well applicant States--again, States will be \nthe decisionmakers on whether they would want to apply for this \nprogram--are able to improve access to the polls in at least nine \nspecific ways. Let me mention three of those.\n  No. 1, provide absentee voting, including no-excuse absentee voting. \nWe in Virginia still have restrictions on absentee voting.\n  No. 2, provide assistance to voters who do not speak English as a \nprimary language. Virginia and North Carolina and other States are \nbecoming more diverse, and we need to accommodate those voters.\n  No. 3, audit and reduce waiting time in polling stations. No one in \nthe 21st century should have to wait 4 or 5 or, as in some reported \ncases in Florida, up to 7 or 8 hours to vote.\n  This voluntary grant program also requires the establishment of \nperformance measures and reporting requirements to ensure a State's \nprogress in eliminating statutory, regulatory, procedural, and other \nbarriers to expedited voting and accessible voter registration.\n  This is a relatively small bill. I commend my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Coons, for taking the lead. I join him as a \ncosponsor. Regardless of which side of the aisle you stand on in 2012--\nand surely before 2016--we ought not to have a repeat of this 21st-\ncentury poll tax that is imposed on folks all across America by not \nbeing able to exercise their vote, having to pay too high a price, or \nhaving the kind of embarrassment where it takes us literally days and \ndays for the public to get the results.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/15/senate-section/article/S6858-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 597--TO PERMIT THE COLLECTION OF CLOTHING, TOYS, \nFOOD, AND HOUSEWARES DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES \n                          IN SENATE BUILDINGS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 490\n\n       Whereas Brittany Wilkinson, the first Youth Ambassador of \n     the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, joined other \n     Youth Ambassadors of the United Mitochondrial Disease \n     Foundation in working tirelessly to raise awareness about \n     mitochondrial diseases;\n       Whereas mitochondrial diseases result from a defect that \n     reduces the ability of the mitochondria in a cell to produce \n     energy;\n       Whereas, as mitochondria fail to produce enough energy, \n     cells cease to function properly and eventually die, leading \n     to the failure of organ systems and possibly the death of the \n     affected individuals;\n       Whereas mitochondrial diseases can present themselves at \n     any age, and mortality rates vary depending upon the \n     particular disease;\n       Whereas the most severe mitochondrial diseases result in \n     the progressive loss of function in multiple organs, \n     including the loss of neurological and muscle function, and \n     death within several years;\n       Whereas mitochondrial diseases are a relatively newly \n     identified group of diseases, first recognized in the late \n     1960s, and diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases is extremely \n     difficult;\n       Whereas there are more than 100 identified primary \n     mitochondrial diseases, but researchers believe there are \n     several hundred other types of unidentified mitochondrial \n     diseases and further research is necessary to help identify \n     those diseases;\n       Whereas mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with many \n     diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, \n     amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism, diabetes, cancer, and \n     many other diseases associated with aging;\n       Whereas research into primary mitochondrial diseases can \n     provide applications to biomedical research and a window into \n     our understanding of many other diseases, including possible \n     treatments and cures for diseases such as Parkinson's \n     disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, \n     autism, diabetes, cancer, and many other diseases associated \n     with aging;\n       Whereas researchers estimate that one in 4,000 children \n     will develop a mitochondrial disease related to an inherited \n     mutation by 10 years of age, and recent studies of umbilical \n     cord blood samples show that one in 200 people could develop \n     a mitochondrial disease in their lifetime;\n       Whereas researchers also believe that those numbers could \n     be much higher, given the difficulty associated with \n     diagnosing mitochondrial disease and the many cases that are \n     either misdiagnosed or never diagnosed;\n       Whereas there are no cures for mitochondrial diseases, nor \n     are there specific treatments for any of those diseases;\n       Whereas human energy production involves multiple organ \n     systems, and therefore primary mitochondrial diseases \n     research involves many Institutes at the National Institutes \n     of Health;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, \n     more than $600,000,000 is being spent on research related to \n     mitochondrial functions, of which $18,000,000\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\n     is being spent on actual primary mitochondrial diseases \n     research;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health has taken an \n     increased interest in primary mitochondrial diseases and has \n     sponsored a number of activities in recent years aimed at \n     advancing mitochondrial medicine, including incorporating \n     research into functional variations in mitochondria in the \n     Transformative Research Awards Initiative;\n       Whereas, in March 2012, the National Institutes of Health \n     convened a 2-day symposium entitled ``Translational Research \n     in Primary Mitochondrial Diseases: Obstacles and \n     Opportunities'', which brought together leading government \n     and private sector researchers and drug developers to share \n     information related to primary mitochondrial diseases, \n     develop systems to facilitate future collaboration, survey \n     obstacles, needs, and priorities of primary mitochondrial \n     diseases research, and develop mechanisms to enhance \n     translation of basic science discoveries to diagnostics and \n     therapeutics; and\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the symposium, a white paper \n     has been developed that identifies current research \n     challenges and impediments and a suggested course of action \n     to address those challenges: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 16, 2012, as \n     ``Mitochondrial Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) reaffirms the importance of an enhanced and coordinated \n     research effort aimed at improving the understanding of \n     primary mitochondrial diseases and the development of \n     treatments and cures;\n       (3) commends the National Institutes of Health for its \n     efforts to organize the symposium entitled ``Translational \n     Research in Primary Mitochondrial Disease: Obstacles and \n     Opportunities'' to improve the understanding of mitochondrial \n     diseases and to enhance collaboration and chart a course for \n     the future with respect to research on mitochondrial \n     diseases;\n       (4) encourages the National Institutes of Health to place a \n     greater priority on research into primary mitochondrial \n     diseases, to continue to explore the connections between \n     mitochondrial dysfunction and other systemic diseases, and to \n     promote collaboration and coordination among the Institutes \n     of the National Institutes of Health and with other \n     organizations;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 598 submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 598) commending and congratulating \n     the San Francisco Giants for winning the 2012 World Series.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am thrilled, along with my friend \nand fellow Giants fan Senator Boxer, to support a resolution honoring \nMajor League Baseball's 2012 World Series champions, the San Francisco \nGiants.\n  Behind the best starting pitching in baseball, a shutdown bullpen, \nbrilliant defense and timely hitting, our Giants are, once again, kings \nof the baseball world.\n  They defeated the American League Champion Detroit Tigers 4 games to \nnone in the 108th World Series to win their second title in just 3 \nyears.\n  It is the seventh title in the long, storied history of the \nfranchise, and their second since moving to San Francisco in 1958.\n  Indeed, these are truly the glory days of Giants baseball in San \nFrancisco.\n  The 2010 Giants were known as a band of misfits and castoffs who \nshocked the baseball world by winning the Giants' first World Series \ntitle in 56 years.\n  This Giants team can only be described as resilient, a diverse \ncollection of veterans, rookies, and midseason acquisitions who banded \ntogether with a ``never-say-die'' spirit to overcome the greatest of \nodds to win it all.\n  Down two games to none in the best of five Division Series against \nthe Cincinnati Reds, outfielder Hunter Pence gathered his teammates \ntogether before the third game and urged them not to give up, to play \nfor each other, win each moment, and leave it all on the field so they \ncould spend another day together.\n  He was not ready to go home, and neither were the Giants. They won \nthat game and the next two, stunning the Reds and advancing to the \nNational League Championship Series against the defending World Series \nchampion St. Louis Cardinals.\n  In that series, the Giants once again found their backs against the \nwall, down three games to one in the best-of-seven series. In game 5 at \nSt. Louis, Giants pitcher Barry Zito overcame years of adversity to \npitch the game of his life, bringing the series back to San Francisco.\n  The Giants won the next two games to clinch the National League \npennant in front of their loyal and passionate fans.\n  They became the first team in more than 25 years to win six \nelimination games in one postseason.\n  So it was on to the World Series against the Tigers, a formidable \nteam that looked unbeatable to most baseball experts.\n  But with all due respect to the Tigers--and my friends and colleagues \nfrom Michigan--after the adversity they had faced against the Reds and \nthe Cardinals, nothing was going to stop the Giants.\n  In game 1, World Series Most Valuable Player Pablo Sandoval became \njust the fourth player in World Series history to hit three home runs \nin one game as the Giants won 8 to 3.\n  In games 2 and 3, starting pitchers Madison Bumgarner and Ryan\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\nVogelsong were dominant as the Giants both games by a score of 2 to 0.\n  And in the deciding game 4, the Giants rallied as National League \nSeries MVP Marco Scutaro gave the Giants a 4 to 3 lead in the 10th \ninning, knocking home Ryan Theriot with a two-out base hit. In the \nbottom of the inning, Sergio Romo struck out the side and the Giants \nwere champions once again.\n  And what a run it was.\n  The Giants closed out the post-season by winning seven straight \ngames, beating the Cardinals and Tigers by a combined score of 36 to 7 \nwith four shutouts.\n  In the World Series, Giants pitchers limited the Tigers to just six \nruns in four games and held them to a .159 batting average.\n  I congratulate all the Giants players for their heart, determination \nand teamwork.\n  When your backs were up against the wall, you epitomized the best of \nSan Francisco and came together as a team, setting aside egos, \nsacrificing individual glory and battling for each other, one game at a \ntime, until you were the last team standing.\n  I would also like to congratulate president and CEO Larry Baer, \ngeneral manager Brian Sabean, manager Bruce Bochy and the rest of the \ncoaching staff for putting together this team and establishing a \nculture of excellence that is the envy of all of baseball.\n  Mr. President, I was privileged to be mayor of San Francisco when the \n49ers--led by Eddie DeBartolo, Bill Walsh, Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott and \nmany others--began their run of five Super Bowl titles that established \nthe 49ers as a dynasty.\n  With their second World Series win in just 3 years, the Giants are on \ntheir way to establishing their own dynasty, once again solidifying San \nFrancisco's status as not just a world-class city but a city of \nchampions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.
