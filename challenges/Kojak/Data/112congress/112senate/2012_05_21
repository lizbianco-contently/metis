Mr. President, I now move to Calendar No. 400, S. 3187.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 400, S. 3187, a bill to \n     amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to revise and \n     extend the user-fee programs for prescription drugs and \n     medical devices, to establish user-fee programs for generic \n     drugs and biosimilars, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on the motion to proceed to the \nFDA user fees bill. At 4:30 the Senate will proceed to executive \nsession to consider the nomination of Paul Watford to be U.S. Circuit \nJudge for the Ninth Circuit. At 5:30 there will be a cloture vote on \nthe Watford nomination. If we are able to confirm his nomination, we \nshould expect a second vote on the motion to proceed to the FDA user \nfees legislation.\n\n\n                        Obstructionism Repeated\n\n  Mr. President, this week the Senate must complete work on legislation \nthat will enact crucial reforms that will prevent drug shortages and \nbring lifesaving medicines to market more quickly. Senators Harkin and \nEnzi, a Democrat and a Republican, worked very hard to bring this \nlegislation to the floor. I am cautiously optimistic that the spirit of \nbipartisanship will continue because Democrats cannot pass this \nlegislation without the cooperation of our Republican colleagues. I \ncertainly hope they will allow us to advance this bill this evening \nwithout additional delay caused by another filibuster. I would like \nSenators from both parties to be free to offer relevant amendments to \nimprove a worthy bill, but before we can get to work on this \nlegislation in earnest, I urge my Republican colleagues to stop their \nfilibuster. Americans living with cancer and other life-threatening \nillnesses are watching closely to see whether the Senate is capable of \nmoving to quick action to ease shortages of crucial medicines or \nwhether we will once more be paralyzed by Republican obstructionism.\n  Americans have seen that obstruction time and time again this \nCongress. They are frustrated with the slow pace of Senate action to \nreauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, Iran sanctions, and on \nlegislation to stop interest rates from doubling on student loans. \nEarlier this month Republicans blocked an attempt to keep higher \neducation affordable for 7 million students. But Democrats have not \ngiven up. I hope our Republican colleagues will come to their senses \nand allow us to prevent this crisis that affects 7 million young men \nand women before it is too late.\n  Republican obstruction and infighting has also stalled critical new \nsanctions on Iran. For 2 months Democrats have worked to resolve \nRepublican objections to this bipartisan measure which passed out of \nthe Banking Committee unanimously. The stakes couldn't be higher. \nSanctions are a key tool to stopping Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon, threatening Israel, and jeopardizing U.S. national security. We \ncannot afford more delays to putting stronger sanctions in place. I \nhope my Republican colleagues will see\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\nhow important it is to advance these important measures and prevent \nIran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Republicans have also needlessly blocked progress on reauthorization \nof the Violence Against Women Act. This helps law enforcement \neffectively combat and prosecute domestic crimes against women. \nAlthough both Chambers have passed a version of this legislation, House \nRepublicans have refused to go to conference with the Senate. Their \nexcuse--a hypertechnical budget issue called a blue slip--isn't much of \na figleaf to hide their blatant obstruction. The truth is that they are \nlooking for any excuse to stall or kill this worthy legislation, but \nAmerican women have not been fooled. If Republicans really want to give \npolice the tools they need to prosecute domestic abusers, they will \ndrop this facade. If Republicans really care about protecting women and \nfamilies, they will abandon these hypertechnical objections and join us \nin conference.\n\n  There are differences between the House and Senate bills that could \nbe worked out easily. American women and families are counting on our \naction. But in this Congress it seems the Republicans are more \ninterested in inaction than action; they are more interested in \nblocking worthy legislation for partisan gain than in working together. \nTheir infighting and partisan games have stopped reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act, Iran sanctions, and the student loan fix--\nstopped them right in their tracks. These are just a few of their ways \nof stopping legislation, a few important measures they have stopped \nover the past few weeks. But the FDA bill, which will prevent drug \nshortages and make lifesaving medicines available more quickly, must \nnot become another victim of this partisanship. I hope Republicans \nseize this opportunity to be cooperative rather than be combative.\n  Mr. President, would you announce the business of the day?\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The motion to proceed is now pending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvotes which were scheduled this afternoon on Watford be vitiated, all \nof the provisions of that order remain in effect.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the call of \nthe quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor to lend my voice to \nasking my colleagues to vote for the motion to proceed to the FDA \nSafety and Innovation Act. Like the Presiding Officer, who is from \nDelaware, where its excellent private sector and public sector have \nbeen the hallmark of innovation, I represent a State that is absolutely \ncritical to the innovation economy.\n  Those of us from Maryland know life science innovation is one of the \nimportant economic engines in our economy both today and in the future. \nWe are the home to flagship government agencies such as the National \nInstitutes of Health, the FDA, and iconic internationally branded \nuniversities that do research and move it into clinical practice at \nJohns Hopkins and the University of Maryland. There are also lots of \nthriving biotech companies and some medical devices. So for us life \nscience is part of the lifeblood of the Maryland economy, and it is \nalso part of the lifeblood of the American economy.\n  Think of what we do. We come up with new biological products, new \npharmaceuticals, new medical devices that not only save and improve \nlives but also enable them to help people in our own country. Because \nthey are FDA approved--the gold standard for safety and efficacy--they \ncan sell these products around the world, often to countries that will \nnever be able to afford an FDA.\n  We have worked very closely on a bipartisan basis to be able to \ncreate the legislative framework called PDUFA, the Pharmaceutical Drug \nUser Fee Act, and there will be a lot of other UFAs, user fees, in \nthis. As I said, we have worked together on a bipartisan basis to bring \nthis legislation to the floor.\n  I note on the Senate floor at this moment is the ranking member of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the Senator from \nWyoming, Mr. Enzi, who has been a leader in fashioning legislation \nwhere we can continue the mission of what we want at FDA: safety and \nefficacy, moving drugs into clinical practice, regulations that are \nsensible, regulate but not strangulate the innovation economy or the \npotential for saving and improving lives. The bill before us is \nintegral to achieving this shared goal.\n\n  This is not new legislation. PDUFA was enacted in 1992. At that time \nwe were almost facing a crisis in our country. There was an unduly long \nwait for patients to have access to new medicines and technologies. For \nFDA, it often took 2 or 3 years to review a drug application. Materials \nwere submitted manually in a very costly fashion. It cost manufacturers \nto the tune of almost $10 million a month.\n  So we decided to come together in the era when Bill Clinton said big \ngovernment was over--not to make government to be bigger but for \ngovernment to be smaller--and we came up with a public-private \npartnership called the PDUFA, the pharmaceutical user fee legislation. \nPDUFA supports drug review, so that those who make the products pay a \nfee to be able to have their drugs reviewed. They also expect their \ngovernment to reduce the time it takes to move reviews expeditiously \nyet safely.\n  Let's be clear: This is a public-private partnership. For FDA, as it \nlooks at its--remember, FDA has two jobs, which are food safety and \nthen the safety of drugs and medical devices. More than 60 percent of \nfunding for drugs and medical devices comes from industry fees--$712 \nmillion. The remainder comes from Federal appropriations--$473 million. \nSo the private sector carries a big part of this responsibility. The \nkind of staffing, expertise, and modernization we have at FDA could not \nhave happened without this public-private partnership. It has been a \nsuccess.\n  More than 1,500 new medicines or technologies have been approved \nsince 1992 for everything from the dread ``C'' words such as cancer or \ncardiovascular disease, to infectious disease, to the dread ``A'' words \nsuch as Alzheimer's, which we are working on, and others. It has \nallowed the FDA to have more scientists and staff, and for that it is \ngiving value to the private sector to be able to decrease review times. \nWe reduced review times from 2 years in 1992 to 1.1 years today.\n  We had excellent hearings. They were very civil, very content rich. \nBut I also launched a listening tour in Maryland where I went out to \nthe major biotech companies and heard from over 25 different companies \nabout what they thought we needed to do. I asked them where their \ngovernment helped them and where their government hurt them, where \nshould their government get out of the way, and where did they need a \nmore muscular government, meaning moving things ahead. They had great \nideas. It was fantastic.\n  What I heard was we have to reauthorize PDUFA quickly, and we must \nmake the improvements to the programs. We need to improve the drug \nreview process; we need to increase communication in order to speed the \ndrug review process. We have made sure we have increased a number of \nmandatory performance requirements between FDA and the life science \nproduct sponsors. I say life science because it is bio, it is pharma, \nit is medical devices, and some things that are both. PDUFA V,\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nwhich this is--it is the fifth time--allows us to use biomarkers to \ndecrease development time by helping to demonstrate therapeutic benefit \nmore quickly. It requires FDA to develop a dedicated program for drug \ndevelopment and training of staff.\n  We face a turnover, and there are a lot of reasons for that which I \nwill come back to. But we want to make sure those young people who are \nso smart in science know how to work to have the science evaluated in a \ntimely way. This is absolutely critical.\n  We have also incentivized the development of drugs for rare diseases. \nParticularly for parents of children with very unique and poignant, \nheart-breaking diseases, we would require FDA to develop guidance \nrelated to advancing and facilitating increased outreach to patient \nrepresentatives, not only to the industry but to those who represent \nthe patient advocacy groups. Again, we seek to develop training and \ncertificate programs within FDA on how to review drugs for rare \ndiseases.\n  I could go through the many benefits of PDUFA. We have done also in \nhere MDUFA, the medical device act, and we do generic PDUFA. So there \nare several bills in this bill. But we have to act. There has to be a \nsense of urgency. This is a different bill than many others. If we \ndon't reauthorize many other bills, they keep on going, but with the \nPDUFAs and the other user fee legislation, they actually will be \nsunsetted if we do not pass them by October. One might say, Well, we \nwill wait until October. We will deal with it on the cliff.\n  We can't do that, because of the impact on both the people in the \nprivate sector and those in the public sector. Failure to reauthorize \nin a timely manner would have catastrophic effects on FDA's ability to \ncarry out its important role. If the user fee agreement expires, \npatients, public health, and industry will suffer. This isn't Senator \nBarb speaking, this is what our leading business and public health \nadvocates are telling us. If we don't reauthorize, the user fees \nsunset, so that means U.S. pharmaceutical industries, which support 4 \nmillion jobs, would be adversely affected. There would be no FDA to \nwork with.\n  In 2010, Maryland private life science companies supported over \n25,000 jobs. These companies are true innovators. On average, it takes \na new medicine 10 to 15 years to develop. If we fail to reauthorize \nPDUFA, which ensures an efficient, consistent, and predictable \nregulatory environment, our private sector will lose out. We are going \nto lose out to Europe and we are going to lose out to China. China is \nstealing our patents as we speak. It will have a terrible consequence \non patients as tens of millions of them rely on drugs and biologics and \nmedical devices.\n  We know we have legislation that works, we have a legislative \nframework that works and now we need to get to work. If we do not pass \nthis bill, and reauthorize these major programs, what will happen is we \nwill need to send out RIF notices. We won't do it, but Dr. Mary \nHamburg, the FDA CEO, the Commissioner, will have to, starting in July \nand August, send out RIF notices to 4,000 Federal employees at FDA, \nfrom the Ph.D. and the M.D. to the important lab techs and others who \nkeep FDA going. This is no fooling around, I say to my colleagues. This \nisn't: Let's wait for the cliff. We will come to the brink if we do not \nreauthorize. Think about the role of FDA. If one thinks one is going to \nlose their job, that is what they are going to be preoccupied with. \nThey are not going to be occupied with looking at these clinical trials \nand moving their advances forward.\n  We have worked so hard on this legislation. The private sector has \nworked hard to find a sensible center, and so has Dr. Mary Hamburg and \nher team. Our committee has worked so well. We can do this. We have to \nhave the will. If we want to stay ahead in the global economy, it has \nto include passing this legislation.\n  Everybody talks about stopping China. I don't know what China is \ngoing to do, but I know we can stop ourselves if we don't pass \nlegislation that promotes innovation in our country and private sector \njobs in a partnership with government.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues to vote for the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland, Ms. \nMikulski, for her passion and understanding and intense work on this \nparticular bill. Of course, she extends her passion and intense work on \nany bill she is involved in. I am so pleased this bill has gone to \ncommittee and has had the time for the committee to work on it. We have \na very bipartisan approach on the bill and a very reasonable way to do \nit.\n  I rise to support S. 3187, the Food and Drug Administration Safety \nand Innovation Act of 2012, and I appreciate Senator Mikulski making \nthe opening statement. This bill will reauthorize FDA's drug and \nmedical device user fee programs, authorize new user fees for generic \ndrugs and biosimilars, and make a small number of targeted bipartisan \npolicy reforms at the same time.\n  This legislation represents over a full year of work by the HELP \nCommittee. Fridays have been dedicated to coming up with solutions on \nthis for over a year, and it has paid off. It reflects the information \nwe have learned from hundreds of meetings with patients, with \nadvocates, with stakeholders, with outside experts, and with the FDA. \nMore importantly, it reflects both the ideas and the feedback we have \ngotten from every member of the HELP Committee and a lot of people \noutside the HELP Committee. The HELP Committee approved this bill by a \nvoice vote on April 25 and reported the bill out of committee on May 7.\n  This bill will make important changes to how FDA does business. \nThanks to the efforts of Senators Burr and Coburn, the bill now \nincludes new requirements that will make FDA more accountable and \ntransparent. A fundamental principle of effective management is that \none has to be able to measure performance if one wants to improve it. \nThe ideas of Senators Burr and Coburn will help provide those \nmeasurements and, as a result, Americans are going to get better access \nto safe, innovative medical devices and medicines.\n  The bill will also modernize how the FDA inspects foreign facilities \nto better account for the global nature of drug manufacturing. It will \nallow FDA to prioritize and target riskier oversized facilities, which \nwill help prevent the recurrence of the problems with drugs such as \nheparin.\n  It will also improve how FDA regulates medical devices. For the past \nseveral years, FDA premarket review of medical devices has involved \nsignificant delay and unpredictability. This has threatened American \nmanufacturing jobs which have started to migrate overseas because of \nthe unfavorable regulatory environment here in the United States. It \nhas also threatened patient access to new therapies. I believe this \nbill will reverse those trends.\n  The bill reflects the concerns I have heard in my meetings with \ncommittee members regarding the current shortages of vital and \nlifesaving drugs. Senators Blumenthal, Roberts, Casey, Alexander, \nBennet, and Hatch should be thanked for all the work they put into the \ndrug shortage proposal. The new notification and coordination \nrequirements are important steps that will help prevent future drug \nshortages.\n  The bill also enjoys broad support. We have received numerous letters \nof support from industry, patient groups, consumer groups, and a whole \nraft of other stakeholders.\n  We also worked to guarantee that any mandatory spending generated by \nthe bill would be fully offset. Over the past several weeks, we have \ndeveloped offsets to pay for those provisions that produce mandatory \nspending. As a matter of fact, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, this bill will reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Chairman Harkin and I have worked very hard to make this bill as \nbipartisan and uncontroversial as possible. We tried to avoid \ncontroversy because we understand this bill needs to get done. If we \ndon't reauthorize the drug and device user fee programs before they \nexpire this fall, the FDA will be forced to lay off 2,000 to 4,000 key \nemployees. This will cause FDA's review of new drugs and devices to \ngrind to a halt. This, in turn, will threaten biomedical industry jobs, \npatient access to new medical therapies, and America's global \nleadership in biomedical innovation. We are talking about 4 million \njobs overall and 2,000 to 4,000 that\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\nwill have to be chopped off because the money runs out when this bill \nexpires, the previous bill expires, so it is critical that we get that \ndone.\n  Another important thing with those 2,000 to 4,000 people who will \nhave to be laid off at FDA is those are key technicians, scientists, \ninformed people who have been working on this for a long time. If we \nlose this, they will still have jobs, it just will not be where we can \nget drugs on the market faster, devices on the market faster, generic \ndrugs out faster, and all of the other things this bill covers.\n\n  So in conclusion, I would like to thank Chairman Harkin and all the \nother members of the HELP Committee, FDA, industry, and many other \ngroups for working with us on this important legislation.\n  I particularly want to point out the cooperation Senator Harkin has \nprovided, the leadership he has provided on the bill, and the way his \nstaff members and mine have worked together for at least a year in \nregular meetings with all members of the committee. So I think a lot of \nthe controversy that could come up with a bill like this has been taken \ncare of. I am hoping it has so we can get this done expeditiously.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what I would like to talk about this \nafternoon is a bit about the President's economic record. I am sure \nAmericans have noticed the President barely mentions this economic \nrecord when he is out on the campaign trail, and I can well understand \nwhy. It is not a very impressive record, especially if you are a \ntaxpayer or a business owner.\n  Our national debt creeps closer to $16 trillion each day. It is now \nmore than $5 trillion more than it was when the President took office. \nIt now adds up to about $50,000 per person in the United States, and \nthat is exclusive of interest payments. By way of contrast, the median \nyearly household income--in other words, all the people in the house--\nis less than $50,000. It is $49,445.\n  Unemployment recently dropped, but it did so for the simple reason \nthat fewer people are searching for work.\n  The President's signature legislative items--the stimulus bill, \nObamaCare, and Dodd-Frank--have not only been unhelpful in boosting \ngrowth, but they have left a trail of crushing debt, uncertainty, and \nnew regulations in their wake. I want to make a few points about each \nof those bills because I think they paint a fair picture of the \nPresident's economic record.\n  First, let me talk about the stimulus. We have not forgotten about \nthe stimulus, even though I suspect the President might like to--$1.2 \ntrillion. It, obviously, failed to achieve the promised results. An \nAssociated Press reporter wrote shortly before it was signed into law:\n\n       They call it ``stimulus'' legislation, but the economic \n     measures racing through Congress would devote tens of \n     billions of dollars to causes that have little to do with \n     jolting the country out of recession.\n\n  Of course, that is exactly what happened. It seemed more designed to \nshower taxpayer dollars on certain favored constituencies and pet \ninterests than to actually jump-start the economy. Much of it was \nsimply wasteful Washington spending. Many investors must have asked \nthemselves why they should put their money to risk on new job-creating \nventures when they have to compete with well-connected firms that can \nsimply wring taxpayer-provided stimulus dollars out of Congress or the \nObama administration.\n  A Washington Post poll released just last week showed that 48 percent \nof Americans have an unfavorable view of the stimulus--and this was, \nafter all, the President's signature effort to spur the economy.\n  Indeed, as Jeffrey Anderson notes in a recent issue of the Weekly \nStandard magazine, the administration does seem to be downplaying the \nlaw. Not only has the stimulus failed to create robust growth, the \ncosts have become more outrageous. He writes:\n\n       It has now been five months since the Administration last \n     put out a report card on [the stimulus.]. . . . the December \n     report marked the sixth straight quarterly report showing \n     that stimulus's cost per job is rising: In reports spanning \n     January 2010 to December 2011, the stimulus's cost per job \n     more than doubled, rising from $146,000 (in January 2010) to \n     $317,000 (in December 2011). With each passing quarter, the \n     stimulus has become an even worse deal for taxpayers.\n\n  So this is the administration's own report card on the stimulus, \nconcluding in the last report, $317,000 per job. Think about that for a \nmoment. To create each job, the taxpayers shell out $317,000.\n  Numbers like these remind me of a quip from writer Christopher \nBuckley. He said writing political satire these days can be difficult \nbecause it has to compete with reality--$317,000 for one job under the \nPresident's stimulus.\n  Well, second, ObamaCare. The $2.6 trillion bill is not aging very \nwell. Since its passage, the act has imposed an estimated $14.9 billion \nin private sector burdens, approximately $7 billion in costs to the \nStates, and 58.6 million annual paperwork hours, according to a weekly \nregulatory report.\n  The April Kaiser health tracking poll showed that more Americans have \nan unfavorable view of the law than favorable. It is 43 to 42 percent. \nMore than half of Americans oppose its central provision, the so-called \nindividual mandate. All told, the new taxes in ObamaCare would add up \nto $\\1/2\\ trillion over 10 years. Many of these taxes will coincide \nwith the biggest tax increase in history--the one scheduled for the end \nof this year. So at the very time the income tax rates are scheduled to \ngo up, the new taxes from ObamaCare will hit--$\\1/2\\ trillion worth of \nnew taxes over the next 10 years.\n  Finally, there is the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform bill. \nWhen it comes to financial regulatory reform, I think most Americans \nbelieve there should be two simple goals: preventing new crises from \nhappening and making sure the taxpayers are not on the hook for Wall \nStreet's mistakes.\n\n  Well, the Dodd-Frank bill did not achieve either goal. It is a \ncomplex web of regulations that institutionalized ``too big to fail'' \nand has served to increase uncertainty, increase moral hazard, and \nincrease economic distortions, all the while adding 52.9 million \npaperwork hours since its passage.\n  So, as I said, President Obama does not seem to be running for \nreelection on this record of the stimulus package, ObamaCare, or Dodd-\nFrank regulatory reform. Instead, he is going to be sending--or maybe \nhe has already sent it--to Congress a to-do list, things he would like \nfor Congress to do, most of which are tax credits and other very short-\nterm proposals that are not likely to have a big effect on jobs or \ngrowth because the business sector is not impressed with a one-time-\nonly, short-term proposition. It wants to know that when it invests \nmoney, that investment is going to be for the long term. Apparently, he \nis going to campaign on this most recent list when he goes out to Iowa \nlater this week.\n  Well, this happens to be Small Business Week, and one would think the \nPresident would turn to something that businesses have actually said \nthey would like to do; that is, to prevent this tax tsunami coming at \nthe end of this year--as I mentioned, the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country, which automatically would take effect on \nJanuary 1 of next year, unless Congress does something about it and the \nPresident can sign the legislation.\n  The NFIB, the National Federation of Independent Business, recently \nreleased a list of the top five uncertainties in the Tax Code that they \nsay would harm small businesses. Let me just mention three of these \nuncertainties.\n  One is the pending increase in marginal tax rates, which will \ndevastate the estimated 75 percent of small businesses that file as \nindividuals. Every one of the five tax rates in the IRS Code will be \nincreased as of January 1. Since most of the businesses now pay--\nespecially small businesses--as individuals--so-called passthrough \nentities--these rate increases directly will impact small businesses.\n  Secondly, they are concerned about the death tax. That is going to \nensnare 900 times more small business owners and 2,200 times more \nfamily farmers if the rate increases to 55 percent and the exemption \nfalls to $1 million, as is scheduled to occur on January 1.\n  Third is the alternative minimum tax which will hit 27 million more\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nAmericans--including many small businesses--if it is not patched or \nrepealed. Well, small business cannot afford this, what has been called \n``taxmageddon'' and its devastating consequences.\n  I would hope, instead of this to-do list the President is sending us, \nhe would take up the cause of preventing this big tax increase at the \nend of the year and help the small businesses and families that need \nthat help.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks a piece in National Review Online by Larry \nKudlow dated May 17 called ``Extend the Bush Tax Cuts Now.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. In this piece, Larry Kudlow, a noted economist, notes that \nwith respect to this ``taxmageddon''--the increase in everybody's taxes \nat the end of this year--it is the uncertainty of it all that is \npreventing the investment by business which would create the jobs we \nwould all like to see. I would just like to quote three paragraphs and \na couple sentences in a fourth. He says:\n\n       The uncertainty over the Bush tax cuts already has caused a \n     number of business leaders to threaten a hiring freeze and a \n     dampening of investment until they can figure out the after-\n     tax cost of capital and rate of return on investment. Hiring \n     has slowed noticeably in recent months. And a number of Wall \n     Street economists are marking down the anemic recovery even \n     more, suggesting that the 3 percent growth at the end of last \n     year, which faltered to 2 percent growth in the first \n     quarter, could be even less in the period ahead.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       A bunch of CEOs have even formed their own march on \n     Washington. Eighteen of them just wrote to Treasury man \n     Timothy Geithner, begging him to oppose tax-rate hikes on \n     dividends--\n\n  Which would go from 15 to 45 percent--\n\n     and capital gains (from 15 to near 30 percent. . . .)\n       ``Equity capital is the life blood of investment and job \n     creation for U.S. companies.''\n\n  That is what these CEOs wrote in the letter to Treasury Secretary \nGeithner.\n  Kudlow goes on to say:\n\n       And they argued that the administration's tax-hike plans \n     would do great harm to American competitiveness and capital \n     formation.\n\n  Then he quotes the Ernst & Young firm to say this:\n\n       . . . the top U.S. integrated tax rate on corporate profits \n     and dividends is on course to hit 68.6 percent, significantly \n     higher than all other OECD countries--\n\n  Those are the developed countries of the world--\n\n     as well as Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Capital gains \n     would rise to 56.7 percent.\n\n  In other words, he is pointing out that not only would these higher \ntax rates hurt the small businesses and the families because of the \nindividual tax rate, marginal rate increases, but raising the dividends \nand capital gains taxes would be even more detrimental because we are \nasking companies in America to compete with firms all over the world, \nand their rate would be much higher with this tax increase than the \nrate in all of the other developed countries, as well as countries such \nas Brazil, Russia, India, and China. How can American businesses \ncompete in that situation?\n  Then, finally, Kudlow notes the effect of all of this uncertainty on \nwhat matters most to most Americans; that is, the fact that they cannot \nget work. He says:\n\n       Bizarrely, some 25 million people have vanished from the \n     labor force--from unemployment, underemployment, or simply \n     dropping out all together. And half of U.S. households are \n     now on some form of federal-transfer-payment assistance. So \n     as we pay so many people not to work, we're sapping the \n     vitality of the economy.\n\n  This is absolutely true. With half of the people in the country on \nsome form of Federal assistance, with 25 million people having just \nvanished from the labor force not even looking for work anymore, \nbusinesses sitting on the sidelines because they cannot calculate what \nkind of return on investment they could get because of the potential \nfor the huge tax increase that is going to occur on January 1, it is no \nwonder we cannot move forward with an economic recovery.\n  So I would just say to President Obama that providing long-term tax \nrate certainty would go a long way toward establishing a sound economy \nin this country, putting Americans back to work, and, ironically, \nestablishing a better record on which the President could run. A year \nand a half ago, the President actually proposed--and I think Congress \nwas very happy to go along with--a continuation of the existing tax \nrates because, as he said at the time, not to do so would be very \ndamaging to the economy. I would submit it is equally damaging for that \nto happen at the end of this year.\n  So I would ask the President, help give the American people and \nAmerican businesses the certainty they need to invest, to create jobs, \nto advance our economic growth, and create prosperity for our future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From National Review, May 17, 2012]\n\n                      Extend the Bush Tax Cuts Now\n\n                           (By Larry Kudlow)\n\n       House Speaker John Boehner is playing a heroic role right \n     now. In his efforts to prevent the Bush tax cuts from \n     expiring, Boehner is aggressively taking on President Obama's \n     leadership ineptitude on the economy. In essence, Boehner is \n     pushing a Republican policy to wrap up a debt-limitation bill \n     and extend the Bush tax cuts in one fell swoop before the \n     election--and before all the last-minute, crisis-oriented, \n     political machinations that would come in a lame-duck \n     Congress, threatening another credit downgrade and leading to \n     a business-hiring freeze and plunging stock market, all of \n     which happened last year.\n       Tax-cut certainty is so vital right now because the anemic \n     economic recovery may be moving towards deflation. That's the \n     message of a gold price that has collapsed by near 20 \n     percent, falling from around $1,900 an ounce to the mid-\n     $1,500s. With a risk-averse economy at home, and with the \n     Greek and European financial crises abroad, the demand for \n     dollars seems to exceed the dollar supply printed by the Fed. \n     This could be solved by more quantitative easing. But a \n     better approach for a system already oversupplied with unused \n     liquidity would be the extension of tax-rate growth \n     incentives, not more monetary pump-priming.\n       The uncertainty over the Bush tax cuts already has caused a \n     number of business leaders to threaten a hiring freeze and a \n     dampening of investment until they can figure out the after-\n     tax cost of capital and rate of return on investment. Hiring \n     has slowed noticeably in recent months. And a number of Wall \n     Street economists are marking down the anemic recovery even \n     more, suggesting that the 3 percent growth at the end of last \n     year, which faltered to 2 percent growth in the first \n     quarter, could be even less in the period ahead.\n       A bunch of CEOs have even formed their own march on \n     Washington. Eighteen of them just wrote to Treasury man \n     Timothy Geithner, begging him to oppose tax-rate hikes on \n     dividends (from 15 to 45 percent) and capital gains (from 15 \n     to near 30 percent, taking the ``Buffett Rule'' into \n     account). ``Equity capital is the life blood of investment \n     and job creation for U.S. companies,'' they wrote. And they \n     argued that the administration's tax-hike plans would do \n     great harm to American competitiveness and capital formation.\n       According to accounting firm Ernst & Young, the top U.S. \n     integrated tax rate on corporate profits and dividends is on \n     course to hit 68.6 percent, significantly higher than all \n     other OECD countries, as well as Brazil, Russia, India, and \n     China. Capital gains would rise to 56.7 percent.\n       And Speaker Boehner knows this. So he's begun a valiant \n     fight to get supply-side tax reform at the top of the \n     congressional agenda well before the election. Similarly, \n     House budget chairman Paul Ryan is suggesting at least a six-\n     month extension of the Bush tax cuts, so as not to disrupt \n     business. (By the way, the Ryan tax-and-spending-reform \n     budget got 41 votes in the Senate, while Obama's budget got \n     none.)\n       In a recent interview, former top Obama economic adviser \n     Larry Summers told me the U.S. recovery is going ``ahead of \n     schedule.'' Really? But former Obama economist Austan \n     Goolsbee gives a more realistic assessment by referring to a \n     subpar 2 percent forecast that is way too slow to spark \n     faster job creation.\n       Bizarrely, some 25 million people have vanished from the \n     labor force--from unemployment, underemployment, or simply \n     dropping out all together. And half of U.S. households are \n     now on some form of federal-transfer-payment assistance. So \n     as we pay so many people not to work, we're sapping the \n     vitality of the economy.\n       Mitt Romney recently gave a fine speech, blasting Obama's \n     profligate spend-and-borrow policies. He described ``a \n     prairie fire of debt sweeping across Iowa and the nation,'' \n     and he tied our newfound debt to the ``tepid recovery.''\n       But lower spending alone, while important, is not going to \n     solve the economic-growth problem. Yes, moving spending to 20 \n     percent of GDP from 24 percent will free up private \n     resources. But lower tax-rate incentives on the extra dollar \n     earned and invested is a more powerful economic-growth tool. \n     Romney should push his 20 percent tax-rate-reduction plan. \n     That would add liquidity to fight deflation, and would \n     provide new economic-growth incentives.\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\n       As for John Boehner's goal of an early extension of the \n     Bush tax cuts, it's going to be an uphill climb. Democrats \n     want to raise taxes, not cut them. But at least the GOP will \n     have a coherent growth-and-jobs message. They can tell the \n     public how important it is to avoid falling off the massive \n     tax cliff which looms ahead. Deflationary fears can ease. And \n     they can make it plain to voters that the GOP has a growth \n     message in these perilous economic times, while the Obama \n     Democrats do not.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3300-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3300-S3307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was not here to hear all of my \ncolleagues' remarks. I know there is a lot of concern about the end of \nthe year and what might happen to try to balance our budget and give us \na solid platform on which this economy could grow. But one of the \nthings that is holding us up is the Republicans' refusal to put any new \nrevenues on the table. They have been adamant and wrong and hardheaded \nand stubborn.\n  They have been very obstructionist in this way--by not being willing \nto put a penny of new revenue on the table. As a result, we have come \nto a standstill because the income coming into the Federal Treasury to \nsupport this government is at the lowest level since President \nEisenhower was President. So they can come to the floor all day long \nand criticize the President, criticize the Democrats, but in the last 2 \nyears Democrats have put over $2 trillion of cuts and reductions to \nsome very important programs on the table.\n  Some of us have even been willing to say, yes; we know we have to \nreform Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. We have also been \nwilling to speak those words which are not easy. Yet not one single \nRepublican leader, not one on either side, the House or the Senate, not \none has come to this floor in public. Now, I have heard them say it in \nprivate. I have been in meetings when they have said it. But not one \nhas come to this floor to say: We are willing to put revenues on the \ntable so we can match the cuts and move this country forward.\n  So I am a little tired of hearing them beat up on either President \nObama or the Democrats when they are more to blame for the situation we \nare in. The American people are getting tired of it too because they \ncan understand it is not 100 percent President Obama's fault. In fact, \nwhen he took office, the Titanic had already hit the iceberg because \nthey had run right smack into it with the economic philosophies and \npolicies they had. The ship was already sinking. But all they want to \ndo is--either Mitch McConnell or Jon Kyl, one day the Senator from \nArizona or the Senator from Kentucky--every day come to the floor and \ntalk about how it is the President's fault there is no way forward, \nthere is no sure path forward, when they are the ones who have put \nboulders in the way every day.\n  So I hope the people can see through it. I came to the floor to talk \nabout something else, but I am getting a little tired of hearing it \nmyself. So I am sure everyone else is as well.\n  Again, Democrats have put $2 trillion of cuts before this body, and \nwe have implemented some of them already. But we cannot run a \ngovernment on 14 percent of the GDP. The average has been about 20 to \n21 percent. So until they are willing to put some more revenues on the \ntable, we are not going to get anywhere, and we are not going to be \nable to extend the tax cuts that cost people money.\n  I hope we can do something so we can extend some tax cuts to small \nbusinesses, which I came to talk about--and you, Mr. President, know \nthis well. Instead of giving some of the biggest tax breaks to \ncompanies that are the biggest in the world and put all of their jobs \noverseas, I wish the Republicans would start talking about tax relief \nto businesses right here at home on Main Street. That is what I want to \ntalk about today.\n  (The further remarks of Ms. Landrieu are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Internet\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe the development of the Internet, \nits networks, and the digital economy are one of the great achievements \nof our age.\n  The Internet links humanity together, facilitating economic growth, \nbringing education and health resources to remote regions, reshaping \nsocieties and advancing human rights.\n  While networks foster innovation, job creation, and political and \nsocial progress, networks can also be used by actors with nefarious \nmotives. It is in our national interest to deter, detect, and destroy \nreal and viable cyber threats, to protect Americans and preserve the \nbenefits of the Internet. Americans must not be afraid to go online.\n  The Internet works not just because it is open to all but because it \nis founded on the principle of trust. Users trust that their browsers \nare visiting real Web sites, not replicated ones. Internet commerce \nsucceeds because people trust that their transactions are private and \ntheir financial information won't be shared with others. People trust \nthe Internet because they believe their service providers work for \nthem, not for their advertisers, not for scammers, and not for the \ngovernment.\n  Congress's effort to develop a comprehensive approach to \ncybersecurity must not erode that trust. When Americans go online to \nconsume digital services and goods, they must believe and know with \nsome certainty that their privacy is adequately protected. The content \nthat Americans consume must be at least as private as their library \nrecords, their video rentals, and book purchases in the brick-and-\nmortar world. Our law enforcement and intelligence agencies should not \nbe free to monitor and catalog the speech of Americans just because it \nis online.\n  But the legislation passed by the other body, known as CISPA, would \nerode that trust. As an attempt to protect our networks from real cyber \nthreats, CISPA is an example of what not to do. CISPA repeals important \nprovisions of existing electronic surveillance laws that have been on \nthe books for years, without instituting corresponding privacy, \nconfidentiality, and civil liberty safeguards. It creates uncertainty \nin place of trust, it erodes statutory and constitutional civil rights \nprotections, and it creates a surveillance regime in place of the \ntargeted, nimble, cybersecurity program that is needed to truly protect \nour Nation.\n  Unfortunately, S. 2105, the bill before the Senate, shares some of \nthese defects. Currently, Internet services and service providers have \nagreements with their customers that allow them to police and protect \ntheir networks and users. Rather than simply allowing these Internet \ncompanies to share information on users who violate their contracts and \npose a security threat, the House and Senate proposals regrettably \nauthorize a broad-based information-sharing regime that can operate \nwith impunity. This would allow the personal data of individual \nAmericans to be shared across a multitude of bureaucratic, military, \nand law enforcement agencies. This would take place regardless of the \nprivacy agreements individual Americans have with their Internet \nservice providers.\n  In fact, both the House and Senate bills subordinate all existing \nprivacy rules and constitutional principles to the poorly defined \ninterests of what is called cybersecurity.\n  These bills would allow law enforcement agencies to mine Internet \nusers' personal data for evidence of acts entirely unrelated to \ncybersecurity. More than that, they would allow law enforcement to look \nfor evidence of future crimes, opening the door to a dystopian world \nwhere law enforcement evaluates your Internet activities for the \npotential that you might commit a crime.\n  In establishing this massive new regime, these bills fail to create \nthe necessary incentives for operators of critical networks to keep \ntheir networks secure.\n  It is a fundamental principle of cybersecurity policy that any \nnetwork whose failure could result in a loss of\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nlife or significant property should be physically isolated from the \nInternet. Unfortunately, many of our critical network operators have \nviolated this principle in order to save money or streamline \noperations. This sort of gross negligence ought to be the first target \nin any cybersecurity program--not the privacy of individual Americans.\n  Congress could target this behavior with yet one more rule book and \none more bureaucracy, creating a cybersecurity contractor full \nemployment program. I am not, however, convinced this is a problem that \nrequires that kind of solution.\n\n  At the same time, Congress should not allow our critical network \noperators to ignore best practices with impunity. It is vital they \nunderstand that any liability for a preventable cyber attack is their \nresponsibility. There is not going to be a governmental bailout after \nthe fact in the cybersecurity area. Shareholders and boards of \ndirectors must be vigilant and understand the risks to their \ninvestments. Executives must understand that ignoring critical cyber \nthreats in the interest of cost savings and convenience will leave them \npersonally exposed.\n  Internet providers and backbone operators clearly have a role in this \nfight. When they detect abnormal network activity or have a user \nviolating their contract in a way that constitutes a cyber threat, they \ncan and should inform our cyber defense officials. If it is necessary \nto grant them immunity to share this kind of information, the Congress \ncould grant it--narrowly and with careful consideration.\n  Mr. President, there would be bipartisan support for the proposition \nthat the Federal Government also has a significant role that does not \nnecessarily require billing taxpayers for legions of private \ncybersecurity contractors. The Department of Defense, the Department of \nNational Intelligence, Homeland Security, and the Justice Department--\nfour major parts of our government--all have cybersecurity specialists. \nThe Congress ought to be promoting the cyber capabilities of these \nagencies and providing the resources that are needed to protect these \nnetworks. These Federal agencies should do a better job of consulting \nthe private Internet companies to better understand the attacks that \nare occurring every day across the net.\n  Some of these steps may require legislation, but many can be carried \nout by responsible actors in the public and private sector without \nwaiting for the Congress to act. However, the legislation before the \nSenate and the cybersecurity legislation that passed the other body \nleads our country away from the kind of commonsense approach to \ncybersecurity I have outlined this afternoon.\n  As they stand, these bills are an overreaction to a legitimate and \nunderstandable fear. The American people are going to respond by \nlimiting their online activities. That would be a recipe to stifle \nspeech, innovation, job creation, and social progress. I believe these \nbills will encourage the development of an industry that profits from \nfear and whose currency is Americans' private data. These bills create \na cyber industrial complex that has an interest in preserving the \nproblem to which it is the solution.\n  In terms of the process, the Senate ought to proceed in a way that is \nas open and collaborative as the Internet the Congress seeks to promote \nand protect. On substance, any cybersecurity bill must contain specific \nand clear descriptions of what types of data and when such data can be \ncaptured, with whom it can be shared, and under what circumstances. \nAnything not specifically covered ought to remain private. Privacy in \nthe cybersecurity arena should be the default not the exception. Legal \nimmunity to corporations that share information should be the exception \nnot the rule and void if privacy protections or contracts are \ndisregarded.\n  The Congress and the public must have the ability to know how any \ncybersecurity program that is established is to be implemented. That \nmeans routine public and unclassified reports and hearings to examine \nwhether there were any unintended privacy or civil liberty impacts \ncaused by the program. No secret law, Mr. President.\n  Bad Internet policy is increasingly premised on false choices. \nEarlier this year, during the consideration of the Protect IP Act and \nthe Stop Online Piracy Act, the Congress was told again it had a false \nchoice. The Congress was told it either could protect intellectual \nproperty or it could protect the integrity of the Internet. This was a \nfalse choice. I and others said so at the time because achieving one \nshould not and does not require sacrificing the other.\n  Now the Congress is being asked once again to make a false choice--a \nchoice between cybersecurity and privacy--and I don't think these two \nare mutually exclusive. I think we can have both. Our job is to write a \ncybersecurity bill that protects America's security and the fundamental \nright to privacy of our people. There is no sound policy reason to \nsacrifice the privacy rights of law-abiding American citizens in the \nname of cybersecurity. It is my intent to fight any legislation that \nwould force Members of the Senate to make that choice.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Food and \nDrug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. I believe we are going \nto have a cloture vote on this bill tonight, and I am pleased that all \nearly indications are it will pass tonight and we will move forward on \nthis bill.\n  There has been considerable time spent drafting this legislation. It \ngained bipartisan support both in House and Senate committees, and it \nis moving through what I would call a regular process. We haven't seen \ntoo much of that in the last year and a half or so. This is the regular \nprocess. For those who say Congress can't get anything done, hopefully, \nwith passage of this bill we will take a very significant step forward \nin terms of being able to provide and bring to patients, doctors, \nadministrators, and others across the Nation new drugs, new treatments, \nand new medical devices that can ensure better health, prevent \npotential terminal situations, and provide better drug availability and \ndevice availability. So I think it is very important that this \nlegislation goes forward.\n  I am pleased we have gotten to this point on a bipartisan basis. I \nthink Senators Harkin and Enzi deserve commendation for their work in \nthe Senate, and those in the House as well for bringing the bill along \non a parallel track.\n  The whole idea of this legislation is to continue to provide the \nsafest, most effective and most efficient drugs and devices for \nAmerican citizens and people around the world. These are two very \nimportant industries in which the United States has had the leading \nedge as providers and we don't want to lose that. It has meant a lot \nfor our economy, and it has meant a lot of jobs for Americans. I think \nthe passage of this bill will continue what has been a remarkable \nnearly three decades' worth of innovation that has taken place both in \nthe biopharmaceutical industry as well as the medical device industry.\n\n  Part of this bill deals with drug shortages. I have talked to a \nnumber of doctors--my staff has been traveling the State talking to \nmedical providers--and there is an alarming number of drug shortages in \ncritical drugs, particularly those designed to deal with more rare \ninstances of health problems and yet, obviously, important to those \npeople who are suffering from those incidences of disease or health \nthreats.\n  It was reported to me that last year FDA received a record number of \ndrug shortage reports--more than 250--including critical drugs used in \nsurgery, emergency care, and oncology. The problem continues today, but \nthe this bill addresses that and, hopefully, will move us forward \nsignificantly in terms of dealing with this current problem.\n  In Fort Wayne--my hometown in Indiana--Parkview Health's pharmacy \ndirector said nearly 80 percent of hospitals consistently face \nshortages in drugs needed for emergencies, including cardiac and \ndiabetic prescriptions. This bill incorporates significant reporting \nrequirements to the FDA that I hope will help mitigate this critical \nproblem. I think we are going to need to figure out ways to further \naddress this, but this can be an important first step.\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\n  The whole concept has been somewhat unique in the Federal Government; \nthat is, the makers of the products essentially pay a fee to a \nregulatory agency for the regulatory agency to conduct the work \nnecessary to gain approval to sell their drugs on the market. We have \nhad a situation which is sort of a cornucopia of new innovations in \ndrugs and medical devices. Yet they have been delayed by the \nbureaucracy or the inability of the FDA to move in an efficient, \neffective way to run this through the process.\n  The biopharmaceutical industry has basically said: Look, we are \nwilling to put up between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in new user \nfees--I believe it is over a 5-year period of time--which will account \nfor nearly 60 percent of the funding designated by the Center for Drug \nEvaluation and Research. In exchange for putting up those fees, the FDA \nhas agreed to new performance goals and process improvements that will \nreduce the time it takes drugs to reach the market.\n  So the key is to provide the funds necessary to hire the right people \nand put the right procedures in place to expedite the study and \napproval of safe, effective, efficient drugs that have been sent to the \nFDA for approval so we can get them into the market. Of course, the \nultimate goal is to get them not only into the market but use them to \nprovide health and safety benefits for the American people.\n  The Medical Device User Fee Act is also part of this. In Indiana, we \nhave not only a very large biopharmaceutical company and a number of \naffiliated companies, we also have a vibrant and dynamic medical device \nindustry. That industry employs over 20,000 Hoosiers directly and many \nmore indirectly with good-paying jobs. Many of these companies are \nright on the leading edge of new innovation and new developments. So \nincluded in the legislation that we will be voting on is a 5-year \nagreement known as the Medical Device User Fee Act that improves the \nregulatory pathway for medical devices.\n  This is the medical device equivalent of the pharmaceutical user fee. \nDevice companies have worked with the FDA, again in an agreement where \neach side contributes. The medical device manufacturers will contribute \nuser fees to go to the FDA that can be used to streamline--without \ncompromising safety in any way--the regulatory process so the approvals \ncan be made.\n  Why is this important? Well, it is important not only to getting \nthese products into the marketplace so they can be used to safely \nimprove the health of American citizens, but this is a dynamic export \nindustry where America has been the leading exporter of medical \ndevices. I have heard from so many medical device manufacturers \nthroughout Indiana that they are faced with the dilemma of having to \npotentially think about moving overseas simply because of the delays \nand the time lapse that exists for approval. They can manufacture these \nproducts overseas and get approval overseas and sell them on a \nworldwide basis much more quickly, but they do not want to do that. The \nUnited States is their home and they want to produce here, but they \nhave to compete with their competitors across the waters that are \nsubjected to fewer delays in implementing approvals.\n  To counter that, we simply want to use this medical device user fee \nin a way that will help the FDA's review process and eliminate these \nunnecessary delays, unpredictability, and inconsistency of past \npractices.\n  I do want to thank the FDA for paying significant attention to our \ndevice users by coming to Indiana and listening to them--a forum that I \nconvened. There has been interaction back and forth, whether it is FDA \ntraveling to Indiana or device manufacturers traveling here to \nWashington. I am pleased that this bill contains some items that are \nthe result of all those negotiations and all those exchanges between \nthe two.\n  Let me mention one last thing before closing, and that is the medical \ndevice tax, which is not part of this bill. To pay for the so-called \naffordable health care law, the administration included a 2.3-percent \ntax on medical devices, which will begin in 2013. That tax essentially \nwas imposed on an industry that is paying its full share of taxes, \ncontributing to the user fee, and yet it was slapped on as a way to pay \nfor the costly health care bill. That has an enormous impact over a \nperiod of time on these device manufacturers and jeopardizes \nmanufacturers' ability to remain based here in the United States rather \nthan looking overseas.\n  There are a number of States in addition to Indiana--and my colleague \nfrom Minnesota is waiting to speak, and her State is also a major \nmanufacturer and innovator of medical devices. California, Florida, \nIllinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, and Wisconsin will all suffer potential job losses if this \nmedical device tax is imposed.\n  We are not taking it up in this bill so as not to try to derail the \nbill. I understand an agreement has been made that it would be set \naside. I know Senator Hatch, on our side, is looking for an opportunity \nto bring that up in another vehicle, and I want to support that. I \nencourage my colleagues to take a look at the impact of that fee on our \nability as a nation to be the leader in innovation and export of \nmedical devices.\n  I thank Senators Harkin and Enzi for shepherding the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act through the committee. I \nbelieve this legislation will help improve patients' access to new \nmedical technology, and it will protect American jobs and improve the \nFDA so that America can remain a global leader in biomedical \ninnovation. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for \nhis words.\n  We both are from States that have a lot of jobs involved in medical \ndevices, and, in fact, this bill is something we worked on very hard. I \nam the cochair of the medical device caucus in the Senate. This has \nbeen our top priority, to try to move those FDA rules along, and this \nbill does that. It is an agreement--a rare agreement--between \ngovernment and industry, which is something both parties want. We would \nlike to move those approvals along for the patients, long-suffering \npatients who should have access to medical devices, and then also for \nthe industry, where we have seen way too much venture capital money go \nto places such as Europe simply because that process moves faster. So \nthis is a very good bill, and I am so pleased we have bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I see that the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, has come into the \nChamber, and both he and Senator Harkin deserve a lot of praise.\n  I wish to focus today on one piece of this bill, something I have \nworked very hard on, and it really came out of things I heard in my \nState, things I heard from pharmacists literally 2 years ago, things I \nhave heard from patients. I got together with our staff. I see that our \nlegislative director, Rose Baumann, and Andrew Hu, who did a lot of \nwork on this bill, are here today. We went and talked to all kinds of \npeople involved. We talked to pharmaceutical companies to try to figure \nout what was going wrong with drug shortages; we talked to the people \nwho were suffering the most--the patients; we talked to the \npharmacists, and we said: What would work here? And the FDA told us \nthat, in fact, when they did get early notification from pharmaceutical \ncompanies that there was going to be some kind of shortage, it helped. \nThey were able to avert that shortage. They have done it successfully \nover 100 times, and they have done it many times with some key drugs. \nAnd the earlier notice they have, the better it is for everyone because \nthey can, in fact, then avert the drug shortage, and that is what this \nis about.\n  I will tell you that, for me, this whole bill and this whole \nprovision really comes down to a little boy named Axel Zirbes, a young \nboy with bright eyes and a big smile. Because of leukemia, this little \nboy, when I saw him, had no hair on his head. He and his family were \nthrown into a panic about 1 year ago when they learned that an \nessential drug--cytarabine--was in short supply and might not be \navailable for their son, who they had just found out was diagnosed with \nleukemia and was supposed to start treatment, and the doctor says: You \nknow\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\nwhat, we don't know if you should start it--you should start it \nimmediately, but we don't have this critical cancer drug, this critical \nleukemia drug.\n  They decided they would take Axel to Canada, where the drug was \nreadily available, and just when they were making those plans to go \nthere, they found out that some of the drug had been located and that \nAxel could come in for his treatments. Well, that should never have \nhappened, not in the United States of America, not to a family of a \nlittle 4-year-old boy, both parents working hard to make sure their \nchild could have health care and then this happens. It makes no sense.\n  There is the story of Mary McHugh Morrison, who joined me at a forum \nI held on this topic in Edina, MN. Mary is a woman whose cancer had, \nunfortunately, returned after a shortage of Doxil. That is a \nchemotherapy drug that had kept her ovarian cancer at bay. In fact, \nthis shortage interrupted her chemotherapy regimen. Mary struggled to \nfind remaining vials of Doxil and then struggled with the ethical \ndilemmas of using the drug she found when others would not be able to \nuse it. She literally talked at the forum about how she had personally \ncalled people, used connections, tried to find those vials, and she \nrealized that when she got those drugs, other people wouldn't have \nthem.\n  Again, this shouldn't be happening in the United States of America. \nShe shared her experience with us. And because of a few delays in \ntreatment, Mary's doctor told her that her tumor had, unfortunately, \nreturned and that she was then no longer responding to that drug. This \npast February, CT scans, unfortunately, showed that Mary's tumor size \nhad doubled. She was immediately accepted into a clinical trial at the \nMayo Clinic and began treatment. Fortunately, she is so far responding \nwell and her health is improving.\n  These shortages are happening all over this country. Every single \nSenator in this Chamber has heard about one of them. You heard Senator \nCoats from Indiana talking about what he had heard. So the fact that we \nheard this first in Minnesota I don't think is any surprise. We have an \nactive State. We have people who believe you can still make a \ndifference. We have pharmacists who are on the front line every day, \nand they came to us to get this bill introduced. We heard from \nemergency medical responders, who have told me that shortages have made \nit difficult to stock lifesaving drugs in their ambulances. I have \nlistened to stories from parents whose children rely on drugs to help \nmaintain their focus at school. I have seen firsthand how doctors and \npharmacists have had to struggle to keep their patients alive as they \nlook for these drugs.\n\n  These shortages have had significant impact on these patients' \nquality of life, oftentimes forcing them to pay hundreds more for \nexpensive alternatives or risking their professional careers to adjust \nfor their diseases and spending hours and days just trying to find a \nway to fill a prescription.\n  When we are dealing with so many costs and resource issues with \nhealth care, the last we want is for doctors and nurses and pharmacists \nto be wasting away hours trying to find drugs and then ultimately, in \nmost cases, finding them, but this is no way to run a railroad. Across \nthe country, hospitals, physicians, and pharmacists are confronting \nunprecedented shortages of these drugs.\n  So those are the stories, but here are the numbers.\n  The number of drug shortages has more than tripled over the last 6 \nyears, jumping from 61 drug products--remember, there are thousands of \nshortages, but this is 61 different drug products in 2005 to more than \n200 drug product shortages in 2011.\n  A survey by the American Hospital Association found that virtually \nevery hospital in the United States has experienced shortages of \ncritical drugs in the past 6 months. More than 80 percent reported \ndelays in patient treatment due to shortages.\n  For some of these drugs, no substitutes are available or, if they \nare, they are less effective and may involve greater risk of adverse \nside effects. The chance of medical errors also rises as providers are \nforced to use second- or third-tier drugs that they are less familiar \nwith using.\n  A survey conducted by the American Hospital Association showed that \nnearly 100 percent of their hospitals experienced a shortage--100 \npercent. Another survey conducted by Premier Health System showed that \n89 percent of its hospitals and pharmacists experienced shortages that \nmay have caused a medication safety issue or an error in patient care.\n  It is clear that there are a large number of overlapping factors that \nhave resulted in these unprecedented shortages. Experts cite a number \nof factors: market consolidation, poor business incentives, \nmanufacturing problems, production delays, unexpected increases in \ndemand for a drug, inability to procure raw materials, and even the \ninfluence of the gray market. Literally, people are trying to make \nmoney off of this now. They hear there is a shortage, and they buy up \nthe supply and then sell it at a higher price. Financial decisions in \nthe pharmaceutical industry are also a major factor. Many of these \nmedications are in short supply because the companies have simply \nstopped production. They decided it didn't work for their profits to \nkeep producing them. Mergers in the drug industry have narrowed the \nfocus of product lines. As a result, some products are discontinued or \nproduction is moved to different sites, leading to delays. When drugs \nare made by only a few companies, a decision by any one drug company \ncan have a large impact. That would make sense.\n  To help correct a poor market environment or to prevent gray market \ndrugs from contaminating our medication supply chain, we must address \nthe drug shortage problem at its root. Last year I introduced the \nPreserving Access to Life-Saving Medications Act with Senator Bob \nCasey. We also have the support of Senator Collins and others. This is \na bipartisan bill that would require drug manufacturers to provide \nearly notification to the FDA whenever there is a factor that may lead \nto a shortage. We also had support from the Presiding Officer, as well \nas Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut and many other people from across \nthe Senate.\n  This bill will help the FDA take the lead in working with pharmacy \ngroups, drug manufacturers, and health care providers to better prepare \nfor impending shortages, more effectively manage shortages when they \noccur, and minimize their impact on patient care. And that is why I am \npleased that the early notification provision from my bill is included \nin the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, the one \nthat Senator Coats and I were just discussing and that we are debating \ntoday.\n  I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi for their leadership on the \nHELP Committee in bringing this legislation forward and including my \nprovision. In a bipartisan manner, the HELP Committee brought together \nseveral working groups to address a wide range of issues, from medical \ndevice innovation to drug shortages. In the drug shortage working \ngroup, we spoke with experts from patient groups, providers, drug \nmanufacturers, and the FDA to try to find an appropriate solution.\n  Ultimately, the legislation now includes many policies that I believe \nwill help address shortages. In addition to the early-notification \nrequirement, again, the FDA is going to be able to look in our own \ncountry, and if they can't find something in our own country they can \nlook at safe locations overseas. You simply can't keep these patients \nwaiting for their treatment.\n  In addition, the bill directs the FDA to improve communications \ninside and outside its walls, requires more robust record-keeping and \nreporting, and asks for studies on how pricing factors impact drug \nshortages.\n  I believe this bill represents a step forward in our ability to \nprevent these shortages--a strong step forward. With manufacturers \nproviding early notification, the FDA's drug shortage team can then \nappropriately use their tools to prevent shortages from happening. As I \nmentioned, in the last 2 years, the FDA, with more information, has \nsuccessfully prevented nearly 200 drug shortages. Imagine the hundreds \nof thousands and millions of patients that has helped. So we need to \nextend it. That is what this bill does.\n  One such example is the recent shortage of methotrexate. This is a \nvery common drug used in chemotherapy to\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\ntreat cancers such as leukemia. For me, the most devastating part about \nthe shortage is that I heard about it from the Zirbes family--the \nfamily of this little 4-year-old boy who had to suffer through the \nshortage of cytarabine earlier. Only this time, the FDA took quick \naction once it learned of this potential shortage and worked with other \nmanufacturers to boost production and helped stop the bleeding before \nthis became a major crisis. That is an example of what can happen with \nearly notification. They are allowed to then go to other manufacturers \nand find the people who can make the drug to get it to the hospitals, \nto get it to the patients. And today, with strong cooperation between \nthe FDA and pharmaceutical manufacturers, methotrexate is available for \npatients who rely on it just like that little 4-year-old boy Axel \nZirbes.\n  Together with Senator Casey, we were able to work with the HELP \nCommittee and in a bipartisan manner come up with a solution that would \ngive the FDA more tools to prevent drug shortages and ensure patients \nsuch as Axel or Mary have the drugs they need when they need them. \nRecent announcements by the FDA have proven that early notification and \ncooperation with manufacturers have helped reduce the number of drug \nshortages by over half. There have been 42 newly scarce drugs so far \nthis year, compared to 90 in the same period last year. That is \nprogress.\n  While I applaud the FDA in their efforts to address this crisis, 42 \ndrugs in shortage is still 42 too many for me. That is why it is so \nimportant to pass this provision and give the FDA the tools it needs to \nget the number down to zero.\n  I understand that early notification requirements may be a short-term \nsolution to a long-term problem. That is why I will continue to work \nwith my Senate colleagues to come up with a broad permanent solution, \none that includes methods to address the root causes of drug shortages.\n  It has been a long road to get to this point. Nearly 2 years ago I \nbegan hearing about this drug shortage issue, and when I first talked \nabout it some of the doctors said: Really? I haven't heard about it. \nNow, 2 years later, they have all heard about it. That is why we \nintroduced the Preserving Access to Lifesaving Medication Act. That is \nwhy we came together to get an agreement in this legislation. That is \nwhy the President issued an Executive order that pushed for more \nvoluntary notifications from manufacturers, and the FDA released an \ninterim final rule that broadened the scope of the current notification \nrequirement. That is why it is so important that we pass this \nlegislation.\n  Patients such as Axel or Mary should not have to be burdened with the \nadded stress and worry about whether they are going to have enough \nmedication to get through their next treatment. They have enough on \ntheir minds. Let's get this done. It is a great example of people \nworking across the aisle. When they heard something from their \nconstituents, they were willing to listen and to put this bill \ntogether. Me, I would like to have gotten it done 2 years ago, but \nlater is better than never. We can get it done this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after many months of bipartisan \nnegotiation, the Senate will proceed this evening to vote on the motion \nto proceed to consideration of the Food and Drug Administration Safety \nand Innovation Act of 2012. I hope it will receive an overwhelming vote \nso we can move ahead with it and dispense with the bill on the floor \nthis week. This bill is the product of excellent bipartisan \ncollaboration on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nwhich I chair. All Senators on the committee have been involved. Going \nback almost a year, we set up working groups. Different Senators had \ndifferent interests in different parts of the bill. They and their \nstaffs on both sides were invited, Republican and Democrat, to be \ninvolved in those working groups to put this bill together.\n  The bill passed overwhelmingly out of our committee--actually by \nvoice vote, with only two reserving their ``no'' votes. So it had \noverwhelming support on both sides in our committee.\n  This bill, of course, reauthorizes important FDA user fee agreements. \nIt modernizes the FDA's medical product authority to help boost \nAmerican innovation and ensure patients have access to the therapies \nthey need. The backbone of this legislation is the user fee agreements \nthat FDA has negotiated with industry. We must remember that a sizable \npart of FDA's budget comes from user fees that the industry agrees to \npay, that allows the FDA to hire the personnel and get the equipment \nthey need to more quickly review product applications. We need to \nreauthorize this bill to implement those agreements if we want to keep \nthe FDA running at full steam, which is critical to preserving jobs at \nboth the agency and in industry, and to ensuring that FDA has the \nresources to get safe medical products to patients quickly. Again, \nthese agreements affect all of us by helping to maintain and create \njobs in our home States. For example, in my own State of Iowa, these \nagreements will support our bioscience sector which is growing and is \nincreasing employment in our State. Implementation of these agreements \nwill continue to foster biomedical innovation and job growth throughout \nour country.\n\n  The bill before us reauthorizes the prescription drug user fee \nagreement, which is known in the nomenclature as PDUFA. The medical \ndevice user fee agreement is known as MDUFA. These will continue and \nimprove the agency's ability to speed market access to both drugs and \nmedical devices while ensuring patient safety.\n  We have a new part of the bill called the generic drug user fee \nagreement, which is expected to slash review times to a third of \ncurrent levels--from 30 months to 10 months--and will improve the speed \nwith which generic products are made available to patients. This will \ngenerate significant savings in our health care system. In the last \ndecade, from 2001 to 2010, it saved the U.S. health care system more \nthan $931 billion.\n  This agreement will ensure we continue to see those savings and that \npatients will have access to cheaper drugs when they need them. It also \nobviously means taxpayers will be saving money because many of these \ndrugs come through both Medicaid and Medicare. By having generic drugs \navailable more rapidly than they have been in the past, it will mean \ntaxpayers will save a significant amount of money in the future.\n  This bill also authorizes another new section, the biosimilars user \nfee agreement, which will further spur innovation by shepherding the \nbiologic industry as it matures.\n  These agreements are vital to FDA's ability to do its job, to the \nmedical products industry's ability to survive some very challenging \neconomic times, but, most importantly, to the patients who are the \nprimary beneficiaries of this longstanding and valuable collaboration \nbetween FDA and industry. As I said, after months of negotiations with \nour staffs, with FDA, with the industry, and with consumer groups, I \nthink they have crafted win-win agreements that they stand behind. So \nindustry is behind this bill, the FDA is behind this bill, and hundreds \nof groups throughout this country have been supporting it. They have \ndone their job and now it is time for us to do ours.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we authorize these user fee \nagreements before they expire. If we don't, the FDA will lose about 60 \npercent of its drug center budget and 20 percent of its device center \nbudget. It will have to lay off nearly 2,000 employees, which would \ngrind the drug and device approval processes to an unacceptably slow \npace, with devastating consequences for patients, jobs, for the \nindustry, and further innovations both in drugs and devices. We cannot \nlet that happen, and that is why for more than a year we have worked \nvery closely in our committee.\n  I see the ranking member, Senator Enzi, is here. We and our staffs \nhave worked together. As I said, we set up\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nthese working groups in our committee. They were not divided along any \nkind of partisan lines. They were set up along interest groups so we \nhad both Democratic and Republican Senators and their staffs working \ntogether for years.\n  I am sure I can speak for Senator Enzi when I say all along our aim \nhas been to ensure that in addition to the user fee agreements and all \nthe other things, this is the product of a consensus, bipartisan, \npolicymaking process that we have had for the last year. It was an open \nand transparent process. We had input not only from our members but \nother Senators were also involved as they had interest in this bill. \nThroughout negotiations on this bill the stakeholder community-at-large \nwas involved.\n  Again, I can assure everyone that this legislation benefited greatly \nfrom all of the diverse input from Senators on both sides, industry \nstakeholders, consumer groups, and patient groups. It is a result of \nconcerted efforts to define our common interests, and I believe these \nefforts will directly benefit patients and the U.S. biomedical \nindustry.\n  Very briefly, I want to say as a broad stroke that this bill \nauthorizes key user fee agreements for both drugs and medical devices. \nIt streamlines the device approval process while again enhancing \npatient protections.\n  We do one other thing. We modernize the FDA's global drug supply \nchain authority so we have a better handle on and better information \nand knowledge of where our products are coming from. Of the drugs \nmanufactured in this country, 80 percent of the ingredients come from \nabroad. In the past we have not had a tight handle on where they were \ncoming from and what kind of manufacturing processes were involved. \nThis bill closes that up. It gives the FDA much better authority over \nthat and much better input from where the drugs come from to make sure \nthey follow good manufacturing practices. It spurs innovation and \nincentivizes drug development for life-threatening conditions.\n  We reauthorized the pediatric trial program and improved it so we \nhave specific trial programs for pediatric drugs. Children are not just \nsmall adults. What may work for an adult in terms of a drug, we don't \njust cut the drug in half and give it to a child. Sometimes it takes \nspecialized, specific kinds of drugs for children that are not \nsomething an adult gets. So this reauthorizes and improves those trials \nfor children.\n  Senator Enzi and I and others in our committee wanted to do something \nabout preventing and mitigating drug shortages, so we have provisions \nin this bill that will do that and help prevent and mitigate these drug \nshortages by making sure the FDA gets timely information from \nmanufacturers if there is going to be any interruption at all in the \nsupply chain. Also I believe this bill increases FDA's accountability \nand transparency.\n  That is sort of a broad-brush stroke of what is in this bill. I will \nbe over in the next day perhaps getting into some more of the \nspecifics. It is imperative that we keep pace with and adapt to \ntechnological and scientific advances. Things move very rapidly in this \narea and we want to make sure we get the drugs and devices approved as \nquickly as possible, but always with keeping patient safety foremost. \nThat is the single most important aspect, to make sure that patient \nprotections will remain key. Keeping pace with the biomedical landscape \nthat changes so rapidly is the aim of this bill, to ensure the drugs \ncoming from abroad are safe, and to take appropriate measures to \nprotect our patients.\n  I believe we have a good compromise. Neither Democrats nor \nRepublicans got everything they wanted in this bill. As I have said \nbefore, I didn't get all of what I wanted in this bill. I am sure \nothers didn't either, but that is the process of a consensus. And where \nwe could not achieve consensus, we didn't allow those differences to \ndistract us from the important goal of producing a bill that everyone \ncould support.\n\n  Again, it is a true bipartisan bill that is broadly supported by the \npatient groups and industry. I have letters from over 100 groups \noutlining their support. To name a few: the Pew Charitable Trust, \nConsumers Union, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the \nGeneric Pharmaceutical Industry, the Biotech Industry Organization, \nBIO, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Advanced Medical Technology \nAssociation, American Foundation for the Blind, and many more. Those \nare just a sampling of over 100 groups.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of those groups \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are expecting that there will probably be some \namendments to this bill, and that is fine. That is the way the Senate \nshould operate. We expect all amendments to this bill will be relevant \nto the bill. I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle who want to see \nthis bill passed expeditiously would keep that in mind. If there is a \nrelevant amendment and Senators feel they want to bring that up, that \nis fine. That is the way the Senate should operate.\n  I hope nonrelevant amendments which have nothing to do with the bill \nwill not be promoted on the Senate floor. That would only slow the bill \ndown and put us into some untenable position on the Senate floor in \nterms of getting this bill expeditiously done.\n  We cannot allow unrelated, partisan disagreements or Presidential-\nelection year politics to interfere with this bill and keep us from \ncompleting our job. So amendments that are offered must be relevant to \nthe bill, and we must pass it now.\n  The clock is ticking. Everything ends by the end of this summer. We \nare out of here in August. We have the 4th of July break and Memorial \nDay break coming up. In order for us to go to conference with the House \nand work out whatever differences we may have and get this back here so \nwe can finish it by late June or early July--I hope we could even \nfinish this by late June so there would not be any disruptions at all \nin the FDA and their planning for the future or in the industry itself.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in the bipartisan spirit of cooperation \nthat we have witnessed in the HELP Committee over the last year. Let us \ncome together to pass this legislation that is of critical importance \nto the American people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Support for Provisions in the FDA Safety and Innovation Act\n\n       A.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his remarks and \nwish to be associated with them. It has been a very bipartisan process \nthat has resulted in this bill coming to the floor, and I am hoping \nthere will only be relevant amendments and that there will be few of \nthose. Every amendment has the potential for disrupting the entire \nbill. This has been a very inclusive process that has led to this \nlegislation.\n  Over a year ago staff began to meet with stakeholders on the policy \nissues that are addressed in S. 3187. Starting in the spring of 2011, \nstaff from Republican and Democratic offices on the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee began a series of standing meetings. The \ngroups proceeded to meet every week for several months. They met with \nstakeholders and discussed policy solutions that each member thought \nwould solve the problem. After much discussion of the benefits, costs, \nand possible unintended consequences, members agreed to a list of \npolicy concepts. If it was not a consensus on a particular policy, then \nit\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\nwas not included. The chairman mentioned the importance of consensus, \nand that is what we worked on.\n  As this process progressed, my staff met with the Republican staff on \nthe HELP Committee for at least 2 hours every week to keep them \ninformed of everything that was happening. I personally met with the \nmembers of the committee before the markup to make sure I understood \ntheir priorities. No one office got the entirety of what they wanted. \nHowever, we did find the 80 percent of each solution we could all agree \ncould help solve whatever policy the group was working on.\n  What we see before us now is the outcome of the hard work of these \ngroups. The bill passed the committee by a voice vote. The bill \nreflects the work of every member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee. All of them have at least one provision included in \nthis legislation, and many members of the committee worked with us to \nfind consensus measures that addressed their priorities as well.\n  This legislation is a model for how the process can and should work \nno matter what the political environment. This went to committee, it \nwas worked in committee, it is now at the Senate floor, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this truly bipartisan provision \nthat reduces the debt and ensures that the United States will maintain \nits leadership in the innovation of safe and effective biomedical \nproduct.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3300-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3300-S3307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was not here to hear all of my \ncolleagues' remarks. I know there is a lot of concern about the end of \nthe year and what might happen to try to balance our budget and give us \na solid platform on which this economy could grow. But one of the \nthings that is holding us up is the Republicans' refusal to put any new \nrevenues on the table. They have been adamant and wrong and hardheaded \nand stubborn.\n  They have been very obstructionist in this way--by not being willing \nto put a penny of new revenue on the table. As a result, we have come \nto a standstill because the income coming into the Federal Treasury to \nsupport this government is at the lowest level since President \nEisenhower was President. So they can come to the floor all day long \nand criticize the President, criticize the Democrats, but in the last 2 \nyears Democrats have put over $2 trillion of cuts and reductions to \nsome very important programs on the table.\n  Some of us have even been willing to say, yes; we know we have to \nreform Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. We have also been \nwilling to speak those words which are not easy. Yet not one single \nRepublican leader, not one on either side, the House or the Senate, not \none has come to this floor in public. Now, I have heard them say it in \nprivate. I have been in meetings when they have said it. But not one \nhas come to this floor to say: We are willing to put revenues on the \ntable so we can match the cuts and move this country forward.\n  So I am a little tired of hearing them beat up on either President \nObama or the Democrats when they are more to blame for the situation we \nare in. The American people are getting tired of it too because they \ncan understand it is not 100 percent President Obama's fault. In fact, \nwhen he took office, the Titanic had already hit the iceberg because \nthey had run right smack into it with the economic philosophies and \npolicies they had. The ship was already sinking. But all they want to \ndo is--either Mitch McConnell or Jon Kyl, one day the Senator from \nArizona or the Senator from Kentucky--every day come to the floor and \ntalk about how it is the President's fault there is no way forward, \nthere is no sure path forward, when they are the ones who have put \nboulders in the way every day.\n  So I hope the people can see through it. I came to the floor to talk \nabout something else, but I am getting a little tired of hearing it \nmyself. So I am sure everyone else is as well.\n  Again, Democrats have put $2 trillion of cuts before this body, and \nwe have implemented some of them already. But we cannot run a \ngovernment on 14 percent of the GDP. The average has been about 20 to \n21 percent. So until they are willing to put some more revenues on the \ntable, we are not going to get anywhere, and we are not going to be \nable to extend the tax cuts that cost people money.\n  I hope we can do something so we can extend some tax cuts to small \nbusinesses, which I came to talk about--and you, Mr. President, know \nthis well. Instead of giving some of the biggest tax breaks to \ncompanies that are the biggest in the world and put all of their jobs \noverseas, I wish the Republicans would start talking about tax relief \nto businesses right here at home on Main Street. That is what I want to \ntalk about today.\n  (The further remarks of Ms. Landrieu are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Internet\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe the development of the Internet, \nits networks, and the digital economy are one of the great achievements \nof our age.\n  The Internet links humanity together, facilitating economic growth, \nbringing education and health resources to remote regions, reshaping \nsocieties and advancing human rights.\n  While networks foster innovation, job creation, and political and \nsocial progress, networks can also be used by actors with nefarious \nmotives. It is in our national interest to deter, detect, and destroy \nreal and viable cyber threats, to protect Americans and preserve the \nbenefits of the Internet. Americans must not be afraid to go online.\n  The Internet works not just because it is open to all but because it \nis founded on the principle of trust. Users trust that their browsers \nare visiting real Web sites, not replicated ones. Internet commerce \nsucceeds because people trust that their transactions are private and \ntheir financial information won't be shared with others. People trust \nthe Internet because they believe their service providers work for \nthem, not for their advertisers, not for scammers, and not for the \ngovernment.\n  Congress's effort to develop a comprehensive approach to \ncybersecurity must not erode that trust. When Americans go online to \nconsume digital services and goods, they must believe and know with \nsome certainty that their privacy is adequately protected. The content \nthat Americans consume must be at least as private as their library \nrecords, their video rentals, and book purchases in the brick-and-\nmortar world. Our law enforcement and intelligence agencies should not \nbe free to monitor and catalog the speech of Americans just because it \nis online.\n  But the legislation passed by the other body, known as CISPA, would \nerode that trust. As an attempt to protect our networks from real cyber \nthreats, CISPA is an example of what not to do. CISPA repeals important \nprovisions of existing electronic surveillance laws that have been on \nthe books for years, without instituting corresponding privacy, \nconfidentiality, and civil liberty safeguards. It creates uncertainty \nin place of trust, it erodes statutory and constitutional civil rights \nprotections, and it creates a surveillance regime in place of the \ntargeted, nimble, cybersecurity program that is needed to truly protect \nour Nation.\n  Unfortunately, S. 2105, the bill before the Senate, shares some of \nthese defects. Currently, Internet services and service providers have \nagreements with their customers that allow them to police and protect \ntheir networks and users. Rather than simply allowing these Internet \ncompanies to share information on users who violate their contracts and \npose a security threat, the House and Senate proposals regrettably \nauthorize a broad-based information-sharing regime that can operate \nwith impunity. This would allow the personal data of individual \nAmericans to be shared across a multitude of bureaucratic, military, \nand law enforcement agencies. This would take place regardless of the \nprivacy agreements individual Americans have with their Internet \nservice providers.\n  In fact, both the House and Senate bills subordinate all existing \nprivacy rules and constitutional principles to the poorly defined \ninterests of what is called cybersecurity.\n  These bills would allow law enforcement agencies to mine Internet \nusers' personal data for evidence of acts entirely unrelated to \ncybersecurity. More than that, they would allow law enforcement to look \nfor evidence of future crimes, opening the door to a dystopian world \nwhere law enforcement evaluates your Internet activities for the \npotential that you might commit a crime.\n  In establishing this massive new regime, these bills fail to create \nthe necessary incentives for operators of critical networks to keep \ntheir networks secure.\n  It is a fundamental principle of cybersecurity policy that any \nnetwork whose failure could result in a loss of\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nlife or significant property should be physically isolated from the \nInternet. Unfortunately, many of our critical network operators have \nviolated this principle in order to save money or streamline \noperations. This sort of gross negligence ought to be the first target \nin any cybersecurity program--not the privacy of individual Americans.\n  Congress could target this behavior with yet one more rule book and \none more bureaucracy, creating a cybersecurity contractor full \nemployment program. I am not, however, convinced this is a problem that \nrequires that kind of solution.\n\n  At the same time, Congress should not allow our critical network \noperators to ignore best practices with impunity. It is vital they \nunderstand that any liability for a preventable cyber attack is their \nresponsibility. There is not going to be a governmental bailout after \nthe fact in the cybersecurity area. Shareholders and boards of \ndirectors must be vigilant and understand the risks to their \ninvestments. Executives must understand that ignoring critical cyber \nthreats in the interest of cost savings and convenience will leave them \npersonally exposed.\n  Internet providers and backbone operators clearly have a role in this \nfight. When they detect abnormal network activity or have a user \nviolating their contract in a way that constitutes a cyber threat, they \ncan and should inform our cyber defense officials. If it is necessary \nto grant them immunity to share this kind of information, the Congress \ncould grant it--narrowly and with careful consideration.\n  Mr. President, there would be bipartisan support for the proposition \nthat the Federal Government also has a significant role that does not \nnecessarily require billing taxpayers for legions of private \ncybersecurity contractors. The Department of Defense, the Department of \nNational Intelligence, Homeland Security, and the Justice Department--\nfour major parts of our government--all have cybersecurity specialists. \nThe Congress ought to be promoting the cyber capabilities of these \nagencies and providing the resources that are needed to protect these \nnetworks. These Federal agencies should do a better job of consulting \nthe private Internet companies to better understand the attacks that \nare occurring every day across the net.\n  Some of these steps may require legislation, but many can be carried \nout by responsible actors in the public and private sector without \nwaiting for the Congress to act. However, the legislation before the \nSenate and the cybersecurity legislation that passed the other body \nleads our country away from the kind of commonsense approach to \ncybersecurity I have outlined this afternoon.\n  As they stand, these bills are an overreaction to a legitimate and \nunderstandable fear. The American people are going to respond by \nlimiting their online activities. That would be a recipe to stifle \nspeech, innovation, job creation, and social progress. I believe these \nbills will encourage the development of an industry that profits from \nfear and whose currency is Americans' private data. These bills create \na cyber industrial complex that has an interest in preserving the \nproblem to which it is the solution.\n  In terms of the process, the Senate ought to proceed in a way that is \nas open and collaborative as the Internet the Congress seeks to promote \nand protect. On substance, any cybersecurity bill must contain specific \nand clear descriptions of what types of data and when such data can be \ncaptured, with whom it can be shared, and under what circumstances. \nAnything not specifically covered ought to remain private. Privacy in \nthe cybersecurity arena should be the default not the exception. Legal \nimmunity to corporations that share information should be the exception \nnot the rule and void if privacy protections or contracts are \ndisregarded.\n  The Congress and the public must have the ability to know how any \ncybersecurity program that is established is to be implemented. That \nmeans routine public and unclassified reports and hearings to examine \nwhether there were any unintended privacy or civil liberty impacts \ncaused by the program. No secret law, Mr. President.\n  Bad Internet policy is increasingly premised on false choices. \nEarlier this year, during the consideration of the Protect IP Act and \nthe Stop Online Piracy Act, the Congress was told again it had a false \nchoice. The Congress was told it either could protect intellectual \nproperty or it could protect the integrity of the Internet. This was a \nfalse choice. I and others said so at the time because achieving one \nshould not and does not require sacrificing the other.\n  Now the Congress is being asked once again to make a false choice--a \nchoice between cybersecurity and privacy--and I don't think these two \nare mutually exclusive. I think we can have both. Our job is to write a \ncybersecurity bill that protects America's security and the fundamental \nright to privacy of our people. There is no sound policy reason to \nsacrifice the privacy rights of law-abiding American citizens in the \nname of cybersecurity. It is my intent to fight any legislation that \nwould force Members of the Senate to make that choice.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Food and \nDrug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. I believe we are going \nto have a cloture vote on this bill tonight, and I am pleased that all \nearly indications are it will pass tonight and we will move forward on \nthis bill.\n  There has been considerable time spent drafting this legislation. It \ngained bipartisan support both in House and Senate committees, and it \nis moving through what I would call a regular process. We haven't seen \ntoo much of that in the last year and a half or so. This is the regular \nprocess. For those who say Congress can't get anything done, hopefully, \nwith passage of this bill we will take a very significant step forward \nin terms of being able to provide and bring to patients, doctors, \nadministrators, and others across the Nation new drugs, new treatments, \nand new medical devices that can ensure better health, prevent \npotential terminal situations, and provide better drug availability and \ndevice availability. So I think it is very important that this \nlegislation goes forward.\n  I am pleased we have gotten to this point on a bipartisan basis. I \nthink Senators Harkin and Enzi deserve commendation for their work in \nthe Senate, and those in the House as well for bringing the bill along \non a parallel track.\n  The whole idea of this legislation is to continue to provide the \nsafest, most effective and most efficient drugs and devices for \nAmerican citizens and people around the world. These are two very \nimportant industries in which the United States has had the leading \nedge as providers and we don't want to lose that. It has meant a lot \nfor our economy, and it has meant a lot of jobs for Americans. I think \nthe passage of this bill will continue what has been a remarkable \nnearly three decades' worth of innovation that has taken place both in \nthe biopharmaceutical industry as well as the medical device industry.\n\n  Part of this bill deals with drug shortages. I have talked to a \nnumber of doctors--my staff has been traveling the State talking to \nmedical providers--and there is an alarming number of drug shortages in \ncritical drugs, particularly those designed to deal with more rare \ninstances of health problems and yet, obviously, important to those \npeople who are suffering from those incidences of disease or health \nthreats.\n  It was reported to me that last year FDA received a record number of \ndrug shortage reports--more than 250--including critical drugs used in \nsurgery, emergency care, and oncology. The problem continues today, but \nthe this bill addresses that and, hopefully, will move us forward \nsignificantly in terms of dealing with this current problem.\n  In Fort Wayne--my hometown in Indiana--Parkview Health's pharmacy \ndirector said nearly 80 percent of hospitals consistently face \nshortages in drugs needed for emergencies, including cardiac and \ndiabetic prescriptions. This bill incorporates significant reporting \nrequirements to the FDA that I hope will help mitigate this critical \nproblem. I think we are going to need to figure out ways to further \naddress this, but this can be an important first step.\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\n  The whole concept has been somewhat unique in the Federal Government; \nthat is, the makers of the products essentially pay a fee to a \nregulatory agency for the regulatory agency to conduct the work \nnecessary to gain approval to sell their drugs on the market. We have \nhad a situation which is sort of a cornucopia of new innovations in \ndrugs and medical devices. Yet they have been delayed by the \nbureaucracy or the inability of the FDA to move in an efficient, \neffective way to run this through the process.\n  The biopharmaceutical industry has basically said: Look, we are \nwilling to put up between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in new user \nfees--I believe it is over a 5-year period of time--which will account \nfor nearly 60 percent of the funding designated by the Center for Drug \nEvaluation and Research. In exchange for putting up those fees, the FDA \nhas agreed to new performance goals and process improvements that will \nreduce the time it takes drugs to reach the market.\n  So the key is to provide the funds necessary to hire the right people \nand put the right procedures in place to expedite the study and \napproval of safe, effective, efficient drugs that have been sent to the \nFDA for approval so we can get them into the market. Of course, the \nultimate goal is to get them not only into the market but use them to \nprovide health and safety benefits for the American people.\n  The Medical Device User Fee Act is also part of this. In Indiana, we \nhave not only a very large biopharmaceutical company and a number of \naffiliated companies, we also have a vibrant and dynamic medical device \nindustry. That industry employs over 20,000 Hoosiers directly and many \nmore indirectly with good-paying jobs. Many of these companies are \nright on the leading edge of new innovation and new developments. So \nincluded in the legislation that we will be voting on is a 5-year \nagreement known as the Medical Device User Fee Act that improves the \nregulatory pathway for medical devices.\n  This is the medical device equivalent of the pharmaceutical user fee. \nDevice companies have worked with the FDA, again in an agreement where \neach side contributes. The medical device manufacturers will contribute \nuser fees to go to the FDA that can be used to streamline--without \ncompromising safety in any way--the regulatory process so the approvals \ncan be made.\n  Why is this important? Well, it is important not only to getting \nthese products into the marketplace so they can be used to safely \nimprove the health of American citizens, but this is a dynamic export \nindustry where America has been the leading exporter of medical \ndevices. I have heard from so many medical device manufacturers \nthroughout Indiana that they are faced with the dilemma of having to \npotentially think about moving overseas simply because of the delays \nand the time lapse that exists for approval. They can manufacture these \nproducts overseas and get approval overseas and sell them on a \nworldwide basis much more quickly, but they do not want to do that. The \nUnited States is their home and they want to produce here, but they \nhave to compete with their competitors across the waters that are \nsubjected to fewer delays in implementing approvals.\n  To counter that, we simply want to use this medical device user fee \nin a way that will help the FDA's review process and eliminate these \nunnecessary delays, unpredictability, and inconsistency of past \npractices.\n  I do want to thank the FDA for paying significant attention to our \ndevice users by coming to Indiana and listening to them--a forum that I \nconvened. There has been interaction back and forth, whether it is FDA \ntraveling to Indiana or device manufacturers traveling here to \nWashington. I am pleased that this bill contains some items that are \nthe result of all those negotiations and all those exchanges between \nthe two.\n  Let me mention one last thing before closing, and that is the medical \ndevice tax, which is not part of this bill. To pay for the so-called \naffordable health care law, the administration included a 2.3-percent \ntax on medical devices, which will begin in 2013. That tax essentially \nwas imposed on an industry that is paying its full share of taxes, \ncontributing to the user fee, and yet it was slapped on as a way to pay \nfor the costly health care bill. That has an enormous impact over a \nperiod of time on these device manufacturers and jeopardizes \nmanufacturers' ability to remain based here in the United States rather \nthan looking overseas.\n  There are a number of States in addition to Indiana--and my colleague \nfrom Minnesota is waiting to speak, and her State is also a major \nmanufacturer and innovator of medical devices. California, Florida, \nIllinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, and Wisconsin will all suffer potential job losses if this \nmedical device tax is imposed.\n  We are not taking it up in this bill so as not to try to derail the \nbill. I understand an agreement has been made that it would be set \naside. I know Senator Hatch, on our side, is looking for an opportunity \nto bring that up in another vehicle, and I want to support that. I \nencourage my colleagues to take a look at the impact of that fee on our \nability as a nation to be the leader in innovation and export of \nmedical devices.\n  I thank Senators Harkin and Enzi for shepherding the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act through the committee. I \nbelieve this legislation will help improve patients' access to new \nmedical technology, and it will protect American jobs and improve the \nFDA so that America can remain a global leader in biomedical \ninnovation. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for \nhis words.\n  We both are from States that have a lot of jobs involved in medical \ndevices, and, in fact, this bill is something we worked on very hard. I \nam the cochair of the medical device caucus in the Senate. This has \nbeen our top priority, to try to move those FDA rules along, and this \nbill does that. It is an agreement--a rare agreement--between \ngovernment and industry, which is something both parties want. We would \nlike to move those approvals along for the patients, long-suffering \npatients who should have access to medical devices, and then also for \nthe industry, where we have seen way too much venture capital money go \nto places such as Europe simply because that process moves faster. So \nthis is a very good bill, and I am so pleased we have bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I see that the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, has come into the \nChamber, and both he and Senator Harkin deserve a lot of praise.\n  I wish to focus today on one piece of this bill, something I have \nworked very hard on, and it really came out of things I heard in my \nState, things I heard from pharmacists literally 2 years ago, things I \nhave heard from patients. I got together with our staff. I see that our \nlegislative director, Rose Baumann, and Andrew Hu, who did a lot of \nwork on this bill, are here today. We went and talked to all kinds of \npeople involved. We talked to pharmaceutical companies to try to figure \nout what was going wrong with drug shortages; we talked to the people \nwho were suffering the most--the patients; we talked to the \npharmacists, and we said: What would work here? And the FDA told us \nthat, in fact, when they did get early notification from pharmaceutical \ncompanies that there was going to be some kind of shortage, it helped. \nThey were able to avert that shortage. They have done it successfully \nover 100 times, and they have done it many times with some key drugs. \nAnd the earlier notice they have, the better it is for everyone because \nthey can, in fact, then avert the drug shortage, and that is what this \nis about.\n  I will tell you that, for me, this whole bill and this whole \nprovision really comes down to a little boy named Axel Zirbes, a young \nboy with bright eyes and a big smile. Because of leukemia, this little \nboy, when I saw him, had no hair on his head. He and his family were \nthrown into a panic about 1 year ago when they learned that an \nessential drug--cytarabine--was in short supply and might not be \navailable for their son, who they had just found out was diagnosed with \nleukemia and was supposed to start treatment, and the doctor says: You \nknow\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\nwhat, we don't know if you should start it--you should start it \nimmediately, but we don't have this critical cancer drug, this critical \nleukemia drug.\n  They decided they would take Axel to Canada, where the drug was \nreadily available, and just when they were making those plans to go \nthere, they found out that some of the drug had been located and that \nAxel could come in for his treatments. Well, that should never have \nhappened, not in the United States of America, not to a family of a \nlittle 4-year-old boy, both parents working hard to make sure their \nchild could have health care and then this happens. It makes no sense.\n  There is the story of Mary McHugh Morrison, who joined me at a forum \nI held on this topic in Edina, MN. Mary is a woman whose cancer had, \nunfortunately, returned after a shortage of Doxil. That is a \nchemotherapy drug that had kept her ovarian cancer at bay. In fact, \nthis shortage interrupted her chemotherapy regimen. Mary struggled to \nfind remaining vials of Doxil and then struggled with the ethical \ndilemmas of using the drug she found when others would not be able to \nuse it. She literally talked at the forum about how she had personally \ncalled people, used connections, tried to find those vials, and she \nrealized that when she got those drugs, other people wouldn't have \nthem.\n  Again, this shouldn't be happening in the United States of America. \nShe shared her experience with us. And because of a few delays in \ntreatment, Mary's doctor told her that her tumor had, unfortunately, \nreturned and that she was then no longer responding to that drug. This \npast February, CT scans, unfortunately, showed that Mary's tumor size \nhad doubled. She was immediately accepted into a clinical trial at the \nMayo Clinic and began treatment. Fortunately, she is so far responding \nwell and her health is improving.\n  These shortages are happening all over this country. Every single \nSenator in this Chamber has heard about one of them. You heard Senator \nCoats from Indiana talking about what he had heard. So the fact that we \nheard this first in Minnesota I don't think is any surprise. We have an \nactive State. We have people who believe you can still make a \ndifference. We have pharmacists who are on the front line every day, \nand they came to us to get this bill introduced. We heard from \nemergency medical responders, who have told me that shortages have made \nit difficult to stock lifesaving drugs in their ambulances. I have \nlistened to stories from parents whose children rely on drugs to help \nmaintain their focus at school. I have seen firsthand how doctors and \npharmacists have had to struggle to keep their patients alive as they \nlook for these drugs.\n\n  These shortages have had significant impact on these patients' \nquality of life, oftentimes forcing them to pay hundreds more for \nexpensive alternatives or risking their professional careers to adjust \nfor their diseases and spending hours and days just trying to find a \nway to fill a prescription.\n  When we are dealing with so many costs and resource issues with \nhealth care, the last we want is for doctors and nurses and pharmacists \nto be wasting away hours trying to find drugs and then ultimately, in \nmost cases, finding them, but this is no way to run a railroad. Across \nthe country, hospitals, physicians, and pharmacists are confronting \nunprecedented shortages of these drugs.\n  So those are the stories, but here are the numbers.\n  The number of drug shortages has more than tripled over the last 6 \nyears, jumping from 61 drug products--remember, there are thousands of \nshortages, but this is 61 different drug products in 2005 to more than \n200 drug product shortages in 2011.\n  A survey by the American Hospital Association found that virtually \nevery hospital in the United States has experienced shortages of \ncritical drugs in the past 6 months. More than 80 percent reported \ndelays in patient treatment due to shortages.\n  For some of these drugs, no substitutes are available or, if they \nare, they are less effective and may involve greater risk of adverse \nside effects. The chance of medical errors also rises as providers are \nforced to use second- or third-tier drugs that they are less familiar \nwith using.\n  A survey conducted by the American Hospital Association showed that \nnearly 100 percent of their hospitals experienced a shortage--100 \npercent. Another survey conducted by Premier Health System showed that \n89 percent of its hospitals and pharmacists experienced shortages that \nmay have caused a medication safety issue or an error in patient care.\n  It is clear that there are a large number of overlapping factors that \nhave resulted in these unprecedented shortages. Experts cite a number \nof factors: market consolidation, poor business incentives, \nmanufacturing problems, production delays, unexpected increases in \ndemand for a drug, inability to procure raw materials, and even the \ninfluence of the gray market. Literally, people are trying to make \nmoney off of this now. They hear there is a shortage, and they buy up \nthe supply and then sell it at a higher price. Financial decisions in \nthe pharmaceutical industry are also a major factor. Many of these \nmedications are in short supply because the companies have simply \nstopped production. They decided it didn't work for their profits to \nkeep producing them. Mergers in the drug industry have narrowed the \nfocus of product lines. As a result, some products are discontinued or \nproduction is moved to different sites, leading to delays. When drugs \nare made by only a few companies, a decision by any one drug company \ncan have a large impact. That would make sense.\n  To help correct a poor market environment or to prevent gray market \ndrugs from contaminating our medication supply chain, we must address \nthe drug shortage problem at its root. Last year I introduced the \nPreserving Access to Life-Saving Medications Act with Senator Bob \nCasey. We also have the support of Senator Collins and others. This is \na bipartisan bill that would require drug manufacturers to provide \nearly notification to the FDA whenever there is a factor that may lead \nto a shortage. We also had support from the Presiding Officer, as well \nas Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut and many other people from across \nthe Senate.\n  This bill will help the FDA take the lead in working with pharmacy \ngroups, drug manufacturers, and health care providers to better prepare \nfor impending shortages, more effectively manage shortages when they \noccur, and minimize their impact on patient care. And that is why I am \npleased that the early notification provision from my bill is included \nin the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, the one \nthat Senator Coats and I were just discussing and that we are debating \ntoday.\n  I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi for their leadership on the \nHELP Committee in bringing this legislation forward and including my \nprovision. In a bipartisan manner, the HELP Committee brought together \nseveral working groups to address a wide range of issues, from medical \ndevice innovation to drug shortages. In the drug shortage working \ngroup, we spoke with experts from patient groups, providers, drug \nmanufacturers, and the FDA to try to find an appropriate solution.\n  Ultimately, the legislation now includes many policies that I believe \nwill help address shortages. In addition to the early-notification \nrequirement, again, the FDA is going to be able to look in our own \ncountry, and if they can't find something in our own country they can \nlook at safe locations overseas. You simply can't keep these patients \nwaiting for their treatment.\n  In addition, the bill directs the FDA to improve communications \ninside and outside its walls, requires more robust record-keeping and \nreporting, and asks for studies on how pricing factors impact drug \nshortages.\n  I believe this bill represents a step forward in our ability to \nprevent these shortages--a strong step forward. With manufacturers \nproviding early notification, the FDA's drug shortage team can then \nappropriately use their tools to prevent shortages from happening. As I \nmentioned, in the last 2 years, the FDA, with more information, has \nsuccessfully prevented nearly 200 drug shortages. Imagine the hundreds \nof thousands and millions of patients that has helped. So we need to \nextend it. That is what this bill does.\n  One such example is the recent shortage of methotrexate. This is a \nvery common drug used in chemotherapy to\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\ntreat cancers such as leukemia. For me, the most devastating part about \nthe shortage is that I heard about it from the Zirbes family--the \nfamily of this little 4-year-old boy who had to suffer through the \nshortage of cytarabine earlier. Only this time, the FDA took quick \naction once it learned of this potential shortage and worked with other \nmanufacturers to boost production and helped stop the bleeding before \nthis became a major crisis. That is an example of what can happen with \nearly notification. They are allowed to then go to other manufacturers \nand find the people who can make the drug to get it to the hospitals, \nto get it to the patients. And today, with strong cooperation between \nthe FDA and pharmaceutical manufacturers, methotrexate is available for \npatients who rely on it just like that little 4-year-old boy Axel \nZirbes.\n  Together with Senator Casey, we were able to work with the HELP \nCommittee and in a bipartisan manner come up with a solution that would \ngive the FDA more tools to prevent drug shortages and ensure patients \nsuch as Axel or Mary have the drugs they need when they need them. \nRecent announcements by the FDA have proven that early notification and \ncooperation with manufacturers have helped reduce the number of drug \nshortages by over half. There have been 42 newly scarce drugs so far \nthis year, compared to 90 in the same period last year. That is \nprogress.\n  While I applaud the FDA in their efforts to address this crisis, 42 \ndrugs in shortage is still 42 too many for me. That is why it is so \nimportant to pass this provision and give the FDA the tools it needs to \nget the number down to zero.\n  I understand that early notification requirements may be a short-term \nsolution to a long-term problem. That is why I will continue to work \nwith my Senate colleagues to come up with a broad permanent solution, \none that includes methods to address the root causes of drug shortages.\n  It has been a long road to get to this point. Nearly 2 years ago I \nbegan hearing about this drug shortage issue, and when I first talked \nabout it some of the doctors said: Really? I haven't heard about it. \nNow, 2 years later, they have all heard about it. That is why we \nintroduced the Preserving Access to Lifesaving Medication Act. That is \nwhy we came together to get an agreement in this legislation. That is \nwhy the President issued an Executive order that pushed for more \nvoluntary notifications from manufacturers, and the FDA released an \ninterim final rule that broadened the scope of the current notification \nrequirement. That is why it is so important that we pass this \nlegislation.\n  Patients such as Axel or Mary should not have to be burdened with the \nadded stress and worry about whether they are going to have enough \nmedication to get through their next treatment. They have enough on \ntheir minds. Let's get this done. It is a great example of people \nworking across the aisle. When they heard something from their \nconstituents, they were willing to listen and to put this bill \ntogether. Me, I would like to have gotten it done 2 years ago, but \nlater is better than never. We can get it done this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after many months of bipartisan \nnegotiation, the Senate will proceed this evening to vote on the motion \nto proceed to consideration of the Food and Drug Administration Safety \nand Innovation Act of 2012. I hope it will receive an overwhelming vote \nso we can move ahead with it and dispense with the bill on the floor \nthis week. This bill is the product of excellent bipartisan \ncollaboration on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nwhich I chair. All Senators on the committee have been involved. Going \nback almost a year, we set up working groups. Different Senators had \ndifferent interests in different parts of the bill. They and their \nstaffs on both sides were invited, Republican and Democrat, to be \ninvolved in those working groups to put this bill together.\n  The bill passed overwhelmingly out of our committee--actually by \nvoice vote, with only two reserving their ``no'' votes. So it had \noverwhelming support on both sides in our committee.\n  This bill, of course, reauthorizes important FDA user fee agreements. \nIt modernizes the FDA's medical product authority to help boost \nAmerican innovation and ensure patients have access to the therapies \nthey need. The backbone of this legislation is the user fee agreements \nthat FDA has negotiated with industry. We must remember that a sizable \npart of FDA's budget comes from user fees that the industry agrees to \npay, that allows the FDA to hire the personnel and get the equipment \nthey need to more quickly review product applications. We need to \nreauthorize this bill to implement those agreements if we want to keep \nthe FDA running at full steam, which is critical to preserving jobs at \nboth the agency and in industry, and to ensuring that FDA has the \nresources to get safe medical products to patients quickly. Again, \nthese agreements affect all of us by helping to maintain and create \njobs in our home States. For example, in my own State of Iowa, these \nagreements will support our bioscience sector which is growing and is \nincreasing employment in our State. Implementation of these agreements \nwill continue to foster biomedical innovation and job growth throughout \nour country.\n\n  The bill before us reauthorizes the prescription drug user fee \nagreement, which is known in the nomenclature as PDUFA. The medical \ndevice user fee agreement is known as MDUFA. These will continue and \nimprove the agency's ability to speed market access to both drugs and \nmedical devices while ensuring patient safety.\n  We have a new part of the bill called the generic drug user fee \nagreement, which is expected to slash review times to a third of \ncurrent levels--from 30 months to 10 months--and will improve the speed \nwith which generic products are made available to patients. This will \ngenerate significant savings in our health care system. In the last \ndecade, from 2001 to 2010, it saved the U.S. health care system more \nthan $931 billion.\n  This agreement will ensure we continue to see those savings and that \npatients will have access to cheaper drugs when they need them. It also \nobviously means taxpayers will be saving money because many of these \ndrugs come through both Medicaid and Medicare. By having generic drugs \navailable more rapidly than they have been in the past, it will mean \ntaxpayers will save a significant amount of money in the future.\n  This bill also authorizes another new section, the biosimilars user \nfee agreement, which will further spur innovation by shepherding the \nbiologic industry as it matures.\n  These agreements are vital to FDA's ability to do its job, to the \nmedical products industry's ability to survive some very challenging \neconomic times, but, most importantly, to the patients who are the \nprimary beneficiaries of this longstanding and valuable collaboration \nbetween FDA and industry. As I said, after months of negotiations with \nour staffs, with FDA, with the industry, and with consumer groups, I \nthink they have crafted win-win agreements that they stand behind. So \nindustry is behind this bill, the FDA is behind this bill, and hundreds \nof groups throughout this country have been supporting it. They have \ndone their job and now it is time for us to do ours.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we authorize these user fee \nagreements before they expire. If we don't, the FDA will lose about 60 \npercent of its drug center budget and 20 percent of its device center \nbudget. It will have to lay off nearly 2,000 employees, which would \ngrind the drug and device approval processes to an unacceptably slow \npace, with devastating consequences for patients, jobs, for the \nindustry, and further innovations both in drugs and devices. We cannot \nlet that happen, and that is why for more than a year we have worked \nvery closely in our committee.\n  I see the ranking member, Senator Enzi, is here. We and our staffs \nhave worked together. As I said, we set up\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nthese working groups in our committee. They were not divided along any \nkind of partisan lines. They were set up along interest groups so we \nhad both Democratic and Republican Senators and their staffs working \ntogether for years.\n  I am sure I can speak for Senator Enzi when I say all along our aim \nhas been to ensure that in addition to the user fee agreements and all \nthe other things, this is the product of a consensus, bipartisan, \npolicymaking process that we have had for the last year. It was an open \nand transparent process. We had input not only from our members but \nother Senators were also involved as they had interest in this bill. \nThroughout negotiations on this bill the stakeholder community-at-large \nwas involved.\n  Again, I can assure everyone that this legislation benefited greatly \nfrom all of the diverse input from Senators on both sides, industry \nstakeholders, consumer groups, and patient groups. It is a result of \nconcerted efforts to define our common interests, and I believe these \nefforts will directly benefit patients and the U.S. biomedical \nindustry.\n  Very briefly, I want to say as a broad stroke that this bill \nauthorizes key user fee agreements for both drugs and medical devices. \nIt streamlines the device approval process while again enhancing \npatient protections.\n  We do one other thing. We modernize the FDA's global drug supply \nchain authority so we have a better handle on and better information \nand knowledge of where our products are coming from. Of the drugs \nmanufactured in this country, 80 percent of the ingredients come from \nabroad. In the past we have not had a tight handle on where they were \ncoming from and what kind of manufacturing processes were involved. \nThis bill closes that up. It gives the FDA much better authority over \nthat and much better input from where the drugs come from to make sure \nthey follow good manufacturing practices. It spurs innovation and \nincentivizes drug development for life-threatening conditions.\n  We reauthorized the pediatric trial program and improved it so we \nhave specific trial programs for pediatric drugs. Children are not just \nsmall adults. What may work for an adult in terms of a drug, we don't \njust cut the drug in half and give it to a child. Sometimes it takes \nspecialized, specific kinds of drugs for children that are not \nsomething an adult gets. So this reauthorizes and improves those trials \nfor children.\n  Senator Enzi and I and others in our committee wanted to do something \nabout preventing and mitigating drug shortages, so we have provisions \nin this bill that will do that and help prevent and mitigate these drug \nshortages by making sure the FDA gets timely information from \nmanufacturers if there is going to be any interruption at all in the \nsupply chain. Also I believe this bill increases FDA's accountability \nand transparency.\n  That is sort of a broad-brush stroke of what is in this bill. I will \nbe over in the next day perhaps getting into some more of the \nspecifics. It is imperative that we keep pace with and adapt to \ntechnological and scientific advances. Things move very rapidly in this \narea and we want to make sure we get the drugs and devices approved as \nquickly as possible, but always with keeping patient safety foremost. \nThat is the single most important aspect, to make sure that patient \nprotections will remain key. Keeping pace with the biomedical landscape \nthat changes so rapidly is the aim of this bill, to ensure the drugs \ncoming from abroad are safe, and to take appropriate measures to \nprotect our patients.\n  I believe we have a good compromise. Neither Democrats nor \nRepublicans got everything they wanted in this bill. As I have said \nbefore, I didn't get all of what I wanted in this bill. I am sure \nothers didn't either, but that is the process of a consensus. And where \nwe could not achieve consensus, we didn't allow those differences to \ndistract us from the important goal of producing a bill that everyone \ncould support.\n\n  Again, it is a true bipartisan bill that is broadly supported by the \npatient groups and industry. I have letters from over 100 groups \noutlining their support. To name a few: the Pew Charitable Trust, \nConsumers Union, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the \nGeneric Pharmaceutical Industry, the Biotech Industry Organization, \nBIO, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Advanced Medical Technology \nAssociation, American Foundation for the Blind, and many more. Those \nare just a sampling of over 100 groups.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of those groups \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are expecting that there will probably be some \namendments to this bill, and that is fine. That is the way the Senate \nshould operate. We expect all amendments to this bill will be relevant \nto the bill. I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle who want to see \nthis bill passed expeditiously would keep that in mind. If there is a \nrelevant amendment and Senators feel they want to bring that up, that \nis fine. That is the way the Senate should operate.\n  I hope nonrelevant amendments which have nothing to do with the bill \nwill not be promoted on the Senate floor. That would only slow the bill \ndown and put us into some untenable position on the Senate floor in \nterms of getting this bill expeditiously done.\n  We cannot allow unrelated, partisan disagreements or Presidential-\nelection year politics to interfere with this bill and keep us from \ncompleting our job. So amendments that are offered must be relevant to \nthe bill, and we must pass it now.\n  The clock is ticking. Everything ends by the end of this summer. We \nare out of here in August. We have the 4th of July break and Memorial \nDay break coming up. In order for us to go to conference with the House \nand work out whatever differences we may have and get this back here so \nwe can finish it by late June or early July--I hope we could even \nfinish this by late June so there would not be any disruptions at all \nin the FDA and their planning for the future or in the industry itself.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in the bipartisan spirit of cooperation \nthat we have witnessed in the HELP Committee over the last year. Let us \ncome together to pass this legislation that is of critical importance \nto the American people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Support for Provisions in the FDA Safety and Innovation Act\n\n       A.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his remarks and \nwish to be associated with them. It has been a very bipartisan process \nthat has resulted in this bill coming to the floor, and I am hoping \nthere will only be relevant amendments and that there will be few of \nthose. Every amendment has the potential for disrupting the entire \nbill. This has been a very inclusive process that has led to this \nlegislation.\n  Over a year ago staff began to meet with stakeholders on the policy \nissues that are addressed in S. 3187. Starting in the spring of 2011, \nstaff from Republican and Democratic offices on the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee began a series of standing meetings. The \ngroups proceeded to meet every week for several months. They met with \nstakeholders and discussed policy solutions that each member thought \nwould solve the problem. After much discussion of the benefits, costs, \nand possible unintended consequences, members agreed to a list of \npolicy concepts. If it was not a consensus on a particular policy, then \nit\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\nwas not included. The chairman mentioned the importance of consensus, \nand that is what we worked on.\n  As this process progressed, my staff met with the Republican staff on \nthe HELP Committee for at least 2 hours every week to keep them \ninformed of everything that was happening. I personally met with the \nmembers of the committee before the markup to make sure I understood \ntheir priorities. No one office got the entirety of what they wanted. \nHowever, we did find the 80 percent of each solution we could all agree \ncould help solve whatever policy the group was working on.\n  What we see before us now is the outcome of the hard work of these \ngroups. The bill passed the committee by a voice vote. The bill \nreflects the work of every member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee. All of them have at least one provision included in \nthis legislation, and many members of the committee worked with us to \nfind consensus measures that addressed their priorities as well.\n  This legislation is a model for how the process can and should work \nno matter what the political environment. This went to committee, it \nwas worked in committee, it is now at the Senate floor, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this truly bipartisan provision \nthat reduces the debt and ensures that the United States will maintain \nits leadership in the innovation of safe and effective biomedical \nproduct.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3307-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3307-S3316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF PAUL J. WATFORD, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Paul J. Watford, of \nCalifornia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am glad we are finally able to debate and vote on the \nnomination of Paul Watford of California to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit. As the distinguished Presiding Officer \nknows, it was 3\\1/2\\ months ago that we voted Mr. Watford out of \ncommittee. We had not been able to get an agreement to debate or vote \non this nomination since it was approved. So for the 27th time, the \nmajority leader was forced to file cloture to get an up-or-down vote on \none of President Obama's judicial nominations.\n  Thankfully enough, Senate Republicans came forward to say they are \nnot going to delay a vote or to continue a filibuster. We ought to just \nhave an up-or-down vote, which we always used to do. Hopefully, we will \nnot vote to promote a filibuster, but vote up or down, and I thank \nthose Republicans who came forward and said enough of the cloture \nvotes, let's vote.\n  This nominee, Paul Watford, is highly qualified. In fact, he has the \nhighest qualifications for the Ninth Circuit. He shouldn't be \nfilibustered. He should not require a cloture vote. He is a nominee \nwith impeccable credentials and qualifications. He served as a Federal \nprosecutor and is now a highly regarded appellate litigator in private \npractice. He served as a law clerk at the United States Supreme Court \nand at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The \nABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave Paul Watford the \nhighest possible rating they could give and they gave it to him \nunanimously. He also has the strong support of his home State Senators, \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. He has widespread support across \nthe spectrum, including known conservatives such as two former \nPresidents of the Los Angeles chapter of the Federalist Society, as \nwell as Judge Alex Kozinski, a conservative Reagan appointee who is now \nChief Judge of the Ninth Circuit. By any traditional measure, Paul \nWatford is the kind of judicial nominee who should be confirmed easily \nby an overwhelming vote--a vote of both Republicans and Democrats.\n  I had hoped after the agreement between the Democratic and Republican \nSenate leadership to begin finally considering the backlog of judicial \nnominations from last year that the Senate was at last returning to \nregular order. The refusal of Senate Republicans to consent to a debate \nand vote on this nomination for more than 3\\1/2\\ months, however, again \nrequired the Majority Leader to file cloture to end another Republican \nfilibuster.\n  Senate Republicans continue to apply what they have admitted is a \n``new standard'' to President Obama's judicial nominees. From the \nbeginning of the Obama administration, Senate Republicans abandoned the \nstandards and arguments they used to say should apply to judicial \nnominations. During the administration of the last President, a \nRepublican, they insisted that filibusters of judicial nominees were \nunconstitutional. They threatened the ``nuclear option'' in 2005 to \nguarantee up-or-down votes for each of President Bush's judicial \nnominations. Many Republican Senators declared that they would never \nsupport the filibuster of a judicial nomination.\n  Senate Republicans reversed course and filibustered President Obama's \nvery first judicial nomination, that of Judge David Hamilton of \nIndiana. They tried to prevent an up-or-down vote on that nomination \neven though he was nominated by President Obama after consultation with \nthe most senior and longest-serving Republican in the Senate, Senator \nDick Lugar of Indiana, who strongly supported the nomination. \nFortunately, the Senate rejected that unjustified filibuster and Judge \nHamilton was confirmed with Senator Lugar's support.\n  Senate Republicans previously engaged in misguided filibusters last \nyear of Goodwin Liu's nomination to the Ninth Circuit and Caitlin \nHalligan's nomination to the D.C. Circuit. Each of those nominees is \nthe kind of brilliant lawyer we should encourage to join the Federal \nbench. There were certainly no ``extraordinary circumstances'' for \nfilibustering their nominations. Senate Republicans filibustered them \nanyway, setting a new and unfortunate standard for the Senate. Those \nfilibusters demonstrated that any nominee can be filibustered based on \nconcocted controversies and baseless claims. That was unfortunate and \nunwise. Senate Republicans have already succeeded in preventing \nconfirmation votes on five of President Obama's judicial nominees who \nwere blocked from a Senate vote after being voted out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Paul Watford is the kind of person we want in our Federal judiciary. \nThis is the kind of person when we talk about the Federal courts, we \ncan say here is a judge we can look up to and who can inspire others \nwho seek to be judges. He is not a nominee against whom a partisan \nfilibuster would be justifiable, and I thank some of those Republican \nSenators who called me this weekend who said they would oppose a \nRepublican filibuster. I thank them for that, because what they are \ndoing is what is best for the Senate. By allowing a vote, they are \ndoing the best for the Ninth Circuit but, even more importantly, they \nare doing what is best for the independence of our Federal judiciary. \nBecause if one is going to vote to try to block somebody as qualified \nas Paul Watford, one is basically saying they don't care who the \nnominee is, they are going to block it, and that is not the message we \nshould send if we are going to have an independent Federal judiciary in \nthis country.\n  He has a mainstream record. He demonstrates legal excellence and \nexperience at the top of his profession. He clerked at the United \nStates Supreme Court for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and on the Ninth \nCircuit for now-Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, a conservative appointee of \nPresident Ronald Reagan. Over his 17-year legal career, Paul Watford \nhas worked on briefs in nearly 20 cases before the United States \nSupreme Court, and has argued numerous cases before the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals as well as the California appellate courts. As a \nFederal prosecutor in the 1990s, Mr. Watford handled prosecutions \ninvolving immigration and drug offenses, firearms trafficking, and \nmajor frauds.\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\n  So he should be on the Ninth Circuit, and I am delighted, as I make a \npreliminary nose count, that he will be confirmed as a judge of the \nNinth Circuit. When confirmed, he will be only the second African-\nAmerican judge serving on the Ninth Circuit, joining Judge Johnnie \nRawlinson of Nevada on the bench. And I will not be surprised when he \nis confirmed, because of his work as a tough but very fair prosecutor. \nIt is no surprise that he had support from conservatives as well as \nliberals. The shock I had was that for a while, his nomination was \nbeing held up and we couldn't get a vote.\n  Two former presidents of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Federalist \nSociety wrote to the Judiciary Committee in support of Mr. Watford. \nJeremy Rosen wrote:\n\n       Everyone who knows Paul (whether they are conservative or \n     liberal, or somewhere in between) recognizes that he \n     possesses the qualities that are most needed in an appellate \n     judge. While I find myself in somewhat frequent disagreement \n     with the President on many issues (and an active supporter of \n     one of his opponents), his nomination of Paul to the Ninth \n     Circuit is a home-run and should receive bi-partisan support.\n\n  Henry Weissman, another former Federal Society chapter President, \nwrote that he has ``never seen any hint of politics in Mr. Watford's \nlawyering'', and that he has ``every confidence that, as a judge, Mr. \nWatford would apply the law faithfully, objectively, and even-\nhandedly.''\n  Conservative law professor Eugene Volokh of UCLA Law and creator of \nthe conservative Volokh Conspiracy blog, expressed his strong support \nfor Mr. Watford to the Committee, writing:\n\n       He has all the qualities that an appellate judge ought to \n     have: intellectual brilliance, thoughtfulness, fairness, \n     collegiality, an ability to deal civilly and productively \n     with colleagues of all ideological stripes, and a deep \n     capacity for hard work. . . . Paul is the sort of moderate \n     Democratic nominee that moderates and conservatives, as well \n     as liberals, should solidly support.\n\n  Conservative law professor Orin Kerr of George Washington University \nLaw, a former special counsel to Senator Cornyn, called him ``extremely \nbright, a moderate, and very much a lawyer's lawyer,'' and concluded an \nonline post saying, ``I hope he will be confirmed.''\n  In their letter of support, 32 of the clerks who served with him at \nthe Supreme Court from the chamber of all the other Justices concluded: \n``We are unanimous in our view that Paul possesses all the qualities of \nthe most highly regarded jurists: powerful analytical abilities, a \nreadiness to listen to and consider fairly all points of view, a calm \ntemperament, and a prodigious work ethic.''\n  A number of corporate general counsels from leading U.S. corporations \nhave written us urging confirmation:\n\n       Mr. Watford has represented a broad spectrum of clients, \n     both in private industry as well as in the public sector. In \n     doing so, he has demonstrated an understanding of the legal \n     and economic challenges faced in both spheres, and an \n     appreciation for the importance of fair, consistent \n     application of the rules of law that govern business.\n\n  The assistant general counsel of Mattel joins in this support, \nwriting: ``[I can] personally attest to his reputation for being \nremarkably intelligent, insightful and evenhanded. He is highly \nregarded within his firm, amongst his clients, and within the wider \nlegal community for his exceptional skills as an appellate \npractitioner.''\n  Daniel Collins, an Associate Deputy Attorney General during the \nadministration of President George W. Bush, described Paul Watford as \n``incredibly intelligent and has solid integrity and great judgment.'' \nHe concluded that this judicial nominee would not ``approach the job \nwith any kind of agenda other than to do what is right and consistent \nwith precedent as he understands it.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of letters of support be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Paul Watford is far from an ideological, partisan \nselection. He shouldn't engender any serious objection; he is too good \nfor that. He is the kind of nominee who, as my years here in the Senate \ndemonstrate, normally receives unanimous support. It would usually not \neven require a roll call vote, because he has the qualifications, the \njudgment, and the ability. Maybe some were concerned that he was too \nwell qualified or relatively young, and so some feared he might some \nday be nominated to a still higher court so they wanted to avoid voting \non his nomination as they did when Elena Kagan was nominated to the \nD.C. Circuit by President Clinton, or when they delayed a vote as they \ndid with Judge Sonia Sotomayor when she was nominated to the Second \nCircuit by President Clinton.\n  I strongly disagree with those who seek to nitpick this man's legal \ncareer. Since his service as a Federal prosecutor, he has worked at a \nhighly respected Los Angeles law firm on a wide variety of matters. He \nhas always represented his clients ethically and to the best of his \nlegal ability.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer, who has been an attorney general \nof his State, knows that lawyers are supposed to give their best \ncounsel and their best effort to those whom they are representing. That \nis what lawyers are supposed to do. In my case, I defended criminals in \nprivate practice. I then prosecuted criminals as a prosecutor. In both \ncases, I knew what my role in the legal system was. As I said, that is \nwhat lawyers are supposed to do. Actually, that is what Republicans \nused to argue to defend the Federalist Society and corporate lawyers \nthat were being nominated by a Republican President.\n  As Chief Justice Roberts noted during his confirmation hearing, \nlawyers represent clients. They do not stand in their client's shoes \nand they should not have their client's legal positions used against \nthem.\n  Let's abandon the crude and inaccurate litmus tests being applied to \nPresident Obama's nominees. Let's stop the caricaturing. If not, no \nlawyer could ever be confirmed to the Federal bench. When we have a \nlawyer who has actually been active in his or her practice, of course \nthey are going to represent some people others disagree with. Of \ncourse, they are going to represent some issues where others may, as \nindividual Senators, feel they would rather be on the other side of the \nissue. But how quickly would our legal system break down if lawyers \ncould only represent one side of an issue, or when a matter comes to \ncourt we can only hear from one side and not from the other? One of the \nmost valued legal systems in the world would disintegrate.\n  As an attorney in private practice Paul Watford has advocated \npositions well within the mainstream of legal argument. There were only \ntwo cases on which he worked as a lawyer among the hundreds and \npossibly thousands in which he has been involved, that were criticized \nby Committee Republicans.\n\n  In one, the well-known law firm with which he is affiliated \nrepresented groups challenging the controversial Arizona immigration \nlaw, and won a preliminary injunction against certain provisions for \nviolating the Constitution. In his role as an attorney he was consulted \nby others working on the case to review and edit their preliminary \ninjunction motion. That motion contains arguments based on Federal \npreemption, due process, and other constitutional rights that are well \nwithin the mainstream of legal advocacy and that were raised, as well, \nby the U.S. Department of Justice in its filings. That a Senator might \ndisagree with the position he assisted in developing on behalf of his \nfirm's clients in this case is hardly a reason to oppose his \nnomination. I did not oppose Chief Justice Roberts' nomination because \nhe helped and advised the challenge resulting in Bush v. Gore. Paul \nWatford's legal work at Munger, Tolles was professional, principled and \nnot out of the mainstream.\n  The other case on which critics have fastened as if to justify their \nopposition was his legal advocacy on behalf of clinical ethicists and \ncritical care providers challenging a specific lethal injection \nprotocol. He did not challenge the death penalty as unconstitutional. \nThe legal challenge was to the manner in which it was being \nadministered. In fact, in direct and express answers to questions from \nSenator Grassley, the nominee wrote that he does not have any personal \nconviction or religious beliefs that would impact the way he would rule \nin a death penalty case and that he would have no difficulty ruling\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\nfairly and impartially in cases involving the death penalty. He also \nanswered that he believes the death penalty an acceptable form of \npunishment and that he would have no difficulty faithfully applying the \nSupreme Court's precedent in that regard. How this record can be seen \nas justifying opposition is beyond me.\n  Our legal system is an adversary system that is predicated upon legal \nadvocacy from both sides. No nominee should be disqualified for \nrepresenting clients zealously. Go back in history. John Adams, one of \nthe most revered Founders and later President of this country, wrote \nthat his representation of the British soldiers in the controversial \ncase regarding the Boston Massacre was ``one of the most gallant, \ngenerous, manly and disinterested actions of my whole life, and one of \nthe best pieces of service I ever rendered my country.''\n  Did he agree with the British in holding the colonies subservient? Of \ncourse not. Did he agree with the efforts of us in this country to be \nfree people--free from alliance with Great Britain? Of course he did. \nThat is what he did when he helped and when he served as one of the \nFounders of this country and when he became President. But he also knew \nour whole system broke down if somebody within a court did not have \nadequate representation on both sides, and that is why he represented \nBritish soldiers in the case involving the Boston Massacre--not because \nhe was supportive of what the British were doing and not because he \nwanted anything other than to have us as a free people, but because he \nwanted to make sure that in a free country, in a free United States of \nAmerica, when someone goes before our courts, they are going to have \nrepresentation on both sides, and that is the way it should be.\n  At his confirmation hearing to become the Chief Justice of the United \nStates, John Roberts made the point:\n\n       [I]t's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back \n     before the founding of the country that lawyers are not \n     identified with the positions of their clients. The most \n     famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the \n     British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that \n     for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution \n     in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule \n     of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.\n       Our Founders thought that they were not being given their \n     rights under the British system to which they were entitled, \n     and by representing the British soldiers, he helped show that \n     what they were about was defending the rule of law, not \n     undermining it, and that principle, that you don't identify \n     the lawyer with the particular views of the client, or the \n     views that the lawyer advances on behalf of the client, is \n     critical to the fair administration of justice.\n\n  That has always been our tradition. I hope it always will be our \ntradition, but I am concerned that some feel it should change. This \nlitmus test that would disqualify nominees because as a lawyer they \nrepresented a side in a case on which we disagree is dangerous and \nwrong. Almost every nominee who has actually been a practicing attorney \nwho has had more than one client in their life is going to fail such a \ntest. They are going to be disqualified, because if they are practicing \nlaw, if they are doing what they are supposed to do, if they are making \nsure that someone is adequately represented in court no matter how \nunpopular that case may be, then of course they are going to take on \nsome cases we might not like. The distinguished Presiding Officer was \nthe chief prosecuting officer of his State. I was the chief prosecuting \nofficer of my county. I prosecuted some people whom I wanted to go to \njail for as long as possible. But the last thing I wanted was for them \nnot to have a good and adequate lawyer on the other side. I wanted them \nto have the best of counsel on the other side, because that way, \nsociety is protected. That way, our court system is protected. That \nway, it meant that if any one of us came in and were innocent and were \nbeing charged, we would know there was an example of always having \nrepresentation.\n  Republican obstruction of this nomination is particularly damaging \ngiven the dire need for judges on the Ninth Circuit. With three times \nthe number of cases pending as the next busiest circuit and twice the \ncaseload of the judges on other circuits, the Ninth Circuit cannot \nafford further delay filling its emergency vacancies. The 61 million \npeople served by the Ninth Circuit are not served by this delay. I have \nbeen asked for months that the Senate expedite consideration of this \nnomination and that of Justice Hurwitz of Arizona to fill these \njudicial emergency vacancies.\n  The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan \nappointee, along with the members of the Judicial Council of the Ninth \nCircuit, wrote to the Senate months ago emphasizing the Ninth Circuit's \n``desperate need for judges,'' urging the Senate to ``act on judicial \nnominees without delay,'' and concluding ``we fear that the public will \nsuffer unless our vacancies are filled very promptly.'' The judicial \nemergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit are harming litigants by \ncreating unnecessary and costly delays. The Administrative Office of \nU.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly five months longer for the \nNinth Circuit to issue an opinion after an appeal is filed, compared to \nall other circuits. The Ninth Circuit's backlog of pending cases far \nexceeds other Federal courts. As of September 2011, the Ninth Circuit \nhad 14,041 cases pending before it, far more than any other circuit.\n  When Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit for positions she took while representing \nthe State of New York, they contended that their underlying concern was \nthat the caseload of the D.C. Circuit did not justify the appointment \nof another judge to that Circuit. I disagreed with their treatment \nof Caitlin Halligan, their shifting standards and their purported \ncaseload argument. But if caseloads were really a concern, Senate \nRepublicans would not have delayed action on this nomination to a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the overburdened Ninth Circuit for more \nthan 3 months.\n\n  There is no justification for refusing to address the needs of the \nNinth Circuit. A few years ago the Senate was forced to invoke cloture \nto overcome Republican filibusters of President Clinton's nominations \nof Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit. That \nobstruction is being repeated.\n  We did not engage in tit for tat when the presidency changed. During \nthe Bush administration, the Senate proceeded to confirm seven of the \nnine Ninth Circuit nominees of President Bush. Four of President Bush's \nNinth Circuit nominees were confirmed during his first 4-year term: \nJudge Richard Clifton, Judge Jay Bybee, Judge Consuelo Callahan, and \nJudge Carlos Bea.\n  By contrast, Senate Republicans have been opposing our moving forward \nto consider and confirm Paul Watford and Andrew Hurwitz, who are both \nstrongly supported by their home State Senators, to fill judicial \nemergency vacancies. Senate Republicans have already successfully \nfilibustered the nomination of Goodwin Liu, who also had the strong \nsupport of his home State Senators.\n  I urge Senators to show that we can work together to reduce the \nvacancies that are burdening the Federal judiciary. Do what some of my \nfriends on the Republican side of the aisle have said to me, which is \nto move forward to vote for this nominee. They should also help the \nmillions of Americans who rely on our Federal courts who seek justice. \nWe can show we intend to do that. We can start right here by voting to \nconfirm this good man, Paul Watford, who is a highly qualified nominee \nto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and say to the American people, \nwe believe in justice for everybody here.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                     Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar\n\n\n                                                  & Scott LLP,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 30, 2012.\n     Re Paul Watford.\n\n     Hon.

Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We write to provide our enthusiastic support \n     for Paul Watford's nomination to serve on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\n       We have known Paul personally and professionally for nearly \n     twenty years, having met him in 1994 when we served together \n     as clerks to Judge Kozinski on the Ninth Circuit. One of us \n     also spent a second year working with Paul during the year he \n     spent as clerk to Justice Ginsburg at the United States \n     Supreme Court.\n       During the crucible those intense years, we learned a lot \n     about Paul's approach to legal issues, his attitudes about \n     legal rules and precedents, and perhaps most importantly his \n     demeanor when confronted with competing views of what the law \n     is or should be. Paul is intelligent, thoughtful, balanced \n     and fair. He is moderate, not extreme, in his views. As a \n     serious student of the law, his instinct is to look for the \n     answer dictated by precedent, not his personal views. And \n     even in the face of heated debate, he maintains an even keel, \n     demonstrating a temperament that is well-suited to the act of \n     judging.\n       Others can and no doubt will speak to Paul's obvious \n     qualifications, including his demonstrable intelligence and \n     distinguished professional career. We can speak, from both \n     sides of the political aisle (one registered Democrat, one \n     registered Republican), to the personal qualities and \n     temperament that make Paul not only qualified but uniquely \n     well-suited to the position to which he has been nominated. \n     We could go on (and on) with our praise for Paul, but the \n     simple fact is that he will make an excellent judge.\n       We urge you to bring Paul's nomination to a vote, and to \n     vote to confirm.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Sean W. Gallagher,\n     Mark S. Ouweleen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 15, 2012.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell, We \n     write in strong support of Paul Watford's nomination to be a \n     Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit. All of us served as law clerks at the Supreme Court \n     during the same year that Paul clerked for Justice Ruth Bader \n     Ginsburg (the October 1995 Term of the Court). During that \n     time, some of us worked with Paul directly in Justice \n     Ginsburg's chambers; others of us worked directly with Paul \n     on cases that we were assigned to in common; and all of us \n     got to know Paul as a colleague. Based on what we saw then, \n     and what we know of Paul's career in the years since, we \n     believe that Paul is a superb choice to be a Judge on the \n     Ninth Circuit. We encourage you to support his nomination and \n     to bring it to a vote expeditiously.\n       Paul came to the Supreme Court after clerking for Circuit \n     Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan appointee, and after attending \n     UCLA Law School. His path to a Supreme Court clerkship \n     reflected his work ethic and his legal acumen. At the Supreme \n     Court, Paul brought those qualities to bear in analyzing \n     difficult legal problems and finding ways to explain them \n     clearly and sensibly. In so doing, Paul won respect from \n     everyone he worked with. Paul invariably got along well with \n     his peers, was always a superb listener, and treated everyone \n     with kindness and respect. Those of us who clerked with Paul \n     for Justice Ginsburg know that she praised his work as \n     exemplary and that she is a tough judge of legal talent.\n       After leaving the Court, Paul has had a distinguished legal \n     career in public service and private practice. At the United \n     States Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, Paul was a standout \n     lawyer in the criminal division and appeared regularly before \n     the Ninth Circuit. For many years, Paul has been a partner at \n     Munger, Tolles & Olson, where he helps lead that firm's \n     appellate practice and has represented a wide range of \n     commercial clients in important and complex appellate \n     matters. Paul has been a lawyer representative to the Ninth \n     Circuit Judicial Conference, and has achieved distinction in \n     the profession. Given his experience as a law clerk, as a \n     federal prosecutor, and as a lawyer in private practice, Paul \n     has an ideal background for the position of a Circuit Judge.\n       The group below is composed of individuals with very \n     different political viewpoints and represents clerks from the \n     chambers of every Justice on the Supreme Court during the \n     OT95 term. We are unanimous in our view that Paul possesses \n     all the qualities characteristic of the most highly regarded \n     jurists: powerful analytical abilities, a readiness to listen \n     to and consider fairly all points of view, a calm \n     temperament, and a prodigious work ethic. We respectfully \n     request that the Senate bring Paul's nomination to a vote and \n     confirm him to the Ninth Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n         Julia Ambrose, David Barron, Stuart Benjamin, Yochai \n           Benkler, Steve Chanenson, Nancy Combs, Jeff Dobbins, \n           Charlie Duggan, Ward Farnsworth, Lisa Beattie \n           Frelinghuysen, Shawn Fagan, Sean Gallagher, Heather \n           Gerken, Craig Goldblatt, Mark Harris, Julie Katzman, \n           Joseph Kearney, Steve Kinnaird, Kelly Klaus, Laurie \n           Allen Mullig, Eileen Mullen, Kate Moore, Jennifer \n           Newstead, Gretchen Rubin, Kevin Russell, Maria Simon, \n           Simon Steel, Ted Ullyot, Phil Weiser, Mike Wishnie, \n           Michael Wong, Ernie Young.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 522 Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 433 \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 361A Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 135 \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Grassley: We write in \n     support of the nomination of Paul J. Watford to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Like Mr. \n     Watford, we have all clerked for the Honorable Alex Kozinski \n     of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and we \n     wish to echo the strong support that Chief Judge Kozinski has \n     given to Mr. Watford.\n       All of us believe that Mr. Watford has the ability and \n     character to be an excellent federal appellate judge. Mr. \n     Watford has a stellar reputation in the legal community. He \n     is known not only for his intelligence, but also for his \n     collegiality and even temperament. For those of us who know \n     Mr. Watford personally, his graciousness, sincerity and \n     brilliance are immediately apparent.\n       Mr. Watford's legal career confirms that he has the \n     experience, skills and demeanor well-suited for the bench. He \n     clerked for two distinguished jurists, then-Judge Kozinski on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Justice \n     Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court of the United \n     States. He served in the Department of Justice as an \n     Assistant United States Attorney in the Central District of \n     California. Mr. Watford is currently a partner in the Los \n     Angeles office of Munger, Tolles, & Olson LLP, a well-\n     respected law firm. He also has taught a course on judicial \n     writing for prospective law clerks at USC's Gould School of \n     Law. In his experiences in public service and private \n     practice, Mr. Watford has gained the respect and admiration \n     of his peers. At every stage of his career, he has \n     demonstrated a strong work ethic, a judicious temperament, \n     unquestionable 1 integrity, a collaborative and respectful \n     manner, and a deeply thoughtful approach to each and every \n     issue that has crossed his desk.\n       As a close family of Kozinski clerks, we share Chief Judge \n     Kozinski's strong faith in Mr. Watford's abilities. We \n     believe he has the necessary qualifications and \n     characteristics to make an exemplary federal appellate judge. \n     Based on his record and personality, we have no doubt that \n     Mr. Watford would approach each case with an open mind and \n     make thoughtful judgments based on the law. Accordingly, we \n     recommend him for this position without hesitation or \n     reservation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Jerry L.

Watford as Circuit Judge of the U.S. \n         Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     to express our support for the nomination of Paul J. Watford \n     to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and urge \n     that the Committee promptly and favorably act to send his \n     nomination to the floor for confirmation. We are General \n     Counsels of a broad spectrum of American businesses. \n     Everything we know about Mr. Watford, both from the direct \n     contact some of us have had to others who have only seen his \n     work, indicates that he would be a superb addition to the \n     bench.\n       For the last 11 years of private practice at one of the \n     nation's premier law firms, Mr. Watford has represented a \n     broad spectrum of clients, both in private industry as well \n     as in the public sector. In doing so, he has demonstrated an \n     understanding of the legal and economic challenges faced in \n     both spheres, and an appreciation for the importance of fair, \n     consistent application of the rules of law that govern \n     business. The jobs, goods and services that constitute our \n     economy require exactly that objective and impartial approach \n     to deciding the important legal principles that come before a \n     court such as the Ninth Circuit. We have every confidence \n     that Mr. Watford has the right experience, intellect and \n     character for such an important role in the judiciary.\n       It also is noteworthy that Mr. Watford's experiences prior \n     to joining private practice demonstrate the same even-handed \n     perspective. He served as a law clerk on the Ninth Circuit \n     and on the Supreme Court to jurists who are known to come at \n     issues from very different places and often end at very \n     different conclusions. Working closely with such diverse \n     intellects is emblematic of Mr. Watford's own capabilities \n     and temperament, and his legal talents are reflective of \n     their skills as well. He is a superb writer, a keen \n     intellect, a strong oral advocate, and someone with a genuine \n     appreciation for the real interests on all sides. He is \n     exactly the kind of individual that any plaintiff or \n     defendant--person, business or government--would welcome \n     deciding their case, and would trust would do so fairly.\n       We urge the Committee to swiftly and favorably act on Mr. \n     Watford's nomination.\n           Respectfully,\n         Alan J. Glass, Vice President, General Counsel & \n           Secretary, CIRCOR International, Inc.; Randal S.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, 224 Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, 224 Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I write this \n     letter in support of the nomination of Paul Watford to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I have \n     known Paul on a professional basis for a number of years, and \n     can personally attest to his reputation for being remarkably \n     intelligent, insightful and evenhanded. He is highly regarded \n     within his firm, amongst his clients, and within the wider \n     legal community for his exceptional skills as an appellate \n     practitioner. More importantly, he is remarkably sincere and \n     friendly, and working with him is always a pleasure.\n       Paul enjoys an exemplary record as an attorney: UCLA Law \n     Review Editor, clerk to Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth \n     Circuit, clerk to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the U.S. \n     Supreme Court, Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, and \n     currently, a partner at the esteemed firm of Munger, Tolles & \n     Olson. Paul has had significant, substantive involvement in \n     bar association activities; most notably, he served as the \n     Chair of the ABA Litigation Section's Appellate Practice \n     Committee, and on the ABA's Amicus Curiae Committee. In \n     addition, Paul shares his talent and time with the broader \n     community, serving on the board of a non-profit legal \n     services provider for low income clients and teaching upper-\n     division legal writing at USC. Certainly, Paul's resume is \n     testament to his stellar qualifications and his dedication to \n     the law.\n       Paul has assisted Mattel with several appellate matters. \n     His analysis, reasoning and writing is of the highest \n     caliber. His performance as a ``judge'' on a moot court \n     panel, however, is what stands out most in my mind. His \n     questions went right to the core issues, his follow-up \n     questioning was quick and insightful, and his discussion of \n     legal nuances and distinctions came easily and naturally. As \n     always, his demeanor was thoughtful, attentive and \n     respectful. Paul has all the hallmarks of an excellent \n     jurist, and I highly endorse his appointment to the Ninth \n     Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jill E. Thomas.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I rise today to support Paul Watford, a California \nnominee for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals whose nomination is \nbefore us today.\n  Mr. Watford has been nominated for a seat that is designated as a \njudicial emergency, which means that it is critical we move swiftly to \nconfirm him.\n  I was pleased when President Obama nominated Mr. Watford to serve on \nthe U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He has a wide breadth of \nexperience, ranging from public service to the private sector, and he \nwill make an excellent addition to the federal bench.\n  Let me say a few words about his background.\n  Mr. Watford was born in Garden Grove, CA. He is a graduate of the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley, and received his law degree from \nthe University of California at Los Angeles, where he graduated with \nhonors and was an editor of the UCLA Law Review.\n  Following law school, he clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, then clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \non the United States Supreme Court.\n  From 1997 through 2000, Mr. Watford served as a federal prosecutor in \nthe United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of \nCalifornia, where he handled a variety of criminal trial and appellate \nmatters for the office, including major fraud investigations.\n  After his tenure as a prosecutor, Mr. Watford entered private \npractice--first with Sidley & Austin, then with his current law firm, \nMunger Tolles, where he is a partner specializing in appellate casework \nand complex commercial litigation.\n  In addition to his record as a lawyer, Mr. Watford has served in bar \nassociations and professional committees. He has served as Co-Chair of \nthe American Bar Association's Appellate Practice Committee, and he is \na member of the Central District Court's Magistrate Selection Panel.\n  The American Bar Association has given him their highest rating--\nunanimously well qualified.\n  Mr. Watford has earned the respect of attorneys who know his work. \nFor example, Daniel Collins, who clerked for Justice Scalia and served \nas an attorney in both Bush administrations, said this about Mr. \nWatford:\n\n       He just embodies the definition of judicial temperament--\n     very level-headed and even-keeled. . . . I don't think he'll \n     approach the job with any kind of agenda other than to do \n     what is right and consistent with precedent as he understands \n     it.\n\n  And Jeremy Rosen, a partner at Horvitz & Levy and former president of \nthe Los Angeles Lawyers Chapter of the Federalist Society, said Mr. \nWatford is a nominee many conservatives could support:\n\n       I know he has the respect of anyone who has come into \n     contact with him. He is exceptionally bright and well \n     qualified. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nDaniel Collins, Jeremy Rosen, Eugene Volokh and Henry Weissmann \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. In conclusion, Mr. Watford is a talented lawyer who has \nearned the respect of his peers for his work in the public and private \nsectors. He will be a great addition to the federal bench, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in voting for him today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    Los Angeles, CA, May 18, 2012.\n     Re Nomination of Paul J. Watford as Circuit Judge, United \n         States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 522 Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, 473 \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, 317 Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, 135 \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I write to express my strong support for the \n     confirmation of Paul J. Watford to be a Circuit Judge on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Having \n     known and worked with Paul for more than eight years at \n     Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP in Los Angeles, I am confident \n     that he has the skills, judgment, temperament, and integrity \n     to be an outstanding appellate judge.\n       Paul and I come from opposite ends of the political \n     spectrum. I have been a conservative Republican for my entire \n     adult life, I am a member and supporter of the Federalist \n     Society, and I served in the Justice Department in \n     Washington, D.C. during the Administrations of both George \n     H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Despite our political \n     differences, I can unreservedly support Paul's nomination \n     because I believe that he understands and respects the \n     crucial distinction between law and politics. I say that \n     based on years of having observed how he approaches legal \n     precedent and how he analyzes complex legal arguments.\n       During our time together at Munger, Tolles, I have \n     frequently consulted Paul on many difficult legal issues, and \n     he has served many times as a ``moot court'' judge helping me \n     to prepare for oral arguments. Given Paul's brilliance and \n     honesty, I know that I can always count on him to quickly \n     spot the weak points in a legal argument and to give me a \n     frank and professional assessment of the applicable case law. \n     Few traits are more important in a Circuit Judge than a \n     willingness to adhere faithfully to precedent, and I have \n     always been impressed by the thoroughness, objectivity, and \n     candor that Paul brings to bear in his evaluation of the \n     relevant body of law in any given area.\n       I strongly agree that judges must respect the proper limits \n     of their office and should not attempt to implement a \n     personal or ideological agenda from the bench. I believe that \n     Paul understands those limits. While he and I may differ on \n     certain jurisprudential issues, I have always been impressed \n     by the even-handed and measured approach he brings to bear in \n     analyzing legal problems. I feel confident that, on the \n     bench, he would do his level best to fairly reach the correct \n     answer under the law as be sees it.\n       To my mind, another indication of Paul's fairmindedness, \n     and of his ability to separate law and politics, is the wide \n     range of the matters on which he has worked. Paul has \n     gravitated to many of the most interesting legal matters in \n     the firm, and that has unsurprisingly led him to work on \n     important matters involving controversial issues that may \n     generate strong reactions on one or the other end of the \n     political spectrum. I do not think that Paul's work on these \n     or any other cases can be viewed as suggesting that he has an \n     ideological agenda that would distort his approach to the law \n     on the bench. Indeed, one of the more controversial cases \n     that Paul worked on was Mohamad v. Jeppesen DataPlan Inc., in \n     which he and I represented the defendant company, which was \n     accused by the plaintiffs (who were represented by the ACLU) \n     of assisting the CIA in carrying out its alleged \n     ``extraordinary rendition'' program. That Paul has shown a \n     willingness to work, with great professionalism, on such a \n     diverse set of important matters seems to me to dispel any \n     concern that his approach to judging would be anything other \n     than evenhanded. Paul has always struck me as a lawyer's \n     lawyer and as refreshingly oblivious to ``political'' \n     concerns. On the bench, he'd be a judge's judge.\n       Lastly, I would note that Paul has an outstanding \n     disposition. Anyone who has met him for any length of time \n     cannot fail to be impressed by his graciousness and \n     professional demeanor. He is without guile. On the bench, he \n     would epitomize judicial temperament.\n       I recognize the importance of the decision to confirm an \n     individual to a lifetime appointment as a federal appellate \n     judge. I am confident that Paul Watford has the talent, \n     fairness, and integrity to be an excellent jurist, and I am \n     pleased to support his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel P. Collins.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Horvitz & Levy LLP,\n\n                                     Encino, CA, January 26, 2012.\n     Re Nomination of Paul Watford.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I write this \n     letter in support of the nomination of Paul Watford to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I have \n     known Paul for over a decade, first as a colleague and then \n     as a friendly competitor in the relatively small California \n     appellate bar.\n       By way of background, I am a partner at Horvitz & Levy LLP, \n     the largest civil appellate law firm in California. My \n     practice primarily focuses on handling appeals in the Ninth \n     Circuit and California appellate courts. At the outset of my \n     career, I had the privilege of serving as a law clerk for a \n     judge on the Ninth Circuit. I am also a member of the \n     National Chamber Litigation Center's California Advisory \n     Committee and past president of the Los Angeles Chapter of \n     the Federalist Society.\n       While I find myself in somewhat frequent disagreement with \n     the President on many issues (and an active supporter of one \n     of his opponents), his nomination of Paul to the Ninth \n     Circuit is a home-run and should receive bi-partisan support. \n     As an appellate lawyer, I care deeply about our nation's \n     appellate courts and see on a daily basis the important role \n     they play in our society. For appellate courts to effectively \n     serve the public, it is vitally important that brilliant, \n     collegial, and fair-minded men and women serve as appellate \n     judges. Paul Watford is such a person.\n       Paul graduated with honors from UCLA Law School and then \n     served as a law clerk to two extremely distinguished judges \n     (one Republican and one Democrat), Alex Kozinski and Ruth \n     Bader Ginsberg. Paul then served the public admirably as an \n     assistant United States Attorney. Since 2000, Paul has been \n     an extremely distinguished appellate lawyer in private \n     practice where he has handled many complex and sophisticated \n     appeals. Throughout his career, Paul has shown himself to \n     possess excellent legal analysis and judgment. Indeed, there \n     are few lawyers in California (or elsewhere) who are better \n     prepared for the intellectual challenges of becoming an \n     appellate judge.\n       Most lawyers who have achieved as much as Paul tend to be \n     unpleasant egomaniacs. Not Paul. He is humble, polite and a \n     good listener. I have no doubt that he will have collegial \n     relations with the other judges on the Ninth Circuit. I also \n     have no doubt that Paul will be fair-minded and will \n     carefully apply the relevant legal precedent to each case he \n     decides. Through his clerking experience, and his public and \n     private practice, Paul has always demonstrated high integrity \n     and ethics.\n       In short, everyone who knows Paul (whether they are \n     conservative or liberal, or somewhere in between) recognizes \n     that he possesses the qualities that are most needed in an \n     appellate judge. Given the urgent need to fill vacancies in \n     the Ninth Circuit, I would strongly urge the Senate to \n     swiftly confirm Paul.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Jeremy B. Rosen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         University of California,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                Los Angeles, CA, January 30, 2012.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I am writing this \n     to express my strong support for the nomination of Paul \n     Watford to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit. I have long been extremely impressed by Paul, since \n     I first met him almost 20 years ago, when my then-boss Judge \n     Alex Kozinski (now Chief Judge) was interviewing him as a law \n     clerk.\n       As you know, Paul had a stellar academic career, graduating \n     very near the top of his class at UCLA School of Law and then \n     clerking for Judge Kozinski and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \n     He has also earned tremendous respect as a practicing lawyer, \n     both as a federal prosecutor and an appellate lawyer. He has \n     all the qualities that an appellate judge ought to have: \n     intellectual brilliance, thoughtfulness, fairness, \n     collegiality, an ability to deal civilly and productively \n     with colleagues of all ideological stripes, and a deep \n     capacity for hard work. If confirmed, he'll make a superb \n     judge.\n       Let me turn then to the question of ideology. In the \n     overwhelming majority of cases that an appellate judge faces, \n     the judge's legal philosophy is entirely or almost entirely \n     irrelevant: The cases are either straightforward applications \n     of clear and well-settled law, or, even if less than clear, \n     involve highly technical legal questions that relate little \n     to high-level philosophical debates. For those questions \n     Paul's intellect, care, and legal craftsmanship will yield \n     results that both liberals and conservatives should applaud.\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\n       At the same time, there is no doubt that some small but \n     important fraction of appellate cases consists of matters on \n     which liberal judges and conservative judges will reach \n     different results. That is inevitable: Law is not \n     mathematics. Some legal questions are unsettled and not \n     answered by statutory or constitutional text, or binding \n     precedent. And in the absence of a clear and obvious legal \n     answer, different judges reach different results based partly \n     on their philosophies. Paul is a moderate liberal; I am a \n     moderate libertarianish conservative; I therefore expect \n     that, if he is confirmed, there would be some future \n     decisions of his with which I will disagree.\n       Yet our current President is President Obama, not Senator \n     McCain. The American people spoke, and they elected someone \n     who will not nominate judges with whom Republicans like me \n     will always agree. So, respecting as I do the voters' choice \n     in 2008 (though it was not my choice), I do not ask: Is this \n     the sort of judge who shares my legal philosophy? Rather, I \n     ask: Would he be the sort of judge whom I could respect \n     intellectually? Would he be the sort of judge whom I could \n     trust to be fair-minded and respectful of the legal rules \n     that he is obligated to follow? Is he likely to be more on \n     the moderate side rather than solidly on the left? For Paul, \n     my answer to those questions is a definite yes.\n       When a Democratic President nominates a judge who is indeed \n     well on the left, Republicans like me face a difficult \n     question: Should we resist the nomination, or should we \n     accept it so long as the judge appears to be excellent on the \n     nonideological factors? I have not fully thought through this \n     question.\n       But for the reasons I mentioned, that's a question that \n     doesn't even come up for me in this instance. Paul is the \n     sort of moderate Democratic nominee that moderates and \n     conservatives, as well as liberals, should solidly support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eugene Volokh.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Henry Weissmann,\n\n                                     Los Angeles, CA, May 3, 2012.\n     Re Nomination of Paul Watford.\n\n     Hon.

Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Leahy and Grassley: I write \n     in support of the nomination of Paul Watford to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n       I am a partner of Mr. Watford's at Munger, Tolles & Olson \n     LLP. Prior to joining Munger, Tolles, I had the honor of \n     serving as a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia of the \n     Supreme Court and Judge James L. Buckley of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. I am also a past \n     President of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Federalist \n     Society and serve on the Executive Committee of its national \n     Telecommunications Practice Group. Although I do not agree \n     with President Obama on many issues, I completely agree with \n     his nomination of Mr. Watford.\n       I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Watford for \n     over a decade in a variety of appellate matters involving \n     large corporate clients. He is brilliant, developing \n     effective arguments on matters of first impression. He is \n     efficient, producing top-quality work product quickly. He is \n     respectful of his colleagues, his opponents, and the courts. \n     Above all, he is a careful lawyer, applying precedent and \n     common sense in a way that leads to moderate arguments. I \n     have never seen any hint of politics in Mr. Watford's \n     lawyering.\n       Mr. Watford is highly regarded not only within our firm, \n     but also in the legal community at large. Lawyers from \n     private practice, his former colleagues in the U.S. \n     Attorney's office, clients, academics, and many others--\n     including those from a wide range of political perspectives--\n     hold Mr. Watford in the highest esteem.\n       I have every confidence that, as a judge, Mr. Watford would \n     apply the law faithfully, objectively, and even-handedly. Mr. \n     Watford would be an outstanding addition to the Ninth \n     Circuit, and I support his nomination enthusiastically.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Henry Weissmann.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote on the Watford nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, \nthat no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any \nstatements related to the nomination be printed in the Record; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, but I \nask unanimous consent that the time between now and the vote at 5:30 be \nevenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          FDA Reauthorization\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbipartisan legislation to which the Senate will move to reauthorize the \nFood and Drug Administration user fees and critical programs to ensure \nAmericans have access to safe and effective medications.\n  Most of us do not think about the FDA on a regular basis. In fact, we \nrarely think about where our medicines come from, the scientists who \ninvented them, the investments required to develop them, and the \ninnovative, cutting-edge new treatments that are essential to keeping \nAmericans healthy and safe or the regulators who make sure these \npharmaceuticals, devices, and treatments work as they are supposed to. \nBut when the moment comes that we face a health crisis and our doctors \nprescribe us essential medication, we want those pharmaceuticals \navailable right away, and we want them to work as promised.\n  One example of the many constituents who have contacted me about \nPDUFA is Virginia from Newark, DE, who recently sent a letter to my \noffice. She volunteers with the National Brain Tumor Society and is \nconcerned that without reauthorization of this legislation, safe and \neffective brain tumor therapies will be slower to be developed and made \navailable to patients who need them. She wrote:\n\n       It has been too long since any new therapies have become \n     available for brain tumor patients that significantly extend \n     survival. Anyone can be diagnosed with a brain tumor, and \n     they are the second leading cause of cancer death in children \n     under twenty.\n\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I am sure, like me, in your office, \nas a Senator from Connecticut, you regularly are visited by folks from \naround the country or around your State who are deeply concerned about \ncontinuing medical progress, discovery and development of the \nlifesaving treatments Americans have developed over the last two \ndecades. It is my hope that the Senate will continue to clear the way. \nThat is why we need this legislation.\n  This reauthorization helps take care of innovation and safety so \nconsumers and patients do not have to worry. It permanently authorizes \nprograms that have helped make medicines safer for millions of \nchildren. It upgrades the FDA's tools to police the global supply chain \nand helps reduce the risk of drug shortages of the kind we saw \nrecently, which Senator Klobuchar just spoke to earlier this afternoon, \nwhen supplies of critical cancer medications ran low.\n  This is a matter of great urgency. The current FDA authorization will \nexpire in a few short months. If we allow that to happen, we put at \nrisk patient access to new medications as well as America's ongoing \nglobal leadership in biomedical innovation.\n  Worst of all, failing to reauthorize would cost us thousands of jobs, \nand more pink slips is not what we need as our economic recovery gains \nstrength. If new drug and medical device user fee agreements are not \nauthorized before the current ones expire, the FDA must lay off nearly \n2,000 employees. Because that does not happen overnight, layoff notices \nwould start going out as early as July. The good news is we are moving \nforward with a timely reauthorization to save those jobs, save \nAmerica's leading role in innovation, and ensure that the FDA continues \nto make progress.\n  This is an all-too-rare display of bipartisanship across both \nChambers. This legislation was unanimously approved by the House \ncommittee and found strong bipartisan support in the HELP Committee \nhere in the Senate, ably led by Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member \nEnzi.\n  There is a reason Members of the House and Senate of both parties are \nin such strong support of this reauthorization.\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\n  The American economy has always been driven by innovation, and some \nof our most extraordinary innovations have come in the biomedical \nsector. In the years ahead, it is my faith, my hope, that we will see \nmore and more narrowly targeted drugs created specifically for certain \nkinds of patients or very specific diseases. In the lifecycle of \ninnovation, this is different than the last few decades when \nblockbuster medications were used and then developed on a very wide \nscale across the country or world. But it is an equally impressive feat \nof innovation that lies in the years ahead, and one that is only \npossible because of amazing advances in technology, the mapping of the \nhuman genome, the disassociation across many labs and small startup \nbusinesses, of the machinery, the mechanics, and the capabilities to \ninnovate in the discovery and development of pharmaceuticals.\n  We have to continue to support and encourage this kind of innovation \nin order to stay competitive in the global economy. At the moment, the \nFDA continues to keep pace with many of our global competitors in terms \nof their review time for new drug applications, but we are at real risk \nof falling behind.\n  One recent example to which I paid close attention, the blood-\nthinning drug Brilinta, was manufactured by a company--was developed \nand discovered by a company--in my home State of Delaware, AstraZeneca. \nIt was finally approved by the FDA in July 2011. But prior to that \napproval, 33 other countries, including the EU and Canada, had already \napproved the drug months or years before. This delay in review and \napproval in some certain cases can be bad for patients who rely on \nthese medications and bad for the competitiveness of the United States. \nSo I am glad this reauthorization clears away some of the conflict in \nthe underbrush and will reauthorize and strengthen and streamline the \nreview timeline for new pharmaceuticals.\n  Not only will this provide the kind of predictability and certainty \nany business needs to succeed, but it helps make sure the FDA's \nessential regulatory process keeps pace with scientific innovation. In \nmy home State of Delaware, there are more than 20,000 jobs that \ndirectly rely on biomedical research and innovation. But around the \ncountry there are more than 4 million indirectly and more than 675,000 \njobs that directly benefit from this area.\n  Frankly, it is also one of our strongest export areas of growth for \nthe long term. So we need this reauthorization now. In my view, moving \nforward with this legislation also means finding the fine balance \nbetween speed and safety, between getting treatments to patients \nwithout delay, and being certain these new drugs will be effective and \nsafe.\n  In a recent editorial, the Washington Post noted:\n\n       This time around, the balance appears to be tilting \n     slightly toward faster approval. That's good.\n\n  I agree. Safety is paramount, but with today's technology and the \nFDA's century of experience, I think we can move more quickly to put \ninnovative treatments in the hands of patients who desperately need \nthem. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act originally passed by Congress \nin 1992 and reauthorized every 5 years since is what allows the FDA to \ncollect user fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers and provide a \nstable, consistent funding stream that has steadily decreased drug \nreview times by nearly 60 percent since it was first enacted. It has \nprovided access on a faster and more predictable timeframe to over \n1,500 new medicines since it was first enacted and deserves to be \nreauthorized to help expedite approval for breakthrough medications to \ntreat rare and widely experienced diseases.\n  In closing, the FDA is the oldest comprehensive consumer protection \nagency in the Federal Government. Its relevance has not decreased with \nage; in fact, quite the opposite. As our researchers and scientists \nhave made major breakthroughs in care and technologies for treatment, \nthe FDA has continued to serve as the conduit between innovators, \nphysicians, and patients.\n  We face tremendous hurdles in treating devastating diseases of all \nkinds. In addition to ancient puzzles such as cancer that continue to \nallude us, there are new challenges cropping up every day. One example \nwould be the need for new drugs to treat increasing cases of bacterial \ninfections, greatly resistant to conventional antibiotics, so-called \nsuperbugs. That is why I have joined with the Presiding Officer and \nSenator Corker as a cosponsor of the GAIN Act, to spur development of \nthese specific types of drugs. This is one of many examples of the \nkinds of innovations that will solve the medical mysteries of the 21st \ncentury, ease the suffering of millions of Americans, secure high-wage \nand high-skilled jobs in the biomedical research field, and ensure our \ncompetitiveness globally.\n  So let's continue working in the bipartisan spirit that has carried \nthis reauthorization thus far and proceed to pass it without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, at 5:30 we will be voting on the \nnomination of Paul Watford for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nwould like to say a few words about him at this time. But before I do, \nI think Members might want to consider the fact that the Ninth Circuit \nis by far the busiest U.S. circuit in the Nation. It has over 1,400 \nappeals pending per three-judge panel. That is the most of any circuit. \nIt is over two times the average of other circuits combined.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States has declared each Ninth \nCircuit vacancy a ``judicial emergency.'' So today we are, in fact, \nfilling one of the seats which is a judicial emergency. The candidate \nis Paul Watford, a Ninth Circuit nominee with stellar credentials and \nsupport across the political spectrum. I am delighted that cloture was \nvitiated so the vote will be directly on his nomination, and it is \nanticipated that he will be confirmed without controversy.\n  Mr. Watford earned his bachelor's degree from the University of \nCalifornia Berkeley in 1989 and his law degree from UCLA in 1994 where \nhe was editor of the UCLA Law Review and graduated Order of the Coif. \nAfter finishing law school, Mr. Watford clerked for Ninth Circuit Judge \nAlex Kozinski, an appointee of President Reagan's. He then clerked for \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Following his two clerkships, he spent a year in private practice at \nthe prestigious firm of Munger, Tolles, and Olson and then moved into \npublic service as an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles in 1997. \nThere he prosecuted a broad array of crimes, including bank robberies, \nfirearms offenses, immigration violations, alien smuggling, and various \ntypes of fraud.\n  He later served in the major fraud section of the criminal division, \nfocusing on white collar crime. Among his many cases, he prosecuted the \nfirst case of an online auction fraud on eBay in California. During his \ntenure as a Federal prosecutor, Mr. Watford appeared in court \nfrequently, typically several times per week. He tried seven cases to \nverdict, and he worked on numerous Ninth Circuit appeals, arguing four \nof them.\n  In one such case, a cocaine dealer had already convinced the State \ncourt that a drug seizure had violated his fourth amendment rights. Mr. \nWatford prevailed on appeal in forcing the dealer to forfeit over \n$100,000 in drug trafficking proceeds.\n  In 2000, Watford rejoined Munger, Tolles, and Olson where he is \ncurrently a partner. This is one of the premiere appellate law firms in \nCalifornia. Paul Watford specializes in appellate litigation at the \nfirm. Like most major law firms, Munger's docket is dominated by \nbusiness litigation. Thus the focus of Mr. Watford's work has been \nappellate litigation for business clients. For example, he represented \nVerizon Communications in a consumer class action case. He represented \nthe technology company, Rambus, in two complex patent infringement \ncases. He also represented Shell Oil in an antitrust case.\n  Mr. Watford and his colleagues at Munger won a 9-to-0 reversal on \nbehalf of Shell Oil in the Supreme Court. He has also represented \nnumerous other American businesses, such as Coca-Cola and Berkshire \nHathaway, as well as business executives and municipal government \nagencies.\n  In total he has argued 21 cases in the appellate courts, and he has \nappeared as counsel in over 20 cases in the U.S. Supreme Court. So he \nis well equipped.\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\n  His extensive experience as a prosecutor and private practitioner, \nincluding his specialty in appellate work, will serve the Ninth Circuit \nextremely well. Mr. Watford is also regarded by attorneys on both sides \nof the aisle, including conservative Republicans who praise him for his \nkeen intellect and fair-minded approach to the law. He has been \nendorsed by two former presidents of the Los Angeles chapter of the \nFederalist Society.\n  One, Jeremy Rosen, says Watford is, ``open-minded and fair,'' and a \n``brilliant person and a gifted appellate lawyer.'' The other, Henry \nWeissman, says that although he ``do[es] not agree with President Obama \non issues, [he] completely agree[s] with his nomination of Paul \nWatford.'' So that is a good thing.\n  Daniel Collins, who clerked for Justice Scalia and served as an \nAssociate Deputy Attorney General in the Bush Justice Department, says \nWatford ``embodies the definition of judicial temperament--very level-\nheaded and even keeled.''\n  Thirty-two Supreme Court clerks from the term when Watford clerked \nfor Justice Ginsburg have written in support of the nomination. These \ninclude clerks from every Justice on the Court at that time, including \nall of Justice Scalia's clerks from that year, as well as several from \nJustices Rehnquist, Thomas, and Kennedy. I find that quite amazing.\n  A group of over 40 former clerks for Judge Kozinski have also written \nin support of Watford's nomination. This group includes numerous \nindividuals with unquestionable conservative credentials. Many clerked \nfor Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, Alito, and Kennedy. Several, such as \nSteve Engel, Charles Duggan, and Ted Ullyot also served in the Bush \nadministration, including in the White House Counsel's Office and the \nleadership of the Justice Department.\n  Watford also has strong support in the business community. The \ngeneral counsels of leading American corporations, including Google, \nMattel, Verizon, and CIRCOR, have also written in support of Mr. \nWatford. They say Watford ``is exactly the kind of individual that any \nplaintiff or defendant--person, business, or government--would welcome \ndeciding their case.''\n  In short, Paul Watford is truly both an excellent and distinguished \nchoice for the Ninth Circuit. He is extremely bright. He is experienced \nat the trial and appellate level and in both civil and criminal cases. \nHe is uniquely respected for his intellect and judgment, and he has \nbroad support across the political spectrum and in the business \ncommunity.\n  Maybe this is the reason cloture was vitiated. He is not \nfilibusterable. I hope people see the fine and keen intellect this man \nis, and he should have a very large vote. If confirmed, he would be one \nof just two African-American active judges on the Ninth Circuit. The \nNinth Circuit, by far the busiest circuit in the Nation, urgently needs \nhim to begin his service.\n  As I said the Ninth Circuit is a judicial emergency. This will fill \none vacancy. So I urge my colleagues to vote at 5:30, in 15 minutes, \nfor Mr. Watford's nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we are going to turn to a \nnomination that the Senator from California has just referred to, Paul \nWatford, to be circuit judge for the Ninth Circuit. I am disappointed \nthat the majority leader has brought this nomination to the floor.\n  The reason I say that is there are at least 10 nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar that might fall into the category of consensus \nnominees. Six nominees on the calendar had significant opposition in \ncommittee and clearly are not consensus nominees. Mr. Watford falls \ninto this category of not being a consensus nominee.\n  I will oppose Mr. Watford's nomination and ask my colleagues to \noppose the nomination as well. My opposition to this nomination is \nbased upon substantive concerns that I have regarding Mr. Watford's \nviews on both immigration and the death penalty.\n  Mr. Watford partnered with the American Civil Liberties Union and the \nNational Immigration Law Center in two cases to oppose Arizona's 2010 \nimmigration bill. In the first case, Friendly House, a class action \nlawsuit, Mr. Watford served as cocounsel for most of the plaintiffs, \nincluding the class action representative Friendly House.\n  The Friendly House complaint attacks the Arizona law on a variety of \ngrounds. He argued the law violates the Supremacy clause; that it \nviolates the Equal Protection clause by promoting racial profiling; \nthat it violates the first amendment by chilling the speech of non-\nEnglish speakers; that it violates the fourth amendment; and that it \nviolates due process by inviting racial profiling and employing vague \ndefinitions of ``public offense'' and other statutory terms.\n  In the second case, United States v. Arizona, Mr. Watford served as \ncocounsel on an amicus brief filed by the Friendly House plaintiffs. \nThis brief covers most of the arguments raised in the Friendly House \ncomplaint. But in addition, it asserts that Arizona ``fails to account \nfor the complexities and realities of Federal immigration law'' because \nindividuals lacking immigration registration documents are put at risk \nof ``constant and repeated criminal prosecution.''\n  I do not believe an attorney should be held accountable for the legal \npositions he advocates on behalf of a client. Of course, there are some \nexceptions to that general rule; for instance, if the legal positions \nare far outside the mainstream of legal theory, are frivolous or \nindicate an unacceptable level of professional competence. However, in \nthis case, Mr. Watford has not simply argued on behalf of a client, he \nadopted those legal theories as his very own. On July 14, 2010, Mr. \nWatford gave a speech analyzing the constitutionality of the Arizona \nlaw. His speech concentrated on ``why S. 1070 is unconstitutional,'' \nand he recapped many of the arguments he made in the Friendly House \ncase.\n  Moreover, despite the fact that he discussed his views on immigration \npublicly, he nonetheless declined to answer many of my questions during \nhis hearing before the Judiciary Committee. For instance, I asked about \nan argument in his brief that the Arizona statute prohibiting illegal \naliens from soliciting work somehow violated the first amendment. The \nnominee responded that it would be inappropriate for him to comment on \nquestions related to whether illegal immigrants were entitled to \nconstitutional protections other than those contained in the fifth, \nsixth and fourteenth amendments. Again, remember, he had already given \na speech on this topic, so I was disappointed that he would not share \nhis views on these important topics.\n  With regard to the death penalty, Mr. Watford assisted in submitting \nan amicus brief to the Supreme Court in Baze v. Rees on behalf of a \nnumber of groups that opposed Kentucky's three-drug lethal injection \nprotocol.\n  In its plurality opinion, the Court rejected the arguments raised in \nthe brief. Ultimately, Kentucky's three-drug protocol was upheld on a \n7-to-2 vote in the Supreme Court.\n  At the hearing we had for Mr. Watford, in following up questions, Mr. \nWatford gave the standard response that he would follow Supreme Court \nprecedent regarding the death penalty. Yet it is very curious to me \nthat he would go out of his way to provide his services to a case that \nwould undermine the death penalty.\n  Furthermore, his concession that he would give consideration to \nforeign or international law in interpreting the meaning of the Cruel \nand Unusual Punishment clause makes me wonder how he would approach \nthis issue.\n  I have other concerns based on positions this nominee has taken in \nhis legal advocacy, as well as some of his presentations.\n  I am generally willing to give the President's nominees the benefit \nof the doubt when the nominee on the surface meets the requirements I \nhave previously outlined. But I don't think this nominee meets these \nrequirements.\n  Finally, Republicans continue to be accused of obstruction and delay \nwhen it comes to judicial nominations. This comes even as we have now \nconfirmed 145 of this President's district and circuit court nominees. \nThat, of course, is during a period when we also confirmed two Justices \nto the Supreme Court. The last President who had two Supreme Court \nnominees had only 120\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nconfirmations. So this argument of obstruction, of delay, and of \nunfairness doesn't hold up.\n  I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle of the \nobstructionism, delay, and filibusters, which they perfected. The \nhistory of President Bush's nominees to the ninth circuit provides some \nvery important examples.\n  President Bush nominated nine individuals to the ninth circuit. Three \nof those nominations were filibustered. Two of those filibusters were \nsuccessful. The nominations of Carolyn Kuhl and William Gerry Myers \nlanguished for years before being returned to the President. A fourth \nnominee, Randy Smith, waited over 14 months before finally being \nconfirmed after his nomination was blocked and returned to the \nPresident. After being renominated, he was finally confirmed by a \nunanimous vote.\n  President Obama, on the other hand, has nominated six individuals to \nthe ninth circuit. Only one of those nominees was subject to a cloture \nvote. After that vote failed, the nominee withdrew. If confirmed, Mr. \nWatford will be the fourth nominee of President Obama nominated to \nserve on the ninth circuit. Those four confirmations took an average of \nabout 8 months from the date of nomination.\n  For all of President Obama's circuit nominees, the average time for \nnomination to confirmation is about 242 days. For President Bush's \ncircuit nominees, the average wait for confirmation was 350 days. Given \nthis history that I have spelled out, one might wonder then why \nPresident Bush and his nominees were treated differently and so much \nmore unfairly than President Obama's nominees.\n  Mr. Watford received his B.A. from University of California, Berkeley \nin 1989 and his J.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles \n(UCLA) School of Law in 1994. Upon graduation, he clerked for Judge \nAlex Kozinski on the Ninth Circuit and then for Justice Ginsburg on the \nSupreme Court. In 1996, he began working as an associate in the \nLitigation Department at the Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles & \nOlsen. From 1997 2000, Mr. Watford was an Assistant United States \nAttorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of \nCalifornia, in Los Angeles, handling a variety of criminal \nprosecutions, such as immigration, narcotics, firearms trafficking, \nbank robbery, computer fraud, mail and wire fraud, and securities \nfraud.\n  In 2000, Mr. Watford returned to private practice as an associate in \nthe appellate practice group at Sidley & Austin's Los Angeles office. \nIn 2001, he rejoined Munger, Tolles & Olsen as an associate, becoming a \npartner there in 2003. His practice focuses primarily on appellate \nlitigation, specifically business and commercial disputes. Mr. Watford \nhas also taught a course on Judicial Opinion Writing at the University \nof Southern California's Gould School of Law for three semesters (2007, \n2008, and 2009).\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nhim as Well Qualified for this position.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 3187\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 400, S. 3187, the Food \nand Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, be vitiated; that at \n2:15 tomorrow, Tuesday, May 22, the motion to proceed be agreed to; \nthat the Harkin-Enzi substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to, and the bill, as amended by the Harkin-Enzi substitute, be \nconsidered original text for the purposes of further amendment, and \nthat the majority leader be recognized at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, based on this, we will have a vote that \nshould start in 5 minutes, which will be the only vote of the day.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the role.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield back all time and ask unanimous \nconsent that the vote start now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Paul J. Watford, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Ninth Circuit.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. \nMcCaskill) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. DeMint), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Heller), \nthe Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), and the Senator from Louisiana \n(Mr. Vitter).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n1905, the Iran Threat Reduction Act, and that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration; that the Johnson of South Dakota-Shelby substitute \namendment, which is at the desk and is the text of Calendar No. 320, S. \n2101, the Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Human Rights Act, as \nreported by the Banking Committee, be considered; that a Johnson of \nSouth Dakota-Shelby amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that \nthe substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the consent request?\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I would like to thank both leaders for their hard work \nin getting what I believe is one of the more important sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions achieved here. It is very difficult. I think words \nmatter. The fact that this resolution points out that we need a \ncomprehensive policy that includes economic sanctions, diplomacy in \nmilitary planning, capabilities, and options; that this objective is \nconsistent with the one stated by President Barack Obama in the State \nof the Union Address where he said, ``Let there be no doubt: America is \ndetermined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will \ntake no options off the table to achieve that goal''--I think this is \nan important resolution. I thank the majority leader.\n  I also point out that the final part of it says that nothing in the \nact shall be construed as a declaration of war or an authorization of \nthe use of force against Iran or Syria.\n  First of all, it is not an authorization. Second of all, I wonder if \nwe ought to include Canada and maybe Brazil and other countries along \nwith that since this resolution contemplates in no way anything \nconcerning Syria, but I guess we could probably throw it in. However, I \nwill not ask for a unanimous consent to amend to add Canada, although \nthe Canadians are very upset because they have no teams in the finals \nof the National Hockey League Stanley Cup championship series.\n  Again, I thank both the Senate majority leader and the Republican \nleader for the work they did and also our friend Senator Menendez, who \nwas also an important factor in getting this done.\n  I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, to the majority leader, well done. I \nthink we are going to be able to voice vote a resolution that states \nthe policy of our country and our President very clearly.\n  To the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, great job on the \nsanctions. I hope the Senator understands why I wanted to put in all \noptions. I hope the sanctions will work. This is a clear statement by \nthe Senate backing up our President that when it comes to Iran having \nnuclear capabilities, there will be more than sanctions on the table, \nand the Iranians need to know that.\n  I hope we can end this peacefully for Israel's sake, for our sake, \nand for the world's sake as we approach beefing up the sanctions with \nthe Banking Committee, with Senator Menendez's and Senator Kirk's \nleadership, and others, who have done a great job. If you are on the \nBanking Committee, you did a great job. I don't even know who is on it.\n  The bottom line is I think the sanctions were really well drafted and \nwill enhance the President's hand, so to speak. We cannot leave this \ndebate without making a very simple unequivocal statement that the goal \nis to get it right. And if sanctions can lead to getting it right, God \nbless. If the sanctions will not get us to where we want to go, \neverything is on the table, including the use of military force, \nbecause this country--Republicans and Democrats--is not going to allow \nthe Iranian regime to develop nuclear capability that will put the \nworld into darkness.\n  To everybody who negotiated this outcome, thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2123) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment (No. 2124) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The substitute amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the bill as \namended.\n  The bill (H.R. 1905), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table and that any statements related to \nthis matter be printed in the Record in the appropriate place as if \nread.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before we leave here this evening, I must \nmention the good work done by the Banking Committee. Senator Johnson of \nSouth Dakota has been stalwart in this issue. He and Senator Shelby \nworked together. It has been very heartwarming.\n  I appreciate Senator Menendez, who has been a loud voice in making \nsure we do something on this legislation about which he feels so \nstrongly.\n  The most important thing for me is Iranians need to know we mean \nbusiness, particularly with the next round of international \nnegotiations taking place the day after tomorrow.\n  I am glad we resolved our differences and everyone realizes how \nimportant it is to advance these measures to prevent Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon. They should be aware that there is still \nmore we can do. I am very happy with what we have done at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I rise to discuss \ntoday's unanimous, bipartisan approval of the Senate Iran Sanctions, \nAccountability and Human Rights Act. With this action, we are adding \nadditional tough, targeted sanctions against the Iranian Government, \nmaking it clear to the Iranian Government that they must stop their \nillicit pursuit of nuclear weapons or face increased pressure on their \neconomy.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a longer statement of \nmine on the bill plus a summary be included in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The bill the Senate adopted today passed the Banking \nCommittee earlier this year by a unanimous bipartisan vote. Among its \nother provisions, this legislation will have important effects because \nit requires intensified targeting of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, \nsanctioning energy and uranium mining joint ventures with Iran, and \nmandating sanctions for those who supply Iran with weapons and other \ntechnologies used to commit human abuses, including those used to \nimpose an electronic curtain of censorship on Iran's citizens. In \naddition, this legislation gives the President additional authority to \nsanction the Asad regime in Syria.\n  Today the Senate has shown that we can still act in a bipartisan way \non important priorities. I thank every Member for supporting passage of \nthis bill today. In particular, I thank all the members of the Banking \nCommittee for their work, including Ranking Member Shelby and Senators \nMenendez, Kirk, Schumer, and Brown. In addition, I thank Majority \nLeader Reid for his determination to get this legislation through the \nSenate.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to quickly \ncome together on a final bill the President can sign soon. It is \nimportant that the Congress act swiftly so that we can continue to put \npressure on the Iranian regime to end its illicit and illegal nuclear \nactivity.\n  Again, I thank all my colleagues for their support on the Iran \nsanctions bill today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Tightening Iran Sanctions\n\n       Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, the prospect of \n     a nuclear-armed Iran is the most pressing foreign policy \n     challenge we face, and we must continue to do all we can--\n     politically, economically, and diplomatically--to avoid that \n     result. The meetings here in Washington in March between \n     Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama \n     underscored the gravity of these issues, and the importance \n     of an intensified, unified effort by the international \n     community to further isolate Iran's leaders and compel them \n     to abandon their illicit nuclear activities. Iran's \n     willingness to sit down again with the P5 + 1 group--the five \n     permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany--\n     and begin to re-engage on the nuclear issues is a hopeful \n     sign. But even after the first meeting, which both sides \n     called ``constructive,'' it remains to be seen whether Iran \n     will actually be willing to work towards progress on the \n     central issues at the negotiating sessions planned for \n     Baghdad\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\n     later this week, or whether these meetings will simply be \n     another in a series of stalling actions to buy time to enrich \n     additional uranium and further fortify their nuclear program.\n       As that process moves forward, today the full Senate is \n     finally acting on an important bill to confront this very \n     serious threat to our national security, to Israel and to our \n     other allies in the Middle East and Europe. S. 2101, the Iran \n     Sanctions Accountability and Human Rights Act of 2012, was \n     approved by a unanimous bipartisan vote in the Senate Banking \n     Committee. I am pleased that, with the help of ranking member \n     Senator Shelby and other committee colleagues, we are \n     presenting to the full Senate, as we did 2 years ago, this \n     bipartisan bill to expand and tighten sanctions on Iran, \n     along with a manager's amendment to address several issues \n     that required updating to take into account recent events, \n     and clarifications or additions that my colleagues sought to \n     expand the reach and effectiveness of the bill, including \n     changes requested by Senator Menendez to an amendment he \n     offered in committee, section 503, to narrow its application \n     while preserving his original intent to enable attachment of \n     assets in which the government of Iran has an interest, to \n     satisfy certain terror-related judgments against Iran.\n       In pressing this bill forward we recognize that economic \n     sanctions are not an end: they are a means to an end. That \n     end is to apply enough pressure to secure agreement from \n     Iran's leaders to fully, completely and verifiably abandon \n     their illicit nuclear program. The President has made clear \n     that his policy is not to contain Iran once it has a nuclear \n     weapon: it is to prevent Iran from achieving that goal in the \n     first place. He is deadly serious about that. At the same \n     time, he is moving forward diplomatically, in consultation \n     with our allies, to test Iran's willingness to come clean on \n     its nuclear program, and resolve the international \n     community's concerns on this front.\n       Let me describe where we have been on Iran sanctions, so \n     that Senators may better understand where we're going. This \n     has been the subject of heated rhetoric on the Presidential \n     campaign trail, so I want to describe clearly the \n     longstanding bipartisan approach we in Congress have taken. \n     Since here in the Senate we sometimes cannot even agree to \n     cross the street together, in today's hyper-partisan \n     environment bipartisan agreement on this bill is notable. On \n     Iran sanctions we have always worked in a bipartisan fashion; \n     I hope that will continue.\n       In coordination with allies like the European Union, Japan, \n     South Korea, Australia, Canada, and others, the \n     Administration has taken its own steps to increase pressure \n     on Iran's petrochemical industry, oil and gas industry, and \n     financial sector. We acted in the Senate 5 months ago on an \n     amendment by Senators Menendez and Kirk to sanction the \n     Central Bank of Iran and other banks that deal with Iranian \n     banks involved in nefarious activities. Shortly thereafter, \n     Europe announced it will ban oil imports from Iran, starting \n     in July. This will further increase pressure on Iran's \n     economy and cut off other key sources of revenue for their \n     nuclear program. Almost $60 billion in energy-related \n     projects in Iran have been put on hold or discontinued. Oil \n     shipments have sharply declined due to sanctions. The Wall \n     Street Journal recently reported that Iran's crude oil output \n     has dropped to its lowest level in over 20 years, due largely \n     to the tightening squeeze of sanctions. And, in the last few \n     months, about half of the tankers booked monthly to load at \n     the country's largest terminal didn't complete the voyages, \n     according to brokers, company officials and ship-tracking \n     data. It is clear Iran is losing oil sales to key customers \n     in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere, and is having some of its \n     biggest customers demand steep discounts to buy its oil. Some \n     estimate the losses in Iran's oil revenues are approaching 40 \n     percent of daily sales. Iran's oil exports have the potential \n     to fall another 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day or more when \n     the European Union's embargo takes effect in July, according \n     to a report this week by Barclays. That is a huge impact. A \n     senior IRGC official acknowledged the effectiveness of \n     sanctions recently, saying: ``The regime is at the height of \n     isolation and in the midst of a technological, scientific and \n     economic siege. We are not in a situation of imaginary \n     threats and sanctions. Threats and sanctions against us are \n     effectively being pursued.'' These sanctions have had a more \n     powerful effect than many thought possible.\n       Iran is also isolated diplomatically. The international \n     community is lined up against their nuclear program, with \n     progressively tougher UN sanctions imposed on them. Their \n     most important ally, Syria, is collapsing into civil war. \n     They are, as President Obama said, in a ``world of hurt.'' \n     Many believe the recent shift by Iran's leaders on the \n     nuclear issue is the result of that pain, and the intense \n     pressure of heightened sanctions. But while it is clear that \n     existing sanctions are biting, they have not yet persuaded \n     Iran's leaders to drop their nuclear ambitions. We must not \n     let up now, as negotiations on these issues are continuing.\n       I believe that further progress in those negotiations \n     depends on intensifying that pressure on Iran's leaders, and \n     that's what this bill is all about. With these new sanctions, \n     including those targeted at the IRGC, we are forcing Iran's \n     military and political leaders to make a clear choice. They \n     can end the suppression of their people, come clean on their \n     nuclear program, suspend enrichment, and stop supporting \n     terrorist activities around the globe. Or they can continue \n     to face sustained multilateral economic and diplomatic \n     pressure, and deepen their international isolation.\n       Just as then-Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby did in \n     2010, Senator Shelby and I have incorporated ideas from many \n     of our Senate colleagues into one Committee bill, including \n     from S. 1048 sponsored by Senator Menendez. Senator Menendez \n     has been a leader on these issues, along with Senator Kirk, \n     and we acknowledge their many contributions. The bill also \n     borrows and refines ideas from legislation developed by \n     Senators Lautenberg, Gillibrand, Schumer, Kyl, Lieberman, \n     Brown, and others. I will now touch on a few of the \n     highlights of this bill and I will insert a more \n     comprehensive and detailed summary into the record at the end \n     of my remarks. Our legislation will: broaden the list of \n     available sanctions, require intensified targeting of Iran's \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps, require firms traded on US stock \n     exchanges to disclose Iran-related activity to the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission, sanction energy and uranium mining \n     joint ventures with Iran, penalize US parent firms for \n     certain Iran-related activities of their foreign \n     subsidiaries, mandate sanctions for those who supply Iran \n     with weapons and other technologies used to commit human \n     rights abuses, including those used to impose an ``Electronic \n     Curtain'' on Iran's citizens, and provide for other similar \n     measures designed to increase pressure on Iran's government.\n       All told, when enacted the bill will significantly increase \n     pressure on Iran's leaders, and that must be our goal as we \n     move forward in this process. I hope and expect my colleagues \n     will support this bill enthusiastically, and that we will be \n     able to reconcile it with the House bill and move it forward \n     quickly into law this year. I look forward to working with my \n     House colleagues, including Chairman Ros-Lehtinen and Ranking \n     Member Berman, who as former Foreign Affairs Committee \n     Chairman has led the sanctions effort against Iran for many \n     years, and played a key role in developing both CISADA and \n     the House version of this measure, to get a bill enacted this \n     year.\n\n      Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Human Rights Act of 2012\n\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n     Sec. 1--Short Title, Table of Contents\n     Sec. 2--Findings\n       Contains a series of findings about the threat posed by \n     Iran, the bipartisan understanding of the implications of its \n     achieving a nuclear weapons capability, steps taken thus far \n     by the US, its allies and the United Nations Security Council \n     to counter that threat, and the need to intensify those \n     efforts to counter that threat and deter Iran's nuclear \n     ambitions.\n     Sec. 3--Definitions\n       Provides that the definitions of key terms (``appropriate \n     congressional committees,'' ``credible information,'' and \n     ``knowingly,'') will be those found in the Iran Sanctions Act \n     (ISA) of 1996, as amended, and that the definition of \n     ``United States person'' will be that found in the \n     Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment \n     Act of 2010 (CISADA).\n     Sec. 101--Statement of Policy\n       Defines US policy to be to prevent Iran from (i) acquiring \n     or developing nuclear weapons and advanced conventional \n     weapons and ballistic missile capabilities, (ii) continuing \n     its support for international terrorism, and (iii) engaging \n     in other activities designed to destabilize its neighbors in \n     the region. It also outlines the US policy of support for \n     full implementation of all sanctions against Iran as part of \n     multilateral efforts to compel Iran to abandon its illicit \n     nuclear program.\n     Sec. 102--Expansion and Implementation of Multilateral \n         Sanctions Regime\n       States the sense of Congress that expansion and vigorous \n     implementation of bilateral and multilateral sanctions \n     against Iran, and vigorous enforcement of all U.S. sanctions, \n     is an effective way to achieve the goal of compelling Iran to \n     abandon its efforts to achieve a nuclear weapons capability.\n     Sec. 103--Diplomatic Efforts to Expand Multilateral Sanctions \n         Regime\n       Urges efforts by the US to expand the UN sanctions regime \n     to include (i) imposing additional travel restrictions on \n     Iranian officials responsible for human rights violations, \n     the development of Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile \n     programs, and Iran's support for terrorism; (ii) withdrawing \n     sea- and airport landing rights for Iran Shipping Lines and \n     Iran Air, for their role in nuclear proliferation and illegal \n     arms sales; (iii) expanding the range of sanctions to which \n     Iran is subject; (iv) expanding sanctions to limit Iran's \n     petroleum development, imports of refined petroleum products \n     and reduce its revenue from sale of petrochemical products, \n     and (v) accelerating US diplomatic and economic efforts to \n     help allies reduce their dependence on Iranian crude oil and \n     other petroleum products. Requires periodic reporting to \n     Congress.\n     Sec. 104--Imposition of Sanctions with regard to Iran\n       Declares the sense of Congress that efforts should be made \n     to maximize the effects of sanctions and to preserve \n     information-sharing.\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\n     Sec. 201--Sanctions with respect to Energy Joint Ventures \n         with Iran\n       Extends ISA sanctions to persons knowingly participating in \n     petroleum resources development joint ventures established on \n     or after January 1, 2002 anywhere in the world, unless such \n     ventures are terminated within 180 days of enactment, in \n     which Iran's government is a substantial partner or investor, \n     or through which Iran could otherwise receive energy sector \n     technology or know-how not previously available to its \n     government.\n     Sec. 202--Expands Sanctions on Providers of Goods and \n         Services to Iran's Energy Sector\n       Requires imposition of ISA sanctions on persons who \n     knowingly sell, lease, or provide to Iran goods, services, \n     technology or support (including refinery construction or \n     repair), or infrastructure predominantly used for the \n     transportation of refined petroleum products, that could \n     directly and significantly contribute to its petroleum \n     resources development or refining programs, in single \n     transactions of $1 million or more or multiple transactions \n     aggregating to $5 million or more in any 12-month period. \n     Requires imposition of at least three ISA sanctions to \n     persons who knowingly sell, lease, or provide to Iran goods, \n     services, technology or support for its petrochemical sector \n     in a single transaction of $250,000 or more, or multiple \n     transactions aggregating to $1,000,000 or more in any 12-\n     month period. In so doing, codifies the President's decision \n     to extend US sanctions to Iran's petrochemical sector, \n     adopting the standards, thresholds and petrochemicals list \n     contained in Executive Order 13590.\n     Sec. 203--Sanctions with respect to Uranium Joint Ventures \n         with Iran\n       Requires ISA sanctions to be imposed on persons who \n     knowingly participate in joint ventures with Iran's \n     government, Iranian firms, or persons acting for or on behalf \n     of Iran's government in the mining, production or \n     transportation of uranium anywhere in the world. Exempts such \n     persons from sanctions if they withdraw from such joint \n     ventures within 6 months after the date of enactment.\n     Sec. 204--Expansion of Sanctions Available under the Iran \n         Sanctions Act of 1996\n       Expands the current menu of sanctions, available to the \n     President under the ISA, to authorize exclusion from the \n     United States of aliens who are corporate officers, \n     principals or controlling shareholders in a sanctioned firm, \n     and permits applicable ISA sanctions to be applied to the CEO \n     or other principal executive officers (or persons performing \n     similar functions) of a sanctioned firm, which could include \n     a freeze of their US assets.\n     Sec. 205--Definitions\n       Defines ``credible information'' and ``petrochemical \n     product.'' ``Credible information'' includes public \n     announcements by persons that they are engaged in certain \n     activities, including those made in a report to stockholders, \n     and may include announcements by the Government of Iran, and \n     reports from the General Accountability Office (GAO), the \n     Energy Information Administration, the Congressional Research \n     Service, or other reputable governmental organizations. \n     Defines ``petrochemical product'' consistent with Executive \n     Order 13590.\n     Sec. 211--Sanctions for Shipping WMD or Terrorism-related \n         Materials to or from Iran\n       Requires the blocking of assets of, and imposes other \n     sanctions on, persons who knowingly provide ships, insurance \n     or reinsurance, or other shipping services, for \n     transportation of goods that materially contribute to Iran's \n     WMD program or its terrorism-related activities. The \n     sanctions apply to parents of the persons involved if they \n     knew or should have known of the sanctionable activity and to \n     any of their subsidiaries or affiliates that knowingly \n     participated in the activity. Provides for Presidential \n     national security interest waiver; requires a report to \n     Congress regarding the use of such a waiver.\n     Sec. 212--Imposition of Sanctions on Subsidiaries and Agents \n         of UN-sanctioned Persons\n       Amends CISADA to ensure that US financial sanctions imposed \n     on UN-designated entities reach those persons acting on \n     behalf of, at the direction of, or owned or controlled by, \n     the designated entities. Requires the Treasury Department to \n     revise its regulations within 90 days of enactment to \n     implement the change.\n     Sec. 213--Liability of US Companies for Violations by their \n         Foreign Subsidiaries\n       Requires the imposition of civil penalties under the \n     International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of up to \n     twice the amount of the relevant transaction on US parent \n     companies for the activities of their foreign subsidiaries \n     which, if undertaken by a US person or in the United States, \n     would violate US sanctions law. Subsidiaries are defined as \n     those entities in which a US person holds more than fifty \n     percent equity interest or a majority of the seats on the \n     board, or that a US person otherwise controls. Covers \n     activities under the current US trade embargo with Iran and \n     would apply regardless of whether the subsidiary was \n     established to circumvent US sanctions.\n     Sec. 214--Securities and Exchange Commission Disclosures on \n         Certain Activities in Iran\n       Amends the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to require \n     issuers whose stock is traded on US exchanges to disclose \n     whether they or their affiliates have knowingly engaged in \n     activities (i) in section 5 of the ISA (energy sector \n     activity); (ii) in 104(c)(2) or (d)1 of CISADA (related to \n     foreign financial institutions who facilitate WMD/terrorism, \n     money laundering, IRGC activity, and other violations); (iii) \n     in 105A(b)(2) of CISADA (related to those who transfer \n     weapons and other technologies to Iran likely to be used for \n     human rights abuses); (iv) with persons whose property is \n     blocked for WMD/terrorism and; (v) persons in the government \n     of Iran. Provides for periodic public disclosure of such \n     information, and conveyance of that information by the SEC to \n     Congress and the President. Requires the President to \n     initiate an investigation into the possible imposition of \n     sanctions as specified, and to make a sanctions determination \n     within 6 months.\n     Sec. 215--Immigration Restrictions on Senior Iranian \n         Officials and their Family Members\n       Requires the identification of and denial of visa requests \n     to senior officials, including the Supreme Leader, the \n     President, members of the Assembly of Experts, senior members \n     of the Intelligence Ministry of Iran, and members of the IRGC \n     with the rank of brigadier general or higher that are \n     involved in nuclear proliferation, support international \n     terrorism or the commission of serious human rights abuses \n     against citizens of Iran. Also includes their family members. \n     Provides for Presidential national security interest and UN \n     obligations waiver; requires a report to Congress regarding \n     the use of such a waiver.\n     Sec. 216--Sanctions with respect to the Provision of Certain \n         Financial Communications Services to the Central Bank of \n         Iran and Sanctioned Iranian Financial Institutions\n       States the sense of Congress that the President should \n     intensify current diplomatic efforts to ensure that global \n     financial communications services providers such as SWIFT \n     terminate services to Iranian financial institutions \n     designated for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to IEEPA. \n     Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to \n     submit a list, within 60 days of the date of enactment, of \n     entities that provide financial communications services to or \n     facilitate access to such services for the Central Bank of \n     Iran or financial institutions described in 104(c)(2)(E)(ii) \n     of CISADA (i.e., institutions whose property is blocked in \n     connection with Iran's proliferation of WMD or its support \n     for terrorism). Requires reporting by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury within 90 days of enactment on the efforts of SWIFT \n     to terminate the provision of services to the Central Bank of \n     Iran and Iranian financial institutions designated for \n     sanction. Authorizes the imposition of sanctions under CISADA \n     or IEEPA with respect to a financial communications services \n     provider, and the directors of, and shareholders with a \n     significant interest in, a provider, that has not terminated \n     such services to the Central Bank of Iran or designated \n     Iranian financial institutions.\n     Sec. 217--GAO Reports on Iran's Energy Sector\n       Mandates regular reports from GAO on foreign investment in \n     Iran's energy sector, exporters of refined petroleum products \n     to Iran, entities providing shipping and insurance services \n     to Iran, Iranian energy joint ventures worldwide, and \n     countries where Iranian petroleum is produced or refined.\n     Sec. 218--Expanded Reporting on Iran's Crude Oil and Refined \n         Petroleum Products\n       Amends section 110(b) of CISADA to require additional \n     reporting on the volume of crude oil and refined petroleum \n     products imported to and exported from Iran, the persons \n     selling and transporting crude oil and refined petroleum \n     products, the countries with primary jurisdiction over those \n     persons and the countries in which those products were \n     refined, the sources of financing for such imports and the \n     involvement of foreign persons in efforts to assist Iran in \n     developing its oil and gas production capacity, importing \n     advanced technology to upgrade existing Iranian refineries, \n     converting existing chemical plants to petroleum refineries \n     and maintaining, upgrading or expanding refineries or \n     constructing new refineries.\n     Sec. 301--Sanctions on Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps \n         Officials, Agents, and Affiliates\n       Requires the President to identify, and designate for \n     sanctions, officials, affiliates and agents of the IRGC \n     within 90 days of enactment, and periodically thereafter; \n     designation requires exclusion of such persons from the \n     United States, and imposition of sanctions (related to WMD \n     under IEEPA, including freezing their assets and otherwise \n     isolating them financially). Also, outlines priorities for \n     investigating certain foreign persons and transactions in \n     assessing connections to the IRGC.

If found to be IRGC \n     entities, sanctions apply to transactions or relevant \n     financial services for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum \n     products from the NIOC or NITC only if the President \n     determines that there exists a sufficient supply of petroleum \n     from countries other than Iran to permit purchasers to \n     significantly reduce in volume their purchases from Iran. \n     Provides for an exception to financial institutions of a \n     country that has significantly reduced its purchases of \n     Iranian petroleum or petroleum products within specified \n     periods which track those provided for in section 1245 of the \n     FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act.\n     Sec. 401--Sanctions on those Transferring to Iran \n         Technologies for Human Rights Abuses\n       Imposes sanctions provided for in CISADA, including a visa \n     ban and property blocking/asset freeze, on persons and firms \n     which supply Iran with equipment and technologies--including \n     weapons, rubber bullets, tear gas and other riot control \n     equipment, and jamming, monitoring and surveillance \n     equipment--which the President determines are likely to be \n     used by Iranian officials to commit human rights abuses. \n     Requires the President to maintain and update lists of such \n     persons who commit human rights abuses, submit updated lists \n     to Congress, and make the unclassified portion of those lists \n     public. Requires the President to report on designations and \n     waivers, as applicable.\n     Sec. 402--Sanctions on those Engaging in Censorship and \n         Repression in Iran\n       Requires imposition of sanctions as in section 401 against \n     individuals and firms found to have engaged in censorship or \n     curtailment of the rights of freedom of expression or \n     assembly of Iran's citizens.\n     Sec. 411--Expedited Processing of Human Rights, Humanitarian, \n         and Democracy Aid\n       Requires the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the \n     Treasury Department to establish a 90-day process to expedite \n     processing of US Iran-related humanitarian, human rights and \n     democratization aid by entities receiving funds from the \n     State Department; the Broadcasting Board of Governors; and \n     other federal agencies. Requires the State Department to \n     conduct a foreign policy review within 30 days of request \n     submission. Provides for additional time for processing of \n     applications involving certain specified sensitive goods and \n     technology, and requests involving novel or extraordinary \n     circumstances.\n     Sec. 412--Comprehensive Strategy to Promote Internet Freedom \n         in Iran\n       Requires the Administration to devise a comprehensive \n     strategy and report to Congress on how best to assist Iran's \n     citizens in freely and safely accessing the Internet, \n     developing counter-censorship technologies, expanding access \n     to ``surrogate'' programming including Voice of America's \n     Persian News Network, and Radio FARDA inside Iran, and taking \n     other similar measures.\n     Sec. 413--Sense of Congress on Political Prisoners\n       Declares that the United States should expand efforts to \n     identify, assist, and protect prisoners of conscience in Iran \n     and intensify work to abolish Iranian human rights \n     violations. Directs the Secretary of State to publicly call \n     for the release of political prisoners, as appropriate.\n     Sec. 501--Exclusion of Certain Iranian Students from the US\n       Requires the Secretary of State to deny visas and the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security to exclude certain Iranian \n     university students who may seek to come to the U.S. to study \n     to prepare for work in Iran's energy sector or in fields \n     related to its nuclear program, including nuclear sciences or \n     nuclear engineering.\n     Sec. 502--Technical Correction\n       Reaffirms longstanding US policy allowing the sale of \n     certain licensed agricultural commodities to Iran by amending \n     section 1245(d)2 of the National Defense Authorization Act to \n     allow for continued payments related to such commodities.\n     Sec. 503 Interests in Financial Assets of Iran\n       Deems blocked assets of Iran seized or frozen in the US, \n     and property interests of Iran in the United States, to \n     include property held in book entry and related indirect \n     forms, property held by securities clearing agencies and \n     other intermediaries, and inchoate interests in funds \n     transfers in the payment process through intermediary banks, \n     regardless of federal or state law that might otherwise \n     apply, if that property is an interest held for the benefit \n     of Iran or if any intermediary holds the interest for the \n     benefit of Iran and the status of the property is relevant to \n     any attachment or proceedings in aid of execution, whenever \n     issued, on judgments against Iran for damages for personal \n     injury or death caused by torture, extrajudicial killing, \n     aircraft sabotage, or hostage taking, or material support for \n     such an act. Defines various terms used for purposes of the \n     section, including ``blocked asset,'' ``clearing \n     corporation,'' ``financial asset,'' ``security,'' and \n     ``securities Intermediary.''\n     Sec. 504--Report on Membership of Iran in International \n         Organizations\n       Requires the Secretary of State to submit a report to \n     Congress listing the international organizations of which \n     Iran is a member and detailing the amount the US contributes \n     to each such organization annually.\n     Sec. 601--Technical implementation; penalties\n       Provides the President with the necessary procedural tools \n     to administer the provisions of this new law, drawing on \n     relevant provisions of IEEPA, including ensuring that the \n     Administration can require recordkeeping of certain persons, \n     and has subpoena and enforcement authority for certain \n     specified provisions of the bill.\n     Sec. 602--Applicability to Authorized Intelligence Activities\n       Provides a general exemption for authorized intelligence \n     activities of the U.S.\n     Sec. 603--Termination\n       Provides for termination of some provisions of the new law \n     if the President certifies as required in CISADA that Iran \n     has ceased its support for terrorism and ceased efforts to \n     pursue, acquire or develop weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles and ballistic missile launch technology.\n     Sec. 701--Short Title for Title VII\n       The ``Syria Human Rights Accountability Act of 2012.''\n     Sec. 702--Sanctions on Those Responsible for Human Rights \n         Abuses of Syria's Citizens\n       Requires the President to identify within 90 days, and \n     sanction under IEEPA, officials of the Syrian government or \n     those acting on their behalf who are complicit in or \n     responsible for the commission of serious human rights abuses \n     against Syria's citizens, regardless of whether the abuses \n     occurred in Syria.\n     Sec. 703--Sanctions on those Transferring to Syria \n         Technologies for Human Rights Abuses\n       Requires the President to identify and sanction persons \n     determined to have engaged in the transfer of technologies--\n     including weapons, rubber bullets, tear gas and other riot \n     control equipment, and jamming, monitoring and surveillance \n     equipment--which the President determines are likely to be \n     used by Syrian officials to commit human rights abuses or \n     restrict the free flow of information in Syria.

Certification required must stipulate that the \n     government of Syria has released political prisoners, ceased \n     the abuse of citizens engaged in peaceful political activity, \n     ceased the practice of procuring sensitive technology to \n     restrict the free expression rights of its citizens, ended \n     support for terrorist organizations, ceased development of \n     missile programs, is not engaged in the development or \n     acquisition of biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, and \n     agreed to allow the UN and international observers to verify \n     such claims. Provides for suspension of sanctions for 1 year \n     if a transitional government is in place, to provide time to \n     develop the more detailed certification above.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, first let me thank the majority leader \nfor his doggedness in making sure we could come to an agreement that \nsends a clear message to Iran before the P5+1 talks take place this \nweek. His commitment made the difference.\n  I would also like to thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Johnson of South Dakota, who, in\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nan agenda that is incredibly full with all of the challenges the \nBanking Committee is taking up, made sure the whole effort on Iran \nsanctions had a priority in the committee and worked to get the strong, \nbipartisan, unanimous vote that came out of the committee that gives us \nthe foundation to move forward today. So I thank both of them.\n  Today the Senate sends a clear message to Iran as it prepares for the \nP5+1 talks in Baghdad, and basically that message is: provide a real \nand verifiable plan for completely dismantling your nuclear weapons \nprogram or Washington will further tighten the economic noose. The \nObama administration is moving forward with full implementation of the \nMenendez-Kirk Central Bank sanctions, and the U.S. Congress is ready \nwith additional measures, such as sanctions on the National Iranian Oil \nCompany and Iranian energy joint ventures that will further isolate the \nregime.\n  I think Iran's Supreme Leader has a choice: Either come to Baghdad \nwith a real plan to terminate Iran's nuclear program or we will make \nour own plan through sanctions and other necessary measures to ensure \nthat Iran fails to achieve its nuclear ambitions.\n  And lest anyone think this is necessary, Madam President, as \nnegotiators head to Baghdad this week for the P5+1 talks, this bill is \nanother tool that will demonstrate to Iran that the United States is \nnot backing down and that buying time and just thinking that you can go \nand talk without substantive, meaningful concessions here is just not \ngoing to work.\n  In case anyone has doubts as to the need for this legislation, the \nrecord is pretty clear. In recent weeks the International Atomic Energy \nAdministration has been subject to Iranian delays and deception over \naccess to the Parchin facility--a facility they claim has no connection \nto their nuclear program but which scientists believe may contain a \nblast chamber used to test explosives that can trigger a nuclear blast.\n  Combine that information with Iran's continued enrichment of uranium \nto 20 percent, development of new enrichment facilities, conducting of \nhigh explosives testing and detonator development to set off a nuclear \ncharge, computer modeling of a core of a nuclear warhead, and the \nAugust 2011 IAEA inspection that revealed 43.5 pounds of a component \nused to arm nuclear warheads was unaccounted for in Iran, and that Iran \nis working on an indigenous design for a nuclear payload small enough \nto fit on Iran's long-range Shahab-3 missile, a missile capable of \nreaching Israel, capable of reaching some of our allies in Europe which \nwe are committed to NATO to defend, there is a pretty clear picture of \nwhy this is in the national interest and security of the United States \nand what is going on in Iran.\n  The bill is intended to give Iran a pretty clear picture in return of \nwhat America's response to their posture would be. This includes \nsanctions on the national Iranian oil and tanker companies to terminate \na work-around to the Central Bank sanctions; sanctions on satellite \ncompanies that provide satellite services to the Iranian regime but \nfail to prevent jamming by Iran of transmissions by other users of the \nsame satellite service company; sanctions on financial messaging \nservice companies that provide services to sanctioned Iranian financial \ninstitutions; imposition of liability on parent companies for actions \nof foreign subsidiaries; and sanctions on energy joint ventures with \nIran related to the development of petroleum resources. Those are just \nsome.\n  This is perfecting legislation to CISADA and I am so thrilled we are \nseeing it today.\n  Finally, I wish to also comment on one particular section of the bill \nto ensure there is no ambiguity about its intent. Section 503, as \nrevised in the managers' amendment, preempts any conflicting Federal or \nState law, but only as they pertain to the eligibility for attachment \nand execution of certain blocked assets of the state of Iran, \nidentified in the section, for judgments against Iran for the execution \nof terrorist acts, including the marine corps barracks bombing in \nLebanon in 1983, which killed 241 U.S. servicemen, and the Khobar \nTowers bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1996 which killed 19 U.S. servicemen. \nNothing in this legislation alters any other applicable law.\n  As someone who authored these provisions, I wanted to be sure that \nthere was understanding on the record that Iran, in addition to \nstopping its nuclear weapons program, which is in the national interest \nand security of the United States, should not be able to avoid having \nits assets attached and pursued and executed upon as they killed \nAmericans and having been part of killing Americans abroad.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes; immediately thereafter, the Senator from Ohio, Senator Brown, \nbe permitted to speak for 5 minutes; and then the Senator from Kansas, \nSenator Moran, be permitted to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be brief. First, I wish to thank our chairman, \nSenator Johnson of South Dakota, for being so steadfast in bringing \nthis bill to the floor. He worked in tandem with Senator Shelby, whom I \nthank as well. Senator Menendez has been a true leader on these issues \nand has been the lead sponsor of many of the pieces of legislation to \ntighten the economic noose on Iran. I wish to thank my friend and \ncolleague Senator Graham from South Carolina as well for being so \ninstructive on this issue.\n  We have had a lot of divisions between Democrats and Republicans, but \non the issue of making sure that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon, \nwe are united. The threat, the specter of an Iranian nuclear weapon, \nwill continue to bring Democrats and Republicans together. I hope the \nIranian Government recognizes that, because we are going to continue to \ntighten and tighten and tighten restrictions so that Iran realizes that \nnot just the United States but just about all of the civilized world is \nagainst her gaining a nuclear weapon. The Iranians can't talk about why \nshouldn't have it when everyone else does. With the kind of saber \nrattling and verbiage that comes out of that regime about what they \nmight do to Israel or other countries, it shows they are not a mature \nenough nation to be possessing this God-awful power.\n  The point I wish to make here tonight is this is another step \nforward. We are further tightening the sanctions. We will continue to \ntighten them so that the answer for Iran, if they persist with moving \nforward on producing a nuclear weapon, is economic chaos for the \nIranian leadership and, unfortunately, for many of the Iranian people.\n  Let Iran beware. This is just another step. We will not stop. We are \nunited as two parties, we are united as a Nation, and we are united as \na family of nations to make sure we do everything we can to prevent \nIran from becoming a nuclear power. That would represent a disaster to \nthe nations of the world, and one we cannot tolerate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I wish to reiterate and \nunderscore the words of my colleague, the senior Senator from New York, \nabout how important the tightening of the Iran sanctions are to Israel, \nto the United States of America, and to the stability of the world. \nAllowing nuclear weapons in the hands of a country as unstable as Iran \nand which is hostile to so many of our values and which is hostile to \nmost people in the world--not just the United States, not just Israel, \nnot just the democratic world--how problematic this is for the entire \nworld. That is why I am pleased with the work Chairman Johnson did, \nalong with Ranking Member Shelby, Senator Menendez, Senator Graham, and \nothers, so that this continues to send an important message to Iran \nthat we will continue to increasingly tighten sanctions threatening to \nIran and the stability of its economy, and helping Iran to understand \nthat this will create difficulties for that regime in having any \nsupport of its people with the economic consequences that could happen \nas we tighten sanctions.\n  As Senator McCain said, we will take nothing off the table. We want a \ndiplomatic solution with these sanctions. We want Iran to recognize it \nis in their interests not to have nuclear weapons. That is the best \nthing for all of us, but, again, taking nothing off the table.\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3322-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       LEAD SMELTER SITES IN OHIO\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise to bring attention to a \nproblem plaguing many aging communities in Ohio and throughout the \nindustrial Midwest. We in this country have a rich manufacturing \nheritage, none richer than Ohio. We are the third leading manufacturing \nState in the country, trailing only in production, and trailing only \nStates two and three times our size--Texas and California. We have \nbuilt an infrastructure in this country that defined the landscape of \nthe modern world.\n  At Ohio plants in places such as Middletown and Youngstown, Ohioans \nmade steel beams that built America's skyscrapers, railroads, and \nbridges. And at lead smelter sites from Cleveland to Cincinnati, OH, \nworkers processed metal to shore up the economic foundation of 20th \ncentury America. But as revealed in a disturbing series of recent \nreports in USA TODAY, former lead smelter plants have left behind a \nterrible legacy: elevated lead levels in the soil and in the air and \nsurrounding playgrounds and schools, especially in poorer areas of our \ncities. Many of these potentially contaminated places are in \nunderresourced, aging areas where homes are not necessarily in good \nshape and where neighborhoods are plagued with many other problems as \nwell.\n  Yesterday I met with Angelina and Ken Shefton in Cleveland at a \nproperty that is within breathing distance of an old lead smelter site. \nWhat is even more troubling is that they didn't even know this existed. \nThey are parents of five. One of their sons was recently diagnosed with \nelevated blood lead levels. They fear for the other four children also. \nParents such as them and thousands of Ohioans living in communities \nwith aging and abandoned industrial sites are worried about the health \nand safety of their families.\n\n  A national newspaper report found that lead levels in soil near this \nsmelter plant in Cleveland exceed 3,400 parts per million. The average \nlead level in U.S. soils is only 19 parts per million.\n  As a father and grandfather, I am particularly disturbed by these \nreports. We know that lead is not broken down when it lingers in the \nground. It can enter our groundwater and children can absorb it on the \nbaseball diamond or while making mud pies in the yard.\n  For too long regulators have overlooked or neglected to fully \ninvestigate toxic sites in our communities. That is why I am urging the \nFederal Government to take action. I have called on the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to hold a hearing on what we can \ndo to address this issue. We need to prioritize testing our schools and \nplaygrounds in those neighborhoods close to abandoned sites.\n  I am asking the EPA to take immediate action to review sites that \nhave not yet been tested. But that is not enough. After the results \ncome in, we need to take action to clean up residual contamination.\n  Last week the CDC lowered by half the recommended allowable limit for \nlead exposure to young children, so we must ramp up our efforts to \naddress the problem lingering in our soil. We need to address it now. \nToo many young lives are depending on our actions. Too many children in \ntoo many urban school districts suffer from behavior problems, suffer \nfrom intelligence problems, if you will, because they have had far too \nhigh lead levels in their blood which retard growth, restrict learning, \nand cause behavioral problems. It is a serious public health problem. \nIt is the paint on the walls in these old homes, and it is the lead in \nthe paint on the walls. It is the lead in the soil of the homes and \nneighborhoods and playgrounds. It does call for real action from State \nand Federal Governments and local communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3322-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LIFE OF BOB BETHELL\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I woke up this morning in Kansas with \nsome sad news. One of our State legislators, Bob Bethell, a 13-year \nmember of the Kansas House of Representatives, died in a car wreck late \nlast night. The Kansas legislature has had a difficult session and \nfinally concluded, I believe after 100 days of the legislative session, \nthis year's work in Topeka, and one of our central Kansas legislators \non the drive home from Topeka back to Alden, KS, was involved in a one-\ncar accident, a fatality.\n  I rise tonight to pay respect to my friend and former colleague Bob \nBethell, and express my respect and gratitude for his public service, \nand my care and concern, in fact my love, for his wife Lorene and his \nfamily and friends.\n  Bob Bethell was, I suppose you could call him, a great politician in \nthe sense that his constituents loved and admired him. They respected \nhim. They cared about him. He could be called a great politician \nbecause in Topeka he was someone whose voice was listened to. But \nnothing about Bob Bethell was a politician.\n  Bob Bethell was a person who was a Baptist minister in his small \nhometown. He loved God greatly. God was the focus of his life. He loved \nthe people God created in his community and across Kansas. In fact, Bob \nbecame the administrator of a nursing home because of his care for \nsenior citizens. It was that extension of his care for seniors that \ncaused him to want to serve in the legislature. Bob wanted to extend \nthat opportunity to make a difference in the lives of the people he \ncared for in his profession with public policy decisions that were \nimportant to them and their future and their families in Topeka, KS.\n  Again, I would say there is nothing political about Bob Bethell. He \nwas respected and someone everybody enjoyed being around, but it wasn't \nbecause he as a politician calculated what the right answer was or how \nto get along with people or one who took a poll to discover what the \nissues were that people supported; it was just that Bob Bethell, in his \nlove of God, had a love of human beings, of citizens of Kansas. So we \nwould see Bob Bethell with a smile on his face at every parade, at \nevery community meeting.\n  I think sometimes in our lives, when we see an elected official, we \nmay see someone walk across the street sometimes to avoid the political \nconversation. But, again, there was nothing political about Bob; he was \nsomebody who cared about people and it showed. He enjoyed being around \npeople; loved the conversation. He worked hard at being a constituent-\nservice-oriented member in the Kansas House of Representatives. It is \nso sad for us to lose such a person.\n  I hope Lorene and her family and friends in Alden find comfort in the \nbelief that God will care for Bob Bethell in the life hereafter. They \nbelieve that in their lives. They demonstrated that to the people \nacross Kansas, and their focus was a love of others.

Madam President, I rise today to recognize the Las Vegas \nMetropolitan Police Department's Hispanic American Resource Team's \n(H.A.R.T.) 10th Academy for their efforts to combat crimes against \nHispanic-Americans, while building good will and trust between the \ncity's police department and the Hispanic community.\n  For more than a decade, H.A.R.T. has fulfilled and exceeded its \nmission, ``to build and maintain positive relationships between the \nHispanic community and the police through compassion and innovative \nthinking.'' At its core, the H.A.R.T. program trains and places \ntalented officers who are fluent in English and Spanish to work \ndirectly with Spanish-dominant community members. It is through \nlanguage ability, cultural competence, and dedication that H.A.R.T \nmaintains public safety for the broader community regardless of \nlanguage capability or immigration status.\n  A centerpiece of the educational services H.A.R.T. provides is the \nHispanic Citizens Academy which offers an intensive 12-week training \nprogram in Spanish to non-English speaking community members to impart \nknowledge on how to navigate through routine law enforcement protocols, \nincluding knowing their legal rights and how to contact the police in \ncase of an emergency. The Hispanic Citizens Academy helps strengthen \nthe partnership between the Hispanic immigrant community and the Las \nVegas Metropolitan Police Department. In fact, the National League of \nCities recognized Las Vegas and the H.A.R.T. program as one of the top \n17 U.S. police departments for good practices in a June 2011 report. \nH.A.R.T.'s work serves as a model for other police departments across \nthe Nation to ensure public safety in immigrant communities by keeping \nthem informed and engaged.\n  On May 23, 2012, H.A.R.T. will be celebrating the graduation of \nindividuals serving in the 10th Hispanic Citizens Academy, a stage \nshared by more than 500 alumni of the program. I am a proud supporter \nof the H.A.R.T. program, and I applaud the leadership and dedication \nlaw enforcement officers have demonstrated to the growing Hispanic \npopulation of my home State of Nevada. I ask my colleagues to please \njoin me in congratulating the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department \nand its H.A.RT initiative as they celebrate the 10th Hispanic Citizens \nAcademy. I wish H.A.R.T. continued success in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3323-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMES CECIL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today I wish to honor Mr. James \nCecil, who is believed to be the last living member of the 729th \nPlatoon of the 2nd Marine Division, known as the Lexington Platoon. Mr. \nCecil and 69 other men from the central Kentucky area formed the \nPlatoon in 1942, 8 months after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. \nThese young men went on to fight in some of the bloodiest battles of \nthe Pacific, including in Okinawa, Saipan, Tinian, and Guadalcanal.\n  The Lexington Platoon was honored on Thursday, May 17 at the \nLexington Urban City Council meeting, with Mr. Cecil being the only \nmember present. Lexington Mayor Jim Gray proclaimed it James Cecil Day, \nand Councilman Jay McChord spoke about his interviews with Mr. Cecil \nwhile writing his 2010 book, A Veteran's Legacy: Field Kit Journal.\n  James Cecil grew up on a tobacco farm, and chose to join the Marines \nwhen the United States entered the war rather than being drafted. He \nwas promoted from private to corporal after killing a Japanese officer \nand obtaining his map of artillery positions, and received a Purple \nHeart for injuries suffered during the battle of Saipan in June 1944.\n  Although Mr. Cecil was recommended for officer candidate school in \nAugust 1945, he never got the chance to attend, as in the weeks \nfollowing, the United States bombed Japan, thus ending World War II.\n  After his service, Mr. Cecil moved to Ohio and became the owner of a \nsuccessful trucking company. He moved back to Lexington after the death \nof his wife, Janet, in 1988. Today, Mr. Cecil is in good health and \nstill often reflects on his wartime experiences. He says that he feels \n``honored and proud that [he] served [his] country.''\n  I would like to ask at this time for my colleagues in the U.S. Senate \nto join me in recognizing Mr. James Cecil for his brave service to our \nNation during World War II. There was recently an article published in \nthe Lexington Herald-Leader highlighting Mr. Cecil's valorous service \nand his platoon's legacy. I ask unanimous consent that said article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, May 15, 2012]\n\n     Sole Surviving Marines' Lexington Platoon Member To Be Honored\n\n                             (By Tom Eblen)\n\n       Eight months after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, \n     hundreds of people gathered around the steps of the Fayette \n     County Courthouse to honor James T. Cecil and 69 other local \n     boys.\n       The recent graduates of Henry Clay, Lafayette and other \n     central Kentucky high schools were forming the Lexington \n     Platoon of the United States Marine Corps. Mayor T. Ward \n     Havely and other dignitaries spoke at the mass-induction \n     ceremony. A young lady sang the Marine Hymn, and women and \n     children wept, the Lexington Herald and Leader reported in \n     late August 1942.\n       Platoon members left in buses that day for processing in \n     Louisville and training in San Diego. From there, they joined \n     some of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific Theater: \n     Okinawa, Saipan, Tinian and Guadalcanal.\n       The Lexington Platoon will be honored again Thursday at the \n     Urban County Council meeting. This time, Cecil, 88, will be \n     the only platoon member present. ``As best we can tell, I'm \n     the only one left,'' he said.\n       Mayor Jim Gray will present a proclamation declaring James \n     Cecil Day. Councilman Jay McChord will speak about how he met \n     Cecil and other World War II veterans while writing and \n     illustrating his 2010 book, A Veteran's Legacy: Field Kit \n     Journal.\n       ``We're losing so many of these guys every day, it's good \n     any time we can honor them,'' McChord said. ``We need to \n     remind ourselves of who they are and what they did.''\n       Cecil and Mitch Alcorn, his Lafayette High School buddy and \n     the longtime Midway postmaster, began tracking down their \n     fellow Lexington Platoon members several years ago, searching \n     the Internet and running ads in veterans magazines.\n       By this time last year, the group had dwindled to the two \n     of them and Elwood Watkins, who earned a Silver Star and \n     three Purple Hearts in battle. Watkins died July 12. Alcorn, \n     who earned a Purple Heart and later fought in the Korean and \n     Vietnam wars as an Army officer, died February 18.\n       Cecil grew up on a tobacco farm off Nicholasville Road. \n     ``We didn't have any money, but we had plenty to eat,'' he \n     said. ``We had milk cows, chickens and a big garden.''\n       When the war came, he decided to join the Marines rather \n     than wait to be drafted. After training, platoon members were \n     scattered to various units of the 2nd Marine Division, \n     although Cecil served alongside Alcorn and a few others from \n     Lexington. ``We were just like a big family,'' he said.\n       As I talked with Cecil last week, he pulled out a small \n     envelope. Inside was a portrait of a Japanese officer he \n     killed, and money and a ration card he found in the officer's \n     pocket. That wasn't all: The officer was carrying a map of \n     artillery positions, a find that got Cecil promoted from \n     private to corporal.\n       Cecil earned a Purple Heart for wounds suffered in the \n     battle of Saipan on June 20, 1944. He survived several \n     Japanese suicide attacks on his camps at night.\n       ``The next morning you couldn't walk without walking on a \n     dead Marine or a dead Japanese,'' he said.\n       At the battle of Okinawa, a Japanese suicide pilot hit the \n     USS Hinsdale before Cecil's unit could land on the beach. \n     Cecil spent 45 minutes in the cold water, watching for \n     sharks, before a Navy destroyer rescued him.\n       ``We had so many killed and wounded,'' Cecil said. ``Every \n     battle, you just didn't know who was going to be next.''\n       Cecil's only trip stateside came in August 1945, when he \n     was recommended for officer candidate school. Before he could \n     begin, though, U.S. forces dropped atomic bombs on Japan, and \n     World War II ended.\n       After the war, Cecil had a successful career as the owner \n     of an Ohio-based trucking company. He moved back to Lexington \n     after Janet, his wife of 52 years, died in 1998. In his \n     apartment, he proudly displays photos of her, their sons and \n     their grandsons.\n       Cecil's health is good, his mind sharp. He finds himself \n     thinking a lot these days about his wartime experiences, \n     including the occasional nightmare with Japanese soldiers \n     ``getting after me.''\n       ``I just felt honored and proud that I served my country,'' \n     Cecil said. ``Coming off a tobacco patch and going into \n     battle, that was a hell of a change. We were just a bunch of \n     brave boys.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3323-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3323-S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISHRA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, earlier today the\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nSenate passed by Unanimous Consent S. 2101, the Iran Sanctions, \nAccountability, and Human Rights Acts of 2012 (ISHRA). The bill \nsignificantly increases pressure on Iran's leaders and I thank my \ncolleagues for their support of this important measure. As we begin \nnegotiations with our counterparts in the House, I want to expand on my \ncomments from my earlier statement. I do so in order to provide my \ncolleagues some clarification regarding a few provisions in the bill.\n  First, section 201 of the Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Human \nRights Acts of 2012 will impose sanctions, for the first time, against \nentities involved in joint ventures to develop petroleum resources \noutside of Iran that are established on or after January 1, 2002. Those \njoint ventures which qualify are joint ventures which involve the \nGovernment of Iran as a substantial partner or investor, or through \nwhich Iran could receive technological knowledge or equipment not \npreviously available to it that could contribute to its ability to \ndevelop domestic petroleum resources. Further, even if ancillary \nagreements to implement an existing pre 2002 joint venture are agreed \nto on or after January 1, 2002, sanctions are not authorized to be \nimposed against any third-party to that joint venture or against \npersons who provide goods, services, technology or information to such \na joint venture, as a result of their participation in or dealings with \nsuch venture, by virtue of such ancillary agreements.\n  In addition, this legislation seeks to continue the long-standing \ntradition of ensuring that humanitarian trade, including agricultural \ncommodities, food, medicine and medical products is specifically \nexempted by Congress from sanctions, on the condition that such trade \nbe licensed by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, or OFAC. It is becoming more apparent that U.S. \nfinancial sanctions targeting Iran's banking sector are causing \nincreased concern among businesses and banks of our allies. The fear is \nthat engaging in humanitarian trade in the current sanctions \nenvironment might lead to sanctions for legitimately licensed \nhumanitarian trade.\n  However, it is not and has not been the intent of U.S. policy to harm \nthe Iranian people by prohibiting humanitarian trade that is licensed \nby the U.S. Treasury Department. OFAC consistently issues many \nlicenses, both general and specific, for this type of trade. The \npractical financing difficulties arising today between banks and those \nengaging in licensed humanitarian trade can be best addressed by U.S. \nGovernment officials, who should do more to make it clear that no U.S. \nsanctions will be imposed against third-country banks that facilitate \nOFAC-licensed or exempted humanitarian trade. The Administration must \nmake that clear in public statements, in private meetings with foreign \nfinancial institutions, and elsewhere as appropriate.\n  Misinterpretation of U.S. law by foreign financial institutions \nshould no longer deny the people of Iran the benefit of OFAC-approved \nhumanitarian trade.\n  I want to close by again thanking my colleagues for their support of \nISHRA. I think this action sends an important message to the Iranians \nand the world that the U.S. will continue to increase sanctions until \nIran verifiably abandons its illicit nuclear program. As we begin our \nwork with the House, I will continue to press for the strongest and \nmost effective sanctions legislation possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3324-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CUBAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Madam President, to mark the occasion of President \nObama's Camp David G8 Summit focusing, in part, on the problem of food \nsecurity in Africa, I want to take this opportunity to address the \nnecessity for the United States to help foster stable and democratic \nnations as partners as we build multilateral coalitions to tackle \nglobal issues like hunger and poverty.\n  Alaska is a long way from Africa, but the citizens of my State are \ncommitted to a stable and prosperous Africa. Many Alaskans contribute \ntheir time and resources toward this goal.\n  A year ago in Deauville, France, President Obama joined other leaders \nof the G8 in reaffirming that ``democracy lays the best path to peace, \nstability, prosperity, shared growth and development.'' As the events \nin North Africa and the Middle East have shown, supporting reliable \nautocrats who are helpful on matters of security and economics at the \nexpense of human dignity, basic democratic rights, and access to \neconomic opportunity is more perilous than ever to long-term U.S. \nnational security interests.\n  It is for this reason that I make a few points about our reliable \npartner in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia. Two weeks ago at the World \nEconomic Forum, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi made hopeful \nremarks about the virtues of democratic society. I publically commit my \ncontinuing support for efforts to make such important principles a \nreality in Ethiopia. It is in the U.S. interest to match Ethiopia's \nprogress in economic development and poverty reduction with movement \ntoward economic opportunity, social justice and judicial independence. \nIt has been said that basic human rights and free and fair elections \nare nothing but dreams for all except for the developed countries of \nthe world. I do not believe that to be true; Ethiopia is ready to \nrealize that dream. To foster the benefits of a diverse citizenry, the \nmany political prisoners and journalists should be released, the \nCharities and Societies Act, as designed and as it is implemented, \nshould be prevented from strangling peaceful civil society advocacy.\n  Beginning in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt and Ethiopian Emperor \nMenelik II launched a long and mutually beneficial history of working \ntogether on important geopolitical and economic strategic partnerships \nthat last to this day. Our friend and partner, Ethiopia, has been a \nchampion with the United States during many critical times for almost \n110 years. When Italy invaded Ethiopia, we refused to recognize the \nconquest. When the United States asked for help during the Cold War, \nHaile Selassie was ready to help. When the regime of Mengistu Haile-\nMariam failed, the United States came to Ethiopia's side with help to \nprevent violence in Addis Ababa, by facilitating Mengistu's departure. \nWe gave this support for the mutual benefit and promise of \ndemocratization in Ethiopia.\n  Ethiopia's macroeconomic successes of rapid growth rates and better \nthan average performance in poverty reduction have been celebrated at \nthis past week's G8 Summit, and at the recent World Economic Forum. \nThere Prime Minister Meles pondered aloud:\n\n       What is the substantive political thing that creates such \n     an environment [of fair economic opportunity for all \n     citizens]? The one [thing] that creates such an environment \n     is an engaged citizenry that is able to create an environment \n     where corruption and loot cannot happen at the lower level, \n     at the mid-level, at the higher level, and that goes beyond \n     elections every four and five years.\n\n  On the microeconomic level, aside from the lack of progress on land \nreform, this is good news indeed, given recent complaints about poor \nstate of economic opportunity for all of Ethiopia's citizens. We are \nhopeful this is a sign that Ethiopia's federal ministries are ready to \nengage and assist the local citizenry in issues that relate to their\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\neconomic interests. Many observers are pessimistic, but I prefer to \nthink of the glass as half full, and ready to be filled to the brim.\n  The Prime Minister's sentiments raise many issues, including: the \nnation's commitment to an environment conducive to free speech and \ncitizen participation; a commitment to building an informed and engaged \ncitizenry as a key to inclusive, long term economic development; a call \nfor the quick and unconditional release of journalists and political \nprisoners as a measure of good faith; and commitment to a diverse and \nmulti-party election in 2015, free from federal government \ninterference.\n  Hopeful as I am, I urge my Senate and House colleagues to re-commit \nto assistance we have offered the people of Ethiopia and their \ngovernment in the past.\n  Let us help build a national consensus on the value of the following \ngoals in Ethiopia: robust public institutions that represent the \ndiversity of perspectives in Ethiopia; free and fair political \nprocesses drawing legitimacy from broad citizen participation; an \nindependent judicial system as outlined in Ethiopia's constitution; a \npress with institutional independence and legal protection to enable it \nto accommodate and a broad range of perspectives and ensure the free \nflow of information, ideas and opinions that are necessary in a \ndemocratic society, as outlined in Ethiopia's constitution; an \nenvironment where each citizen can take advantage of Ethiopia's \neconomic success; and the security that comes with the assurance that \nuniversal rights are respected and protected.\n  Our international partnerships are stronger and more enduring when we \nshare values of opportunity and freedom with our partners. A more \ndemocratic Ethiopia would represent a more stable and reliable partner \nfor the United States and serve the long-term interests of peace and \nsecurity in the Horn of Africa. A more democratic Ethiopia would ease \nthe free flow of information, which would ease trade and ensure more \ninformed investments. A more democratic Ethiopia would ensure that \ngovernment policies are the result of broad national consultation with \nall segments of society.\n  Such are hallmarks of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and \nthey provide a return of accountability and transparency to both \nAmerican taxpayers and Ethiopian citizens. Let's do what we can to help \nour fast and true friend, Ethiopia, extend opportunity and freedom to \nthe majority of its citizenry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3325-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING THE SALVE REGINA UNIVERSITY MEN'S RUGBY TEAM\n\n  Mr. REED.

His signature \nachievement in this regard was the advancement of project labor \nagreements for major public works projects, which are now widely used \nto deliver construction in a cost-efficient and timely manner.\n  Mr. Malloy was also a strong supporter of promoting opportunity and \ndiversity in the construction industry's workforce, helping launch \nprograms to provide access to careers in the building and construction \ntrades for youth, veterans of the U.S. Armed Services, minorities and \nwomen. In particular, an organization that Mr. Malloy helped found has \nto date placed more than 1,300 youth, public housing residents and \nother city residents into unionized apprenticeships, 89 percent of whom \nare African American, Hispanic, Asian and other minorities. The results \nof these efforts are evident today, with the majority of union \napprentices and workers in New York City's construction industry being \nAfrican American, Hispanic, Asian and other minorities.\n  Edward J. Malloy was respected by all who knew him as not only a \ntireless advocate for working men and women, but an advocate for our \ngreat city and State. His hard work and wit allowed him to pass easily \nfrom union halls to business board rooms and the chambers of \ngovernment.\n  This dedication and personality served members of organized labor \nwell for decades as he worked to promote job creation, economic \ndevelopment and fairness. His contributions are immeasurable and we owe \nhim an enormous debt of gratitude for them. We extend our heartfelt \ncondolences to his family on behalf of an entire industry. Mr. \nPresident, today, I ask all members of this esteemed body to join me in \nhonoring Edward J. Malloy's lifetime of commitment to improving the \nlives of working men and women from around the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3325-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3325-S3326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, today, I want to congratulate \nand acknowledge the University of Texas at Austin's Department of \nHistory for creating an interactive website that offers\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\na unique outlet for promoting information and enhancing understanding \nabout U.S. and world history. This new site puts the expertise of the \nUniversity of Texas world-renowned faculty at the service of the \ngeneral citizenry, and provides a public forum for the discussion of \nhistorical and contemporary events.\n  The title of the website, www.notevenpast.org, ``Not Even Past,'' \n(NEP) derives its name from William Faulkner's famous line that, ``The \npast is never dead. It's not even past.'' It acknowledges the \nprofessional and ethical commitment to understanding history as a \npublic conversation about the importance of the past for our actions, \nvalues, and beliefs in the present, and for the decisions we make today \nthat will affect our lives tomorrow.\n  I would like to congratulate particularly the efforts of Professor \nJoan Neuberger, Chairman Alan Tully, the department's 60-person \nfaculty, and the input of graduate students for establishing this \nproject in 2010.\n  NEP brings together a diverse group of historians in every major \nhistorical field by using modern technology as a vehicle to share their \nperspectives on topics related to Texas, the United States, and world \nhistory. The website allows people from around the world with an \ninterest in history and historical events to take advantage of the \nUniversity of Texas' new resource. This unique and innovative website \noffers book and film recommendations, movie clips, podcasts, links to \nhistorical documents and artifacts, as well as a fact-checker series \nand free virtual courses.\n  The development of NEP reinforces the reputation of the University of \nTexas Department of History. I believe this website is an invaluable \nresource of remarkable range and interest, and will advance the \nuniversity's goal of undertaking programs of civil, educational and \nsocial services.\n  Since NEP was launched in January 2011, the website has enabled \nhosting and sponsoring events devoted to the history curriculum, \norganization of a book club with award-winning professors and students \nof history, accumulation of an extensive library of podcasts, short \narticles and recommended movies related to all aspects of history, and \neven virtual history courses that are offered through the University of \nTexas. In June 2012, NEP will also begin posting university, high \nschool, and middle school students' history projects.\n  Congratulations to the University of Texas Department of History for \ncreating this interactive website.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3326-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. LEWIS N. WALKER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, today I, along with my Senate \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, recognize Dr. Lewis Walker, \na dynamic and forward thinking leader who has been a driving force \nbehind Lawrence Technological University's growth and continued \nsuccess. Dr. Walker retires in June after 18 years at Lawrence Tech, \nthe last 6 as President and CEO.\n  Ensuring students acquire the skills necessary to meet the challenges \nof an ever-changing, global workplace has been a central tenet of Dr. \nWalker's work at Lawrence Tech. Since joining Lawrence Tech in 1994, \nDr. Walker has sought innovative ways to expand the university's \nacademic footprint. A hallmark of his tenure has been his commitment to \nbroadening academic opportunities for students, pursuing international \npartnerships, and expanding the university's technological \ninfrastructure.\n  This work led to the creation of a number of certificate and degree \nprograms at Lawrence Tech, from the associate to the doctoral level, \nand notably includes programs in robotics, defense and sustainability. \nImpressively, during his tenure, the number of academic programs the \nuniversity offers has expanded from 60 to more than 100 and more than \n40 ``fast track'' certificate programs have been created to help \ndislocated workers transition to new career paths.\n  Dr. Walker also emphasized leadership, believing that ``Our aim has \nbeen to imbue in our graduates the ability to have confidence in \nthemselves.'' This focus is truly perceptive. Seeking to integrate \nleadership throughout the University experience, Lawrence Tech now \nincludes leadership training as part of its undergraduate experience. \nUnder Dr. Walker's leadership Lawrence Tech also forged a partnership \nwith the Ferndale Public Schools to establish the University High \nSchool, a high school designed to challenge its students academically \nand expose them to the university experience. Its core focus is to \nprepare public high school students for success in college and beyond.\n  Dr. Walker has a distinguished academic background. He holds 3 \ndegrees, including a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and has published \nmore than 50 technical papers. Before joining Lawrence Tech, he served \nat the University of Hartford in various capacities, including dean of \nengineering and special assistant to the president. Earlier this year, \nhe was awarded the 2012 Gold Award from the Affiliate Council of \nEngineering Society of Detroit for his outstanding work in science and \nengineering.\n  Throughout his professional career, Dr. Walker has worked tirelessly \nto find solutions to pressing concerns and to position Lawrence Tech to \nmeet the challenges of tomorrow. The Lawrence Tech community is a \nbetter place as a result of his efforts, and we know his wife, Nancy \nand their children and grandchildren are proud of his many \naccomplishments over his long and illustrious career. We wish Dr. \nWalker and his family the best as he embarks on the next chapter of his \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3326-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3326-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3326-4", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3326-S3327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \nORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13303 OF MAY 22, 2003, RECEIVED \n        DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON MAY 18, 2012--PM 50\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to provide for the settlement of the water rights \nclaims of the Fort Belknap Indian Community, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, water is the foundation for life. That is \ntrue in every community, but especially in American Indian Country. \nWater plays a particularly important role in Native American life--past \nand present--in history, culture and religion. That is why I am proud \nto introduce the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine Tribes of the Fort Belknap \nIndian Community Water Rights Settlement Act of 2012.\n  Not every issue relating to this important compact is resolved. I \nvery much appreciate the perspective of those who say that changes are \nstill needed. My goal in introducing this legislation is to get all \ninterested parties to negotiate on the issues that must still be \nresolved. By introducing this bill today, the Ft. Belknap Indian \ncommunity, surrounding counties and the State of Montana indicate to \nthe United States that we are ready to negotiate in earnest. During \nthat process, Montanans and I will work to gain support from the \nDepartment of the Interior, State of Montana, the Tribe, and local \ncommunities as we address individual concerns.\n  The current federal policy to determine Indian water rights is to \nnegotiate, rather than litigate. Montana has had a similar policy since \nit created the Montana Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission in \n1979. Both governments recognize that litigating every water right on \nMontana's vast Indian reservations is cost prohibitive and time \nconsuming. Negotiated settlements are cheaper for everybody. They are \nmuch faster than litigation. They allow individuals to participate in \nthe outcome. They provide a greater degree of certainty to everybody \ninvolved. Folks working on this settlement and I intend this \nlegislation to fulfill the spirit of those policies.\n  Since the Supreme Court's 1908 decision in Winters, the United States \nhas had a responsibility to provide water to the land it reserves for \nspecific purposes, such as reservations for American Indian homelands. \nThis legislation fulfills that responsibility. It will empower the \nTribe to create jobs and stronger communities by improving critical \ninfrastructure.\n  More importantly, it strikes the proper balance to achieve a fair, \nequitable, and final settlement of claims to water rights in the State \nof Montana between the State, the Tribe, and the United States for the \nbenefit for the Tribe and allottees.\n  There is more work to do to ensure that all interested parties can \nsupport a final agreement. I understand that. However, hundreds of \nhours of deliberation over more than a decade have been put into \nshaping the terms of this Compact and Settlement. Although we have made \ngood progress during that time, we still have a lot of work left. I \nlook forward to working with my tribal, local, state and federal \npartners to get this done. It is the right thing to do for the United \nStates, the Tribe and the State of Montana.\n  In 2001, as a member of the Montana legislature, I was happy to \nsupport\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\nstate ratification of the Fort Belknap Water Rights Compact. I look \nforward to assisting the parties in moving this Compact over the next \nhurdle--congressional authorization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3331-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 468--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \nTO CHILDHOOD STROKE AND RECOGNIZING MAY AS ``NATIONAL PEDIATRIC STROKE \n                           AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Chambliss) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 468\n\n       Whereas a stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, \n     is an acute neurologic injury that occurs when the blood \n     supply to a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in the \n     artery or a burst of the artery;\n       Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause \n     permanent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly \n     diagnosed and treated;\n       Whereas stroke occurs in approximately 1 out of every 4,000 \n     live births, and the risk of stroke from birth through age 18 \n     is nearly 11 out of every 100,000 children per year;\n       Whereas an individual can have a stroke before birth;\n       Whereas stroke is among the top 10 causes of death for \n     children in the United States;\n       Whereas between 20 percent and 40 percent of children who \n     suffer a stroke die as a result;\n       Whereas stroke recurs in 20 percent of children who have \n     experienced a stroke;\n       Whereas the death rate for children who experience a stroke \n     before the age of 1 year is the highest out of all age \n     groups;\n       Whereas the average time from onset of symptoms to \n     diagnosis of stroke is 24 hours, putting many affected \n     children outside the window of 3 hours for the most \n     successful treatment;\n       Whereas between 50 and 85 percent of infants and children \n     who have a pediatric stroke will have serious, permanent \n     neurological disabilities, including paralysis, seizures, \n     speech and vision problems, and attention, learning, and \n     behavioral difficulties;\n       Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical \n     therapy and surgeries;\n       Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments \n     resulting from strokes that occur during childhood and young \n     adulthood have a considerable impact on children, families, \n     and society;\n       Whereas very little is known about the cause, treatment, \n     and prevention of pediatric stroke;\n       Whereas medical research is the only means by which the \n     citizens of the United States can identify and develop \n     effective treatment and prevention strategies for pediatric \n     stroke; and\n       Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric stroke \n     greatly improves the chances that the affected child will \n     recover and not experience a recurrence: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges May as ``National Pediatric Stroke \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to support the \n     efforts, programs, services, and advocacy of organizations \n     that work to enhance public awareness of childhood stroke;\n       (3) supports the work of the National Institutes of Health \n     in pursuit of medical progress on the matter of pediatric \n     stroke; and\n       (4) urges continued coordination and cooperation between \n     government, researchers, families, and the public to improve \n     treatments and prognoses for children who suffer strokes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3331-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 469--HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF SMALL \n BUSINESS CONCERNS IN THE UNITED STATES DURING NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS \n                   WEEK, WHICH BEGINS ON MAY 20, 2012\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nEnzi, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Ayotte, \nMr. Risch, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Merkley) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 469\n\n       Whereas the approximately 27,500,000 small business \n     concerns in the United States are the driving force behind \n     the Nation's economy, creating 2 out of every 3 new jobs and \n     generating more than 50 percent of the Nation's non-farm \n     gross domestic product;\n       Whereas small businesses are the driving force behind the \n     economic recovery of the United States;\n       Whereas small businesses represent 99.7 percent of employer \n     firms in the United States;\n       Whereas small business concerns are the Nation's \n     innovators, serving to advance technology and productivity;\n       Whereas small business concerns represent 97.5 percent of \n     all exporters and produce 31 percent of exported goods;\n       Whereas Congress established the Small Business \n     Administration in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect \n     the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve \n     free and competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total Federal Government purchases, \n     contracts, and subcontracts for property and services are \n     placed with small business concerns, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total sales of government property are made \n     to such small business concerns, and to maintain and \n     strengthen the overall economy of the United States;\n       Whereas every year since 1963, the President has designated \n     a ``National Small Business Week'' to recognize the \n     contributions of small businesses to the economic well-being \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas in 2012, National Small Business Week will honor \n     the estimated 27,200,000 small businesses in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small \n     business concerns by providing access to critical lending \n     opportunities, protecting small business concerns from \n     excessive Federal regulatory enforcement, helping to ensure \n     full and open competition for government contracts, and \n     improving the economic environment in which small business \n     concerns compete;\n       Whereas for more than 50 years, the Small Business \n     Administration has helped millions of entrepreneurs achieve \n     the American dream of owning a small business, and has played \n     a key role in fostering economic growth; and\n       Whereas the President has designated the week beginning May \n     20, 2012, as ``National Small Business Week'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the entrepreneurial spirit of small business \n     concerns in the United States during National Small Business \n     Week, which begins on May 20, 2012;\n       (2) applauds the efforts and achievements of the owners and \n     employees of small business concerns, whose hard work and \n     commitment to excellence have made such small business \n     concerns a key part of the economic vitality of the United \n     States;\n       (3) recognizes the work of the Small Business \n     Administration and its resource partners in providing \n     assistance to entrepreneurs and small business concerns; and\n       (4) recognizes the importance of ensuring that--\n       (A) guaranteed loans, including microloans and microloan \n     technical assistance, for start-up and growing small business \n     concerns, and venture capital, are made available to all \n     qualified small business concerns;\n       (B) the management assistance programs delivered by \n     resource partners on behalf of the Small Business \n     Administration, such as Small Business Development Centers, \n     Women's Business Centers, and the Service Corps of Retired \n     Executives, are provided with the Federal resources necessary \n     to provide invaluable counseling services to entrepreneurs in \n     the United States;\n       (C) the Small Business Administration continues to provide \n     timely and efficient disaster assistance so that small \n     businesses in areas struck by natural or manmade disasters \n     can quickly return to business to keep local economies alive \n     in the aftermath of such disasters;\n       (D) affordable broadband Internet access is available to \n     all people in the United States, particularly people in rural \n     and underserved communities, so that small businesses can use \n     the Internet to make their operations more globally \n     competitive while boosting local economies;\n       (E) regulatory relief is provided to small businesses \n     through the reduction of duplicative or unnecessary \n     regulatory requirements that increase costs for small \n     businesses; and\n       (F) leveling the playing field for contracting \n     opportunities remains a primary focus, so that small \n     businesses, particularly minority-owned small businesses, can \n     compete for and win more of the $400,000,000,000 in contracts \n     that the Federal Government enters into each year for goods \n     and services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3331-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3331-S3332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2113.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the \n     ``Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of \n     2012''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers is a \n     matter of increasing public health concern. According to the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, \n     the proportion of all substance abuse treatment admissions \n     aged 12 or older that reported any pain reliever abuse \n     increased more than 400 percent between 1998 and 2008, from \n     2.2 to 9.8 percent.\n       (2) In 2008, among the population of the United States aged \n     12 or older, nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers \n     was the second most prevalent type of illicit drug use, after \n     marijuana use.\n       (3) When used properly under medical supervision, \n     prescription opiates enable individuals with chronic pain to \n     lead productive lives. However, when taken without a \n     physician's oversight and direction, opiates can cause \n     serious adverse health effects, resulting in dependence, \n     abuse, and death.\n       (4) As with any controlled substance, there is a risk of \n     abuse of methadone and other opiates.\n       (5) Methadone is an extensively tested, federally approved, \n     and widely accepted method of treating addiction to \n     prescription pain relievers or opiates.\n       (6) For more than 30 years, this synthetic prescription \n     drug has been used for pain management and treatment for \n     addiction to heroin, morphine, and other opioid drugs.\n       (7) The efficacy and lower cost of methadone has resulted \n     in its being prescribed for pain management.\n       (8) Prescriptions for methadone have increased by nearly \n     700 percent from 1998 through 2006.\n       (9) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the number of poisoning deaths involving \n     methadone increased nearly 7-fold from almost 790 in 1999 to \n     almost 5,420 in 2006, which is the most rapid increase among \n     opioid analgesics and other narcotics involved in poisoning \n     deaths.\n       (10) The age-specific rates of methadone death are higher \n     for persons age 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 than for other age \n     groups. However, the rate of methadone deaths in younger \n     individuals (age 15 to 24) increased 11-fold from 1999 \n     through 2005.\n       (11) Deaths from methadone and other opiates may actually \n     be underreported. There is no comprehensive database of drug-\n     related deaths in the United States.\n       (12) The lack of standardized reporting by Medical \n     Examiners precludes a uniform definition of ``cause of \n     death'' on death certificates.\n       (13) The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) \n     requires that every person who dispenses or who proposes to \n     dispense controlled narcotics, including methadone, whether \n     for pain management or opioid treatment obtain a registration \n     from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Unfortunately there \n     is no requirement as a condition of receiving the \n     registration that these practitioners receive any education \n     on the use of these controlled narcotics, including \n     methadone.\n       (14) Current Federal oversight of methadone and other \n     opioids is inadequate to address the growing number of \n     opioid-related overdoses and deaths.\n       (15) Federal legislation is needed to avert opioid abuse, \n     misuse, and death, without reducing patient access to needed \n     care.\n\n     SEC. 1142.

ENHANCEMENT OF ACCELERATED PATIENT ACCESS TO NEW \n                   MEDICAL TREATMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings; Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (A) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in this \n     section as the ``FDA'') serves a critical role in helping to \n     assure that new medicines are safe and effective. Regulatory \n     innovation is 1 element of the Nation's strategy to address \n     serious and life-threatening diseases or conditions by \n     promoting investment in and development of innovative \n     treatments for unmet medical needs.\n       (B) During the 2 decades following the establishment of the \n     accelerated approval mechanism, advances in medical sciences, \n     including genomics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, \n     have provided an unprecedented understanding of the \n     underlying biological mechanism and pathogenesis of disease. \n     A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is under \n     development to treat serious and life-threatening diseases, \n     some applying drug development strategies based on biomarkers \n     or pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, clinical trial \n     enrichment techniques, and novel clinical trial designs, such \n     as adaptive clinical trials.\n       (C) As a result of these remarkable scientific and medical \n     advances, the FDA should be encouraged to implement more \n     broadly effective processes for the expedited development and \n     review of innovative new medicines intended to address unmet \n     medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or \n     conditions, including those for rare diseases or conditions, \n     using a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and \n     modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle \n     when appropriate. This may result in fewer, smaller, or \n     shorter clinical trials for the intended patient population \n     or targeted subpopulation without compromising or altering \n     the high standards of the FDA for the approval of drugs.\n       (D) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and \n     effective innovative therapies to treat unmet medical needs \n     for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n       (E) For these reasons, the statutory authority in effect on \n     the day before the date of enactment of this Act governing \n     expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening \n     diseases or conditions should be amended in order to enhance \n     the authority of the FDA to consider appropriate scientific \n     data, methods, and tools, and to expedite development and \n     access to novel treatments for patients with a broad range of \n     serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Food and Drug Administration should apply the accelerated \n     approval and fast track provisions set forth in section 506 \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356), \n     as amended by this section, to help expedite the development \n     and availability to patients of treatments for serious or \n     life-threatening diseases or conditions while maintaining \n     safety and effectiveness standards for such treatments.\n       (b) Expedited Approval of Drugs for Serious or Life-\n     Threatening Diseases or Conditions.--Section 506 (21 U.S.C. \n     356) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 506. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-\n                   THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.\n\n       ``(a) Designation of Drug as Fast Track Product.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, at the request of \n     the sponsor of a new drug, facilitate the development and \n     expedite the review of such drug if it is intended, whether \n     alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the \n     treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or \n     condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet \n     medical needs for such a disease or condition. (In this \n     section, such a drug is referred to as a `fast track \n     product'.)\n       ``(2) Request for designation.--The sponsor of a new drug \n     may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast \n     track product. A request for the designation may be made \n     concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an \n     application for the investigation of the drug under section \n     505(i) or section 351(a)(3) of the Public Health Service Act.\n       ``(3) Designation.--Within 60 calendar days after the \n     receipt of a request under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall \n     determine whether the drug that is the subject of the request \n     meets the criteria described in paragraph (1).

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Successive Presidents of the United States have \n     determined that the pursuit of nuclear weapons capabilities \n     by the Government of Iran presents a danger to the United \n     States, its friends and allies, and to global security.\n       (2) Successive Congresses have recognized the threat that \n     the Government of Iran and its policies present to the United \n     States, its friends and allies, and to global security, and \n     responded with successive bipartisan legislative initiatives, \n     including most recently the enactment of the Comprehensive \n     Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 \n     (22 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) on July 1, 2010.\n       (3) If the Government of Iran achieves a nuclear weapons \n     capability, it would pose a threat to the United States and \n     allies and friends of the United States, particularly Israel, \n     destabilize the Middle East, increase the threat of nuclear \n     terrorism, and significantly undermine global \n     nonproliferation efforts.\n       (4) The United States and its allies in the international \n     community recognize the threat posed by the pursuit of \n     nuclear weapons capabilities by the Government of Iran and \n     have imposed significant sanctions against the Government of \n     Iran, including through the enactment of the Comprehensive \n     Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 in \n     the United States and the adoption of a series of successive, \n     increasingly stringent United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions. While such efforts, together with others, have \n     served to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program, \n     they have not yet deterred Iran from its nuclear ambitions, \n     and international efforts to do so must be intensified.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 14 of the Iran Sanctions Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104 172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note).\n       (2) Credible information.--The term ``credible \n     information'' has the meaning given that term in section 14 \n     of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended by section 205 \n     of this Act.\n       (3) Knowingly.--The term ``knowingly'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 14 of the Iran Sanctions Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104 172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note).\n       (4) United states person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' has the meaning given that term in section 101 of \n     the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and \n     Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8511).\n\n  TITLE I--EXPANSION OF MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME WITH RESPECT TO \n                                  IRAN\n\n     SEC. 101. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO \n                   DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAPABILITIES BY \n                   IRAN.\n\n       It shall be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to prevent the Government of Iran from--\n       (A) acquiring or developing nuclear weapons;\n       (B) developing its advanced conventional weapons and \n     ballistic missile capabilities; and\n       (C) continuing its support for terrorist organizations and \n     other activities aimed at undermining and destabilizing its \n     neighbors and other countries; and\n       (2) to fully implement all multilateral and bilateral \n     sanctions against Iran, as part of larger multilateral and \n     bilateral diplomatic efforts, in order to compel the \n     Government of Iran--\n       (A) to abandon efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons \n     capability;\n       (B) to abandon and dismantle its ballistic missile and \n     unconventional weapons programs; and\n       (C) to cease all support for terrorist organizations and \n     other terrorist activities aimed at undermining and \n     destabilizing its neighbors and other countries.\n\n     SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EXPANSION OF MULTILATERAL \n                   SANCTIONS REGIME AND IMPLEMENTATION OF \n                   SANCTIONS LAWS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the goal of compelling \n     Iran to abandon efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons \n     capability and other threatening activities can be \n     effectively achieved through--\n       (1) the prompt expansion, vigorous implementation, and \n     intensification of enforcement of the current multilateral \n     sanctions regime with respect to Iran; and\n       (2) full and vigorous implementation of all sanctions \n     enacted into law, including sanctions imposed or expanded by \n     this Act or amendments made by this Act.\n\n     SEC. 103. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO EXPAND MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS \n                   REGIME.\n\n       (a) Multilateral Negotiations.--In order to further the \n     policy set forth in section 101, Congress urges the President \n     to intensify diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate \n     international fora such as the United Nations and bilaterally \n     with allies of the United States, to expand the multilateral \n     sanctions regime with respect to Iran, including--\n       (1) expanding the United Nations Security Council sanctions \n     regime to include--\n       (A) a prohibition on the issuance of visas to any official \n     of the Government of Iran who is involved in--\n       (i) human rights violations in or outside of Iran;\n       (ii) the development of a nuclear weapons program and a \n     ballistic missile capability in Iran; or\n       (iii) support by the Government of Iran for terrorist \n     organizations, including Hamas and Hezbollah; and\n       (B) a requirement that each member country of the United \n     Nations prohibit the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines \n     from landing at seaports, and cargo flights of Iran Air from \n     landing at airports, in that country because of the role of \n     those organizations in proliferation and illegal arms sales;\n       (2) expanding the range of sanctions imposed with respect \n     to Iran by allies of the United States;\n       (3) expanding efforts to limit the development of petroleum \n     resources and the importation of refined petroleum products \n     by Iran;\n       (4) developing additional initiatives to--\n       (A) increase the production of crude oil in countries other \n     than Iran; and\n       (B) assist countries that purchase or otherwise obtain \n     crude oil or petroleum products from Iran to reduce their \n     dependence on crude oil and petroleum products from Iran; and\n       (5) eliminating the revenue generated by the Government of \n     Iran from the sale of petrochemical products produced in Iran \n     to other countries.\n       (b) Reports to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days \n     thereafter, the President shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report on the extent to which \n     diplomatic efforts described in subsection (a) have been \n     successful that includes--\n       (1) an identification of the countries that have agreed to \n     impose additional sanctions or take other measures to further \n     the policy set forth in section 101 and a description of \n     those measures;\n       (2) an identification of the countries that have not agreed \n     to impose such sanctions or measures;\n       (3) recommendations for additional measures that the United \n     States could take to further the policy set forth in section \n     101; and\n       (4) a description of any decision by the World Trade \n     Organization with respect to whether the imposition by any \n     country of any sanction with respect to Iran is inconsistent \n     with the obligations of that country as a member of the World \n     Trade Organization or under the General Agreement on Tariffs \n     and Trade, done at Geneva October 30, 1947.\n\n     SEC. 104.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Iran continues to violate \n     systematically the basic human rights of citizens of Iran, \n     including by cutting off their access to information and \n     technology, suppressing their freedom of expression, and \n     punishing severely, and sometimes brutally, their attempts to \n     exercise political rights.\n       (2) In a March 20, 2012, speech celebrating Nowruz, the \n     Iranian New Year, President Barack Obama described censorship \n     of the Internet and monitoring of computers and\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\n     cell phones by the Government of Iran as depriving the people \n     of Iran of ``the information they want [and] stopping the \n     free flow of information and ideas into the country''. The \n     President concluded that ``in recent weeks, Internet \n     restrictions have become so severe that Iranians cannot \n     communicate freely with their loved ones within Iran, or \n     beyond its borders, [so that] an electronic curtain has \n     fallen around Iran.''.\n       (3) At a time when growing numbers of Iranians turn to the \n     Internet as a source for news and political debate, the \n     response of the Government of Iran has combined increasingly \n     pervasive jamming and filtering of the Internet, blocking of \n     email, social networking and other websites, and interception \n     of Internet, telephonic, and mail communications.\n       (4) The March 2012 Report of the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council Special Rapporteur on Iran details the \n     Government of Iran's widespread human rights abuses and \n     censorship, its chronic disregard of due process, and its \n     equally chronic harassment, abuse, and intimidation of the \n     people of Iran.\n       (5) There has been no independent investigation into the \n     months of violence that followed Iran's fraudulent 2009 \n     presidential election, violence that included the beatings of \n     scores of Tehran University students by security forces using \n     weapons, such as chains, metal rods, and electrified batons, \n     and the subsequent imprisonment of many students, some of \n     whom died in captivity.\n       (6) The Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with \n     human rights investigations by the Special Rapporteur, and \n     its failure to cooperate in those and similar investigations \n     has been criticized in reports of the United Nations \n     Secretary-General, General Assembly, and Human Rights \n     Council, even as human rights abuses continue.\n\n     SEC. 402. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Iran, especially Iran's Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps, continues to engage in serious, systematic, and \n     ongoing violations of human rights and the rise in the level \n     of such violations after the 2009 presidential elections has \n     not abated;\n       (2) the Government of Iran is engaging in a systematic \n     campaign to prevent news, entertainment, and opinions from \n     reaching media that are not subject to government control and \n     to eliminate any free Internet or other electronic media \n     discussion among the people of Iran; and\n       (3) the Government of Iran has refused to cooperate with \n     international organizations, including the United Nations, \n     seeking to investigate or to alleviate those conditions.\n       On page 58, line 7, strike ``401'' and insert ``403''.\n       On page 59, line 12, insert ``, any entity organized under \n     the laws of Iran or otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of \n     the Government of Iran, or any national of Iran, for use in \n     or with respect to Iran'' after ``Iran''.\n       On page 59, line 13, insert ``(including services relating \n     to hardware, software, and specialized information, and \n     professional consulting, engineering, and support services)'' \n     after ``services''.\n       On page 60, line 6, insert ``(or by any other person on \n     behalf of the Government of Iran or any of such agencies or \n     instrumentalities)'' after ``instrumentalities''.\n       On page 63, line 1, strike ``402'' and insert ``404''.\n       On page 63, strike line 19 and all that follows through \n     page 64, line 12, and insert the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of the Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and \n     Human Rights Act of 2012, the President shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a list of persons that \n     the President determines have, on or after June 12, 2009, \n     engaged in censorship or other activities that--\n       ``(A) prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom \n     of expression or assembly by citizens of Iran; or\n       ``(B) limit access to print or broadcast media, including \n     the facilitation or support of intentional frequency \n     manipulation by the Government of Iran that would jam or \n     restrict an international signal or the failure to prohibit \n     intentional frequency manipulation by the Government of Iran \n     that would jam or restrict an international signal by \n     satellite service providers that provide satellite services \n     to the Government of Iran or an entity owned or controlled by \n     the Government of Iran.\n       On page 64, line 13, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 64, line 21, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(3)''.\n       Beginning on page 72, strike line 7 and all that follows \n     through page 78, line 6, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 503.

Res. 468\n\n       Whereas a stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, \n     is an acute neurologic injury that occurs when the blood \n     supply to a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in the \n     artery or a burst of the artery;\n       Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause \n     permanent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly \n     diagnosed and treated;\n       Whereas stroke occurs in approximately 1 out of every 4,000 \n     live births, and the risk of stroke from birth through age 18 \n     is nearly 11 out of every 100,000 children per year;\n       Whereas an individual can have a stroke before birth;\n       Whereas stroke is among the top 10 causes of death for \n     children in the United States;\n       Whereas between 20 percent and 40 percent of children who \n     suffer a stroke die as a result;\n       Whereas stroke recurs in 20 percent of children who have \n     experienced a stroke;\n       Whereas the death rate for children who experience a stroke \n     before the age of 1 year is the highest out of all age \n     groups;\n       Whereas the average time from onset of symptoms to \n     diagnosis of stroke is 24 hours, putting many affected \n     children outside the window of 3 hours for the most \n     successful treatment;\n       Whereas between 50 and 85 percent of infants and children \n     who have a pediatric stroke will have serious, permanent \n     neurological disabilities, including paralysis, seizures, \n     speech and vision problems, and attention, learning, and \n     behavioral difficulties;\n       Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical \n     therapy and surgeries;\n       Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments \n     resulting from strokes that occur during childhood and young \n     adulthood have a considerable impact on children, families, \n     and society;\n       Whereas very little is known about the cause, treatment, \n     and prevention of pediatric stroke;\n       Whereas medical research is the only means by which the \n     citizens of the United States can identify and develop \n     effective treatment and prevention strategies for pediatric \n     stroke; and\n       Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric stroke \n     greatly improves the chances that the affected child will \n     recover and not experience a recurrence: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges May as ``National Pediatric Stroke \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to support the \n     efforts, programs, services, and advocacy of organizations \n     that work to enhance public awareness of childhood stroke;\n       (3) supports the work of the National Institutes of Health \n     in pursuit of medical progress on the matter of pediatric \n     stroke; and\n       (4) urges continued coordination and cooperation between \n     government, researchers, families, and the public to improve \n     treatments and prognoses for children who suffer strokes.\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/21/senate-section/article/S3386-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3386-S3388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 469, submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 469) honoring the entrepreneurial \n     spirit of small business concerns in the United States during \n     National Small Business Week, which begins on May 20, 2012.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We have submitted a resolution, because it is Small \nBusiness Week, on behalf of myself and Senator Snowe, Senator Pryor, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Enzi, Senator Kerry, Senator Brown, Senator \nCantwell, Senator Ayotte, Senator Risch, Senator Cardin, and Senator \nHagan, a very good representation of our Small Business Committee and \nothers that submitted a resolution this week, again, as we have done \nevery year since 1953. We have done so every year since 1953 to \nrecognize this week, or 1 week in the year, as Small Business Week. So \nthat is what our resolution, which was submitted earlier today, does.\n  I hope Leaders McConnell and Reid will take up this resolution and \npass it so we can honor the 28 million small businesses that exist \ntoday in America. We have been doing everything we can, and I am very \nproud, as the chairman of the Small Business Committee, that we have \nworked in a bipartisan fashion for the most part trying to give our \nbusinesses, first of all, the recognition that 9 out of 10 new jobs \ncreated were created by a small number, a very small number, of small \nbusinesses that are fast growing. They are the new job creators. These \nare the businesses that are going to be putting this recession behind \nus. These are the businesses that are innovating and adapting and \nchanging and being more strategic and smarter, looking for those \nopportunities in all areas and in all geographic parts of our Nation.\n  Over the past few months my committee has held three very special \nroundtables to explore strategies, tools, and methods to strengthen \nwhat I like to call the ecosystem of entrepreneurship. Much like a rain \nforest or desert or much like the ocean itself, that is an environment \nwhere many creatures or organisms have to live and interact. The same \nis true of our financial ecosystem, the political ecosystem. Society \nitself is an ecosystem where small businesses have to function.\n  In order for them to be healthy, there have to be the right \nnutrients, if you will, present. So we have explored in our committee \nwhat--we know the United States does this well. We do it better than \nany country on Earth. That is one of the great strengths of America; we \nfoster that entrepreneurship, free but fair markets, well regulated, \nnot too lightly, not too heavily. Sometimes we go a little overboard \nand we need to pull back. Sometimes we do not regulate enough and we \nneed to step up. But that is what we have been exploring.\n  In fact, we have broken our roundtables into domains: Do our small \nbusinesses have enough access to capital? Do our small businesses truly \nhave access to grow global markets? What did we learn this year? We \nlearned that less than 12 percent of all small businesses in America \nexport. With the market growing overseas and only the small percentage \nof the world market being now in the United States--we were at one time \nthe biggest market, when China was closed, when communism was reigning \nin the Soviet Union, and the Arab world was in darkness. I mean the \nmarket was in the United States.\n  But that is no longer the case, as these countries and areas have \nemerged and created markets and opportunities of their own.\n  So one thing we learned is that the ecosystem needs to be stronger by \nhelping small businesses to export. They do not have the back office or \nthe expertise of 10 accountants and a Chinese specialist and a South \nAmerican specialist. But we can, by being smart, help. Through the \nCommerce Department, the Small Business Administration, or maybe even \nthrough some of our research and development arms of some of our \ndepartments, we can be the back office for small businesses.\n  We are excited about what is happening there. So access to capital, \naccess to global markets, access to counseling, mentoring, technical \nassistance and education. I have had so many small businesses come \nbefore our committee and say: You know, Senator, getting the loan from \nthe bank was the first step. But if so-and-so had not shown up in my \noffice from the Score Chapter or if I could not have reached out to my \nlocal university or my small business center there, I would never have \nbeen able to make it because they told me what to do to save me from \nmaking a fatal mistake and got me on my way or helped me to rethink my \nmarket during the recession.\n  How one lady put it before our committee, they helped her remarket \nher business so now it is growing faster than ever. I think also access \nto strategic partnerships is important. No man is an island. We do not \naccomplish anything by ourselves in the world. That is true of \nindividuals, that is true of small businesses. So we asked ourselves: \nWho are the partners, strategic partners for small businesses? Cities \nare doing some creative things.\n  Madam President, you were a county executive. You know the things you \ndid as a county executive. Your reputation is well known in that \nregard.\n  States can be strategic partners to their small businesses. We \nexplored those opportunities. Access to government contracting--you \nknow, the Federal Government, state governments, and local governments \nare some of the biggest spenders and biggest businesses--if they were \nbusinesses, which they are not; there are clear differences--but if we \nwere a business, the Federal Government would be the largest business \nin the world. It buys more goods and services than others. We do not \nhave to do all of that just with the big businesses such as IBM, GE, \nExxonMobil. We can contract with small businesses. It takes a little \nmore time, takes a little more energy, takes a little bit different \napproach, but we most certainly can buy some of the things we need from \nthe small business right down the street.\n  So we are shaping policies to do that. Senator Cardin from Maryland \nhas been particularly aggressive when it comes to contracting with \nminority and women-owned businesses, which make up a significant and \ngrowing area. It is very exiting as more women enter not just the \nworkforce but decide they want their flexibility. They want to set \ntheir own hours. They want to be their own bosses. They want to \nestablish businesses that allow them to also raise children at home, to \nbe there when their kids need them. So they find that small businesses \noperating out of their homes are the answer to that dilemma. We want to \ngive them access to government contracting when, of course, they are \ncapable and provide the right price.\n  One of the big areas that we looked at is access to human capital. I \nthink you probably heard, Madam President, many of our businesses \nsaying: Why is it that we are bringing in some of the smartest people \nin the world, educating them at our universities, to where they are \ngetting master's degrees and Ph.D.s in engineering, math, and science, \nand then we send them back to the country they came from so they can \ncreate businesses to compete against us? Why don't we extend visa \nprivileges to these master's and Ph.D. candidates?\n  That is a good question, and we have bills to answer that. We also \nwant to develop a skilled workforce in America. Access to human capital \nis what small businesses need to grow and to expand.\n  Finally, we need access to flexible regulation and smart tax policy. \nWe are never going to live in a world where we do not pay taxes. It is \njust the nature of what we have to do to keep our government running \nand operating, with a government that serves the people--by the people, \nfor the people.\n  But our taxes should not be too heavy, too burdensome, and our \nregulatory regime should not be either too light or too onerous. It \nshould be just right. But it is hard to get that just-right approach. \nWe are working at it every day. Senator Snowe has been working on \nregulatory reform. Senator Warner has been working very hard on \nregulatory reform--and other Members of this body.\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\n  The bottom line is that this is Small Business Week. We want to honor \nthe small businesses that are helping us put this recession in the \nrearview mirror. I want to ask the leadership to pass this resolution--\na very straightforward, noncontroversial resolution by both Democrats \nand Republicans, recognizing this is Small Business Week.\n  I also wanted to bring to the attention of the body the conclusion, \nbasically, of the three roundtables we have held and thank the Members \nwho attended. We had good attendance, and we gleaned some excellent \nideas about the brackets I have outlined today, and have been in the \nprocess of filing over the last week, and throughout this week, \nindividual bills that reflect what we have learned in these \nroundtables. We have taken those ideas and turned them into \nlegislation.\n  I am happy to say there is not going to be a big pricetag on this \nlegislation. It is not just throwing money at the problem, but we do \nneed additional resources. It is sharpening things, reforming some of \nour strategies, laws, rules, and regulations on the books, and \nencouraging, by granting some competitive grants, some of these \nstrategic partnerships with counties, cities, and States. I look \nforward to seeing how this body responds to some of the new pieces of \nlegislation we put out. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nthrough this week and the month of May, through the summer, and into \nthe election, to keep focused on the No. 1 issue on the minds of the \nAmerican people, which is jobs, economic hope, and economic opportunity \nfor themselves and their families. Tom Friedman has been saying all \nover the world that when kids graduate from college, it is not a job \nthey are looking for. They may not be able to find the job they are \nlooking for. They need to create the job they want. They need to build \na business, build a better mousetrap, think about a different way of \ndelivering a product or a service or think about a business that is \nselling to a domestic market and taking it global. With technology and \nopportunities, many young people are doing just that.\n  In conclusion, I had the wonderful opportunity on Friday to be \ninvolved and took the opportunity Saturday morning to stop in at the \nCambridge Innovation Center, the granddaddy of all small business \nincubators. It is across the street from MIT, Microsoft, and Google. \nThere were some young and exciting college students in the building. \nYou could either rent a cubicle that looked like a kindergarten with \nyour name on it to get in the building or you could rent a space such \nas a bullpen where you could work or rent your own cubicle or private \noffice; and thousands, literally, of young people were moving into that \nbuilding--actually people of all ages, even retired executives who \ndecided, I have always wanted to try out my idea, so let's see if I can \nget my business started. Even on a Saturday--and it was very quiet--I \ncould feel the energy in that building, although it was virtually \nempty.\n  I have walked through incubators in New Orleans, and I hope the \noccupant of the chair did, and helped to create them in Delaware. That \nis what it is going to take, a strategic partnership between government \nand the private sector, letting the private sector do what they do \nbest, but letting government do what it does best. That was a perfect \nexample of what I saw in terms of taking research dollars that are \nspent at MIT, moving them out to the universities, and then on to these \nideas, where they are literally being tested and commercialized to get \nout into the market to create wealth and opportunity for the United \nStates and the world.\n  I am happy to be chair of the Small Business Committee. For small \nbusiness and economic growth, it is National Small Business Week. I \nthank all the groups helping us to celebrate this week and, most \nimportant, I thank the entrepreneurs who literally risk everything to \ncreate their dreams and bring economic prosperity not just to \nthemselves and their family business but to a Nation that relies on \nthem every day. We want to make that burden lighter. I want to help \nthem in every way we can in our committee in Washington and throughout \nour States, counties, and cities, and be the partner they can rely on \nto get the job done.\n  Madam President, I don't see anyone else on the floor. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt our resolution. I thank all of us who will be \nspeaking today and this week on Small Business Week.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, it is my understanding we are \nready to act on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 469) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I now ask that we act on the \npreamble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the preamble.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 469\n\n       Whereas the approximately 27,500,000 small business \n     concerns in the United States are the driving force behind \n     the Nation's economy, creating 2 out of every 3 new jobs and \n     generating more than 50 percent of the Nation's non-farm \n     gross domestic product;\n       Whereas small businesses are the driving force behind the \n     economic recovery of the United States;\n       Whereas small businesses represent 99.7 percent of employer \n     firms in the United States;\n       Whereas small business concerns are the Nation's \n     innovators, serving to advance technology and productivity;\n       Whereas small business concerns represent 97.5 percent of \n     all exporters and produce 31 percent of exported goods;\n       Whereas Congress established the Small Business \n     Administration in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect \n     the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve \n     free and competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total Federal Government purchases, \n     contracts, and subcontracts for property and services are \n     placed with small business concerns, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total sales of government property are made \n     to such small business concerns, and to maintain and \n     strengthen the overall economy of the United States;\n       Whereas every year since 1963, the President has designated \n     a ``National Small Business Week'' to recognize the \n     contributions of small businesses to the economic well-being \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas in 2012, National Small Business Week will honor \n     the estimated 27,200,000 small businesses in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small \n     business concerns by providing access to critical lending \n     opportunities, protecting small business concerns from \n     excessive Federal regulatory enforcement, helping to ensure \n     full and open competition for government contracts, and \n     improving the economic environment in which small business \n     concerns compete;\n       Whereas for more than 50 years, the Small Business \n     Administration has helped millions of entrepreneurs achieve \n     the American dream of owning a small business, and has played \n     a key role in fostering economic growth; and\n       Whereas the President has designated the week beginning May \n     20, 2012, as ``National Small Business Week'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the entrepreneurial spirit of small business \n     concerns in the United States during National Small Business \n     Week, which begins on May 20, 2012;\n       (2) applauds the efforts and achievements of the owners and \n     employees of small business concerns, whose hard work and \n     commitment to excellence have made such small business \n     concerns a key part of the economic vitality of the United \n     States;\n       (3) recognizes the work of the Small Business \n     Administration and its resource partners in providing \n     assistance to entrepreneurs and small business concerns; and\n       (4) recognizes the importance of ensuring that--\n       (A) guaranteed loans, including microloans and microloan \n     technical assistance, for start-up and growing small business \n     concerns, and venture capital, are made available to all \n     qualified small business concerns;\n       (B) the management assistance programs delivered by \n     resource partners on behalf of the Small Business \n     Administration, such as Small Business Development Centers, \n     Women's Business Centers, and the Service Corps of Retired \n     Executives, are provided with the Federal resources necessary \n     to provide invaluable counseling services to entrepreneurs in \n     the United States;\n       (C) the Small Business Administration continues to provide \n     timely and efficient disaster assistance so that small \n     businesses in areas struck by natural or manmade disasters \n     can quickly return to business to keep local economies alive \n     in the aftermath of such disasters;\n       (D) affordable broadband Internet access is available to \n     all people in the United States, particularly people in rural \n     and underserved communities, so that small businesses can use \n     the Internet to make their operations more globally \n     competitive while boosting local economies;\n       (E) regulatory relief is provided to small businesses \n     through the reduction of duplicative or unnecessary \n     regulatory requirements that increase costs for small \n     businesses; and\n       (F) leveling the playing field for contracting \n     opportunities remains a primary\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\n     focus, so that small businesses, particularly minority-owned \n     small businesses, can compete for and win more of the \n     $400,000,000,000 in contracts that the Federal Government \n     enters into each year for goods and services.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelated to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
