Mr. President, today, I am pleased the Senate will pass the \naviation jobs conference report. This measure is the first long-term \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration in almost 5 \nyears. The FAA has worked under 23 short-term extensions since 2007. In \nfact, the FAA was shut down last year. That is right, workers were \nfurloughed and construction at airports terminated.\n  The 4-year compromise we will pass this evening doesn't give everyone \neverything they want, but that is the way legislation is. It will, \nhowever, finally give the FAA the ability it needs to properly maintain \na world-class air travel system.\n  The aviation jobs bill will also create thousands of jobs--about \n300,000--and it will protect airline workers and improve safety for \ntravelers. This legislation will create badly needed jobs and it will \ngive the FAA the ability to finally upgrade the country's air traffic \ncontrol system.\n  Today, America relies on World War II era technology to track \naircraft and to guide them to safe landings. An upgrade to modern \nsatellite technology is long overdue. The aviation jobs bill will \nfinally make that critical investment possible. It will invest more \nthan $24 billion in airports and runways across the Nation and on \nmodern air traffic control equipment.\n  I am very happy that Democrats and Republicans were finally able to \nreach this compromise. I wish the spirit of compromise would also \nextend to ongoing conference committee negotiations on a year-long \npayroll tax cut. I was dismayed to read this morning that rank-and-file \nRepublicans in both Chambers are on the fence over whether we should \nextend this break for working families. More than 160 million Americans \nwill benefit, with an average family savings this year of $1,000. That \nis taxes they won't have to pay.\n  Republicans are questioning whether Americans need that extra cash, \nand they are once again playing politics and putting our economy at \nrisk at a crucial time when we need to work out a compromise. Democrats \nhave offered\n\n[[Page S330]]\n\nto meet them halfway--even more than halfway--but Republicans will not \ntake yes for an answer. In exchange for extending this middle-class tax \nbreak, Republicans are insisting, among other things, that we pass an \nunrelated ideological piece of legislation that will make our water \nless safe to drink. This would allow mercury and other carcinogens to \nbe put in our water supply.\n  That is a pretty stark compromise: We will give you a payroll tax cut \nfor 160 million Americans if you will let us continue to put things \nsuch as arsenic and mercury in the water of the American people. That \nis not a very good deal.\n  Not only that but they are refusing to close tax loopholes, such as \ngiveaways to oil companies making record profits. Instead, they insist \non more handouts to millionaires and billionaires before they will do \nanything that will benefit the middle class.\n  The American people have spoken and spoken clearly. Working families \nneed this money. They need this thousand dollars to put food on the \ntable and gas in the car. And they won't tolerate Republicans holding \ntheir money hostage to extort a political payback.\n  They did this last December. In fact, I thought Republicans got the \nmessage in December when they took a beating for opposing this tax cut. \nI hope they won't pick this losing fight a second time. But time is \nrunning. If they do choose to fight, as we try to put more money back \nin the pockets of 160 million working Americans, the outcome will \neventually be the same. Democrats will not give in when it comes to \nprotecting the middle class. That is why we will prepare a fallback \nplan in case Republicans refuse to cooperate. Our legislation will \nprevent a tax hike on middle-class families, extend unemployment \nbenefits, protect seniors on Medicare from losing their doctors, and \nextend expiring tax provisions. And it will be free of unrelated \nideological legislation designed to please the radical right.\n  Stopping a $1,000 tax increase on virtually every American family is \ntoo important to be bogged down with sweeteners for the tea party. \nSenate Democrats will be prepared to act with or without Republican \ncooperation. Republicans must make a choice. They can force a thousand \ndollar tax increase on American families to strengthen the tea party or \nthey can compromise to strengthen the middle class. The choice is \ntheirs.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S330-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nan issue of paramount importance to our country--the issue of religious \nfreedom. Our great Nation was founded on religious freedom. This \nliberty is at the very core of our government. It has been a \nsignificant part of our heritage since this land was first settled, and \nit is a freedom that sets us apart from many countries around the \nglobe.\n  The Framers of our Constitution rightfully recognized an individual's \nreligious liberty and conscience is above any regulation, any \nlegislation. One of the chief authors of that guiding document, James \nMadison, declared:\n\n       Conscience is the most sacred of all property.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man \n     than that which protects the rights of conscience against the \n     enterprises of the civil authority.\n\n  These fundamental values are a part of the fabric of this great \nNation. It is no coincidence it is the first freedom in the Bill of \nRights. It is a core value. It is an inalienable right. So that means, \nas public servants, it is our utmost duty to protect this American \nfreedom.\n  When I was sworn in as a Senator, I--as my colleagues did--took an \noath to uphold the Constitution. We all believe strongly in that oath. \nI take seriously my commitment to uphold the values and the freedoms \nour forefathers fought to establish and that generations of heroes have \ndied defending.\n  That is why today I am devastated to see this very freedom, the heart \nof our Constitution, being so completely ignored. The President has \ntaken an unprecedented step in the wrong direction, grossly misusing \nauthority to implement the new health care law. This administration has \nrefused to exempt religious institutions that serve the public good \nfrom mandates of the law that go against their strong beliefs and their \nvalues, and the values of our Nation.\n  Last August, in an interim final rule, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services announced what free preventive services all new health \ninsurance plans would be required to provide under the law, and that \nthose services must include contraceptives and controversial drugs, \nsuch as the so-called morning-after pill.\n  With that mandate, the agency included a supposed religious exemption \nbut, upon reading that, it was clear that was simply unacceptable. It \nis so narrow that the vast majority of religious hospitals and \nuniversities, businesses, social services, and charities are still, \nvery clearly, required by law to comply with the mandate.\n  Many of these organizations have strong faith-based missions and \ndeeply held convictions. Yet they don't fall under the exemption. In \nother words, their government is compelling Americans to act against \ntheir constitutionally protected moral and religious convictions.\n  Since that announcement, hundreds of religious organizations have \nraised their voices, and I have heard from countless Nebraskans. I held \na roundtable back in Nebraska where this was the topic of discussion.\n  Twenty-six of my colleagues joined Senator Hatch and me in sending a \nletter to the administration condemning this sweeping mandate. We asked \nthem to redraft the regulation so it is consistent with longstanding \nconstitutional principles.\n  Despite these strong efforts, just recently we learned that our \npassionate concerns had been dismissed. Very disappointingly, the \nadministration has announced that they will move forward with the \nAugust interim rule. Under the guise of compromise, they announced that \nreligious organizations would have an additional year before the \nmandate was enforced; in other words, after election day.\n  The head of the Diocese of Lincoln, a man I have great admiration \nfor, Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz, called the administration's extension an \n``act of mockery.''\n  Americans are not fooled by this nonsensical extension. The issue is \nnot that religious groups have time to comply. That is not the issue. \nIt is that they are being forced to provide coverage that goes against \ntheir conscience, their religious beliefs, their moral beliefs.\n  Bishop Bruskewitz went on to warn ``our American religious liberty is \nin grave jeopardy.''\n  The bottom line is that by issuing this decision, this administration \nhas ignored the most sacred of all American freedoms.\n  Just a week before this announcement, the Supreme Court unanimously \naffirmed the core constitutional principle of religious liberty in its \nHosanna-Tabor decision. The court held that churches and other \nreligious groups must be free to choose their leaders without \ngovernment interference. Yet the administration has clearly come out on \nthe other side of our Constitution.\n  During the health care debate, we heard something vastly different. \nThe President repeatedly promised the opposite. He pledged that the new \nhealth\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\ncare law would not weaken long-held life and conscience protections. In \nhis public statements about the health overhaul, he vowed ``Federal \nconscience laws would remain in place.'' He even issued an Executive \norder where he stated that ``longstanding Federal laws to protect \nconscience will remain intact.''\n  Many of us--myself included--during the health care debate warned \nthat the Executive order was just window dressing to get votes and \nwould do nothing to protect life in matters of conscience.\n  While supporters of the bill echoed the President's promise, I spoke \non the Senate floor--once in November and again in March--warning \nAmericans that they should not be fooled by hollow promises, and I \nurged my pro-life colleagues to join me in opposing this dangerous \npolicy.\n  Two years after the law's passage, the truth behind the \nadministration's priorities has been revealed. The President has, \nregrettably, punted the implementation of this controversial mandate \nuntil after the election. So now many religious organizations are \nforced to face two options: act against their convictions or drop \nhealth care coverage altogether. This decision comes from an \nadministration that granted over 1,700 health plans with waivers from \nthe law's major provisions, many of those to unions. A total of 4 \nmillion people, including select businesses and unions, have benefited \nfrom the waiver process. The administration has gone out of its way to \nguide its friends around the onerous mandates of this flawed policy. \nYet this same administration is unwilling to protect a fundamental \nconstitutional freedom by simply crafting a reasonable exemption for \nreligious organizations.\n  Would Presidents Thomas Jefferson or James Madison have forced vast \nswaths of society to take action against their conscience? The answer \nis a resounding and obvious no. This political posturing is obvious, \nand it is appalling. This political maneuvering comes at a heavy cost \nfor many Americans; it is a breach of values and beliefs. It runs \ncounter to the very core of our identity as Americans.\n  Never before has the Federal Government required that individuals \nprovide a product that violates their conscience.\n  Many Americans are questioning what will come next. They recognize \nthat other strongly held beliefs could also be compromised.\n  I am not alone in being deeply troubled by this administration's \ncomplete disregard of the liberties in our Constitution. It is these \nliberties that make our country great.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act \nintroduced by my colleague Senator Blunt. This legislation would \nreverse the administration's massive overstep and ensure that all \nconscience rights are protected. I will do everything in my power to \npush this to a vote. We must act to right this wrong. We must ensure \nthat America's values are not compromised. We must protect religious \nliberty. We all took an oath to do so. I am confident that, with prayer \nand persistence, we can reverse this course.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S331-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S331-S332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BOILER MACT\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to discuss an \nimportant action this Congress can take to protect manufacturing jobs \nand strengthen our economy.\n  Specifically, I encourage Senate conferees on the payroll tax bill to \ninclude projobs bipartisan language--such as H.R. 2250 or S. 1392--that \nwould address the EPA's proposed rule on maximum achievable control \ntechnology standards for boilers, also known as boiler MACT.\n  Fixing boiler MACT is important because if the EPA gets it wrong, it \nwill cost tens of thousands of good-paying blue-collar manufacturing \njobs. These regulations will be one more unnecessary weight dragging \ndown our economy and making life harder for low- and middle-income \nfamilies.\n  Fixing boiler MACT is important also because Congress should provide \nclarity and certainty to the rulemaking process. The process has been \nplagued by complications, administrative stays, court orders, and \nnumerous other stops and starts.\n  For example, employers spent hundreds of millions working to comply \nwith the 2004 boiler MACT rules only to be told they must now spend \nbillions more. The boiler MACT legislation should be included in the \npayroll tax relief legislation which is intended to provide some help \nto our sluggish economy by allowing Americans to keep a little more of \nthe money they earn. By addressing boiler MACT on this bill, we can \nfurther protect jobs--especially manufacturing jobs--and prevent our \ncountry from having to absorb one more sudden regulatory punch in the \ngut.\n  Fixing boiler MACT is important because our economy is weak and \nfamilies are struggling. Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office predicted a weak and perilous economic situation for the \nnext couple years. We see continued high unemployment, including \nestimates that the unemployment rate will tick up to 8.9 percent this \nyear and 9.2 percent next year. We see projections of $1.2 trillion \ndeficits. On top of all this, we have learned that the GDP growth \nslowed to just 1.7 percent last year.\n  I hope these troubling projections are wrong, but given what we know, \nwe should be focused on encouraging job growth and opportunity. \nAmerican families are counting on us. We should not stifle businesses \nthat want to expand and create jobs. One way to help is to provide some \nregulatory certainty and to allow employers the time they need to \nadjust to new, burdensome regulations.\n  The boiler MACT fix would provide the EPA an additional 15 months to \nprepare appropriate, justified, and achievable regulations for \nindustrial boilers. Without this time, EPA will be forced to rush the \nrules out the door only a few weeks after they will receive hundreds of \nsubstantive comments and new data on boiler performance.\n  The boiler MACT fix would also give employers a little extra time to \ncomply with the rules once they are finalized. This is vital because it \nwill minimize job losses that would occur if employers had to rush to \nimplement the new rules. The rules are very expensive and spreading the \ncost out over a couple extra years will make it less likely that \nemployers will have to lay off employees.\n  In Arkansas alone, boiler MACT will cost over $230 million and put \n3,600 jobs at risk. These are real jobs and real people. I shake their \nhands and I hear their serious concerns when I visit communities such \nas Pine Bluff, AR, or Howard County, AR. In our State, the proposed \nboiler MACT rules will especially harm the employers with units that \nburn solid fuels such as biomass. The boiler MACT would help by stating \nthat materials such as renewable biomass that have been used for fuel \nfor decades should remain classified as fuel and not reclassified as \nsolid waste.\n  We should be encouraging the use of renewable biomass, not \ndiscouraging it. Sending biomass to a landfill makes absolutely no \nsense when we can use it to power our industries and create jobs. The \npotential harm to renewable, carbon-neutral biomass is very bad for \nArkansas. But it is not just our rural States with significant biomass \nthat will be harmed; boiler MACT will hit all States, large and small, \nrural and urban.\n  For example, in Pennsylvania it will cost over $751 million and put \nover 12,000 jobs at risk. In Montana it will cost $32 million and put \nover 500 jobs at risk. In Maryland it will cost over $195 million and \nput over 3,100 jobs at risk. In Rhode Island it will cost over $19 \nmillion and put hundreds of jobs at risk. In Wyoming it will cost over \n$155 million and put over 2,400 jobs at risk.\n  Some of the hardest hit States include North Carolina, Ohio, \nMichigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Virginia, \nIllinois, and Minnesota. Several States will see more than 12,000 jobs \nput at risk. In Arkansas, the expense and uncertainty created by these \nrules will force some employers to scale back. Other employers\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\nmay be able to keep existing jobs but decide that it does not make \nsense to hire new employees while they face these mounting regulatory \ncosts. Given these serious concerns, the boiler MACT fix will provide \nclarity and give businesses a reasonable timeframe to comply. The \nboiler MACT legislation passed the other body with bipartisan support \nfrom 275 Congressmen. In the Senate this legislation has the support of \na strong bipartisan majority.\n  Over the last four decades our country has cleaned our air by \nreducing emissions that cause serious threats--threats to human health \nand to the environment. I strongly support appropriate, science-based \nprotection for clean air, and we must continue to protect the \nenvironment.\n  The public will continue to support appropriate protections for clean \nair, especially if this Congress takes a reasonable approach and gives \nthe EPA the time it needs to develop rules that are achievable and that \ncan be implemented in a timeline that will protect important \nmanufacturing jobs throughout our country. For these reasons I urge the \nSenate conferees on the payroll tax bill to include the boiler MACT \nfix. I also ask my colleagues to let the conferees know how important \nthis issue is. Together, we can help create opportunities and protect \nthese important, high-paying manufacturing and other blue collar jobs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a new \nemployment report last week for the month of January with some good \nnews: more jobs created in the private sector than had been projected \nand unemployment dropped to 8.3 percent. President Obama has been \ntaking a victory lap and touted the jobs report as a sign that his \neconomic policies are working. But it reminds me of the two fleas on \nthe back of the chariot in Stephen Leacock's famous fable. They look \nbehind them and say: My, what a fine cloud of dust we've kicked up.\n  It could be in the 2\\1/2\\ years since the great recession technically \nended and the 3 years since the passage of the stimulus bill that the \nPresident promised would keep unemployment below 8 percent, that \nwhatever recovery we have had is not necessarily the result of the \nPresident's policies. Why has unemployment remained above 8 percent for \nthe last 35 months? Why are there more unemployed today than when \nPresident Obama took office? Is it more likely that some people are \nfinding work in spite of and not because of President Obama's policies?\n  Today I would like to speak about that for a few minutes and try to \nput these numbers into perspective. The obvious point, of course, is \nthat we still have a long way to go before anyone can claim that we \nhave an economic success story.\n  Let's start with the recovery itself. The fact is, this has been the \nweakest recovery since the Great Depression. Consider this comparison: \n31 months after the recession ended in June of 2009, payroll employment \nhas increased by only 1.5 percent. During the Reagan Presidency 31 \nmonths after the end of the 1981-1982 recession, payroll employment had \nincreased by 9.8 percent. So 1.5 under President Obama, 9.8 percent \ncomparable timeframe with President Reagan.\n  At a comparable point in time during the Reagan recovery, payroll \nemployment was 6.2 million jobs or 6.8 percent higher than the \nprerecession level. In contrast, today we have about 5 million fewer \njobs since peak employment of 2007--not more but fewer--and more than \n1.1 million jobs have been lost since President Obama took office.\n  How can that be? It takes a certain number of jobs just to keep up \nwith the new entrants into the labor market. In fact, economists \nbelieve we need on average about 130,000 to 150,000 jobs per month just \nto hold even. So even though we have created more jobs--and the \nPresident's supporters say we have been creating now more jobs for the \nlast 23 months. That is fine, but if it does not keep up with the \nnumber we need just to keep up with new entrants into the workforce; \nnamely, 130,000 to 150,000, we are not making progress. In fact, we are \nregressing. If this recovery we are currently experiencing had \nduplicated the path of recovery from the 1981-1982 recession, there \nwould be 14.9 million more payroll jobs than we have today--in other \nwords, almost 15 million more jobs. That is a better measure of the \nsuccess--or lack of it--in coming out of this recession.\n\n  Now, to make matters worse, much of the recent decline in the \nunemployment rate can be attributed to a decline in labor force \nparticipation--in other words, people who are still looking for work. \nLabor force participation dropped to 63.7 percent in January, meaning \nthat many have simply stopped looking for jobs. This is the lowest \nlabor force participation rate in nearly three decades. Labor force \nparticipation stood at 66 percent at the beginning of the recent \nrecession. If the rate had remained at the prerecession level, the \nunemployment rate today would be approximately 11.4 percent. In other \nwords, 3 percentage points more than it is today is accounted for by \nthe fact that that many people have simply stopped looking for work. \nAccording to many economists, this is a better measure of the true \nemployment situation in the country.\n  A commentator on one of the news shows that I heard yesterday gave \nthis analogy: If we heard that fewer elderly people in America were \nsick, at least initially we would think that was really good news. But \nif the reason there were fewer sick people is that more of them had \ndied, we wouldn't think that was a cause for celebration. And that is \nthe problem here--too many people have just decided it is not possible \nfor them to get a job and they are going to stop looking.\n  Finally, there is the underemployment and long-term unemployed \nsituation. The plight of the folks who have been unemployed for a long \nperiod of time or those who are underemployed--they have a job but \ncould be getting something that pays more--has really not changed. \nThese are the Americans who want good jobs. In the latest report, the \nnumber of those who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more has \nhardly changed at 5.52 million people, accounting for almost 43 percent \nof the unemployed population. Those are the folks who are really \nhurting. The underemployment rate, which includes part-time workers who \nwould like to have full-time work and those who want to work but have \ngiven up looking, has remained largely unchanged, dropping to 15.1 \npercent from 15.2 percent.\n  I say all of this not to pile on President Obama and certainly not to \ndenigrate the fact that we finally have a little bit of good news \ncoming out of the economic picture but, rather, to make the point that \nthe employment numbers from 1 month--last month--hardly tell the whole \nstory. We have to have better progrowth policies if we are really going \nto have a stronger economy, if we are going to create more jobs and, \nover the long term, improve the employment opportunities for all \nAmericans who want work.\n  It was very disappointing for the President to have rejected the \nKeystone Pipeline. That is a project which would have created as many \nas 343,000 private sector jobs, according to the Congressional Research \nService, and all of that without having cost the taxpayers a dime.\n  We also need to consider how the policies of the last 3 years, which \ninclude the exploding debt and the massive new taxes and regulations \nthat are contained in ObamaCare and the so-called financial reform \nbill, have put a drag on the economy. It has increased uncertainty for \njob creators, and it has actually weakened the economic recovery. If \nPresident Obama wants to continue any jobs momentum, I believe he ought \nto reconsider his position on the tax hikes coming at the end of this \nyear. They are automatic. If we don't do anything, taxes will go up on \neveryone next January 1st, the largest tax increase in the history of \nour country, over $3.5 trillion. Will businesses want to expand and \nhire new workers in the face of a tax increase that size over the next \n10 years? Will they want to create\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\njobs if they are faced with an avalanche of new regulations? Will they \nbe able to invest in growth if the government keeps crowding out \nprivate investment with massive borrowing and spending?\n  The bottom line is that there is a recipe for turning the economy \naround in a very strong way and providing the jobs people are going to \nneed in order to get the work they can do and need in order to support \ntheir families. What the President has done has impeded and slowed down \nthat growth. Of course, one can argue that he didn't create the \nproblem, he inherited the problem, but that his policies have made it \nworse, not better; that we would have a stronger recovery had we not \nwasted that money on the stimulus program and had we not passed some of \nthe highly regulatory and depressing legislation such as ObamaCare.\n  With the opportunity before us to support progrowth policies, I am \nconvinced the private sector of this country is strong enough to \nrebound. We are beginning to see that in these employment numbers. If \nwe work with businesses, understanding that they create the jobs, not \nthe government--all we can do is to provide the best foundation for job \ncreation--if we do that, then this eventually can be a strong economic \nrecovery, and then we really will have something to brag about. It is \nmy hope that in the remaining months of this year, before politics \ncompletely consumes Washington, DC, Republicans and Democrats, the \nHouse and the Senate, can work together with the President to create \nthat kind of climate in which all Americans who want to can find \neconomic opportunity and work.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 658, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     658), to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \n     appropriations for the Federal Aviation Administration for \n     fiscal years 2011 through 2014, to streamline programs, \n     create efficiencies, reduce waste, and improve aviation \n     safety and capacity, to provide stable funding for the \n     national aviation system, and for other purposes, having met, \n     have agreed that the House recede from its disagreement to \n     the amendment of the Senate and agree to the same with an \n     amendment and the Senate agree to the same. Signed by a \n     majority of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be up to 2\\1/2\\ hours of debate on the conference report \nequally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  The problem we face here is that most people are in the air coming in \nthis direction. Most will land around 5 o'clock. So Senator Hutchison \nand myself don't feel any particular pressure. We can talk for long \nperiods of time and talk about other issues.\n  Today we are considering the FAA conference report which has been the \nsubject of negotiations--I shudder when I say that--between the House \nand the Senate for much of the past year, and actually we have been \nworking on it for much longer than that. We have been through 23 \nextensions. We are now looking at the possibility of a bill that will, \nin fact, last for 4 years, which will be the best news that the airline \nindustry ever had, that the people who work for the airline industry \never had, that the people who work to improve the safety of the airline \npeople ever had, including those who are doing a new traffic control \nsystem. So I am very happy that, as we call it, the FAA Modernization \nReform Act of 2012 will extend the authorities through 2015. As the \nPresiding Officer is aware, we have done this for 2 months, 3 months--\ntime after time after time--and it makes it impossible to negotiate and \nit is terribly destabilizing for the aviation industry as well as the \nFederal Aviation Administration.\n  This agreement is going to provide a lot of stability to the FAA--\nthey will be happy about that--and it will make certain there is \nadequate funding to support the agency's mission.\n  The bill takes concrete steps to modernize our air traffic control \nsystem. I am excited beyond words to be able to say that sentence \nbecause it will take us into a new era that will bring much more \nefficiency, more planes will be able to take off and land and, in so \ndoing, do it much more safely, being watched from space rather than \nfrom radar, which is what we do now.\n  This bill is going to make the air transportation system safer than \never before and make certain that small communities have access to \ncritical air service. I will speak more about that.\n  It will also make sure that the U.S. aviation industry remains \ncompetitive and remains strong. We are that way in the world. We do \nlead in exports on aviation and the Federal aviation industry continues \nto be the gold standard for safety. That is not to say we have not had \nproblems, but we have been solving those problems.\n\n  This has been a long and sometimes arduous process. I think my \ncolleague Senator Hutchison would agree with that. Many compromises \nwere made to get us here. Compromises in the present atmosphere are not \neasy. Conversations are not easy. Compromises are very difficult. While \nno one got everything they wanted, the bill will permit us--I believe \nSenator Hutchison would agree--to achieve our shared goals.\n  The agreement will allow us to pass a comprehensive, again, 4-year \nFAA reauthorization. The legislation we have before us now will move \nour aviation system forward. It will not be in neutral. People who run \nthe system, the folks who take care of airplanes and who run the \ncompanies, will be absolutely thrilled if this bill passes, which I \nexpect it to do.\n  In this era of very scarce resources, we still have managed to \nproduce a bill that provides the FAA the money it needs to carry out \nits mission. Without going into too much detail, we had to make a \ncompromise on that. But, frankly, that was a compromise that was agreed \nto and, I believed, was reasonable in terms of the other way of looking \nat things. So it is stability.\n  The funding authorized for the Airport Improvement Program, which is \nvery important, and the facilities and equipment accounts, which are \njust gobbledygook to most people, will give much needed support to \naviation infrastructure projects and planning across our Nation. It is \na blueprint.\n  Over $3 billion a year is provided through the Airport Improvement \nProgram to provide airport grants that will make a real difference in \nthe Nation's airspace system and the people who use it every day. We \nwill create and we will sustain jobs in every State, and we will \ncontinue to make substantial investments in our Nation's airports. \nBased on Department of Transportation estimates, the Airport \nImprovement Program alone supports over 100,000 jobs annually. I will \nsay later on in these remarks that there are about 10 million people \nwho work because of something called aviation in this country--10 \nmillion people.\n  For communities in West Virginia, having up-to-date airports is \nabsolutely critical to our future. The investments we make through the \nAirport Improvement Program will help the country greatly--not just \nWest Virginia but the entire country.\n  With this bill, as I said, nearly $3 billion will also be provided \neach year for the facilities and equipment account which basically \nfunds the new air traffic control system. I have said this 10 times \nfrom this floor: Mongolia has that; we do not. They have globally \npositioned--very accurate reading--not\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\nonly for weather but for aircraft on the ground and also in the air, so \nthe spacing vertically and horizontally is extremely accurate and, \ntherefore, much safer and much more efficient and uses much less fuel.\n  This effort on the air traffic control system is embarrassing, it is \nso needed. We are working on radar right now. We are working on radar. \nThat is compared to a satellite-based aircraft surveillance system. I \nhave spent, frankly, much of the last decade working to make sure the \nFAA has the resources and the ability to implement NextGen, the so-\ncalled new air traffic control system, the modernized, digitalized air \ntraffic control system. It is so essential. It is so embarrassing we do \nnot have it as a nation. It is such a burden on the air traffic control \npeople themselves, trying to see through the fog, so to speak, of the \nworld of radar.\n  This bill will move forward key aspects of the NextGen effort and \nmake sure that modernization will proceed on schedule with clear \ntimelines and a lot of oversight and requirements.\n  We push for near-term modernization benefits by requiring that \nprecision navigation be implemented first--and this makes sense--in the \n35 largest airports in the country--that does make sense--by the year \n2015 and then in all airports by the year 2016. This will significantly \nimprove airspace capacity and, by the way, the environment.\n  The bill also establishes a chief NextGen officer--not a bureaucracy \nbut a person--to lead the modernization effort. It is very specific; it \nis a very calculated and precise instrument that has to be done \ncorrectly--and takes steps to improve coordination among relevant \nFederal agencies. One has to say that. It is sort of a boring \nstatement, but it is kind of a necessary one if it happens to be true, \nwhich in this case I believe it is.\n  While modernization will provide the greatest safety benefits, the \nbill also requires the FAA to move forward on other imperative safety \nmeasures. The bill mandates stricter oversight of airlines and their \ncompliance with airworthiness directives. It requires regular \ninspections of foreign repair stations--subject to controversy--and the \nimplementation of drug and alcohol programs at those facilities--a \nsubject, frankly, lacking in controversy.\n  Specific measures in the bill also focus on the safety of our air \nambulance operations--that is a lot of activity in our country--and \ntake steps to improve airport runway surveillance; that is, we have a \nproblem now with literally airplanes running into each other on the \ntarmac because of fog or because of poor coordination or whatever--the \nkind of things that a NextGen modernized system would tend to make much \nless prevalent.\n  This bill will make significant strides for the airline industry \nthrough modernization. They crave it. They need it. Commercial aviation \nhelps drive $1.3 trillion in U.S. economic activity and, as I said \nbefore, more than 10 million U.S. jobs. So I think those who would \nconsider not voting for this would have to at least start out on that \nrather alarming fact.\n  The aviation sector is critical to our place in the global \nmarketplace. It contributes $75 billion to our trade balance and \nrepresents roughly 6 percent of the gross domestic product of the \ncountry. It is huge.\n  We must make certain all Americans reap the benefits of our national \naviation system. To that end, this bill preserves and strengthens the \nEssential Air Service Program. I have to say that had been completely \neliminated by the House--completely eliminated. That is life or death \nfor West Virginia and for a lot of rural places. In general, almost all \nlarge States also have rural aspects, and they need this kind of help.\n  We provide vital access to the aviation system for small and rural \ncommunities. That gives access to the global marketplace. It means \npeople come. CEOs do not tend to want to drive to Montana or to West \nVirginia to look over possible sites for building plants. It is very \nimportant for economic development.\n\n  It is interesting--and I am sure Senator Hutchison would agree with \nme--that communities thrive, particularly smaller communities, on how \nwell their small airports are doing. They may have good runway space \nbut not a lot of enplanements because it is not a hugely populated \narea. But we put very strict confinements on that in the essential air \nservice. We disciplined it. We said there can be no new ones other than \nthe ones currently existing.\n  We put other restrictions on it to make it palatable to the other \nbody. We said, for example, communities that have per-passenger \nsubsidies over $1,000 are eliminated forthwith from the program. That \nmakes sense. That much money going for a couple of passengers is just \nridiculous. Communities that have fewer than 10 passengers per day--and \nthere are in my State some very strong communities that have that \nsituation. They just cannot work it out that they get people onto their \nairplanes or air service, and, as a result, obviously, the service \nbegins to disappear. There is no reason the essential air service \nshould allow any of that to proceed. So we say if they have fewer than \n10 passengers per day--if you are an airport of that sort--and are \nwithin 175 miles of a large or medium-sized hub airport, you are to be \neliminated immediately from this program. That is harsh for some. But \nit is what brought us a compromise for the majority of us--all of us.\n  The program also caps future eligibility, as I have indicated, to \nthose communities that are currently in this program.\n  Now, I am sure everyone has heard me say the essential air service is \nthe lifeblood for so many communities. I believe this bill strikes a \ncareful balance between the need to cut government spending, which this \ndoes, and preserving small community access to our national aviation \nsystem by making some of these prudent reforms.\n  It is important for me to take a moment to emphasize the consequences \nof not passing this bill. Aside from not achieving all the benefits \nthis bill provides, we will find ourselves in a nasty fight with the \nHouse when the current FAA extension runs out in less than 2 weeks.\n  This is not just a bill that is floating around. This is a bill that \nis on a timetable, and the extension--the 23rd extension--of this bill \nwe made runs out in several weeks. So, then, everything goes back to \nzero, and you remember we laid off a lot of people earlier.\n  The House has no patience left for short-term extensions--I cannot \ndisagree with that--and they have shown this past August they are \nperfectly willing to send over an extension with policy riders, policy \nriders which they full well know are totally impossible for this body \nto accept or for the majority of this body to accept.\n  They also have shown their resolve in all of this. Not too long ago \nthey shut down the FAA. It was not a question of what this is going to \ndo to people's lives. They just shut it down for the principle of \nsticking by their guns, and they furloughed 4,000 government employees \nand did not seem to care that hundreds of millions in aviation trust \nfund revenues were lost forever. If we do not pass the FAA conference \nreport, you can be sure the House will send over an FAA extension that \nis just as troublesome.\n  We have reached a compromise position under the magnificent watchful \neye of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. Again, nobody got everything they \nwanted, and there are some provisions that people have great difficulty \naccepting. I understand that. All of this has to be seen within the \ncontext of the greater bill, which is a huge piece of legislation, a \nmagnificent piece of legislation, and very much a job-creating piece of \nlegislation. But this is, in my judgment, a very good deal. It is a \nfair deal. If we do not pass it, I think we will all certainly regret \nit. I strongly encourage all of my fellow Members to support this bill.\n  Now, finally, before I conclude my remarks I want to thank my \ncolleagues for all of their diligent work on this bill.\n  Let me be clear, we would not be here today were it not for the \nefforts of Senate majority leader Harry Reid and for his guidance and \nfor his leadership. He and his team negotiated the most sensitive part \nof the bill. I personally want to thank Senator Reid for his stalwart \nsupport throughout this process.\n  Right after him comes Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. Over the past 4 \nyears, she has done more than anybody to get this bill passed into \nlaw--hopefully passed into law. Although she was fully engaged in every \npart of the development, most notably, her work on\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nsecuring a slots agreement removed one of the biggest hurdles in \ngetting this legislation through the Senate. In fact, it was the \nbiggest hurdle when we got this through the Senate. It was Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison who worked out those compromises and deals in a \nharrowingly magnificent fashion.\n  Her deep aviation expertise and negotiating skills are truly \nremarkable, and this bill is another significant part of her already \nvery substantial legacy.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Maria Cantwell. A year ago, she assumed the \nchairmanship of the Aviation Subcommittee. She made substantial \ncontributions to the entire bill but most notably on NextGen--the new \nair traffic control system, the modernized one, the GPS one, the \ndigitalized one. She effectively balances very difficult issues and at \nthe same time is incredibly committed to the interests of Washington \nState.\n  We should be proud of this compromise agreement that will enable our \naviation system to move forward to meet the challenges of continuously \nimproving safety, air traffic control modernization, airport \ndevelopment, and small community air service.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee for all that he said. I really \nappreciate working with him. Clearly, because of 23 extensions, you \nknow this was a hard bill to pass.\n  Since 2007, we have been trying to reauthorize the FAA and \nparticularly increase aviation safety and put our NextGen air traffic \ncontrol system in place. That has been the primary moving force. But, \nas is often the case, it is other issues that have come to the \nforefront and caused the delay after delay after delay process in \npassing this bill. We did pass it through the Senate and now have come \nout with a conference report between the House and Senate.\n  So I really first have to say thank you for the leadership of Senator \nRockefeller, which has been quiet and effective and letting the \ndifferent Members with different interests, of which there were many on \nthis bill, have their say--and he was very calm throughout the \nprocess--because in the end we all know that none of us are dictators, \nnone of us are the sole arbiters of what comes out of the Senate. We \nare a body of 100. We have colleagues on the other side who are 435. So \nobviously some people are going to have to give in certain areas. But \nwhat is good about the bill before us today is that the major \nprinciples have been addressed and the people who were most affected by \nthose have been able to see the big picture that we needed to address \nin this bill, that we give our airports the ability to grow, expand, \nand repair with the aviation trust fund, which the passage of this bill \nwill do. It will be in a stable environment because we have 4 years \nafter this bill is passed.\n  I thank the chairman and all who have worked on this bill. As \neveryone knows, the repeated use of short-term extensions does not \nallow for the long-term planning that is needed on the big projects, \nsuch as NextGen, the air traffic control system that will be based on \nsatellites or the airport improvements that are so important for our \nsmooth aviation system to function.\n  So what we are doing today is asking the Senate to pass the \nconference report the House has already passed. When we pass it, which \nis my hope today, it will go to the President for signature, and it \nwill provide that clear, stable way forward for our airports and the \nFAA to operate and make the sound fiscal investments in ensuring that \nwe have a good and seamless system.\n  First, the bill does improve aviation safety, including the \ndevelopment of a plan to reduce runway incursions and operational \nerrors, along with significant safety improvements for helicopter \nemergency medical service operators and their patients.\n  The bill modernizes our antiquated air traffic control system and \nmoves us one step closer to a more efficient and effective use of our \nnational air space. Specifically, it focuses on advancing the next-\ngeneration air transportation system that we call NextGen, and it \nimproves the management practices and oversight of the agency in the \nmodernization effort.\n  When fully implemented, NextGen will fundamentally transform air \ntraffic control from a ground-based radar system to a satellite-based \nsystem that uses global positioning navigation and surveillance digital \ncommunications and more accurate weather services. It is our belief \nthat most of the other countries in the world have NextGen already, but \nAmerica has the biggest aviation transportation system in the world, \nand therefore, when we come up to speed, it will make the seamless air \ntraffic control system globally better.\n  Some people will say: Well, NextGen--what does it mean? Well, it is \ngoing to open more airspace for our airplanes' use, both scheduled and \ngeneral aviation. It will reduce delays because we are going to have \nbetter scheduling. We are going to have more accurate capabilities to \nschedule, and therefore it will open more airspace for use by our \ngeneral aviation as well as our scheduled carriers. As we know, our \nscheduled carriers will be growing in the future. They are \nrestructuring and trying to accommodate us. But more and more people \nand bigger populations are going to produce more need for aviation \ntraffic.\n  Special attention is given to the acceleration certification planning \nand implementation of critical NextGen technologies. We have \nestablished in the bill clear deadlines for the adoption of technology \nand navigational procedures which will allow for a more precise and \nfuel-efficient use of our national airspace.\n  This conference report also moves forward initiatives associated with \nthe integration of the unmanned aircraft system--the UAS--into the \nnational airspace. We are seeing now more and more applications of \nunmanned aircraft, and it is going to increase.\n  We are looking at border security using UAV research, law \nenforcement, firefighting, just to name a few. There are going to be \nmore and more uses for unmanned aerial vehicles to be able to do the \nsurveillance and photographing that have taken helicopter pilots and \nsmall general aviation and even large aircraft to do in the past. So \nour bill begins to have a process for our air traffic control system to \naccommodate these UAVs.\n  Finally, the bill finds compromise in several difficult areas. \nChairman Rockefeller has mentioned several of those. The Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Perimeter Rule, the air carriage of lithium \nbatteries, and small-community air service are among the compromises \nthat were reached in this bill.\n  It is time that we finally create some stability in the aviation \nsector. This bill will do that. I encourage my colleagues to support \nits passage.\n  I would like to go ahead, since we do have time--actually, I do see \nsomeone waiting to speak. Since we will be on the floor until the vote, \nI will yield the floor at this time and finish the rest of my statement \nlater.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am down here to speak in favor of the \nFAA reauthorization conference report that the Senate will vote on \nshortly. I thank Chairman Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison for their \ngreat work on this piece of legislation--a long time coming. It has not \nbeen reauthorized since 2007, so it has been a long time coming. So I \nam very excited about this opportunity.\n  I think it is maybe a new trend for the year. Last week we passed the \nSTOCK Act, and today hopefully we will pass the FAA bill. There has \nbeen a lot of work, a lot of compromise on these two pieces of \nlegislation and this one particularly today.\n  The last time Congress actually passed a comprehensive FAA bill was \nin 2003. The bill expired in 2007. Since then, the FAA has been \noperating on 23 short-term extensions. These temporary extensions have \nbeen detrimental. They have prevented progress on modernizing our air \ntraffic control. I speak as someone who just literally flew in a couple \nof hours ago overnight from Alaska. We clearly understand air traffic. \nThey did not give airports funding certainty for planning, runway, and \nsafety improvements, and they resulted in a brief shutdown in which\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\n4,000 FAA employees were furloughed for almost 2 weeks last summer. It \nis far past time that Congress pass a comprehensive FAA reauthorization \nbill.\n\n  While this bill is significant for the entire country, it is \nparticularly important for my residents, the residents of aviation in \nAlaska, and residents overall. It is truly a lifeblood. When you think \nof aviation, it is our highway in the sky. Alaska has 6 times more \npilots and 16 times more aircraft per capita than the rest of the \nUnited States. More than 80 percent of our communities are not on the \nroad system. So aviation is the only reliable year-round means of \ntransportation.\n  This conference report invests over $13 billion in our airport \ninfrastructure over the next 4 years. Let me underline that--$13 \nbillion in the next 4 years. This is about jobs. It is about improving \nairport safety. In an economy that is slowly recovering and on the \nright track, this will add to the needed jobs in the construction \nindustry but also make sure that we put them to work in areas such as \naviation which are critically needed. It will improve our runways, \ncreate more safety projects in our airports and our runway areas, yet \nsafely accommodate the higher traffic levels while putting tens of \nthousands of Americans to work.\n  This bill invests in and accelerates the deployment of the NextGen \nmodernization of our air traffic control system, as you have heard \ndescribed already. We have been using a World War II-era radar \ntechnology for our air traffic control. Transition to more accurate \nsatellite-based tracking will allow for more direct routes between \ndestinations, reducing fuel use and saving airlines money.\n  The backbone of this technology, called ADS-B, was proven in Alaska \nas part of the capstone project. So we are excited that we were the \nincubator for such an important element of our aviation, and now to see \nit accelerated and moved throughout the whole industry will be a huge \nbenefit to the consumer.\n  For Alaskans, it contains an amendment which I offered and was \ncosponsored by Senator Murkowski, providing relief for a one-size-fits-\nall rulemaking. That rule inadvertently prevented the shipment of \ncompressed oxygen needed for medical and construction purposes in rural \nAlaska.\n  This legislation also contains a special provision that Senator \nCoburn from Oklahoma and I sponsored called the orphan earmarks \nprovision. It repeals earmarks for aviation projects if less than 10 \npercent of the earmark has not been used after 9 years. It saves \nmillions of dollars on stalled projects so that we can direct those \nlimited resources where they can have the greatest bang for the dollar.\n  This conference report makes significant investments in the Essential \nAir Service Program--otherwise known as EAS--which serves rural and \nisolated areas. Forty-four communities in Alaska will continue to \nreceive a minimal level of scheduled passenger service. There are \nsensible reforms that will exclude communities in the lower 48 with \nfewer than 10 passengers per day.\n  The House FAA bill proposed to make truly Draconian cuts to the EAS \nProgram. I wish to thank Chair Rockefeller particularly for his effort \nto make sure that rural communities throughout America and Alaska \ncontinue to receive the access they need to airspace and travel from \ntheir small communities. For the general aviation community, this bill \ncontains no new user fees. Let me repeat that--no new user fees for \ngeneral aviation.\n  There is aviation community funding for research into an unleaded \nfuel substitute which one day may replace avgas. There are incentives \nfor ADS-B equipment.\n  I will continue to work with my copartner on the general aviation \ncaucus, Senator Johanns, to make sure that aviation policies are \nmindful of the significant role general aviation plays not only in my \nState of Alaska but throughout this country.\n  For our airline passengers, this conference report includes a \npassengers' bill of rights championed by Senators Boxer and Snowe. It \ncodifies commonsense approaches and changes, such as making sure \npassengers have adequate food and water and lavatory access if delayed \non the tarmac and options to deplane if the flight has been excessively \ndelayed.\n  It is not a perfect bill. I was disappointed that the conference \nreport contains language pertaining to the National Mediation Board and \nthe rules governing union organizing. It is not relevant to the \nunderlying bill. It was not included in the bill the Senate passed last \nyear. We understand this was a necessary compromise for the House \nleadership to allow this long-stalled bill to move forward. Again, it \nis not an appropriate element to this bill, but recognizing that the \noverall bill is critical to the long-term health of our aviation \nindustry and the passengers of this country, we can take comfort from \nthe fact that we added over 30 provisions in this conference report \nthat will improve conditions for aviation workers.\n  I firmly believe the controversial NMB language has no place in this \nbill. I also recognize it is time to move forward.\n\n  I wish to recognize again the leadership of Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Hutchison of the Senate Commerce Committee and their tireless \nwork. They never gave up. Their staffs continued to work and to push \nforward, to push everyone when it looked as if the differences between \nthe House and Senate were impossible to resolve. The conference report \nbefore us is a testament to their tenacity and their bipartisanship.\n  This bill is a shining example of what Congress can accomplish when \nwe put our differences aside and sit down to do the daily work of \nlegislating. This is a very strong bill, a bipartisan bill. It is just \nunfortunate it has taken this long to get here.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this monumental conference report \nwhich will put Americans back to work, enhance our airport \ninfrastructure, and will make the safest aviation system in the world \neven safer.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we will be voting in an hour and a \nhalf, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank so many of the \npeople who brought this bill together, which we hope will come to a \ngood conclusion in about an hour and a half.\n  Obviously, I have talked about Chairman Rockefeller. This has been a \nlong process, clearly--23 extensions and it has been since 2007 that we \nhad the last authorization. I think the fact we are now going to have a \n4-year authorization is one of the more important elements. Now our \nairports are going to be able to start their building projects. They \nare going to be able to increase their runway space or do repairs or \nwhatever the priorities are that are decided by the FAA are the most \nimportant priorities for our Nation because the funding source from the \nhighway trust fund will now be known for 4 years. I think that is a \nvery important step in the right direction.\n  I wish to thank the House managers of this bill as well, the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Chairman Mica and Ranking Member \nRahall and the respective Aviation Subcommittee chairs in the House, \nRepresentatives Petri and Costello. Their work and input on their bill \nwas certainly critical, and the ability to come to conference and \nhammer it out was critical as well.\n  In the Senate, I wish to thank all our conferees, Senators Hatch, \nIsakson, and DeMint on our side and, additionally, Senators Cantwell \nand Thune, the respective chair and ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee's Aviation Subcommittee, for their work on the bill.\n  The staff, of course, are the ones who work long hours, and though we \nnever see them, they are there. Senator Rockefeller and I were having \ntelephone calls at 10 o'clock at night, then we would call our staffs \nand then call back to determine what was happening and what needed to \nbe happening. So I thank the person who runs the Commerce Committee on \nthe majority side, Ellen Doneski, who is wonderful to work with, James \nReid, Gael Sullivan,\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\nRich Swayze, and Adam Duffy, who worked on this bill and the \nnegotiations for all these years that we have been trying to pass this; \non Representative Mica's staff, Jim Coon, Holly Woodruff Lyons, Bailey \nEdwards, and Simone Perez; on Representative Rahall's staff, Jim Zoia, \nWard McCarragher, Giles Giovinazzi, and Alex Burkett; and on my staff, \nthe Commerce Committee minority side, Todd Bertoson, Richard Russell, \nand Jarrod Thompson.\n  I wish to especially mention Jarrod Thompson, who is the one I know \nthe best, because he is the Aviation Subcommittee ranking member's \nstaff leader. He knows the history of the aviation bills. He knows the \nsubject matter. There was never a time when I would ask a specific or \ntechnical question that Jarrod didn't know the answer, and I so \nappreciate his being on our staff and helping us through this very \nimportant time.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I thank all my colleagues and our \nHouse colleagues and staff for their work on this bill that I hope we \nwill be able to pass when the vote comes at 5:30 this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am in the happy position of \nmimicking a lot of what my colleague Senator Hutchison has said but for \na very good reason. Until one goes through an experience such as the \none Senator Hutchison and I have been through for the last year, plus, \nplus, one has no understanding of how hard staff works.\n  That staff routinely work over the weekends is just a given. They \nwork through the night. They will stay up all night frequently. They \nhave to reach out in so many directions. There are not that many of \nthem as compared to those who have requests of them, and so their work \nnever stops.\n  Let me start, obviously, with Senator Hutchison. She did mention Todd \nBertoson and Richard Russell, then Jarrod Thompson, the lead \nnegotiator. That is a tough position. It is a very tough position \nbecause people and interest groups figure out whom to go to and whom to \npester and whom to follow up with. I have that same situation, and \nEllen Doneski is incredible. I called her at 11 last night and she was \nfine and well and then she got sick and now she is already back at \nwork. Does that mean she is not sick any longer? I don't know. But they \nare driven to excel. They are driven to drive the product home in ways \nthat are expiring.\n  To my left sits James Reid, who is the No. 2 person on that committee \nwho, as far as I can tell, knows everything about everything and \ncertainly about any discussion that comes up in terms of the Commerce \nCommittee. He is tireless. He has young children with the tension that \ncreates, not in principle but just the idea that you have to \noccasionally show up at home and be a good father.\n  Gael Sullivan is our lead negotiator, and that is a very special \nposition on a bill such as this. Rich Swayze and Adam Duffy; Rich \nSwayze and Gael worked so many things together, and Gael Sullivan and \nAdam Duffy.\n  Let me go to Representative Joe Rahall. Obviously, he is a colleague \nof mine. I think he has been in the House for 36 years, and he \nrepresents the coal fields, in many ways the most volatile part of our \nState as its economics change rapidly. His chief negotiator is Giles \nGiovinazzi, and to him goes the same praise. House Members and the \nsubcommittees and committees have so many fewer staff than in the \nSenate, so we have to praise them very much. Jim Zoia, who is his chief \nof staff--and has been, I swear, for all 36 years. If it is not the \ncase, it doesn't matter--is a remarkable person; Ward McGarragher and \nAlex Burkett.\n  With John Mica, I need to mention Jim Coon, Holly Woodruff Lyons, who \nwas his lead negotiator, and Bailey Edwards and Simone Perez.\n  Let me end simply by saying Senator Reid and his people were so \nheavily involved, particularly in this one aspect of the bill. But he \nhas been driving this bill in our caucuses, as the Presiding Officer \nwell knows, for over a year: Where is my FAA bill? Where is my FAA \nbill? He has been driving, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing. His \nchief of staff is David Krone, who so many people don't know and it is \ntheir loss; Darrel Thompson, Bob Herbert, Bill Dauster, who keeps in \ntouch with everybody and everything.\n  To the floor staff of the majority and the minority leaders, just \nsimply to be grateful to them and to make sure we say that to them \npersonally, we say it publicly, and we say it frequently.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, from this point forward, any time spent \nin quorum calls be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise and ask unanimous consent to speak \nas if in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   startup america legislative agenda\n\n  Mr. COONS. Last week, President Obama unveiled his Startup America \nLegislative Agenda.\n  It marked the 1-year anniversary of his Startup America initiative, \nan ambitious, impressive, national energetic effort led by, among \nothers, legendary innovator and entrepreneur Steve Case, the founder of \nAOL. It was a strategy that focused on how the Federal Government can \nbest help young companies and, in particular, entrepreneurs all over \nthis country get into the game of starting and growing businesses. It \nis smart and it is important.\n  Entrepreneurs are driving our economic recovery and will drive our \neconomic recovery into the future. They are taking the risk personally \nto turn their ideas into startup companies in fields from biotech and \nclean energy to manufacturing. Among these innovators could be the next \nAmerican giant, a General Electric or DuPont. But in order for these \nstartup companies to grow, we have to support them in their critical \nearly stages. Today, I take that as our challenge.\n  Whenever I visit a factory in Delaware or meet with the young owner \nof a company that he or she has just started, I ask the same question: \nHow can we best help you to grow?\n  Small business, it is often said, is the engine of job creation in \nthis country. In the 1990s and the early 2000s, small firms created \nmore than 65 percent of the new jobs in this country. But I want us to \nparticularly focus on those small businesses that have enormous \npotential, so-called gazelle startups, those that grow not from 5 to 10 \nor 5 to 20 employees but from 5 to 50 to 500 to 5,000, whether it is \nFacebook or other startups that have gone from literally bench top or \ndorm room to being employers of thousands or tens of thousands.\n  Our economy has grown dramatically because of these rapidly growing \ninnovative startups. Typically, they are startups that focus on a \ndisruptive technology or product, something that fundamentally changes \na whole sector of our marketplace, and they have the most promising \npotential for job creation.\n  Between 1980 and 2005, most of the net new jobs in America were \ncreated by firms that were 5 years old or less. That is about 40 \nmillion jobs over those 25 years.\n  This summer, I hosted in Delaware a series of roundtables with \nbusiness owners. The focus of these conversations was on how we can \nhelp their businesses to grow and grow quickly. A lot of these \nbusinesses were young and innovative companies. They have a great idea \nand a good start on their research. But I often found, particularly in \nthis economy, they are struggling to capitalize on their innovations.\n  Innovation is the spark that drives and sustains entrepreneurship, \nparticularly entrepreneurship in disruptive technologies. But it is \nresearch and development that drives that innovation, and government \nonly has so many tools we can use to help promote innovation. Today, I \nwish to talk about a piece of the Tax Code that is one of the most \npowerful tools in our toolbox.\n  Thirty years ago, Congress created the Research and Development Tax \nCredit, the R Tax Credit, to help incentivize companies to invest in \ninnovation, to invest in the people who are doing the research and the \ndevelopment that drives innovation. In fact, 70 percent of R\nqualified expenses\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\ntoday are for wages. In many ways, it is an innovative jobs credit. It \nhas helped tens of thousands of companies and has been extremely \nsuccessful at getting companies to invest in innovation. But it has one \nkey weakness: It expires. It expires all too often. It has, in fact, \nexpired 8 times and been extended 13 times and it has most recently \nexpired in December of last year.\n  The first bill I introduced as a Senator last April was entitled the \n``Job Creation Through Innovation Act.'' It did two things. First, and \nmost important, it made the R tax credit permanent--important, in my \nview, to sustain and extend this successful program. But there is \nanother issue we still need to address to make the tax credit relevant \nto these early stage, innovative, high-growth companies. Right now, the \ntax benefits of the R tax credit are available only to more \nestablished companies that are already turning a profit. We have to \nhave a tax liability on their profits for that credit to be of any \nvalue to them. That is a roadblock in the way of success for startups \nand small businesses in Delaware and around the country and a place \nwhere I think we can and should come together across the aisle to \naddress this gap in the R tax credit program because, in my view, it \nis the small early startups that most need a cash infusion to support \ntheir confidence, their stability, and their innovation. We can, and \nshould, take this tax credit and retool it in a way that makes it more \nrelevant and more effective. If entrepreneurs are the ones taking risks \nin this economy and creating jobs, they should be the ones we support \nin this tough economy through our Tax Code. As I said before, history \nshows it is those young companies that are creating the most jobs the \nmost quickly and that have the best return on tax expenditures.\n  Here is what I have been working on. As I have met with innovative \nyoung businesses in Delaware, one of the ideas that has come to me more \nthan once is to change the R tax credit so it is accessible not just \nby being permanent to big and profitable companies but by being \ntradable so smaller or startup companies that have no tax liability can \ntake advantage of it.\n  How would that work? It allows startups to sell their tax credit to a \nlarger company, giving them a much needed infusion of cash. Let me give \nan example.\n  Elcriton is a small but high promise, high potential Delaware \ncompany. It has patented strains of bacteria that are designed to \nconsume duckweed--also called pond scum--and produce biobutanol, a \npromising drop-in alternative fuel. It has tremendous potential. \nElcriton today is run by two Ph.D.s who have put together all the money \nthey can raise, from family and friends and angel investors and early \nfunds into research and development. But for them to grow, and grow \nquickly, they need access to more capital to fund more innovation.\n  Evozym Biologics also is a 2-year-old Delaware company trying to \nbring to market cutting-edge innovations in computing and in the \ndevelopment of proteins from the University of Delaware and the Desert \nResearch Institute. They are doing incredible things there.\n  Both these companies need more funding to invest in R and to \ncapitalize on their potential to grow rapidly and grow high-quality \njobs. If they were already bigger, well-established, successful \ncompanies, they might well qualify for the existing R tax credit. But \nbecause they are so small and just getting started, our current tax \ncredit doesn't help them at all.\n  Fortunately, Delaware is also home to a few great well-established \ncompanies. Since those companies turn a profit and pay taxes, they \ncould actually utilize a tax credit. In this case, Elcriton or Evozym \nwould sell their innovation credit to one of the larger established \ncompanies. The bigger company gets the tax credit. The newer company \ngets the infusion of cash it needs to sustain its innovation. It would \nbe a win-win.\n  This is just one idea of a number that I have introduced, that I have \nproposed, and that I have discussed with Senator Baucus and others on \nFinance. I hope that in discussing it today, some of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle and leaders in the business and innovation \ncommunities will work with me to further refine it, focus it, and make \nit part of our greater conversation about tax reform and the economic \nrecovery.\n  We can and should put our heads together to find commonsense \nsolutions to the problems, challenges, and opportunities of innovation \nand competitiveness. We have to give American business the support they \nneed to compete in an increasingly competitive global economy because, \nin my view, we are falling behind in the race for innovation.\n  In the 1980s, the United States was routinely ranked as having the \nbest R tax incentives and overall support for innovation in the \nworld, but today some studies have us ranked 17th in the world in \nsupporting and sustaining innovation. I refuse to let American \ncompanies, American inventors, and American workers fall behind. With \nthe right resources, American ingenuity will continue to outcompete any \ncountry on Earth every time. I know it is possible. I have seen it week \nin and week out as I have visited small and medium startup companies in \nDelaware.\n  Just a few weeks ago in Bridgeville, DE, a town many from here have \ntraveled as they have gone to the Delaware beaches, I stopped to visit \na small company, Miller Metal, that is proving day in and day out that \nwith investment, with innovation, with continuous improvement, they can \ngo head to head with Chinese metal fabricators and win: manufactured in \nDelaware, competitive in the global marketplace.\n  Although we need a full overhaul of our corporate tax structure, \nmaking this one small tweak to the R tax credit to make it accessible \nto early stage innovative companies will, in my view, give us a running \nstart into the headwinds of the global economy, and I think we have no \nmore time to waste. It is small businesses and innovative strategies \nthat will create the jobs we need to put our neighbors back to work and \nturn this economy around more quickly. Let's work together, let's help \nthem, and let's make progress on this most important proposal to change \nthe R tax credit, make it permanent, and make it accessible for early \nstage companies.\n  I am eager to hear what people think about this idea, and I hope they \nwill connect with me and my office and let me know how to improve on \nit, how to execute on it, and how to deliver this as a new tool in the \ntoolkit of American innovation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, as many of my colleagues \nhave done, to speak in favor of the final passage of the conference \nreport to accompany the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and \nImprovement Act. I don't know what the acronym to that is. It is a long \nname but it is a very comprehensive bill, and a very good bill.\n  I especially want to thank Senator Hutchison and my good friend from \nWest Virginia Senator Rockefeller and their dedicated staff for the \ncountless hours they have dedicated over the past 5 years to produce \nlegislation that will provide the Federal Aviation Administration with \nthe tools necessary to begin finally to support the 21st century \nnational airspace system. It is not often you have a staff and two \nMembers dedicated for 5 years to finally come up with a good bill. It \nhas been tough sledding, but they have gotten it done.\n  The aviation industry remains one of the most important economic \nsectors in my home State of Kansas. Passage of this 4-year \nreauthorization is absolutely necessary for giving aviation companies \nnecessary funding and the regulatory certainty to move forward with a \nnumber of important initiatives. It is not very often in today's world \nyou talk about regulatory certainty. This bill will do that.\n  Specifically, the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \nImprovement Act includes provisions to\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\nimplement a state-of-the-art satellite-based navigation system to \nprovide operators and users of our national airspace the ability to \nseamlessly guide and locate traffic throughout our Nation and around \nthe world.\n  It also authorizes critical funding for the Essential Air Service \nProgram which provides Kansas and other rural States the ability to \nprovide air service to smaller communities and the citizens and \nbusinesses whose livelihoods rely on the ability to travel longer \ndistances in a short amount of time.\n  As a Member of the House--as a matter of fact, even prior to that as \na staffer to a Member of the House--I was part of the effort that \nestablished the first Essential Air Service, so I have a long-time \ninterest in this. I again thank Senators for doing their very best to \npreserve this program.\n  More important, this legislation reflects a bipartisan effort to \nensure the continued health of the general aviation industry. This \nindustry contributes over $150 billion to the national economy each \nyear. It has created over 1.3 million jobs--if anybody wants to hear \nabout job creation, this is the outfit that does it--across a broad \nrange of disciplines, and allows companies the ability to access \nfacilities all across the globe.\n  This is where I want to particularly thank Chairman Rockefeller and \nSenator Hutchison as well as my colleagues on the Finance Committee who \nwere tasked with finding the necessary funding streams to pay for the \nannual $15.9 billion tag this legislation does authorize.\n  Notably, this legislation does not include language imposing \ndisproportionate and onerous user fees on the general aviation \nindustry. This is contrary to what has happened in the past. This has \nbeen a general agreement now. Rather, this legislation preserves the \ncurrent fuel tax levels, an efficient and effective funding mechanism \nthat accurately reflects general aviation's use of the system.\n  If anybody down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is listening, I hope they \nwould adopt the same attitude as we have been able to reach in a \nbipartisan way, and not pick on any particular industry--or use their \nname or acronym for their name about six or seven times in three \nparagraphs of recent speeches.\n  Last, this legislation would not undermine steps taken at the \nDepartment of Transportation to protect private citizens from having \ntheir movements tracked by anyone with easily accessible flight \ntracking technology.\n  I look forward to joining my colleagues later this afternoon in \npassing this important measure, a great, comprehensive bill that will \nsupport more than a million jobs and help spur further economic growth \nand development in our Nation's aviation sector.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to echo, first of \nall, the words of the distinguished Senator from Kansas. He was right \non target in every point he made. But I also rise to pay tribute to the \nchairman, Senator Rockefeller, and ranking member Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nMr. Ray LaHood, and Chairman Mica in the House, all of whom did an \noutstanding job bringing this together.\n  I was thinking in the airplane coming up here--it was an appropriate \nplace to think about it; we are all on airplanes quite a lot--I was \nthinking about the many bills I have been involved in here in my 13, \nalmost 14 years in the Congress of the United States. I don't know if I \never remember a conference committee that was so far apart and so \ndivided that finally came together in the best interests of the \nAmerican people than this one. I want to pay tribute to Majority Leader \nHarry Reid, who played an instrumental role in finding common ground \nand coming to agreement. Speaker Boehner in the House of \nRepresentatives did the same. This was a team effort. The National \nMediation Board decisions that were made in the final agreements were \ngood and they were fair. As Senator Roberts has said, the treatment of \ngeneral aviation and commercial aviation is fair and equitable. We now \nhave a 4-year plan for the next generation. Everything that happened, \nhappened for the best and it happened because of good leadership on the \npart of Chairman Rockefeller and Congressman Mica and Speaker Boehner, \nthe Speaker of the House, and Senator Reid. I thank all for the work \nthey did, and I am very proud to have been a part of the solution that \nled to the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roberts from Kansas \nand Senator Isakson from the State of Georgia--State of Atlanta--for \ntheir very kind remarks. I really mean that. These are two good people \nwith a lot of business experience, with aviation--is Hartsfield still \nthe world's busiest airport?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Busiest in the world.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And tremendous general aviation industry the Senator \nhas in his State. That they come down and praise this bill means a lot \nto this Senator and I thank both of them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about \nprovisions of this bill that amend an unrelated labor law statute--the \nRailway Labor Act. As the chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, which has jurisdiction over this law \nand the agency that enforces it, the National Mediation Board, I am \ntroubled by the inclusion of this language and the implication that it \ncreates; namely, that this independent Federal agency and the hard-\nworking Americans it protects are being punished for recent regulatory \nchanges that protect workers' rights.\n  The National Mediation Board--or NMB as it is known--established in \n1934, is an independent agency that administers labor relations in the \nair and rail industries. In 2009 this small, 51-person agency went \nthrough a careful process to change the voting rules governing the \nelections that it administers. Under the old antiquated election \nsystem, all nonvoters were automatically and arbitrarily treated as a \n``no'' vote, or a vote against the union, regardless of whether they \nactually opposed forming a union. These rules were contrary to the \nelection rules used in National Labor Relations Board-supervised \nelections and different from the rules governing elections held \nthroughout the entire United States, from school boards to U.S. \nSenators. Think about it--if you don't vote, you are counted as a \n``no'' vote. What kind of sense does that make? It made no sense. Just \nas it would be unfair to arbitrarily assign an individual American a \nposition, let's say, in the Presidential race because he or she chose \nnot to vote, it was unjust to capriciously impose a position on rail \nand aviation workers who, for one reason or another, didn't vote in a \nrepresentation election. That is why the National Mediation Board \nadopted the commonsense rule, the same rule that applies to industries \nall over America that are governed by the National Labor Relations \nBoard. The rule was that in the future elections, a voter's decision \nnot to vote would have no impact on the election's outcome. Only those \nvoters who actually participate will determine the outcome of the \nelection. A majority of those who vote determines who wins.\n  This basic system, as I said, of conducting elections works for \nschool boards and for Congress. It works for all the businesses in \nAmerica that are governed by the National Labor Relations Act, and it \nwill work and has worked for rail and aviation workers. The only entity \nthis new system apparently doesn't work for is the management of a few \npowerful airlines. These powerful companies don't want workers to have \nrepresentation. They don't want to engage in collective bargaining with \ntheir workers. I guess they are deeply concerned about the remote\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\nchance that at some point in the future they just might have to put a \nfew additional dollars into middle-class workers' pockets, so they \nwaged an unprecedented attack campaign to kill this rule, the rule that \nsays: If you don't vote, your vote is not counted as yes or no. The \nonly votes that count are those that vote yes and those that vote no. \nIn the past, if you didn't vote, it was counted automatically as a \n``no'' vote. Finally, people said: This doesn't make sense. No other \nbusiness in America has any kind of rule like that governed by the \nNational Labor Relations Board.\n  These few powerful airlines waged an unprecedented attack campaign to \nkill the rule. First they found some friends in Congress and tried \nchallenging the rule under the Congressional Review Act, a law that \nallows Congress to overturn a rule through a resolution of \ndisapproval. They lost that fight on the Senate floor. Next, they went \nto court to challenge the legality of the rulemaking. They lost that \nfight in the district court, and then they appealed to the court of \nappeals and they lost there too. So then they waged a last-ditch effort \nto kill the rule on this FAA reauthorization bill, which has nothing to \ndo with it. Again, it was not in the Senate bill. The House put it on a \ntotally unrelated provision dealing with the National Mediation Board \nthat isn't even a part of the FAA and which isn't in the jurisdiction \nof the Senate Commerce committee.\n\n  The FAA reauthorization has historically been a bipartisan bill that \nis essential to the operation of our aviation system. As a pilot \nmyself--I have been all my life--I can see why this bill was needed, \nbelieve me. The current bill not only extends a wide variety of \nprovisions impacting aviation, it helps to create tens of thousands of \njobs and to bring our aviation system into the 21st century. This \nimportant legislation has absolutely nothing to do with the National \nMediation Board, whose sole job is to oversee labor relations. But last \nyear House Republicans tried to turn this FAA reauthorization bill into \na vehicle to attack workers' rights.\n  They added a provision to their bill repealing the National Mediation \nBoard's election rule--the rule which said if a person does not vote, \nit is not counted. It is not counted as a ``no'' vote or ``yes'' vote; \nit is just not counted--a commonsense rule. Then, when the House and \nSenate bills were in conference last year, they refused to pass a clean \nextension of the FAA laws as had been done on more than 20 occasions \nprior. Since they didn't do that, they stopped the conference \nnegotiations. Instead, the House forced a partial shutdown of the FAA.\n  That shutdown last summer left 4,000 FAA workers furloughed. It put \nmany thousands more people out of work in airport construction. It cut \noff FAA reimbursement payments to small businesses across the country. \nIt cost the government about $25 million in tax revenues every single \nday just because the House was attacking workers' rights and they \nwanted to add this onerous provision to the FAA bill.\n  While frustrating, it has long been the norm here to keep agencies \noperating with short-term extensions while bills whose terms have not \nbeen worked out are negotiated. The House action was a rare break from \nthat norm, and it caused real damage to thousands of real people.\n  Fortunately, there was a substantial public backlash against the \nHouse Republicans, and they had to back down. They let a short-term FAA \nextension pass, then they backed off on their demand to kill the rule. \nBut the powerful corporations behind this effort still couldn't let the \nissue go. Despite the fact that the new rule had been in place for more \nthan a year and has had absolutely no negative impact on any carrier--\nthe union success rate in elections has remained roughly the same \nbefore and after the rule's implementation--these corporations were \nstill bound and determined to attack the National Mediation Board and \nto attack America's rail and airline workers to punish them for having \nthe audacity to stand up for what is fair and to have the audacity to \nstand up and say a vote that is not taken shouldn't be counted as a \n``no'' vote or a ``yes'' vote; it shouldn't be counted at all, which I \nthink most Americans would think makes sense.\n  So these corporations got their friends in the House Republican \nleadership to demand the addition of burdensome new changes to the \nRailway Labor Act in this unrelated FAA bill. The dramatic changes they \ninitially demanded to this statute were absurd and would have been \nirresponsible to slip into a nonamendable conference report without any \nconsideration by the committee of jurisdiction which happens to be the \njurisdiction of the committee I chair in the Senate.\n  Fortunately, Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, and Senator Reid, through months of negotiations, were able \nto stave off the worst of the House Republican proposals and ultimately \nsettle on a package of less detrimental changes. Under this new \nlanguage, the agency retains discretion to determine when a union \nshould be properly certified as a bargaining representative, and we \nhave no intention of changing that process. I also think we have left a \nlot of room for the agency to make rules that govern special situations \nsuch as mergers.\n  But to be clear, I don't think any of us on this side of the aisle \nwanted to make these changes at all. We were forced to do this by a few \npowerful people who were willing to hold many thousands of American \njobs hostage and hold hostage improvements to our airway system just to \nget this.\n  Some people might call this process a compromise, but I call it an \nabuse of our legislative process, and we shouldn't let it happen. To be \nclear, as I have indicated, there is progress in this bill for the \npeople of my State and the people of this great Nation. It will create \njobs. It will move our country's aviation system into the 21st century. \nIt shifts our air traffic control system to a GPS system where planes \ncan fly far more efficiently, saving fuel and time. It provides a \ncompromise that continues the Essential Air Service Program.\n  So, again, I thank Chairman Rockefeller for his diligence and his \nhard work for over 4 years trying to lead the House and others into \nmoving our air transportation system, both for general aviation and for \nair transport and for the airlines, to be more efficient and to use \nless fuel so it is more benign to our environment. Believe me, there is \na lot in here that is going to help general aviation also. So I thank \nSenator Rockefeller for his diligence and his hard work.\n  So my ``no'' vote today on this bill is not to suggest that there \naren't many good things in this bill. Instead, my vote is to stand up \nagainst the notion that a Federal agency and the American workers it is \ncharged to protect should be punished for doing what is right and what \nis fair, what is in their jurisdiction, and to stand up against a \nprocess that allows the few and the powerful to hijack this body and \nchange the rules of the game in their favor. The American people \ndeserve better than that.\n\n\n                           Railway Labor Act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask a few questions of my \nfriend the majority Leader and my friend Senator Rockefeller, Chairman \nof the Senate Commerce, Science, Transportation about the changes to \nthe Railway Labor Act in the this bill. Because my committee has \njurisdiction over this important act, I want to make sure that I fully \nunderstand the scope and impact of these changes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I think a little context is helpful to understand \nthe situation we were in. Republicans sought to use the FAA \nreauthorization bill to overturn a recent administrative rule by the \nNational Mediation Board granting certification if a union won a \nmajority of actual voters in a representation election. The Senate \ncorrectly rejected that provision of the House bill. The rule was fair \nand reasonable and I strongly support it.\n  Mr. REID. I agree, and reaffirm our strong support for National \nMediation Board's decision in this matter. The Senate bill would, \nhowever, modify the Railway Labor Act in a few minor ways. One of these \nchanges would modify the agency rules governing the showing of interest \nthat is a precursor to a representation election for either a new \ncertification or a change in certification. We modified that standard \nto require a 50 percent showing of interest for all elections. This \npercent was chosen to recognize the longstanding primary statutory goal \nof the Railway Labor Act, which is stability\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\nin labor relations through peaceful collective bargaining. A 50 percent \nshowing of interest will ensure that elections only occur when there is \na sufficient and substantial indication of employee support.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My understanding is that there has been longstanding \ndeference to the National Mediation Board regarding the findings it \nmakes in the representation context. As the Supreme Court stated in \nSwitchmen's Union v. NMB, after a NMB's decision on whether a showing \nof interest has been made ``the dispute [is] to reach its last terminal \npoint when the administrative finding [i]s made. There [i]s to be no \ndragging out the controversy into other tribunals of law.'' Would these \nchanges alter that longstanding deference in any way?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely not. In considering the amendments, we relied on \nand had no intention of disrupting the Supreme Court's decision in the \nSwitchmen case. Codifying the standard in statute was not intended to \nalter the longstanding deference that must be accorded to the National \nMediation Board as it makes factual findings in the representation \ncontext. In fact, the language was included in a new section of the \nAct, rather than incorporated into the existing Section 9, based on a \nconsensus among all parties involved in the conference negotiations \nthat the new showing of interest should not enable an employer to \nmanipulate the election process by demanding court review of the \nshowing of interest.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would ask my friend, Senator Rockefeller, if this was \nhis understanding as well?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Certainly. We had no intention of changing the level \nof deference that is accorded to the agency in representation matters. \nThe NMB's certification authority remains conclusive.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleagues and am reassured by their response. \nI can think of a number of dangers that would arise if the sufficiency \nof a showing of interest were litigated in court. The sad reality is \nthat employees are regularly retaliated against for supporting \nunionization--in ways that are legal and illegal. It would be very \ndangerous if employers could gain access to union authorization cards \nthrough litigation discovery. It is reassuring to hear that the sponsor \nof this bill does not intend that result by codifying the showing of \ninterest.\n  Mr. REID. The purpose of the amendments was very limited. It was not \nintended to alter judicial review; in fact, there was agreement among \nDemocrats and Republicans negotiating the agreement that there would be \nno expansion of judicial review. And I would also like to explain that \nit is not intended to apply to the unique situation in mergers. The \ntext of the amendments apply to all applications for representation \nelections, but not to the entirely different circumstance where a labor \norganization or employees petition the National Mediation Board for a \ndetermination as to whether a merger or other transaction has altered \nan existing representational structure as a result of a creation of a \nsingle transportation system. In those cases, it is our intent that the \nNational Mediation Board's existing merger procedures, as modified from \ntime to time by the National Mediation Board, shall determine the \npercent of the craft or class to establish a showing of interest. \nOtherwise, employees could lose their representation simply by merging \nwith a slightly larger unit without even having the opportunity to \nvote, which is unacceptable.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the majority leader for that helpful \nclarification. I would like to raise two additional questions if I may, \nboth related to whether usual rules of statutory interpretation are \nintended to apply here. First, am I correct that the showing of \ninterest requirement set forth in this legislation should only apply \nprospectively and should not apply to any application for \nrepresentation pending at the time of the effective date of the \nlegislation?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. And second, in the amendments, \nCongress directed the Government Accountability Office to review \ncertain NMB activities periodically, and in conducting these reviews, \nto consider whether the agency's actions are consistent with \nCongressional intent. I would presume that the relevant question for \nthe GAO to consider is whether the agency's actions are consistent with \nthe intent of the Congress that passed the provisions of the Act in \nquestion, the joint labor-management agreements which led to its \nadoption, and the subsequent judicial interpretation thereof?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER: That is correct, yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleagues for joining me in this \nconversation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote in support of the conference \nreport to accompany the FAA Reauthorization and Reform Act, H.R. 658. \nThe last reauthorization bill expired at the end of fiscal year 2007 \nand since then we have passed 23 short-term extensions. We are long \noverdue to enact a long-term reauthorization of FAA's programs in order \nto provide important funding and program improvements that will enhance \nthe safety and efficiency of our Nation's aviation system. I am pleased \nwe are finally doing that today and in so doing we make key investments \nin our Nation's aviation infrastructure as well as create good jobs in \nthe process.\n  One of the main issues holding up the bill for so long was a \nprovision contained in the House bill, but not the Senate bill, to \nrepeal the National Mediation Board--NMB--rule that ensures that only \nthose votes cast in a union election are counted. I am glad to see that \ncontroversial provision has been removed, although I am disappointed \nlanguage has been added to change Railway Labor Act rules and \nregulations governing union elections by raising the showing of \ninterest threshold for holding an election from 35 percent to 50 \npercent of the employees in the craft or class. I do not believe the \nFAA reauthorization bill is the appropriate vehicle for this sort of \nchange and I do not support its inclusion in this bill.\n  Providing a long-term 4-year reauthorization of our aviation programs \nis vitally important. Our global economy depends on the smooth and \nefficient movement of goods, services and people from city to city and \nacross international borders. A safe and efficient aviation system goes \nhand in hand with a strong economy. We are fortunate to have one of the \nbest aviation systems in the world and I am pleased that under this \nbill we continue to make the necessary investments and upgrades to \nretain that high standard. This FAA reauthorization bill addresses \nproblems of capacity, congestion and delays to help ensure our aviation \nsystem can handle the projected growth in airlines passengers.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill will also create much needed jobs by \nproviding the funding and directives for safety improvements at our \nairports and in the aviation industry. In Michigan alone the FAA is \nbuilding two new air traffic control towers, at Kalamazoo and Traverse \nCity. The FAA is also repaving numerous runways and taxiways, including \nat Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, Alpena County Regional \nAirport, Bishop International Airport, Sawyer International Airport and \nat other airports around the state. The FAA is also constructing new \nterminal buildings at Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport and \nat MBS International Airport in Freeland, MI. And FAA funds are paying \nfor the design of a new building for aircraft rescue and firefighting \nand snow removal equipment at Pellston Regional Airport in Emmet \nCounty. These are important upgrades to Michigan airports and funding \nof many more needed improvements will make flying into and around \nMichigan safer and easier.\n  H.R. 658 will move us closer toward modernizing our air traffic \ncontrol system by building the Next Generation Air Transportation \nSystem--NextGen--of satellite-based navigation. The NextGen system will \nbe more accurate and more efficient than the current radar-based air \ntraffic control system. It will also result in significant fuel \nefficiencies and time savings by allowing aircraft to fly more direct \nroutes. This is good for the environment, good for air carriers and \ngood for the flying public.\n  I am very pleased the conference report adopted the Senate approach \nto the Essential Air Service Program--EAS--and preserves this important \nprogram rather than terminate it as the House bill would have done. The \nEAS provides rural communities with\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\naccess to the national air transportation system and is very important \nto Michigan. We have 8 communities that rely on EAS subsidies to help \nprovide them with daily commercial air service. This conference report \nmaintains the EAS program at current funding levels with some minor \nmodifications. I very strongly opposed attempts to deprive Michiganians \nliving in the less populated areas of our State of commercial air \nservice. For businesses in the affected communities, this service is an \neconomic lifeline that connects them to the web of both national and \ninternational commerce. At a time when we are doing everything we can \nto compete globally and to increase the number of jobs, cutting off \nthat access makes no sense and I am glad this conference report \nrecognizes this.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today, nearly a year after the Senate passed the FAA \nModernization and Reform Act, the Senate is being asked to adopt the \nconference report to accompany it.\n  I am pleased that the conference report does retain bipartisan \nlanguage that I worked on to protect the public's right to know under \nthe Freedom of Information Act. The Freedom of Information Act is one \nof our Nation's premier open government laws. The language included is \nintended to allow the Government to protect sensitive aviation \ninformation while still ensuring that the American public has access to \naviation-related health and safety information.\n  I am very disappointed that the conference report does not contain \nthe amendment that Senator Inhofe and I worked hard to pass when the \nbill was considered and passed by the Senate. Following passage of our \namendment in the Senate, which contained important improvements to the \nPublic Safety Officers Benefits Act--PSOB--and the Volunteer Protection \nAct, I worked with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith to \nrevise the Senate language into a bipartisan set of PSOB reforms.\n  Among these reforms, and the basis of my Senate amendment, was the \nDale Long Emergency Medical Service Providers Protection Act. This \nmeasure was prompted by the tragic death of Dale Long, a decorated \nemergency medical technician from Bennington, VT, who spent his career \nhelping his fellow Vermonters. Following Mr. Long's death, I became \naware of a gap in PSOB coverage for emergency medical responders, and \nthis amendment was designed to close that gap so that Mr. Long, and \nothers who serve as medical responders for private, non-profit \nambulance services, have the protection of the PSOB program.\n  In addition to the Dale Long measure, the agreement that Chairman \nSmith and I drafted included provisions to improve the administration \nand efficiency of the PSOB program. These reforms would have made the \nclaims process faster, easier, and fairer for those disabled in the \nline of duty, and for the surviving family members of those who lose \ntheir lives during service. I regret very much that the Conference \nCommittee decided to remove these improvements from the final version \nof the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I note that the time is just before 5 \no'clock. My distinguished Republican colleague, Senator Hutchison, is \nnot on the floor at the moment, but I do not know of nor have I heard \nof any other Members wanting to speak. I don't know that we need to do \nmuch except go ahead and vote. I don't have the power to command that. \nI see a whole lot of people up here who do, but I would just say if \nthere is anybody at the last moment who wants to speak, that is fine.\n  We have set up the vote for 5:30. I think there are a lot of our \ncolleagues who aren't going to get here until 5:30 because they are on \nairplanes that land at 5:00. So we have to take that into \nconsideration.\n  So I stand here to say that I think this is a very good bill, and I \nthink, as has been mentioned often, it is a 4-year product with hard \nwork and with an unbelievable consultation with all of the \nstakeholders, which includes all of the Members of the Senate and their \nstaffs and all of the people out in the world of aviation. We have \nspent endless hours with them, and rightly so and happily so.\n  I think there is general support in the aviation community for this \nbill. I could read a list of all of the people who do support it, the \nassociations that support it, but it would take me a long time. I hope \nvery much my colleagues will vote for this bill.\n  As I indicated, nobody got all they wanted, but that is the nature of \ncompromise. Compromise in and of itself was particularly difficult in \nthis negotiation, but we have done what we have done. It is well \nregarded. I urge my colleagues, when they do come, to vote for the \nbill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the Presiding Officer, my colleague from \nDelaware, has heard me say more than a few times that when I meet \npeople who have been married a long time, I like to ask them: What is \nthe secret to being married 50 or 60 or 70 years or more? I get some \nfunny answers. I also get some very poignant answers. Sometimes I get \nvery instructive answers. One of the best answers I have ever heard--in \nfact, I have heard it more than a few times over the years--is the key \nto a long marriage, a successful marriage is the two Cs--not Coons and \nCarper, not Coons and Carney, not Coons and Castle but communicate and \ncompromise.\n  The folks from Delaware who elect us--and people from the other 49 \nStates--are wondering: why don't we do the two Cs more here? Because \nthose two qualities--communicating and compromising--are actually not \nonly needed for a successful marriage but also for democracy to \nsucceed.\n  Today, as we prepare to vote on the conference report--a compromise--\nit is a product of a whole lot of communication from people all over \nthe country: from businesses, from air traffic controllers, from labor \nunions, from people who use airlines, to folks who are involved in \nsometimes direct or indirect ways with this legislation, but they have \nbeen communicating with us what they think we should do.\n  As we work to bring our air traffic control system into the 21st \ncentury and as we seek to fund the modernization of our airports and \nour airways, we have had to raise some money. I was privileged to serve \non the Commerce Committee for a while with our chairman Senator \nRockefeller, and forever we were trying to work out a compromise \nbetween the airlines and the general aviation community on how do we \npay for this tab so we do not run the deficit up even more. I take my \nhat off to the chairman and the others who worked on this with the key \nstakeholders to say: They are going to raise some revenues, they are \nactually going to pay some additional tax moneys to come up with the \nmoney we need to provide for better airports and, frankly, better air \ntraffic control systems--safer air traffic control systems, more \nefficient air traffic control systems. Better results? Maybe not for \nless money but better results for a little bit more money. But it has \nbeen an ongoing communication for several years and an ongoing dialog \nthat has actually led us today to a very good compromise.\n  We are often told in these jobs we talk with consultants who talk to \nus about messaging and how do we message or talk about certain things? \nOne of the things they tell us is never use the word \n``infrastructure.'' Do not use it. Don't tell your constituents we are \nworking on infrastructure. They do not know what you mean. Instead, we \nshould talk about roads, highways, and bridges. We should talk about \nrailroads. We should talk about canals or ports. We should talk about \nwater or wastewater treatment systems. We\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\nshould talk in our State about the dune system that protects our \ncoastal beaches. We should talk about dredging a channel in a place \nsuch as the Delaware Bay or the Delaware River in an environmentally \nsafe way. We should talk about levees. We should talk about the \ndeployment of broadband across our country. That is all infrastructure.\n  Do you know what else is infrastructure? Our airports, the airways, \nthe air traffic control system that is used to dispatch planes and make \nsure they go where they are supposed to go and land where they are \nsupposed to land and fly safely throughout the day and throughout the \nnight.\n  In the State of Delaware, I say to the chairman--as our Presiding \nOfficer knows--we have three counties. The largest county in Delaware \nis called Sussex County. It is the third largest county in America. The \ncounty seat of Sussex County is a place called Georgetown. Just on the \noutskirts of Georgetown--a town of several thousand people--we have an \nairport, an air park as we call it. There is an effort to try to expand \nthe length of one of the runways. One of the runways is about 3,000 \nfeet. The other is about 5,000 feet. The county, which sort of manages \nthe air park in Georgetown, would like to expand the longest runway \nfrom 5,000 to 5,500 feet or 6,000 feet.\n  Why? Because by doing that, we provide a nurturing environment by \nimproving that infrastructure--in this case, the length of the runway--\nand the navigational system, the lighting system that is associated \nwith the airport. We make it an easier place, a safer place to fly in \nand out of, and we increase the likelihood it is going to be used.\n  By whom? It is going to be used by, among other things, not just 737 \naircraft but 757s. There is a company there called PATS that works on \nairplanes, some very expensive executive jets, 737s and cargo planes \nand passenger planes. They help make sure they have larger fuel tanks \nso they can fly further safer. In some cases, they work on the insides \nof these very exclusive executive jets and tony them up and make some \nmoney doing that, and they fly all over the country, all over the \nworld. That takes place right in Sussex County, DE, at the Georgetown \nAir Park.\n  They need to increase the length of the runways. This legislation \nwill help make that possible over about a two-stage period over the \nnext maybe 18 months or so. They need, at Georgetown, to be able to \ntake out some hindrances to the safe travel of airplanes, including \nmaybe trees in some parts of the runway--the approach or the takeoff, \ndeparture side of the runway. They need to be able to put in some \nbetter navigational systems, better lighting to make sure the big \nplanes can get in and out safely. If more work can be done by PATS, \nthey can hire more people.\n  There is a guy from West Virginia whom the chairman knows well. We \nare both from West Virginia. I am a native West Virginian, and he has \nlived there and governed there and served as their Senator for a lot \nlonger than I lived there as a kid. But there is a guy there named John \nChambers, whom Senator Rockefeller knows well, whose parents are, I \nthink, still there. I think they taught maybe college, so I do not know \nif they taught at West Virginia Wesleyan when the Senator was their \npresident. But John Chambers' parents, I think, both have been \nteachers, maybe professors.\n  John Chambers runs Cisco. He started Cisco, a big technology company. \nJohn Chambers is fond of saying the jobs in the 21st century are going \nto go to the States or the nations that do two things well: No. 1, \ncreate a world-class productive workforce. People can come to work, do \na job, and do it in an efficient way using technology. The second thing \nhe says is, the jobs of the 21st century will go to places where the \ninfrastructure is world class.\n\n  With this legislation, we are going to make sure the Nation that \nstarted all this aviation with the Wright Brothers and actually got us \nnot off on the right foot but off on the right wing all those years \nago, that we are going to be in a position to reclaim that mantle and \nto again show the rest of the world how to do it right: to strengthen \nour infrastructure, bring our infrastructure into the 21st century, be \nable to fly planes safer out of airports that are better configured, \nbetter constructed, more wisely invested in communications, in \nnavigational systems, in the right length and width of our runways, and \nto make sure the folks who are controlling our aircraft are doing a \nbetter job, using all the tools in the toolbox.\n  I had a chance to fly as a naval flight officer for about 23 years--5 \nyears in a hot war and another 18 years in a cold war, until the end of \nthe Cold War with the Soviets--and I have flown in and out of a lot of \nairports, naval bases, and other military bases with my crews on Active \nDuty and Reserve Duty, and I spent a little bit of time, as the \nchairman did, as Governor of my State and as the commander and chief of \nthe Delaware National Guard. So these are issues I have actually \nthought about a whole lot, as somebody who has been in airplanes, a \nwhole lot of airplanes, over the years.\n  I feel better about the men and women who are flying airplanes in \nuniform, in flight suits going forward. I feel better with this \ninvestment in this legislation about the folks who will be flying in \ncommercial airlines, whether they are from the United States or some \nother country because of this legislation, this compromise, and I feel \nbetter about people flying in what I call those ``teeny-weenies,'' \nwhether they happen to be little Pipers or Cherokees or whatever or \nwhether they happen to be some of these real exclusive executive jets \nwe see zipping around West Virginia and Delaware and other places.\n  So it will be a safer way to travel, and it is going to be an \ninvestment that is going to help create jobs, including in Georgetown, \nDE, including in West Virginia.\n  To everybody who has been a big part of bringing us to this point, to \nour friends over in the House who were able to communicate and \ncompromise with us, to the chairman of the committee, and to our \nranking Republican on the committee who is not on the floor right now, \nI take my hat off to you for getting us to this day. This is a good \nday. This is a happy day for us in this body. I think this is a happy \nday for the United States of America. We have shown we can actually get \nsomething done that has a good and positive impact on our States and on \nour Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I do not know if there is anybody else \nwho seeks recognition. If not, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. On behalf of the minority side, I yield back the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 658.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

While \nin orbit, John Glenn performed a series of breakthrough experiments to \ntest human ability to function in the weightlessness of space. He then \nsuccessfully piloted the spacecraft manually after a malfunction in the \nautomatic flight controls, overcoming severe oscillation and a \ndwindling fuel supply during reentry, and completing the mission by \nlanding the spacecraft safely in the Atlantic Ocean 4 hours, 55 minutes \nand 23 seconds after initial launch. He returned a national hero.\n  His historic flight inspired scientific curiosity and national \nenthusiasm for further space exploration, paving the way for America's \ncontinued dominance in space operations.\n  In 1998 Senator Glenn again demonstrated his tremendous courage and \nreentered space at the age of 77, aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, \nto examine the effect of space flight on the elderly.\n  Space exploration is not, however, Senator Glenn's only remarkable \nachievement. He set the transcontinental speed record in 1957 for the \nfirst flight to average supersonic speed, flying at an average speed of \n723 miles per hour, from Los Angeles to New York. Then in 1996 Senator \nGlenn set a new record, along with co-pilot Phillip Woodruff, of an \naverage speed of 229 miles per hour in a 367-mile flight from Dayton, \nOhio to Washington, DC.\n  In addition to these contributions to scientific exploration and \nNASA, John Glenn gave 23 years of service to the U.S. Marine Corps; is \na veteran of two foreign wars; flew 149 combat missions; was awarded \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross five times; and retired a colonel in \n1965.\n  Ten years later he began a career in the U.S. Senate, contributing 24 \nyears of service as a U.S. Senator from the State of Ohio from 1975 to \n1999.\n  In 1998 the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy \nat The Ohio State University was created and Senator Glenn became an \nadjunct professor in OSU's School of Public Policy and Management in \nthe Department of Political Science.\n  Then, in 2006 the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public \nPolicy merged with the School of Public Policy and Management to form \nthe John Glenn School of Public Affairs at The Ohio State University, \nwhich prepares future generations of public servants.

Madam President, today I rise to mourn the loss of a \ngreat American veteran and a musical legend in Kentucky's own signature \ngenre, bluegrass.\n  Mr. Kenny Baker of Letcher County passed away in July of 2011. He was \n85 years old. Although Mr. Baker is no longer with us, his monumental \ncontribution to the musical world will remain for many years to come.\n  Mr. Baker was most widely known for his innovative style of fiddle \nplaying that many have referred to as ``long bow fiddling.'' He would \nuse every inch of the bow, from tip to tip, to produce a sound unlike \nany other in the world of bluegrass music. Mr. Baker picked up the \nfiddle at the young age of 5 years old and went on to write an \nastonishing 92 musical numbers throughout his lifetime.\n  He enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was assigned to \na destroyer escort ship in the Pacific theater. But once the Navy \nlearned of his musical ability, he was quickly transferred from his \nstation to entertain troops in the South Pacific. After honorable \nservice to his country in the Armed Forces, Mr. Baker returned to \nLetcher County and found work in the coal industry of eastern Kentucky \nbut his musical journey was far from over.\n  Kenny Baker started playing the fiddle professionally in 1953 and \nplayed in the company of musical greats such as Don Gibson, Bobby \nOsborne, Josh Graves, and famous bluegrass innovator Bill Monroe. After \ntaking a few years to get acquainted with the world of the music \nindustry, he finally settled down and found a permanent home in the \nband Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.\n  On Mr. Baker's extensive musical journey, he regularly played at the \nGrand Ole Opry, recorded hit albums, played numerous concerts, and even \nhad the distinct honor to play the fiddle for President Jimmy Carter at \nthe White House. However, his greatest achievement came when he was \nnamed to the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1999.\n  Mr. Baker spent his final years teaching children the value and \nimportance of music in their lives. His generosity and love for music \nand music education will be greatly missed, not only by his wife Audrey \nBaker; his sons, Johnny Lee and Kenneth Junior; and many other beloved \nfamily members and friends, but also by generations of fans and fans to \ncome of bluegrass music, as well as the residents of the great \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.\n  So, Mr. President, I would like to ask that my Senate colleagues join \nme in honoring Mr. Kenny Baker not only for his service to our country \nbut also for his great contributions to the creative field of music. \nThe Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article recognizing \nMr. Baker's incredible life. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, July 12, 2011]\n\n                              Kenny Baker\n\n                         (By Jennifer Hewlett)\n\n       When Kenny Baker played the fiddle, the notes flowed out \n     like honey pours from a jar--smooth, thick and wide, \n     according to his friends.\n       ``All your great fiddle players in Nashville, when they \n     heard Kenny, they knew there was a lot more to be had with a \n     fiddle, a lot more to learn.'' said Ronnie Eldridge, a close \n     friend.\n       ``He was the best at hoedowns. Nobody could touch him on \n     the waltz. He was a singer's dream.'' Eldridge said.\n       Mr. Baker, 85, a Letcher County native who spent many years \n     performing with legendary bluegrass musician Bill Monroe, \n     penned 92 instrumentals and tutored many others in his ``long \n     bow'' fiddling style, died Friday, just a few days after his \n     last jam session. Mr. Baker, who lived near Gallatin, Tenn., \n     died of complications from a stroke.\n       Mr. Baker first picked up a fiddle when he was 5, according \n     to his son, Kenneth Baker Jr. of Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Baker's \n     father had been an old-time fiddle player.\n       Mr. Baker later turned to the guitar, but he eventually \n     went back to the fiddle. He grew up inspired by jazz, his son \n     said.\n       After joining the Navy during World War II, Mr. Baker was \n     soon transferred off a destroyer escort ship to entertain \n     troops in the South Pacific. After military service, he \n     returned home to Letcher County, got married, worked in coal \n     mines and played at barn dances on weekends.\n       He started playing the fiddle professionally with country \n     musician Don Gibson. In 1953, Mr. Baker went from playing \n     Western swing and dance-band tunes to bluegrass music, \n     performing with Monroe, who is known as the father of \n     bluegrass music, beginning in 1957. After a few years, he \n     went back to the coal mines in eastern Kentucky. He returned \n     to Monroe's Blue Grass Boys band in 1968 and left again in \n     1984, but he was reunited with the band in 1994 at Monroe's \n     Bean Blossom bluegrass festival.\n       Monroe's well-known ``Uncle Pen'' album features Mr. Baker \n     on the fiddle.\n       ``He was just absolutely the backbone of that band,'' \n     Eldridge said.\n       ``They were at the White House one time. Bill Monroe's \n     group was invited by Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter,'' \n     Kenneth Baker Jr. said. ``He liked to say when Rosalynn had a \n     request, she came to Dad.''\n       Many people went to bluegrass music festivals to hear Kenny \n     Baker play the fiddle as much as they went to hear Bill \n     Monroe sing, bluegrass music great Bobby Osborne said.\n       Many great fiddlers, past and present, are indebted to \n     Baker, said Osborne, who performed with Mr. Baker and shared \n     a dressing room with him at the Grand Ole Opry.\n       ``I couldn't single him out as the top player of all time, \n     but a lot of people would,'' Osborne said.\n       Mr. Baker's son said technique and a great memory made his \n     father stand out.\n       ``Dad would use the bow from tip to tip. That made his \n     fiddling so smooth, and that was something different in the \n     bluegrass world,'' Kenneth Baker Jr. said. ``It was all by \n     ear, and he had a tremendous ability to recall just about any \n     song that people asked for--hundreds of songs.''\n       Mr. Baker was particularly proud of the songs he wrote and \n     recorded, his son said.\n       ``At any of the major fiddle contests, probably a third of \n     the tunes played will be Bill Baker tunes,'' Eldridge said.\n       Said Osborne: ``The tunes that he wrote, they were so down \n     to earth. The melodies that he put to his tunes were so easy \n     to learn.''\n       After 1984, Mr. Baker performed in many shows with dobro \n     great Josh Graves.\n       In 1993, Mr. Baker received a National Heritage Fellowship \n     from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1999, he was \n     named to the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in \n     Owensboro.\n       In addition to his son, Mr. Baker is survived by his wife, \n     Audrey Baker; another son, Johnny Lee Baker of Nashville; two \n     sisters; a brother; four grandchildren; and several great- \n     and great-great-grandchildren.\n       Services will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Burdine Freewill \n     Baptist Church in Letcher County. Carty Funeral Homes in \n     Jenkins is handling arrangements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S345-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S345-S346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise to join my fellow \nColoradans, my colleagues in the U.S. Congress and others across the \nNation to celebrate Black History Month. I am honored to recognize the \ncontributions of the African-American community in the United States \nand especially in my home State of Colorado.\n  I am particularly proud to reflect on the legacy of community \ninvolvement exemplified by Colorado's Black community, from Colorado's \nearliest days as a western territory to the present. There have been \nmany community leaders, public officials, and entrepreneurs who have \ncontributed immensely over the years to make our great State what it is \ntoday, from our historic and cultural institutions, to the farms and \nsmall businesses of our rural communities.\n  One gentleman named James Beckwourth, whom I have recognized in \nprevious years as a true frontiersmen, exemplifies the entrepreneurial \nspirit that led to the building of the economic foundations that \nsupported the formation of our great State. He led expeditions into \nColorado's Rocky Mountains in the 1820s and returned in the 1830s to \nserve at Fort Vasquez near Denver. In the 1840s, he co-founded a \ntrading post and settlement named Fort Pueblo to serve as a trading hub \nfor the Native Americans, Mexican settlers and other American \nfrontiersmen along the Santa Fe Trail. This settlement eventually \nbecame the City of Pueblo and still serves as a commercial hub for \nSoutheast Colorado.\n  Mr. Beckwourth exemplifies the entrepreneurship that continues to \nthrive in all of Colorado's African-American communities. Today, I \nwould like to specifically recognize the importance of the continuation \nof the entrepreneurial spirit in Black communities throughout Colorado \nand share how much it has strengthened Colorado's economy and will \ncontinue to help lead our country on the path to economic recovery.\n  The increase in the number of minority-owned businesses has been a \nbright spot in our economy. According to the Minority Business \nDevelopment Agency (MBDA), operated by the Department of Commerce, \nminority-owned businesses contributed $1 trillion to the economy last \nyear and created 5.8 million jobs. Specifically, the total number of \nAfrican-American owned businesses grew to 1.9 million firms between \n2002 and 2007, an increase of 61 percent. This figure is particularly \nimpressive when compared to the employment growth in the rest of the \ncountry during that same time period, which was less than 1 percent.\n  In Colorado, the total number of minority-owned firms increased by 19 \npercent between 1997 and 2002. By 2007, this figure had increased even \nfurther as there were over 59,000 firms, employing over 74,000 workers, \nand the numbers continue to grow. African-American-owned businesses are \nan important part of this driving force in our State's economy. Along \nwith all other minority-owned businesses, the increase in African-\nAmerican owned businesses in Colorado has helped sustain our economy \nand stimulate job growth. The most recent data show there are more than \n9,000 African-American-owned businesses in Colorado. These businesses \nare especially valued in Colorado because they not only provide jobs to \nColoradans, they also provide essential services that meet the needs of \nboth African-American and non-African-American communities. And as we \nknow, successful businesses have a positive economic ripple effect \nthroughout our communities.\n  In spite of the rising number of minority-owned businesses in \nColorado, barriers to success still exist, and in some cases the \nchallenges facing minority-owned businesses can be particularly \ndifficult. This is why I was proud to welcome the creation of the \nDenver Minority Business Center last summer. The Denver Minority \nBusiness Center is an extension of the Minority Business Development \nAgency, and will further supplement our State's commitment to \nsupporting minority owned businesses by providing the resources to \ndevelop technical skills and to access capital and contracting \nopportunities. Within the last 3 years alone the MBDA has helped create \n11,000 new jobs nationally and helped save thousands of existing jobs \nat minority-owned firms by helping secure $7 billion in contracts.\n  As we celebrate the diverse and profound contributions of African-\nAmericans to our State, I hope we will remember to appreciate the \npositive and sustaining impact of African-American owned businesses, \nand I hope we will continue to support the creation of new minority \nowned businesses in all corners of our State. I encourage all \nColoradans to join me in reflecting on the invaluable contributions of \nAfrican Americans to our State and throughout our great Nation--not \nonly during Black History Month, but every month of the year.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I wish to recognize February as Black \nHistory Month. Each February our Nation focuses on the contributions \nAfrican Americans have made in shaping our Nation. This year, the \nAssociation\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\nfor the Study of African American Life and History has declared the \ntheme for 2012: ``Black Women In American Culture and History.''\n  Each year since 1976, the President issues an executive proclamation \nnaming February as African American History Month. More than a half \ndozen Federal agencies, including the Library of Congress, conduct \ncelebrations, programs, and activities relating to this rich history.\n  I join them in recognizing the importance of remembering the \ncontributions made by such memorable figures as Rosa Parks, Shirley \nChisholm, Sojourner Truth and Maya Angelou just to name a few, and our \ncountry's initial African-American First Lady, Michelle Obama.\n  Just as importantly, countless unsung African-American women have \nmade a mark in their communities by caring for their families, teaching \nour youth, running successful businesses, serving their churches, and \ngetting elected to public office.\n  Many African Americans spent their entire lives without getting the \ncredit they deserved. By focusing on Black history in February, we can \ngive overdue acknowledgement and perhaps inspire our young African \nAmericans to continue to achieve greatness.\n  In Alaska, African Americans have worked to build our communities \nwith their many contributions.\n  I urge all Alaskans and other Americans to examine and contemplate \nthe significance of the contributions that African-American men and \nwomen have made in determining the course of these United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S346-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S346-S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING KING ARTHUR FLOUR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention the recent accomplishments of King Arthur Flour of Norwich, \nVT.\n  Established in 1790, King Arthur Flour has stood the test of time as \nthe oldest flour company in the United States. Over the years King \nArthur Flour has continued to raise the bar as an outstanding Vermont \ncompany. Most recently the company redesigned its website to allow for \neasier mobile phone and tablet use, placing it in the Hot 100 feature \nof Internet Retailer magazine. This continued focus on technology is \npropelling King Arthur Flour into the future as a cutting-edge company \nto watch.\n  As the company has continued to grow and succeed, it has managed to \nstay true to its Vermont roots. King Arthur Flour has flourished as an \nemployee stock ownership company (ESOP), a model of business \nstewardship that highlights a strong commitment to the company's \nworkforce and the local community. I also appreciate that King Arthur \nFlour has been a long-time participant in the annual Taste of Vermont \nevent in Washington, where we bring the finest Vermont products to the \nNation's capital.\n  I wish King Arthur Flour the best of luck as it continues to grow \nboth its web presence with new technology and its physical presence \nwith a major expansion project set to open this summer. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a December 22, 2011, Burlington Free Press article \nhighlighting the company's achievements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 22, 2011]\n\n                       A (Web) Recipe for Success\n\n                           (By Stephen Mills)\n\n       Norwich.--King Arthur Flour is America's oldest flour \n     company, established 1790, a year into George Washington's \n     presidency.\n       So how does a company that makes flour and bread--an \n     ancient art--win national awards and acclaim for its business \n     practices in the 21st century?\n       Quite simply, the company has become the toast of the town \n     among the technocrati of e-commerce.\n       With the economy flagging, many companies turned to \n     enhanced e-retailing to capture more sales, offering free \n     shipping and additional savings for shopping online. King \n     Arthur Flour is no different, relying heavily on its website, \n     kingarthurflour.com, to sell its products and services that \n     can also be found at its ``Norwich, Vermont bakery, school \n     and store''--a sponsorship refrain often heard on Vermont \n     Public Radio, which also calls it ``home'' for its company-\n     sponsored studio there.\n       But to maximize online sales, King Arthur Flour redesigned \n     its website to allow its offerings to be displayed on any-\n     size screen, including phone, tablet or desktop. And it did \n     so without having to write exotic or expensive software \n     programs for each device.\n       Company online services director Halley Silver explains: \n     ``Our previous site used a template that was 780 pixels wide. \n     We have moved to a template that adapts its layout from 320 \n     pixels wide to 992 pixels wide. This is called a responsive \n     website design. It's not a mobile application, but rather a \n     mobile-friendly website.\n       ``We have built a new website that works well across mobile \n     devices and tablet computers, as well as desktops and \n     laptops,'' Silver added. ``We have seen strong growth in \n     mobile and tablet traffic to our site, and also realize that \n     having a usable site while shoppers use their phones in the \n     supermarket and tablets in the kitchen is critical to our \n     success online.''\n       The result has been explosive mobile sales growth for the \n     company by shoppers using hand-held smartphones and tablets, \n     up 14 percent in September compared with just 2 percent for \n     the comparable month last year. The sales spike was 5 percent \n     from tablets such as iPads, and 9 percent from mobile phones.\n       The company's success compares favorably with online sales \n     figures just out for all retailers showing a 15 percent \n     increase over Thanksgiving, the nation's busiest shopping \n     period, compared with last year, and even better than those \n     for mobile devices, which increased 7.4 percent, according to \n     data from IBM Benchmark.\n       Company CEO Steve Voigt said: ``I have long been a big \n     supporter of online efforts and it is very encouraging to see \n     all the success which our customers and we enjoy by our \n     efforts to-date. . . . Baking seems custom-made for the \n     online community; a little online chat, then a little offline \n     baking.''\n\n\n                              Net royalty\n\n       Voigt is demur about the company's financial success, \n     noting figures for the private company are ``confidential.'' \n     But according to the Internet Retailer Top 500 Guide, King \n     Arthur Flour reported online sales of $15.15 million in 2010. \n     Voigt did say the company has $96 million in annual revenues \n     for the most recent fiscal year.\n       Internet Retailer magazine, a leading tracker of e-\n     commerce, picked the company for its Hot 100 feature in the \n     December issue. The Hot 100 are not ranked but represent the \n     nation's the most interesting innovations in online retailing \n     this year.\n       Under the article heading, ``Mobile Drives Design,'' the \n     publication notes: ``Founded in 1790, baking ingredient and \n     bakeware retailer King Arthur Flour is both the oldest brand \n     in this year's Internet Retailer Hot 100 and one of the most \n     forward-looking.''\n       The article added, ``King Arthur's `mobile first' approach \n     to Web design exemplifies an elegant solution to Web \n     merchants'' growing challenge of designing for multiple \n     access devices.''\n       Internet Retailer also has asked Silver to be a featured \n     speaker at its annual Internet Retailer Web Design and \n     Usability Conference 2012 in Orlando, Fla., in February. It \n     refers to her as King Arthur's ``secret ingredient'' who \n     ``mixes common sense with tech know-how.''\n       As Silver said she will explain in the session she'll call, \n     ``The Mobile-First Approach to Web Multi-Platform Design,'' \n     one key element in the redesigned site is the use of a Web \n     design language called CSS3 (cascading style sheets) that \n     presents images and product information differently depending \n     on the visitor's device and browser.\n       ``For a small company, King Arthur Flour is a very \n     innovative retailer,'' magazine editor Don Davis said in a \n     phone interview. Of Silver, he said, ``She is someone who is \n     as innovative as anyone at Amazon for the cool stuff they're \n     doing.\n       ``One of the things that's so impressive is that she's \n     extremely knowledgeable about the intricacies of e-commerce \n     and Web technology, an area that's constantly changing, while \n     at the same time has a grasp of her company's business \n     goals,'' Davis said. ``It's not that often you find \n     someone fluent in the language of bits and bytes who also \n     understands the overarching importance of the bottom \n     line.''\n       How does Silver feel about all the attention she's \n     receiving?\n       ``I still am somewhat amazed that a company selling flour \n     and ingredients online can be seen as an inspiration and used \n     as an example to other online retailers,'' she said.\n\n\n                          Building visibility\n\n       Other online innovations Silver has brought to the company \n     include:\n       two website redesigns.\n       a 55 percent increase in completed checkout sales after \n     adding items to the cart by streamlining the process and \n     offering further discounts for additional items.\n       tools that help website designers face the difficult \n     challenge of displaying multiple fonts while sticking with a \n     site's branded look.\n       the launch of the Bakers' Banter Blog.\n       This year, 32 videos were also posted to the website to \n     help customers better-appreciate the ``farm-to-plate'' \n     relationship with mostly Midwestern farmers who supply much \n     of the grain for King Arthur's flours.\n       Born in Cleveland and raised in New York City, London and \n     San Francisco and eventually Vermont, Silver was a math major \n     at Wesleyan University. She moved through a number of posts \n     centered on Web technology, including the former Internet \n     shopping\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\n     search portal Excite@Home, and Internet security firm \n     VeriSign. She also built and launched Hoofpicks.com, a free, \n     Web-based, equestrian-event management service.\n       She joined King Arthur Flour in 2007 because of her passion \n     for baking. ``Cooking and baking have been a hobby of mine \n     since a very early age,'' she said. ``To be able to combine \n     that passion with building for the Web has been a wonderful \n     experience.''\n       What else is in the offing for the company online?\n       ``We hope to expand our presence in the mobile and tablet \n     space, and continue to improve all of our offerings online,'' \n     she said.\n       One new development is a Google ad about the company, \n     filmed in October that began airing Nov. 27. A longer version \n     of the ad is available only on YouTube at: http://\nwww.youtube.com/watch&?v=nzjcA2a \n     WILo=channel_video_title.\n       Collectively, Silver and the 255 workers at the employee-\n     owned business have won a host of awards that include: the \n     2011 Vermont Governor's Award for Outstanding Workplace \n     Safety in the Large Business category; the 2011 Magnus Opus \n     Awards for its bi-monthly newsletter, The Baking Sheet; the \n     2007 Business Innovator of the Year Award from the Hanover \n     Area Chamber of Commerce; the 2006 Outstanding Vermont \n     Business Award; the 2006 Best Place to Work Award; and the \n     2006 Better Business Bureau Local Torch Award for Excellence.\n       The company is also one of the nation's few to attain B-\n     Corporation status because of its beneficial balance between \n     ``people, planet and profit.''\n       Some of the many ways it does so is through donating to \n     local food shelves within a 100-mile radius; the Life Skills \n     Bread Baking Program for 155,000-plus students nationwide, \n     teaching them to bake bread themselves and for the hungry; a \n     corporate volunteer program that provides paid time-off for \n     employees as volunteers in the community (in 2010, 123 \n     employees volunteered 1,075 hours); annual employee \n     participation in Green Up Vermont Day; Winterbake, when \n     employees bake bread for donation to local food pantries \n     annually on the Martin Luther King, Jr. day of service; a \n     food-diversion program that donates old baking products to \n     local farmers for animal feed or composting; the use of eco-\n     friendly certified cleaners in all company facilities and \n     available to employees for home use at $1 per bottle; and \n     participation in the Bike/Walk to Work Day program.\n\n\n                             Living history\n\n       The company has come a long way from its origins. King \n     Arthur Flour began in 1790 as the Sands Taylor & Wood Co., a \n     retailer of specialty flours and cookbooks and baked goods, \n     based in Boston.\n       Founded by Henry Wood, primarily an importer and \n     distributor of English-milled flour, the business grew \n     quickly. A partner, Benjamin Franklin Sands, took over the \n     company in 1870, and in 1886, the firm introduced a premium \n     brand of flour.\n       At that time, a partner attended a performance of the \n     musical ``King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table'' \n     that inspired the name of the new product, King Arthur Flour \n     (and its current logo). The brand was introduced at the \n     Boston Food Fair on Sept. 10, 1896, to great fanfare.\n       Subsequently, during ownership changes, retail flour sales \n     declined, and the company expanded into commercial baking \n     equipment in the 1960s, and other retail products, including \n     a line of coffee and prepared pie fillings. In 1978, the \n     company sold its other interests and returned to a core flour \n     business, and moved to Norwich in 1984.\n       Today, new things are cooking at the company.\n       The Norwich site is undergoing massive changes, with the \n     expansion of the bakery (to 3,400 square feet), baking \n     education center (3,400 square feet), store (4,700 square \n     feet), and cafe (2,200 square feet with seating for 75). The \n     offsite administration offices and recipe-testing center will \n     also be housed under the same roof, and continue to be \n     affectionately known as Camelot. Also offsite nearby is the \n     manufacturing center, known as Avalon. Begun in June, the \n     work will be completed in July. Artist renderings of the new \n     digs, work progress and historic detail about the company can \n     be found at www.kingarthurflour.com/ourstore/\nrenovations.html.\n       The company could certainly use the space, officials said. \n     Business was booming one day a few weeks ago, with shoppers \n     packed into the store all day long, looking for seasonal \n     comestibles, while the cafe did a brisk trade in fresh \n     pastries and coffee. ``This is our peak season, with \n     Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas,'' public relations \n     coordinator Terri Rosenstock said.\n       Across the courtyard, bakers were busy making bread, pizza \n     and croissants, and the baking school was fully booked for a \n     pastry class.\n       ``We have a lot of people with pie-crust and yeast anxiety \n     right now,'' quipped the instructor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S347-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR.

Dr. \nPaul Taylor of Fairbanks, AK, while serving as a member of the United \nStates Army Special Forces in the Republic of Vietnam, risked his life \non January 17, 1967, to save a wounded soldier and prevent the further \ndemise of American forces.\n  While under heavy attack, Staff Sergeant Taylor and a fellow soldier \nled a direct charge on the enemy position and both sustained serious \ninjuries. After dragging his wounded comrade to safety, Staff Sergeant \nTaylor continued to lead the attack on the enemy until the platoon \ncould retreat to a secure helicopter landing zone.\n  Staff Sergeant Taylor's decorations from his service in Vietnam \ninclude a Bronze Star with ``V'' device, Silver Star, three Purple \nHearts, and the Army Commendation medal.\n  It is with great honor and humility that I, along with the United \nStates Army, on February 4, 2012 will recognize Dr. Taylor with the \npresentation of a Silver Star with a Single Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for \nthis action. Although this recognition is 45 years after the fact, Dr. \nTaylor's actions and sacrifice shall not be forgotten by Alaskans and \nall Americans as the memory is still alive with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S347-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING COLEMAN DAIRY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

Coleman Dairy is an excellent example of a homegrown \nbusiness that continues its service and commitment to providing the \nbest quality products that are just as important as the excellent \npeople employed by the company.\n  Small businesses are the building blocks of our economy. They provide \nimportant services, products, and employment opportunities while \nsharing an identity with the community and the values of its employees. \nThere is no better company that exemplifies being a leader on this \nfront than Coleman Dairy.\n  Coleman Dairy has grown since Eleithet Coleman began the business in \n1862. Through the generations the family has continued his vision, \nwhere hard work, honesty and customer service remain top priorities.\n  This year Coleman Dairy is celebrating 150 years of providing dairy \nproducts to Americans. As one of the 100 oldest family-run businesses \nin America, Coleman Dairy has a track record of success and I am \nconfident will continue to provide high-quality products for customers \nwho deserve the very best.\n  Thank you for providing us a quality product all these years. \nCongratulations on 150 years and best of luck on the next 150.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S347-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S347-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S347-5", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S347-S348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n   IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13396 ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, WITH RESPECT TO THE \n          SITUATION IN OR IN RELATION TO COTE D'IVOIRE--PM 38\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\nfor the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, within \n90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

(CISADA), I issued \nExecutive Order 13553 on September 28, 2010, to impose sanctions on \nofficials of the Government of Iran and other persons acting on behalf \nof the Government of Iran determined to be responsible for or complicit \nin certain serious human rights abuses. To take further additional \nsteps with respect to the threat posed by Iran and to provide \nimplementing authority for a number of the sanctions set forth in the \nIran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172) (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) \n(ISA), as amended by CISADA, I issued Executive Order 13574 on May 23, \n2011, to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to implement \ncertain sanctions imposed by the Secretary of State pursuant to ISA, as \namended by CISADA. Finally, to take additional steps with respect to \nthe threat posed by Iran, I issued Executive Order 13590 on November \n20, 2011, to authorize the Secretary of State to impose sanctions on \npersons providing certain goods, services, technology, information, or \nsupport that contribute either to Iran's development of petroleum \nresources or to Iran's production of petrochemicals, and to authorize \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to implement some of those sanctions.\n\n  I have determined that additional sanctions are warranted, \nparticularly in light of the deceptive practices of the Central Bank of \nIran and other Iranian banks to conceal transactions of sanctioned \nparties, the deficiencies in Iran's anti-money laundering regime and \nthe weaknesses in its implementation, and the continuing and \nunacceptable risk posed to the international financial system by Iran's \nactivities.\n  The order also implements section 1245(c) of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81) (NDAA) by \nblocking the property and interests in property of Iranian financial \ninstitutions pursuant to IEEPA.\n  The order blocks the property and interests in property of the \nfollowing:\n  The Government of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran;\n  Any Iranian financial institution, including the Central Bank of \nIran; and\n  Persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, to be owned or controlled by, or to have \nacted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, \nany person whose property and interests in property are blocked \npursuant to the order.\n  The prohibitions of the order do not apply to property and interests \nin property of the Government of Iran that were blocked pursuant to \nExecutive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979, and thereafter made subject \nto the transfer directives set forth in Executive Order 12281 of \nJanuary 19, 1981, and implementing regulations thereunder. In addition, \nnothing in the order prohibits transactions for the conduct of the \nofficial business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or \ncontractors thereof.\n  I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \npowers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry \nout the blocking-related purposes of the order. All agencies of the \nUnited States Government are directed to take all appropriate measures \nwithin their authority to carry out the provisions of the order.\n  I have also delegated certain functions and authorities conferred by \nsection 1245 of the NDAA to the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nSecretary of State in consultation with other appropriate agencies as \nspecified in the order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 5, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S348-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3578.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington requesting the adoption of federal \n     legislation relative to sellers, regardless of nexus, \n     collecting states' sales tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n               Substitute Senate Joint Memorial No. 8009\n\n       To the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United \n     States, and to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, and to the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled:\n       We, your Memorialists, the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the State of Washington, in legislative \n     session assembled, respectfully represent and petition as \n     follows:\n       Whereas, The 1967 Bellas Hess and the 1992 Quill United \n     States Supreme Court decisions denied states the authority to \n     require the collection of sales and use taxes by out-of-state \n     sellers that have no physical presence in the taxing state; \n     and\n       Whereas, This puts local, in-state sellers, whether \n     electronic or brick and mortar, at a competitive disadvantage \n     in making sales, because they must collect the sales tax and \n     most remote sellers do not collect sales tax; and\n       Whereas, The combined weight of the inability to collect \n     sales and use taxes on remote sales through traditional \n     carriers and the tax erosion due to electronic commerce \n     threatens the future viability of the sales\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\n     tax as a stable revenue source for state and local \n     governments; and\n       Whereas, The following federal legislation has been \n     introduced in the United States Congress to grant states the \n     authority to require all sellers, regardless of nexus, to \n     collect those states' sales and use taxes:\n       (1) The Main Street Fairness Act of 2011 (S. 1452 sponsored \n     by Senators Richard Durbin, Daniel Akaka, Daniel Inouye, Tim \n     Johnson, Jack Reed, and Sheldon Whitehouse; and H.R. 2701 \n     sponsored by Representatives John Conyers, Jr., Michael \n     Capuano, Jesse Jackson, Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr., Heath \n     Shuler, Adam Smith, and Peter Welch);\n       (2) The Marketplace Fairness Act of 2011 (S. 1832 sponsored \n     by Senators Michael Enzi, Lamar Alexander, Roy Blunt, John \n     Boozman, Bob Corker, Richard Durbin, Tim Johnson, Mark Pryor, \n     Jack Reed, and Sheldon Whitehouse); and\n       (3) The Marketplace Equity Act of 2011 (H.R. 3179 sponsored \n     by Steve Womack, Michael Capuano, Judy Chu, Eric A. ``Rick'' \n     Crawford, Theodore E. Deutch, Mario Diaz-Balart, John J. \n     Duncan Jr., Renee L. Ellmers, Gene Green, Carolyn B. Maloney, \n     Betty McCollum, Brad Miller, Kristi L. Noem, Ted Poe, Dennis \n     Ross, Heath Shuler, Jackie Speier, and Peter Welch); and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that Washington would realize up \n     to $170.3 million in state and local taxes in the 2011-2013 \n     biennium, and $483.0 million in state and local taxes in the \n     2013-2015 biennium, if it had the ability to require remote \n     sellers to collect our state's sales and use taxes; and\n       Whereas, Since 1999, state legislators, governors, local \n     elected officials, state tax administrators, and \n     representatives of the private sector have worked to develop \n     a Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Collection System for the \n     21st century; and\n       Whereas, On November 12, 2002, state delegates unanimously \n     ratified the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, which \n     substantially simplifies state and local sales tax systems, \n     removes the burdens to interstate commerce that were of \n     concern to the Supreme Court, protects state sovereignty, and \n     is consistent with the introduced federal legislation; and\n       Whereas, The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement \n     provides the states with a blueprint to create a simplified \n     and more uniform sales and use tax collection system that \n     when implemented, allows justification for Congress to \n     overturn the Bellas Hess and Quill decisions; and\n       Whereas, Washington State enacted legislation in 2007 to \n     bring this state's sales and use tax statutes into compliance \n     with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement; and\n       Whereas, By November 30, 2011, 24 states: Arkansas, \n     Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, \n     Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, \n     North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, \n     Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, \n     Wisconsin, and Wyoming, representing over 40 percent of the \n     total population of the United States enacted legislation to \n     bring their state's sales and use tax statutes into \n     compliance with the Agreement; and\n       Whereas, Over 1,700 businesses have voluntarily registered \n     under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement to collect \n     and remit sales and use taxes; and\n       Whereas, The legislature of Washington and our colleagues \n     in the other states have shown the resolve to acknowledge the \n     complexities of the current sales and use tax collection \n     system, have worked with the business community to formulate \n     a truly simplified and streamlined collection system, and \n     have shown the political will to enact the necessary changes \n     to make the streamlined collection system the law; and\n       Whereas, Until Congress and the President enact federal \n     legislation, participation by remote sellers is only \n     voluntary and thus states are unlikely to close the revenue \n     gap between what is owed on remote transactions and what is \n     collected; and\n       Whereas, Governors and state legislatures have made the \n     difficult choices to reduce spending and where necessary to \n     raise revenue during the recent ``great'' recession to close \n     the $417 billion cumulative budget gaps; and\n       Whereas, After closing $417 billion in budget gaps for \n     fiscal years 2009-2011, the estimated budget shortfall for \n     states in fiscal year 2012 will be $82 billion and for fiscal \n     year 2013 will be $67 billion; and\n       Whereas, Federal legislation would provide fiscal relief \n     for the states by enabling collections of taxes that are \n     already due;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that: \n     The members of our congressional delegation join as \n     cosponsors of the introduced federal legislation and support \n     the Act's swift adoption by the Congress of the United \n     States; and that President Barack Obama sign the legislation, \n     upon its passage by Congress. Be it\n       Resolved. That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S350-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY, from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 1408.

Res. 368\n\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 \n     on the Richter scale struck the country of Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Geological Survey, \n     the epicenter of the earthquake was located approximately 15 \n     miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the Government of Haiti, more than \n     220,000 people died as a result of the earthquake, and more \n     than 300,000 people were injured;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations and the \n     International Organization for Migration an estimated \n     3,000,000 people, or nearly \\1/3\\ of the population of Haiti \n     were directly affected by the disaster, and an estimated \n     1,500,000 people were displaced from their homes;\n       Whereas a Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the \n     Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the World Bank, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, and other experts, estimated \n     that damage and economic losses totaled $7,800,000,000, which \n     amounted to approximately 120 percent of the gross domestic \n     product of Haiti in 2009;\n       Whereas the response of the United States Government, led \n     by the United States Agency for International Development and \n     United States Southern Command, was swift and resolute;\n       Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic \n     organizations throughout the United States and the \n     international community responded to the crisis by supporting \n     Haiti and its people through innovative\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\n     ways, such as fundraising through text messaging;\n       Whereas the Haitian diaspora in the United States was \n     integral to emergency relief efforts and continues to make \n     significant financial contributions to Haiti and seeks \n     opportunities to participate in the rebuilding of Haiti;\n       Whereas the International Organization for Migration \n     estimates that approximately 550,000 people remain in \n     spontaneous and organized camps in Haiti;\n       Whereas, at the time of the January 2010 earthquake, Haiti \n     was the poorest, least developed country in the Western \n     Hemisphere, and more than 70 percent of the population in \n     Haiti lived on less than $2 per day;\n       Whereas, before the earthquake, Haiti was making \n     encouraging improvement in recovering from a catastrophic \n     series of hurricanes and tropical storms, food shortages, \n     rising commodity prices, and political instability;\n       Whereas, in January 21, 2010, the Senate adopted by \n     unanimous consent Senate Resolution 392 (111th Congress), \n     expressing its profound sympathy and unwavering support for \n     the people of Haiti and urging all nations to commit to \n     assisting the people of Haiti with their long-term needs;\n       Whereas, on October 19, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was \n     detected in the lower Artibonite region of Haiti, which \n     according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and \n     Population had affected more than 500,000 people and caused \n     the death of more than 6,700 people nationwide by November \n     30, 2011;\n       Whereas, as of December 2011, the United States Government \n     had provided technical assistance and contributed more than \n     $73,000,000 in purified drinking water, soap, and oral \n     rehydration salts to combat the spread of cholera in Haiti;

and\n       (6) encourages the United States Government, the Government \n     of Haiti, and international donors--\n       (A) to give priority to policies that would enhance the \n     ability of the Government of Haiti to attract private sector \n     investment and meaningful diaspora participation, including \n     judicial reform, civil registry, enterprise fund, and land \n     tenure reform;\n       (B) to develop, improve, and scale-up communications and \n     participatory mechanisms to more substantially involve civil \n     society in Haiti at all stages of the cholera and post-\n     earthquake responses;

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 368, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 368) recognizing the anniversary of \n     the tragic earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010, honoring \n     those who lost their lives in the earthquake, and expressing \n     continued solidarity with the people of Haiti.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that there be no intervening action \nor debate; and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 368) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 368\n\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 \n     on the Richter scale struck the country of Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Geological Survey, \n     the epicenter of the earthquake was located approximately 15 \n     miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the Government of Haiti, more than \n     220,000 people died as a result of the earthquake, and more \n     than 300,000 people were injured;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations and the \n     International Organization for Migration an estimated \n     3,000,000 people, or nearly \\1/3\\ of the population of Haiti \n     were directly affected by the disaster, and an estimated \n     1,500,000 people were displaced from their homes;\n       Whereas a Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the \n     Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the World Bank, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, and other experts, estimated \n     that damage and economic losses totaled $7,800,000,000, which \n     amounted to approximately 120 percent of the gross domestic \n     product of Haiti in 2009;\n       Whereas the response of the United States Government, led \n     by the United States Agency for International Development and \n     United States Southern Command, was swift and resolute;\n       Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic \n     organizations throughout the United States and the \n     international community responded to the crisis by supporting \n     Haiti and its people through innovative ways, such as \n     fundraising through text messaging;\n       Whereas the Haitian diaspora in the United States was \n     integral to emergency relief efforts and continues to make \n     significant financial contributions to Haiti and seeks \n     opportunities to participate in the rebuilding of Haiti;\n       Whereas the International Organization for Migration \n     estimates that approximately 550,000 people remain in \n     spontaneous and organized camps in Haiti;\n       Whereas, at the time of the January 2010 earthquake, Haiti \n     was the poorest, least developed country in the Western \n     Hemisphere, and more than 70 percent of the population in \n     Haiti lived on less than $2 per day;\n       Whereas, before the earthquake, Haiti was making \n     encouraging improvement in recovering from a catastrophic \n     series of hurricanes and tropical storms, food shortages, \n     rising commodity prices, and political instability;\n       Whereas, in January 21, 2010, the Senate adopted by \n     unanimous consent Senate Resolution 392 (111th Congress), \n     expressing its profound sympathy and unwavering support for \n     the people of Haiti and urging all nations to commit to \n     assisting the people of Haiti with their long-term needs;\n       Whereas, on October 19, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was \n     detected in the lower Artibonite region of Haiti, which \n     according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and \n     Population had affected more than 500,000 people and caused \n     the death of more than 6,700 people nationwide by November \n     30, 2011;\n       Whereas, as of December 2011, the United States Government \n     had provided technical assistance and contributed more than \n     $73,000,000 in purified drinking water, soap, and oral \n     rehydration salts to combat the spread of cholera in Haiti; \n     and\n       Whereas, since the January 12, 2010, earthquake, the people \n     of Haiti have demonstrated unwavering resilience, dignity, \n     and courage: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the loss of lives as a result of the tragic \n     earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010;\n       (2) honors the service of United States personnel in the \n     United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince, the United States \n     Coast Guard, United States Armed Forces, and other United \n     States Government agencies, and all members of international \n     organizations who have persevered through adverse local \n     conditions and continue to serve Haiti and the Haitian \n     people;\n       (3) reaffirms its solidarity with the people of Haiti as \n     they work to rebuild their country and livelihoods;\n       (4) reaffirms its commitment to support the people of \n     Haiti, in partnership with the Government of Haiti and in \n     coordination with other donors, in long-term reconstruction;\n       (5) urges the United States Government, international \n     donors, and non-governmental organizations in Haiti to work \n     in full partnership with authorities, civil society, and the \n     private sector in Haiti and to prioritize sustainable \n     projects with greater opportunity for capacity building; and\n       (6) encourages the United States Government, the Government \n     of Haiti, and international donors--\n       (A) to give priority to policies that would enhance the \n     ability of the Government of Haiti to attract private sector \n     investment and meaningful diaspora participation, including \n     judicial reform, civil registry, enterprise fund, and land \n     tenure reform;\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\n       (B) to develop, improve, and scale-up communications and \n     participatory mechanisms to more substantially involve civil \n     society in Haiti at all stages of the cholera and post-\n     earthquake responses; and\n       (C) to give priority to programs that protect and involve \n     vulnerable populations, including internally displaced \n     persons, children, and persons with disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/06/senate-section/article/S359-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2012\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
