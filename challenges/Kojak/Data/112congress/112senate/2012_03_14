Madam President, it is a real accomplishment for this \nSenate to pass this highway bill, and it will happen. We worked through \nall these amendments, different tones and variations of subject matter, \nmany of them not having anything to do with the highway bill, but as \neveryone knows, that is what the Senate is all about a lot of the time.\n  I now call upon my friend, the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, to move this bill over there as quickly as possible. \nHe has indicated that they likely will take up the Senate bill. I hope \nthat is, in fact, the case.\n  At the end of this month the highway bill expires, which could lead \nto the laying off and termination of a little more than a million \npeople. This bill, when it is signed by the President, will save or \ncreate 2.8 million jobs. It is important to get this done.\n  As for the judges, there have been conversations with me and a number \nof different combination of Senators, and I am hopeful we can work \nsomething out on this. If not, as I indicated, we will go ahead and \nhave these judges votes. We need to get something done here. We have 17 \njudges--this does not count the appellate judges--that is, the circuit \ncourt judges--and there are 4 of those. I am hopeful we can work our\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\nway toward this culmination so we don't have this situation.\n  We have been in touch with the White House. There has been some \nconcern about what happens with the 2-week recess that we have, and I \nam confident we will work our way through that. There is a conversation \nas to how we proceed with the IPO bill we got from the House. I think \nthere is general agreement that there should be an extremely limited \nnumber of amendments, and we will move this as quickly as possible. So \nI hope the next day or two or three brings us more success here in the \nSenate.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1640-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am worried about the Senate as a body \ntoday. I came down here to the floor and I listened very intently to \nthe Chaplain's prayer. He asked that we call on the higher wisdom; not \nman's wisdom, but God's wisdom. And I note with lots of consternation \nand worry that what is a very fine institution is being put at risk \nbasically through failed leadership.\n  Let me explain what I mean by that. Having lived 64 years and running \nan organization and running a business, the quality that is most needed \nin leadership is a quality called reconciliation. And when that doesn't \nhappen by our leaders--and I'm not singling out any one leader in \nparticular--when that effort, that reconciliation, doesn't happen, it \nis not just directly related to the events surrounding that lack of \nreconciliation, it does damage to institutions. What we are about to \nsee carried out today is the placing of partisan principles on both \nsides of the aisle ahead of the principle of advice and consent and the \nSenate's role.\n  Unfortunately, our leader didn't protect the Senate's rights under \nthe Constitution with the last four nominations in terms of recess \nappointments, and we can debate that. But the fact is as an \ninstitution--whether it had been a Republican leader or Democratic \nleader--the No. 1 issue that needs to be protected is the rights of the \nSenate as related to the other branches of government. I think that is \nunfortunate, and I think that is part of our problem today as we fail \nto trust one another to do what is right.\n  Let me go back to leadership. The real qualities of great leaders are \nthey bring people of disparate views together and they solve those \nproblems; they never accept the fact that an impasse is the answer. \nWhat we have queued to set up today is going to be an impasse. \nEverybody knows it. It is going to be an impasse. All that does is \nreflect poorly on the Senate as a whole and on the leadership of the \nSenate as a whole on both sides. So my caution would be to return to \nwhat Chaplain Black said: There is greater wisdom than we have. That is \nthe wisdom we ought to be drawing from as we reconcile differences in \nthe Senate, rather than destroy the comity of the Senate and destroy \nthe ability of us to work together in the Nation's best interest in the \nfuture.\n  I would also tell you that the other thing I am disappointed about is \nthat we have the Senate focused on that small issue instead of the very \ngreat issues in front of our Nation--the very fact that we are going \nbankrupt; that we have not done one thing this year to actually trim \nthe excesses of the Federal Government; that we have not addressed in \nany way, shape, or form the very problems that are going to create \ntremendous burdens not only to our children but those people who, \nthrough no fault of their own, will not have a safety net in the future \nbecause we failed to make the tough decisions today, and that is \nwrapped up in political expediency.\n  One of my favorite quotes--it is a summary of Martin Luther King, \nJr.'s words. It is not his exact words, but he said the following: \nCowardice asks the question, Is it safe? Expediency asks the question, \nIs it politic? Vanity asks the question, Is it popular? But conscience \nand character ask the question, Is it right?\n  What I put forward to the two leaders today is what we are about to \nlet unfold today in the Senate: Is that the right thing for the Senate \nor does it have to do with expediency and popularity? And if it is to \ndo with those two things--whether it is connected or not--that is \ncalled failed leadership. That is a failure to lead, to reconcile, to \nbring people together. We are better than that. Our leaders are better \nthan that. We should not allow this to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business on \nmajority time, and I will yield, of course, to a Republican Senator \ncoming to the floor because I know they have some 15 minutes or so \nremaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1640-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1640-S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is time to end the delays and move \nahead with up-or-down votes on these judicial nominations.\n  Right now there are 22 judicial nominations sitting on the judicial \ncalendar: 17 district court and 5 circuit court nominees. These are \nappointments to Federal judgeships. In many instances they are \nappointments that are long overdue and desperately needed.\n  Twelve of these nominees were voted out of the Judiciary Committee \nlast year--last year--two of them as far back as last October.\n  One would think they must be very controversial people to have made \nit this far but then stalled on the calendar. It turns out 17 of these \n22 nominees received strong bipartisan support on the committee. \nThirteen had blue slips, which is permission to go forward, from home \nState Republican Senators. Eleven of them would fill vacancies deemed \nas judicial emergencies.\n  I don't understand how we can do this to the Federal judiciary and to \nthe men and women who are involved. The American people need these \nnominations to be confirmed in a timely fashion, and it is only fair to \nthese men and women who are offering their lives in public service and \nsometimes jeopardizing their current jobs because of the uncertainty of \ntheir future.\n  All Americans want our Federal courts to be there to prosecute \ncriminals, to make certain they have their day in court in civil \nproceedings, as well as to maintain the integrity of our judicial \nprocess.\n  There are only two ways to schedule a confirmation vote in the \nSenate: either a unanimous consent agreement or file cloture, which \nbasically means force the issue. Forcing the issue takes time, and time \nisn't on our side. We have important things to do: finishing the \nTransportation bill today and moving forward on other important issues. \nBut since President Obama took office, Senate Republicans have \nroutinely objected when we have asked for their consent to promptly \nschedule confirmation votes on judicial nominees.\n  When we take a look at the record President Obama has faced, the \nobstruction from the Republican side of the aisle is unprecedented. \nPresident Obama's district court nominees have been forced to wait on \nthe floor more than four times longer on average than those confirmed \nunder President Bush or under President Clinton. Overall, at this point \nin their terms, President Obama has had only 131 nominees confirmed \nwhile President George W. Bush had 172 and President Clinton had 183.\n  Right now there are 39 judicial nominees pending either on the \nJudiciary\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\nCommittee or on the Senate floor. Promptly confirming these 39 would \nbring the President's overall numbers close to parity with President \nBush. It wouldn't give him an advantage.\n  It is time to stop the delay. I think it is important for us to \nconfirm these nominees as quickly as possible. We don't have to go \nthrough this painful and embarrassing charade of calling cloture vote \nafter cloture vote on nominees who were accepted on a strong bipartisan \nvote, have been approved by Republican Senators, and are simply being \nheld up on the hope by some Republican Senators that the day will come \nwhen there is a Republican President who can fill these vacancies. That \nisn't fair. Taking that approach is what gives our Chamber a bad name.\n  Ten of these nominees were reported out of committee last year. Why \ncontinue to delay them? I know during President Bush's first term the \nSenate confirmed 57 district court nominees within 7 days. These \nnominees languished on the calendar for months--months. If there is a \nlegitimate objection to any nominee, step forward and state the \nobjection. If a Member opposes the nominee, when the vote comes vote \nno. But for, goodness' sake, to let these names and nominations \nlanguish on the calendar isn't fair to the nominees, and it isn't fair \nto the courts that are in many instances facing judicial emergencies \nbecause of these vacancies.\n  I urge my colleagues--among these nominees are two for Illinois. \nSenator Mark Kirk and I had an agreed-to bipartisan approach. We put \ntogether bipartisan committees, we each found our favorite nominees, \nand we submitted the nominee to one another. We asked for approval; we \ngot the approval. We have two extraordinarily good people: John Lee, \nproposed by me, and Jay Tharp, proposed by Senator Kirk. Both came out \nof committee without controversy--two excellent nominees sitting on the \ncalendar.\n  For goodness' sake, I ask my colleagues, why would they do this? It \nisn't fair to these individuals. It isn't fair to Senator Kirk, and it \nisn't fair to this process. Let's move these names forward as quickly \nas possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1641-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this week the average price of a \ngallon of gas is $4. The national unemployment rate is 8.3 percent. If \nwe include those who are so frustrated they have stopped looking for \nwork altogether, of course, the unemployment rate is much higher than \n8.3 percent.\n  With all of this, the Democratic majority is about to spend more of \nthe Senate's time on another heavy-handed power play that will not get \nthem anywhere. But it will make clear yet again how out of touch they \nare with the needs of the American people.\n  First, we need to make clear what this is about and what this is not \nabout. This is not about making sure the President's judicial \nnominations are being treated fairly. Despite what the majority would \nlike us to believe, the President is doing quite well on that score, as \nis clear from both the facts and the admissions of our Democratic \nfriends themselves.\n  As Senator Alexander noted yesterday, the Senate has confirmed 76 out \nof 78 district court nominees whom President Obama submitted in his \nfirst 2 years. The President withdrew the other two. That is a 97-\npercent success rate. Not bad.\n  The Senate confirmed 62 of President Obama's circuit and district \ncourt nominations last year alone. If we look at President Bush's and \nPresident Obama's lower court confirmations when they both had two \nSupreme Court appointments for the Senate to consider, President Obama \nis doing much better than President Bush. President Bush had a total of \n120 lower court judges confirmed in 4 years, while President Obama \nalready has 129 lower court judgeships confirmed in just 3 years. So \nPresident Obama has had more confirmations in a much shorter period of \ntime.\n\n  To the extent there is anyone here to blame, the Obama administration \nand Senate Democrats should actually look in the mirror. Of the 83 \ncurrent vacancies, over half of them--44--don't even have nominees. Let \nme say that again: Of the 83 current vacancies, over half of them--44--\ndon't even have nominees.\n  As for the minority of the vacancies for which the President has \nactually submitted a name, almost half of those are still in the \nJudiciary Committee. So nearly three-fourths of the current vacancies--\n61 of 83--are due either to the administration failing to nominate \nsomeone or the Democratic-controlled Judiciary Committee failing to \nmove them out of committee.\n  Given what we have to work with, it is no wonder the majority leader \ncomplimented Republicans--complimented Republicans--at the end of last \nyear, noting that the Senate had, in fact, accomplished quite a bit on \njudicial nominations. That was the majority leader of the Senate just \nlast year. The senior Senator from Minnesota, a Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee, acknowledged the same thing.\n  So this is not about making sure the President is treated fairly in \nhis judicial nominations. In fact, this isn't even about judicial \nnominations at all. This is about giving the President what he wants \nwhen he wants it, and what the President wants is to distract the \ncountry from his failed policies that have led to soaring gas prices \nand high unemployment and instead try to write a narrative of \nobstruction for his campaign. He doesn't care if he eviscerates the \nSenate's advice and consent responsibility to do so.\n  What the majority should do is work with us to move these lifetime \nappointments in an orderly manner as we did 62 times last year and as \nwe have already done 7 times this year. As I suggested yesterday, we \ncould get to the bipartisan jobs bill this week and process some \njudicial nominations as well. The jobs bill passed the House by a vote \nof 390 to 23--390 to 23--and the President says he supports it as well. \nWhile we are working on a bill to get people back to work, we can make \nprogress on other judicial nominations.\n  So I encourage the majority to work with us on both legislation and \nnominations and not to go off on a partisan, unprecedented path that \nwould not get us anywhere and would not solve the problems Americans \ncare about.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank our Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell, for bringing some perspective to this situation. I have seen \nthe circumstances in the Senate and how the nominations process has \nchanged over time. When I came here, there were no filibusters. Maybe \nthere had been one in which a nomination was delayed and the nomination \nwas withdrawn because it had certain problems, but virtually none. It \nwas the position of the Senate that we did not filibuster nominations, \nand I still believe in that.\n  But I would point out that in 2001 the Democrats met in conference, \nand they had a plan to change the ground rules of confirmations. They \nannounced it to the New York Times. Cass Sunstein, Marcia Greenberg, \nand Laurence Tribe met with them, and they came out and started \nfilibustering systematically the fabulous nominations that President \nBush had sent to the Senate. He sent eight nominees early in his \nadministration. Two of them were renominations of President Clinton's \nnominees. They were promptly confirmed in the Senate. But immediately \nfilibusters of superb nominees such as Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers \nBrown, and others commenced, and we had a long process with that. This \nwas led by the Democrats. Then-Senator Obama was one of them. He \nfilibustered Justice Alito's nomination. We had not done that before. \nHe participated in other filibusters. Senator Reid voted to block an \nup-or-down vote 26 times. Senator Leahy voted to block an up-or-down \nvote 27 times.\n  What happened was there was such a controversy over this changing of \nthe rules in the early 2000s that it resulted in a compromise. Fourteen \nSenators--called the Gang of 14--decided they would break the logjam \nand create a new rule. It was not a perfect rule. I really think \nfilibusters are not the\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\nright thing for judges. But they said: We will have them only in \nextraordinary circumstances. That sort of became the new rule, and a \nnumber of nominees eventually, after years of waiting, were confirmed. \nOthers were not. That is sort of the way we operate today. But that is \nnot the problem. That is not the problem at all.\n  Since President Obama has been in office, he has had about the same \npercentage of confirmations as President Bush had during the same \nperiod of time. He has had fewer lower court nominations because he has \nsubmitted fewer nominations--about 20 percent fewer nominations than \nPresident Bush. The average time from nomination to confirmation for \nPresident Obama's nominees is within a week of the average time from \nnomination to confirmation for Bush nominees. The process is working \nhere.\n  What is happening? I am telling you, I know what is happening. This \nDemocratic leadership in the Senate--and make no mistake, they control \nthis body--has been trying to create a perception that there is \nobstruction going on, and they are going to pretend that these 17 \nnominees, who would have come up for a vote in regular order, are being \nblocked. This is part of an obstructive tactic, and it is not accurate, \nand it is not correct. Nominations have been moving at the regular \npace. It is a gimmick. It is a political stunt.\n  What ought to be done in the Senate? We need to be working on what is \nimportant. We now will have, finally, after 3 weeks, votes today--\nmaybe--to pass the highway bill. Well, why did it take 3 weeks? We went \nabout 2 weeks without doing anything. We have had about 2 days' worth \nof votes all of a sudden at the end of 3 weeks, and the bill will be up \nfor final passage.\n  Why was that not done 3 weeks ago? Because Senator Reid obstructed \nthe ability of Senators to offer amendments, and he tried to move this \nbill forward without amendments, except the ones he picked, and that is \nnot right. The majority leader does not get to pick amendments or how \nmany should be offered to legislation in the greatest deliberative body \nin the history of the world, the U.S. Senate. He does not have that \npower. So he tried to move the bill forward, and Republicans said: No, \nwe will not move to a final vote until you agree on amendments. Now he \nhas agreed to 20 or 30 amendments. In about 2 days' time, they will \nhave all been voted on--some of them were withdrawn--and the bill will \ncome up for final passage.\n  Why didn't it happen earlier? Because this is a rope-a-dope. They do \nnot want to talk about the things that this country needs. One of them \nis a budget. It has been over 1,000 days since this Congress has passed \na budget. Why aren't we spending time on that? Senator Reid said it is \nfoolish to pass a budget. It is not foolish to pass a budget. We are \nrequired to pass a budget. This country has never needed a budget more \nthan it needs it today--never.\n  We are heading to financial catastrophe. Erskine Bowles chaired the \ndebt commission--President Clinton's Chief of Staff--and he said we are \nheading to the most predictable financial crisis in our Nation's \nhistory. Why? Because of the debt we are running up. And we need to \nconfront that, but Senator Reid did not want to talk about it. He did \nnot want his Members to have to vote. If you bring up a budget, Members \nhave to vote. They get to offer amendments. They will talk about the \ndebt course of America, which is on an unsustainable path. Everybody \nsays that. Why aren't we talking about that?\n  Judicial nominations are moving at a reasonable pace, as they have \nalways moved. There is nothing unusual about President Obama's ability \nto get his judges confirmed. I have probably voted for 90 percent of \nthem. What is unusual is that we are violating the statutory law of the \nUnited States of America that says you should have a budget. We are \nrequired to pass a budget. By April 1, it should be before the Senate. \nIt should be passed by April 15. Isn't that perfectly sane, that the \nUnited States of America would have a budget? And the Senate does not \nwant to do that.\n  What else should we be talking about? We should be working to have \nmore affordable American energy. We all want to create jobs. Our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side rammed through a big stimulus bill \nthat spent government money, ran up $800 billion--every penny added to \nthe debt of the United States. We were in debt and we spent $800 \nbillion--all borrowed, all adding to our debt. It did not really do \nanything for the economy. Only 4 percent of it went to roads and \nbridges. What a tragedy that was. It was supposed to fix our crumbling \ninfrastructure. At least we would have had something concrete to show \nfor it had we built roads and bridges.\n  So now we are in this situation: How do you create jobs? We cannot \nkeep borrowing money. We do not have it. Expert after expert who has \ntestified before the Budget Committee, where I am the ranking \nRepublican, has told us you cannot keep borrowing this kind of money. \nExperts have told us that the size of the debt we have now--$15 \ntrillion--already is slowing growth in the country. We need economic \ngrowth, we do not need it slowed, and it is being slowed because we \nhave run up so much debt, experts tell us. So I am worried about that. \nWe have to deal with it.\n\n  How do we create growth? One of things we need to do is produce more \nAmerican energy. We do not need a Secretary of Energy--I have taken to \ncalling it the Department of Anti-Energy--who said in 2008 that he \nwanted to see the price of energy go up.\n  He was asked I think yesterday in the committee: Do you still believe \nthat?\n  He said: Well, no, I have changed my mind since 2008. You know, the \neconomy is not doing well, and maybe now at this point I don't think \nenergy prices should go up.\n  Can you imagine the Secretary of Energy fundamentally having as his \nguiding principle that he wants to raise the price of energy? And the \nPresident said it himself before he was elected.\n  This is a radical idea driven by extremists who do not understand \nthat the cost of energy hammers the American people. The average \nAmerican is spending $4,000 a year on gasoline, at almost $400 a month. \nYou were spending $200 a month on your gasoline when President Obama \ntook office. Now you are spending twice as much: $400--$200 a month in \nthe form of a basic tax on you.\n  We are importing oil. But we are finding more in the United States, \nand we have better techniques for bringing it out of the ground. We can \nproduce a lot more. Privately owned lands are showing increases in \nenergy production and exploration. They are doing a good job. But the \ngovernment owned lands are down 14 percent because the President is \nblocking production on government lands, blocking offshore production. \nHe really is.\n  We were projected to have issued lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico on \n12 major tracts. That has been reduced to just two in the last 2 years. \nThis is putting us behind. Production of oil and gas in the Gulf of \nMexico is down. Jobs are down. When we allow drilling in the Gulf of \nMexico, oil companies bid for those rights. They pay money to the U.S. \nGovernment. Not only do they create jobs in America, they pay us money \nto get the right to drill and then they pay us for every barrel of oil \nthey produce. It creates wealth for America. Why do we want to loan \nmoney to Brazil to produce oil and gas offshore when we can produce it \nin our own gulf?\n  So those are things on which we need to be focused. Why aren't we \ntalking about that, in addition to the budget?\n  And taxes. I was talking to a businessman the other day. He said this \ninvestment tax credit that encourages you to invest in new machinery \nand other equipment for his company--he examined that, and he decided \nhe would take advantage of it and accelerate a purchase of some things \nfor his company. He got a big tax credit, but he said the paperwork was \nthis thick. The lawyers and accountants and effort he had to go through \ncost him at least a third of the advantage he was supposed to get from \nthe government. It is not necessary for things to be that complicated.\n  We need simplified, progrowth tax reform. Why is that not on the \nfloor of the Senate? Isn't that a priority for America? I think \neverybody can agree that if we simplified our tax procedure, if me made \nit more growth-oriented, we could create jobs without losing revenue to \nthe Federal Government, create economic growth, and put our country on \na path to a sound future.\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\nWe have to have economic growth, and we cannot get it by continuing to \nborrow from our children--really borrowing currently--to spend money to \ntry to jump-start through a sugar high the American economy that is \ndragging along.\n  We have this major problem with governmental regulations. I am \nhearing it everywhere I go--from farmers who are being told they cannot \nhave dust on their farms. When Senator Roberts asked an EPA witness how \nare we going to keep dust down, they said, well, you can have a water \ntruck and go by and water it. Now, how silly is that? They have work \nrules that keep children in families from helping out on the farm. They \nhave rules dealing with a ditch, calling it a navigable stream. This is \nregulatory overreach of a monumental degree, and I am hearing it from \nbusiness, I am hearing it from taxpayers, I am hearing it from farmers \nall over.\n  Every regulation needs to be examined. If it produces a positive \nresult for America in terms of health and safety and the general \nwelfare, OK, I am for it. But if it is the kind of regulation that does \nnot produce a benefit but adds to the cost of doing business--costs \nthat add up for the average American consumer--then it needs to be \neliminated.\n  It would help create jobs and help make us more productive, as we \nwork on producing American energy, which creates jobs in itself. That \nadditional production of energy does have the tendency to pull down \nprices. There is no doubt about it. It may not happen day to day. But \nas energy reserves are increased, as energy productions and exploration \noccur and more is produced, it tends to bring down prices. So we need \nto focus on things that bring down prices of energy. We do not need to \nbe mandating forms of energy that cost 2, 3, 4, 8, 10 times as much as \nthe basic energy we have today.\n  We cannot afford it. It adds to the cost of doing business. The \nconsumers pay it with their pocketbooks when they go to the store, and \nwhen businesses look for a place to build a plant, they look at the \nrest of the world. If our energy prices are lower and reliable, then \nthey can afford to invest here, hire American workers.\n  But if our energy prices are too high--and I can cite examples of \ninvestments in my State of Alabama that were determined one way or the \nother based on energy prices. If the price of energy is too high, they \ngo somewhere else. They cannot afford it. They have to seek the lowest \nprice. That creates jobs and growth.\n  We need to have an Energy Secretary who understands his job is to \nprotect the health and safety of America and produce as much energy as \nwe can at the lowest possible price, not to be engaged in some social \nengineering. I have to tell you, it troubles me that the Secretary of \nEnergy does not even own a car, he rides a bike. I mean, this is who is \nrunning this country. It is the kind of idea that is not realistic for \nthe average American citizen. People with big salaries and so forth, \nwhen the price of energy goes up, it does not bother them. But the \naverage guy, the high prices hit his rent payment, hit his health care, \nhis food, and he has to pay $100 more a month, $150 more a month for \nthe same amount of gasoline.\n  We have small business paying more. Tell me that does not hurt this \neconomy. Tell me that does not raise unemployment. It absolutely does. \nIt is stupid. We do not need to be doing things that do not make sense. \nWe cannot afford it. This Senate needs to be focused not on some \nunprecedented, unheard of, gimmicked-up complaint that we are now going \nto have 17 cloture votes on judges, many of whom have been on the \nSenate floor less than 1 month.\n  Half the nominees who have made it to the Senate today are now in \ncommittee. Senator Leahy, our Democratic chairman, has not moved them \nout of committee yet. They will move. He moves them very fast, frankly. \nHow can it be Senator McConnell's fault that they have not been \nconfirmed? It is a lifetime appointment. Judges are not entitled just \nto be given a lifetime appointment like that. People running for \nCongress, they work for months and years trying to achieve the job, \nputting a record out there. So it does not hurt for a judge to be \nsitting on the floor for a while.\n  Maybe someone will come forward and say: Let me tell you what that \njudge did to me or this is what he did wrong or something. Sometimes \nthat happens. So we need a steady process, and we are moving forward \nwell within the traditions of this Senate.\n  But what has happened is this Senate is obstructing legislation that \nis coming out of the House that would fix energy, that helps tax \nreform. There are small business growth proposals that are on the floor \nnow, they are not even being brought up. They are being obstructed by \nSenator Reid and the Democrats. That is a fact. I am not making this \nup. So this is a body that is not doing its job. The House produced a \nbudget. They produced a historic budget. That was realistic. I would \nlike to have seen them go a little further, frankly.\n  We may not have agreed with everything in it. But it was a historic \nbudget. It changed the debt trajectory of America. It began to bring \nour debt on a downward path instead of this surging, upward path we are \non. They did it last year and they are going to do it again this year.\n  What is the Senate going to do? Nothing. We are not going to have a \nbudget for the United States of America. It is a sad day. I feel \nstrongly about this. I have seen the debates over judges. I saw \nfabulous judges, like Justice Alito on the Supreme Court, be \nfilibustered. I saw Chief Justice Roberts' nomination sit for a long \nperiod of time when he was nominated for the circuit bench.\n  Alabama's fabulous Justice Bill Pryor, now on the Eleventh Circuit, \nwas blocked for months and months and months. Janice Rogers Brown, \nSupreme Court of California, African-American, great justice; Priscilla \nOwens, ``unanimously well qualified,'' Supreme Court Justice of Texas. \nShe was fabulous. They held them all.\n  The only ones they confirmed were the two judges President Bush had \ngraciously reappointed, whom President Clinton had nominated but were \nnot confirmed at the end of his term. I will close by saying we do need \nto work on this issue of what the Senate needs to be focusing on. I \nbelieve it needs to be focusing on a budget, energy, taxes, \nregulations, things that will make a difference for America, make our \ncountry stronger and healthier and more productive and more competitive \nwithout adding to the debt.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1643-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1643-S1645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I was listening with interest to my good \nfriend from Alabama, a man I work with very closely on a number of \nissues. But on this one, we see the world a little differently. He has \nmade his point that Democrats held up a lot of judges and so on. I \nunderstand that. But there is no comparison. Facts are stubborn things. \nWe need to look at the facts when it comes to voting on judges.\n  I just wanted to share, before I talk about the highway bill, this \none chart: ``Judicial Nominee Wait Times.'' These are the facts. This \nis not made up. These are the facts. With President Clinton, we see the \nwait time. With Bush, we see the wait time. Obama, we see the wait \ntime--way over 100 days. So we are going from 10 to 20, to over 100 \ndays.\n  This tells the story. If people want to know why our majority leader \nhas decided to bring up all these judges today, it is because of this. \nWe have emergencies in some of our courts where they do not have the \njudges. These judges are so well qualified. We have one amazing judge \nawaiting to be confirmed from our Central District. I think he is about \nthird on the list. He received a great vote out of the committee. These \nnominees have put their lives on hold.\n  This may sound odd, but my favorite part of the Constitution is the \npreamble. I read it a lot. When I go into\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\nthe schools, I talk about it to the children. We discuss what it means. \nWhen it says, ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a \nmore perfect Union, establish Justice . . .'' that is the first reason. \nWe want to form a more perfect Union, and the first way to do it is to \nestablish justice.\n  How can we have justice if it is so delayed? How can we have justice \nwhen it is politicized? I think this says it all. So as we go from a \nbipartisan bill into this, unfortunately, the partisan waters, I think \nit is important to the people of the country to understand, we do not \nwant to pick a fight at all. We want to get things done around here. \nDemocrats want to get things done. We have proven it by reaching out to \nour Republican friends on the highway bill and many other things--\npayroll tax. On the judicial nominees, we want to do the same.\n  I wished to just make that simple point before I get back to the \nreason I am on the floor; that is, to complete work on the \nTransportation bill.\n\n\n                             Transportation\n\n  The Chair is a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nShe has been instrumental in getting this bill to the floor. People \nasked me yesterday--some of the press people--what it has been like to \nget this bill to the state it is in now, passing the Senate. I say: \nPeople like to say, watching a bill become law is watching someone \nmaking sausage. I said: It is a lot messier than that. It truly is. \nThis bill was almost derailed because someone wanted to talk about \ncontraception. Then we had issues that had nothing to do with the bill, \ndealing with offshore oil drilling and issues dealing with pipelines \nand issues dealing with extraneous matters.\n  But we got through it all. We got through it all for one main reason; \nthat is, the desire of the vast majority of Senators, certainly not \nall--there are some on the fringes who do not want to do this bill--but \nthe vast majority of Senators want to get this bill done. Why is that?\n  It is because this is a bipartisan program that has been in place \nsince Dwight Eisenhower was President, a Republican President, who \nclearly stated--because he was an expert on logistics as a general--\nthat we have to move people and we have to move goods efficiently in a \nfirst-rate economy.\n  So I think everyone--not even most people--sees that. Yes, we have a \nfew colleagues in the far corner of the right who want to do away with \nthe highway program. But thank goodness they did not succeed on their \nvote. They got too many votes for my liking, but that is where it is. \nBut we were able to say strongly, no.\n  This is a program the Federal Government should play a role in \nbecause this is one Nation under God. If one has great roads in their \nState and the next-door neighbor has not paved any roads, they are kind \nof stuck. That is why we have a national highway program.\n  One more reason we got where we are, which is very close to being \ndone with this bill, successfully done, is that we had more than 1,000 \ngroups behind us--way more than 1,000--and they represented Americana. \nThey represented everyone one from the construction workers who are \nstruggling and suffering with a very high unemployment rate to the \nbusinesses that employ them, that want to be able to provide the work \nand want to be able to do what they do best, which is building \nthings. So for all those reasons, we have gotten to where we are. There \nis one more reason.\n\n  I wanted to take my last few minutes to talk about those Members who \nworked together on this bill, the various chairmen. This is an unusual \nbill. It is a jobs bill, a huge jobs bill, and 2.8 million jobs hang in \nthe balance. We have had to deal with four different committees \ntogether. We have Senator Inhofe, my ranking member, who was \nextraordinary. He is a hero when it comes to this bill--talking to \npeople on the floor yesterday, from the heart, with the facts, urging \nthem to help us pass this bill. My hat is off to my ranking member \nSenator Inhofe.\n  Interestingly, we are on opposite sides on the environmental issues. \nWe really are. We have some very tough arguments and very tough \ndebates. I just see a clean and healthy environment as something we \nneed to do to protect our people. He sees it as a bureaucratic regime \nto stop business. Through it all, we have never lost respect for one \nanother. We have come together on this issue. There is very little \ndistance, if any, between us. I thank Senator Inhofe.\n  Senator Baucus is chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nSubcommittee of EPW, and, of course, the very strong chairman of the \nFinance Committee. I can't thank him enough. He had the tough job of \nfilling the gap we had in terms of money for the highway trust fund. \nThis was not easy. He had to find ways to do it that everybody \nsupported--not everybody but most people--and he was able to get the \njob done.\n  With many colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I particularly give \na shout out to Senator Thune, whom I believed was extremely helpful in \nall of this.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Vitter, who was the ranking member of \nthe Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee of EPW, for his \nassistance.\n  On the other key committees, Senator Tim Johnson, chairman of the \nBanking Committee, and Senator Richard Shelby, ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, could not have been nicer. I called their staffs \nvery often to make sure they would move forward, and they did.\n  By the way, the EPW Committee was able to vote out a bill \nunanimously. Everybody supported it, and so did the Banking Committee. \nI am grateful to them.\n  I thank Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison, chair and ranking \nmember of Commerce, from the bottom of my heart. They had some \ndifficult bumps in the road. When the bill came out of committee, there \nwas controversy. Working with Senator Cantwell, we figured out how to \nget a vote on something she cared a lot about. We were able to smooth \nout that bump in the road. Frankly, they came together like true \nchampions and were able to get over the partisan differences and come \nup with a bipartisan bill. So we married together four committees' \nwork--that was amazing--into this Transportation bill. It was \nbipartisan from day one to this day.\n  That reminds me of how long we have been on this bill on the Senate \nfloor. It has been 5 weeks, and today I believe we are going to see \nvictory.\n  In terms of Senators, I have to thank our leader Senator Reid from \nthe bottom of my heart. When you are the majority leader--and there \nhave been books written about this--you have to keep the train moving. \nYou have to keep moving with legislation, moving forward. Everything \nhas a deadline and a date. Every committee chair wants their bill on \nthe Senate floor. I know what it is because I have the good fortune of \nbeing on the leadership team. He could have easily said: Senator Boxer, \nSenator Inhofe, I have given you 3 weeks, and we are still not off \nthis. But he stuck with it. I am so appreciative, and so are all the \nworking people and the businesses that rely on this bill.\n  Our whip, Senator Durbin, worked so hard, along with his staff. We \nlove his staff. Day in and day out they would let us know what the \nvotes would be like on the amendments. I appreciate it.\n  Senator Schumer and Senator Murray in the leadership were pushing \nthis forward.\n  I also thank Senator McConnell for working with us to get this done.\n  I also must thank staff by name. I hope I don't leave anybody out. I \nwant them to know somebody asked me what it was like, and I said there \nis a song called--don't worry, I am not going to sing it--``The Long \nand Winding Road.'' It was ``the long and winding road'' to navigate \nthis bill. It was very difficult.\n  I have a chief of staff, chief counsel of the committee, who is \nbeyond extraordinary, and that is Bettina Poirier. I think she deserves \nan enormous amount of credit. She was able to work with all the staff \nto bring them along so that their concerns were heard from day one to \nthis day. I thank her. Her counterpart on Senator Inhofe's staff Ruth \nVanMark is an extraordinary person who has been with the Senator for \nway more than 20 years. She is a tower of strength and has great \nrespect from the colleagues on her side of the aisle, working with them \nto make sure they knew what was going on.\n  This bill is a reform bill. It takes 90 titles down to 30. It is a \nstrong bill and a fair bill, and it is paid for.\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\n  David Napoliello, there is so much I can say about him and what that \nman has brought to our committee. This bill is a testimony to his \nskill. And James O'Keeffe, who works for Senator Inhofe, is David's \ncounterpart. They have all become very good friends. Bettina, Ruth, \nDavid, and James have become almost like family working on this bill.\n  I am holding a list of the incredible people who work for me and \nworked with Bettina. I will go through the names: Andrew Dohrmann, \nMurphie Barrett, Tyler Rushforth, Kyle Miller, Grant Cope, Mike Burke, \nand Tom Lynch.\n  I know Mike works with Senator Cardin and the committee, and Tom \nLynch works with our committee through Senator Baucus. Also, there is \nMark Hybner, Charles Brittingham, Alex Renjel, and Dimitri Karakitsos, \nwho were all just amazing.\n  Lastly, I thank the leadership staff. This became a bill that was so \nbig and involved so many committees. We could not do it without a \nleadership team working, of course, with the leadership and with the \nSenators I mentioned, Senator Reid and Senator Durbin. I mentioned \nbefore who did the whip count. So I thank the leadership staff, \nparticularly Bill Dauster, Reema Dodin, and Bob Herbert. I thank the \nstaff directors of the key committees who worked on this, including \nEllen Doneski, Dwight Fettig, and Russ Sullivan.\n  Madam President, that was a long list of people, but I felt compelled \nto come down and do that. The staff--and the occupant of the chair \nknows this, as she has achieved some amazing things. I am so proud of \nthe occupant of the chair. She knows that having the staff behind us to \nmake sure that every ``i'' is dotted and every ``t'' is crossed and \nevery followup is done and every problem a Senator's staff might have \nis addressed is very important. Nobody really knows about this, so once \nin a while we need to do this. I wanted to do it before we get into the \nbill.\n\n  I ask the Chair, what time do we go back to the bill?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. In 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will then speak more about the bill because we have \nsome amendments.\n  Can the Chair advise me what the order of votes are on this \nTransportation bill?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The first amendment in order is No. \n1810. Next is Carper No. 1870, Hutchison No. 1568, McCain No. 1669, \nAlexander No. 1779, Boxer No. 1816, Paul No. 1556, and Shaheen No. \n1678.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I wanted Members to know about the \norder. It is likely that several of these will not require votes. I \nthink we will expect at least between, I would say, three and five \nvotes. I think that is a fair indication of where we are going. I will \nbe back to discuss those amendments at the proper time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1645-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I am rising to speak about the Senate's \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent on judicial nominations. This \npower is enormously important. In no way did the writers of our \nConstitution envision that this body would use their power of advice \nand consent as a method of undermining the ability of the other two \nbranches to perform their responsibilities.\n  Indeed, throughout the history of the United States, Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle have taken this responsibility of advice and \nconsent very seriously. This duty requires us to put aside ideology and \npartisanship because otherwise our constituents, through our inaction, \nwould be unable to obtain the speedy and public trial that is supposed \nto be their birthright as Americans.\n  Americans are not thinking of their district courts in terms of red \ncourts and blue courts. They are not thinking of their circuit courts \nin terms of red courts and blue courts. No, they are thinking about \nLady Justice, about justice being delivered in an evenhanded and swift \nmanner. When they see the obstruction of the judiciary that is \nemanating from the Senate, they are frustrated. They are frustrated. \nThey recognize that when the judiciary is damaged and justices go \nunappointed, indeed that means delays for cases and that means their \nright to a speedy trial is taken away. They are thinking about the \nchaos that results when a case remains in limbo for too long.\n\n  So why in the past few years have we allowed partisanship to overtake \nour duty to maintain a functional judiciary? Simply put: Some Senators \nin this body, motivated by misguided notions of partisan warfare, have \ndecided to abuse the supermajority power of this Chamber in order to \nundermine the judiciary.\n  This bears little resemblance to the Senate of 1976 when I first came \nhere as an intern, when the power of the supermajority was recognized \nas an exceptional act of conscience to be used only for the most \nenormous issues, when a Senator would be willing to stand on the floor \nof the Senate and make his or her case before the American people as to \nwhy the simple majority envisioned in the Constitution for this body to \nact should be obstructed. Now we see Senators exercising their power to \nobstruct a simple majority and not coming to the floor to defend their \nposition. They are afraid of public reaction to their obstruction of \nthis body because they know the public expects us to be responsible in \nreviewing and voting on nominees for the executive branch and for the \njudiciary.\n  The Senate of 1976 would never have entertained the idea that well-\nqualified nominees would be routinely subjected to filibusters. Indeed, \neven throughout most of the last decade, this has not been the case. So \nimagine my surprise when I came here as a new Senator in 2009, \nrevisiting the Chamber I came to as a youth in 1976, and I discovered \nthe two Senates bore little resemblance to each other; that the \nreasonably responsive, bipartisan, collaborative body of 1976 had been \nreplaced with a Senate now paralyzed due to the abuse of the filibuster \nand the supermajority.\n  Instead of debate and deliberation, followed by up-or-down votes, \nSenators have even been blocking motions to proceed. In other words, \nthey have been blocking the ability to debate whether to get to a bill \nin order to debate an issue--two levels removed from actual discussion \nand decisionmaking.\n  In contrast to the image Americans have of the filibuster made famous \nby Jimmy Stewart, who comes to Washington and stands in the well of the \nSenate and carries on his fight and his argument in front of the \nAmerican people until he collapses from exhaustion, now the Senator who \nfilibusters can hide from the American people. They object to the \nsimple majority rule, go off and have a fancy wine dinner, while \nAmerican justice remains unfulfilled. That is not right.\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\n  There has been egregious abuse of the filibuster across all areas, \nbut it is particularly destructive in regard to judges. That is because \nwe are often talking about judges everyone agrees are well qualified--\njudges who pass out of committee unanimously, and judges who, when they \nreach a final vote, pass this Chamber with 80 or 90 or 95 Members \nsaying, yes, that person is the right person to fill that judicial \nvacancy. So why on Earth--why on Earth--are we dragging our feet on \nthese nominees when we have courts in crisis?\n  Lest my colleagues on the other side of the aisle simply think we are \nraising this now because we are in the majority and they are in the \nminority, let us revisit the point in 2004, at the exact same point \ninto the administration of George W. Bush that we are now with this \nadministration.\n  Here is a chart that compares the two administrations. We have both \nthe circuit court and the district court. This far into the \nadministration of George W. Bush, the time it took to go from committee \nto being confirmed was 29 days. The time now is 131 days for a circuit \ncourt nominee, and getting longer with every delay we have. And for the \ndistrict court, at this time in the Bush administration, it took 22 \ndays to go from committee to confirmation, whereas now, under the \ndysfunction of our current Senate, with the abuse of this current \nSenate, it is taking 93 days.\n  If these bars were reversed, my colleagues in the minority would come \nto the floor and say, look what a good job we did previously and what a \nterrible job is being done now, and I would agree with them, that we \nhave to be able to get folks out of committee and we have to be able to \nvote on them. We need to work together to change this situation because \nthe result of these delays means there are more and more vacancies, \nmore and more judicial emergencies, and where it has been declared \nthose vacancies are having an emergency impact on the function of the \njudiciary.\n  Let's take a look at that issue. Here we have judicial vacancies in \nrecent Presidencies. In March 1996, we had 53 vacancies at that time in \none administration. In March 2004, there were 47 vacancies under Bush. \nNow here we are with 94 vacancies in district and circuit courts, so \nvirtually a doubling of those vacant positions that are preventing \nspeedy and responsive trials across our Nation. That is why our Chief \nJustice has declared there is a judicial emergency in our country; that \njustice delayed is justice denied; that we, the Senate, must do a \nbetter job of fulfilling our responsibility under the Constitution.\n  In many cases, the home State Senators for a particular circuit or \ndistrict court nominee have done their job. They have vetted the \ncandidates, forwarded the names of nominees, and the administration has \npicked one of them. Often this is a bipartisan deliberation. Yet here \nwe are, even after clearing the Judiciary Committee in a bipartisan \nfashion, paralyzed on the floor of the Senate. So we have no one else \nto blame. We can't blame the home State Senators, we can't blame the \nJudiciary Committee. It is only the floor of this Chamber where there \nis obstruction by those who are basically taking an arrow and aiming it \nat the heart of justice across this Nation.\n  It is time for this body to do its job, and it is time for these \nnominees to be voted on here on the floor of the Senate. It is time to \nfill those vacancies and put justices into place in order to fulfill \nour responsibility to advise and consent and to fulfill the judiciary's \nresponsibility to provide justice across our Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Abrams Nomination\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I am honored to offer my support for \nthe nomination of Ronnie Abrams to the United States District Court for \nthe Southern District of New York. I also want to thank President Obama \nfor acting on my recommendation and nominating another superbly \nqualified female jurist to the Federal bench.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Ronnie for many years. I know her \nas a fair-minded woman of great integrity. Throughout her distinguished \nlegal career she has proven herself as an exceptional attorney. As the \nDeputy Chief of the Criminal Division at the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nthe Southern District of New York, she supervised 160 prosecutions of \nviolent crime, organized crime, white-collar crime, public corruption, \ndrug trafficking, and computer crime. She helped shape the policy and \nmanagement of the U.S. Attorney's Office, guiding its success in a \nbroad range of high-level, high-stakes cases. Her record shows her \ncommitment to justice. I can tell you she has a deep and sincere \ncommitment to public service.\n  There is no question that Ms. Abrams is extremely well qualified and \nwell suited to serve on the Federal judiciary. I strongly believe this \ncountry needs women such as her serving in the Federal judiciary, an \ninstitution that I believe needs more exceptional women. Ronnie Abrams \nreceived bipartisan support among the Senate Judiciary Committee \nmembers. Yet because of the political games we have today, she has \nwaited more than 227 days to be confirmed. As my colleague from Oregon \npointed out, that is far longer than any nominee had been waiting under \nthe George Bush administration.\n  I have traveled all across New York State, at event after event, \nurging more women to enter public service. I am encouraged that women \nnow make up nearly half of all our law students and about 30 percent of \nthe Federal bench. For the first time in history, women also represent \nnearly one-third of the seats on trial courts, courts of appeal, and--\nafter the confirmations of Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan to the \nhighest Court in the land--the Supreme Court.\n  The Obama administration has taken significant steps toward \nmaintaining and indeed increasing the representation of women in the \nFederal judiciary. Forty-seven percent of President Obama's confirmed \nnominees have been women, compared to only 22 percent of the judges \nconfirmed under his predecessor.\n  While it is true women have come a long way in filling the ranks of \nthe legal world, we still have a long way to go to achieve equality and \na Federal bench that is truly reflective of the American people. I \nbelieve it is incredibly important we reach that point of equality \nbecause it can bring us closer to full equality and justice throughout \nour legal system and throughout our Nation. Not only is Ms. Abrams an \nexceptional jurist, there is no doubt that having Ms. Abrams serving in \nthe Federal judiciary will bring us closer to that goal.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues to come together now around this \nshared value that we believe as a Nation, as a body, that everyone \ndeserves justice.\n  We have to work together because, as it stands, there are not enough \njudges right now to do the work our overloaded courts need them to do. \nWe have to be able to hand out justice in a timely manner.\n  Former Attorney General to President George W. Bush Michael Mukasey \nrecently remarked that the civil litigation system has ground to a \nhalt. That is not the kind of system the American people deserve, and \nwe cannot let partisan politics and political bickering get in the way \nof allowing our judicial system to function properly.\n  I recommend Ms. Abrams because of her dedication to the law, her \ncommitment to fairness, and her ability to serve the people of the \ngreat State of New York with dignity and integrity. I have been very \nhonored to recommend her for this position, and I urge my colleagues to \nmove forward to support her confirmation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1556\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 1556.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes amendment \n     numbered 1556.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To permit emergency exemptions from compliance with certain \n                laws for highway construction projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. EMERGENCY EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       With respect to any road, highway, or bridge that is closed \n     or is operating at reduced capacity because of safety \n     reasons--\n       (1) the road, highway, or bridge may be reconstructed in \n     the same general location as before the disaster; and\n       (2) such reconstruction shall be exempt from any \n     environmental reviews, approvals, licensing, and permit \n     requirements.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. The question I have for Senate is, Has your government \ngotten out of control? Have the regulators become so numerous and so \nzealous that we can't even carry on the ordinary affairs of our \ngovernment?\n  We recently had a bridge where a boat ran into the bridge in Kentucky \nand one could no longer cross the bridge because it is not there. We \nhave to wait for environmental regulations and environmental studies, \nwhich sometimes can be 4 and 5 years, before we can repair our bridges \nand our roads during an emergency. This is crazy. This goes on even in \nregular affairs, such as trying to replace a sewage plant in our State \nor throughout the United States. Do we want to live in a country where \nwe have to stop and count how many barnacles are on our bridge before \nwe decide whether to rebuild the bridge? Do we want to stop and count \nhow many mussels are attached to the pier before we rebuild the bridge? \nIn the end we are going to rebuild the bridge anyway, but we spend a \nyear's time or more wasted on these studies but in the end we are going \nto rebuild the bridge. I will give an example.\n  We have a small town in Kentucky that has a sewage plant, and the \npopulation of the town has outgrown the sewage plant. When it rains, \nthe raw sewage goes into the river. I don't know any Republican or \nDemocrat who wants raw sewage in the river. So we need a new sewage \nplant in the town. But what does the EPA say? They want to count the \nmussels. They want to count the mussels in the river and then they want \nto estimate will there be more mussels or less mussels after we build a \nnew sewage plant. Guess what. When we build a new sewage plant, the raw \nsewage would not go in the river, which is what we all intend and in \nthe end what will happen but, in the meantime, we waste time and money.\n  This small town of about 300 people is going to have to spend \n$100,000 on an EPA study to hire someone to count the mussels. While \nthey are counting the mussels, they are going to have to hire someone \nto count the Indian artifacts and look for Indian arrowheads. If they \nfind an arrowhead, it may delay it indefinitely. We have gone crazy as \na country. We all want some rules. We don't want anyone to pollute our \nneighbor's property, but the EPA is out of control.\n  What we need to do is in emergencies or urgencies, when a bridge \ncollapses or a roadway is washed away, we don't need to spend 1 year or \n2 or 4 or 5 years doing an EPA study, which basically enriches some \ncontractor that counts the mussels. We don't need to be counting the \nmussels in this stream. We need to get to repairing the bridge, which \nwe are going to do anyway. We are just going to waste 1 year counting \nthe mussels and paying some contractor $100,000 a year.\n  So this amendment would allow States to opt out. The bridge we have \nout in Kentucky has two communities. Many people live in one community \nand have to drive to the other community. They can't get there because \nof the bridge. Do we want to wait 1 year because they have to count how \nmany barnacles are on the bridge?\n  This is a commonsense resolution that should pass, but I will tell \nyou the way Washington works, the other side doesn't want my amendment \nto pass, even though it has common sense, so they are going to offer an \nalternative. Their alternative is to say something but do nothing. It \nis called a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. They will proudly proclaim \nwe need to make it better, and, please, Mr. Regulator, make it better. \nBut they will not change the law.\n  Mine would actually change the law to allow communities to start \nrebuilding their bridge or repairing their road almost immediately, in \nthe same location, free of the government regulations. We need to do \nthis at all levels. This is a very small incremental step forward. It \nis something on which we should all agree. If we watch the vote later \non today, we will find out we don't all agree and, instead, the other \nside is going to say: Say something; do nothing.\n  This is something we need to, as a society, get started on because we \nare being killed by regulations. This is one small step on something \nthat should be bipartisan. There are many more steps that need to be \ntaken, because throughout our country millions of jobs are being lost \nfrom overzealous regulators. Millions of people's privacy and private \nproperty rights are being invaded by these regulators, and this is a \nvery small incremental stop of the encroachment of these regulators.\n  I urge support of my amendment 1556, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend to withdraw the request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator withdraw his \nrequest for a quorum call?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1816\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. First of all, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \ncall up Boxer amendment No. 1816, and I ask the clerk report the \namendment by number.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \nreport the amendment by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1816.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Federal agencies \n  should ensure that all applicable environmental reviews, approvals, \n licensing, and permit requirements under Federal law are completed on \n          an expeditious basis after a disaster or emergency)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 15__. SENSE OF SENATE CONCERNING EXPEDITIOUS COMPLETION \n                   OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS, APPROVALS, LICENSING, \n                   AND PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Federal agencies \n     should--\n       (1) ensure that all applicable environmental reviews, \n     approvals, licensing, and permit requirements under Federal \n     law are completed on an expeditious basis following any \n     disaster or emergency declared under Federal law, including--\n       (A) a major disaster declared by the President under \n     section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170); and\n       (B) an emergency declared by the President under section \n     501 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5191); and\n       (2) use the shortest existing applicable process under \n     Federal law to complete each review, approval, licensing, and \n     permit requirement described in paragraph (1) following a \n     disaster or emergency described in that paragraph.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I just have to say Senator Paul's \namendment is a broad overreach that would endanger the health and \nsafety of the people he represents, whom I represent, and every Senator \nrepresents. What I have is essentially a side-by-side amendment that \nencourages and tells the agencies the Senate supports a very speedy \nprocess, which is already in the law, to review and approve health and \nenvironmental protections when we have to rebuild.\n  The current law is flexible. If we look at the reconstruction of the \nbridge in Minnesota, everybody knows what happened there. It collapsed \nin August\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n2007, and the bridge was completely replaced by September 2008, without \nthese Draconian types of measures that my friend puts forward. In other \nwords, he is looking for a problem. The fact is we were able to see \nthat bridge rebuilt in 1 year. That is amazing. No environmental laws \nwere waived. People worked and made sure they all were expedited. So \nthere is a difference between expediting a review, which we support. As \na matter of fact, the underlying bill is very strong on that. We \nexpedite reviews without giving up anything for the people. They can \nstill make sure their rights are protected.\n  Let's say a highway is washed away in a flood. If we were to follow \nSenator Paul's advice on his amendment, we would virtually have no \nstudies to take a look at whether it makes more sense to rebuild it \nperhaps just a few feet away from where it washed out. It might avoid \nthen the cascade of water that washed away in the first place. We may \nhave a situation where they are rebuilding a bridge and as they put the \nfoundation in they find out, through these studies--because they \nperhaps were never done before--these bridges are old, that there is a \ndrinking water aquifer right below so if you move that a few feet, you \nresolve the problem. What is the point in not having information and \nmaking a huge mistake and rebuilding?\n  We had a situation right here from an earthquake where we learned so \nmuch after the bridge collapsed; that if we used different materials, \nfor example, it would withstand the next earthquake better. We do have \nearthquakes all the time, unfortunately, in our great State of \nCalifornia.\n  So it is an overreach. It is radical. We don't want to waive all the \nprotective laws that protect the drinking water of our people, that \nprotect the environment. So I hope we will vote against the Paul \namendment--I think it is very important to do that--and support my \namendment, which basically is very clear and tells agencies they should \nuse the most efficient and speedy process under the law to review and \napprove health and environmental protections.\n  The bottom line is our underlying bill already includes significant \nbipartisan reforms that will ensure accelerated project delivery, \nincluding limiting the number of steps needed to clear a project for \nconstruction, easy and early coordination between agencies to avoid \ndelays, incentives for accelerating the project delivery decisions. \nAmendment 1556, this amendment by Rand Paul, walks away from this \nbipartisan approach. It launches a sweeping attack on Federal and State \nhealth and environmental safeguards.\n  When we need to rebuild a project and it involves toxic materials \nsuch as lead and asbestos, they have to be handled and disposed of \nproperly to protect public health. Waiving all these Federal and State \nreviews endangers our people, and I hope we will vote no on amendment \nNo. 1556 and yes on amendment No. 1816.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am not going to call up my \namendment that would limit the tolling federal highways, and limit \ntolling of Federal Interstates under the Pilot Program through which \nthree facilities have been conditionally approved by the Department of \nTransportation. Senator Carper and I have talked, and his amendment, \nwhich would have expanded that, is also filed but is not going to be \nconsidered. Mine also was filed but it is not going to be considered.\n  Here is the point, though. It is time that we have a real discussion \nand a debate about tolling. We need to bring this out. I ask the \nchairman and ranking members of the committee to have a hearing. Let's \ntalk about this.\n  When President Eisenhower said we need a National Highway System it \nwas for the purpose of national security. That was his major purpose, \nbut it has also clearly been a huge help for commerce, the ease of \ncommerce and travel among our States. I don't think President \nEisenhower ever envisioned that a State would then put tolls across an \nentire Federal highway and make the taxpayers--who have paid for 50 \nyears to build these highways, and not just in their States--pay again \nto use them. To me, that is not in keeping with the vision of President \nEisenhower to have a free system that supports national defense, \nconnectivity, and commerce.\n  I am not going to offer my amendment and Senator Carper is not going \nto offer his amendment that would expand tolling. But I do think it is \nessential that we have a new policy for our highways that have been \nbuilt for 50 years to give us the vision that President Eisenhower had \nof a National Highway System. We have completed it, the skeleton has \nbeen completed, now it is time to look at different ways of funding \nthese highways. No. 1, I agree with tolling on one lane where there is \nat least the addition of a new free lane. That is fine so as long as \nyou have the same number of free lanes for the people of the United \nStates who have paid for these lanes and the truckers of the United \nStates who are using these lanes. I do not object to tolling that adds \nnew capacity, but to take all free lanes away and say we are going to \ntoll the truckers and the taxpayers who have built and used these \nfreeways is wrong. I think we should have a policy against it.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee is here, Senator Boxer. I ask as we move through this--and I \ndo hope we have this 2-year bill, and I commend her and the ranking \nmember, Senator Inhofe, for a 2-year bill that does keep our \ninfrastructure going. But I hope in the future, as Congress considers a \nlong-term bill, that we would have a national discussion on tolling. I \nthink we should adopt a policy that says, No. 1, we are not going to \nclog the freeways already built by taxpayers with toll lanes that make \nAmericans pay again; and, No. 2, that we will open up the possibility \nthat States that are donor States, that are giving their hard-earned \ntax dollars to other States that now have equal ability to build out, \nthat they be allowed to opt out of the Federal-Aid Highway Program and \nuse their transportation dollars for their needs.\n  We are a fast-growing State, as is the State of California. We need \nour highway dollars for our own priorities. I think that should be \nconsidered in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Boxer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to congratulate Chairman Boxer \nand Ranking Member Inhofe for all of their hard work on this very \nimportant bill. This legislation is a major step forward toward \naddressing the significant infrastructure needs of our country and \ncreating desperately needed jobs. I appreciate the inclusion of an \namendment I offered which increases the Federal cost share for \nemergency relief permanent repairs in extreme disasters. My intent is \nthat the provision will apply to all open disasters as of the date of \nenactment of this bill.\n  Is this the chairman's understanding as well?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to say to the Senator from \nVermont, first of all, thank you for all of his hard work on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. The Senator focuses on jobs \nlike a laser beam.\n  Yes, the Senator is correct. The intent is that this provision would \napply to all open disasters which would include the States which were \npummeled by Hurricane Irene last year.\n  Mr. SANDERS.

The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1669, As Modified, Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent the McCain amendment No. 1669, as \nmodified, be withdrawn and the Shaheen amendment No. 1678 no longer be \nin order, as these issues were resolved\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nin the managers' package last evening; further, that the Carper \namendment No. 1670 and the Hutchison amendment No. 1568 no longer be in \norder as they no longer intend to offer these amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to each vote and all after the first vote be 10-\nminute votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, can I ask, what is the amendment pending \nbefore the body?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1810\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nquestion is on amendment No. 1810.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1810.\n  The amendment (No. 1810) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1779\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \nnow 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, on amendment No. 1779.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield back all time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1779) was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes of debate on \namendment No. 1816.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I just wish to ask if it is possible, by \nunanimous consent, to permit Senator Carper to speak for 2 minutes to \ndiscuss an issue Senator Hutchison addressed before.\n  I would ask unanimous consent if we could take a break from the \nvoting.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, before I say anything, I would like to \nextend a heartfelt thanks to Senator Boxer, Senator Inhofe and to \nmembers of our staff and your staff for their hard work. This is good \nstuff. Thank you.\n  I wish to take 1 minute or so to talk about an amendment I have filed \nto this legislation with Senator Kirk and Senator Warner, to whom I \noffer my sincere thanks as well as a whole lot of organizations around \nthe country which supported this legislation.\n  Under current law a small number of States around the country now \nenjoy the flexibility to implement tolls on interstate highways. Under \nthe amendment we filed, some additional States could choose to apply \nfor that same flexibility. States would only use the toll revenues--a \ntype of user fee--to pay for additional transportation investments \nalong those roads that are actually being tolled.\n  In Delaware and a handful of other States, interstate toll revenue is \nan important part of the State's transportation budget. Senators Kirk, \nWarner, and I believe other States should have the same option \navailable to them. However, in an effort to move this critical \ntransportation legislation forward, Senator Hutchison and I have both \nagreed not to offer our competing amendments to the bill.\n  That being said, I filed this amendment, in part, because Congress \nneeds to face the facts when it comes to transportation funding and \ndeclining gas tax revenues. If we are using less gas due to more \nenergy-efficient vehicles, the cost of roads, highways, bridges, and \ntransit continues to go up and we need to continue to pay for them. We \ncannot just keep borrowing money from around the world to do that. If \nwe want to pass another Transportation bill when this legislation we \nare debating expires in 2 years, we must address structural flaws in \nthe highway trust fund that are making long-term investments nearly \nimpossible.\n  Our respective amendments are at odds with one another, but I hope \nthey represent the beginning of an honest and important conversation \nabout our Nation's long-term transportation needs and how we pay for \nthem in a fiscally responsible way.\n  With that, I am pleased to yield the floor to whoever seeks \nrecognition.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1816\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1816 \noffered by the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we have two choices on how to handle \nrebuilding and maintaining infrastructure, whether it occurs after an \nemergency or is just in the stream of regular maintenance.\n  What we have done in this bill is extraordinary, and I think everyone \nwould admit we have speeded up the approval process for all \nconstruction in the underlying bill. This was a hot issue. Senator \nInhofe and I were coming from different places, but we reached strong \nagreement, and what we said in our amendment No. 1816 is that we \nencourage and support what we have done in the underlying bill and tell \nthe agencies that after a disaster to move as fast as they can while \nprotecting the people.\n  What Senator Paul does in his amendment, it doesn't apply just after \na disaster, it is anytime. So you could be fixing any problem that \ninvolves the most toxic materials and all the laws are waived. It is an \noverreach. It is radical. I would urge an ``aye'' vote on the Boxer \namendment and a ``no'' vote on the Paul amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we have a bridge out between Marshall \nCounty and Trigg County. It takes 1 hour to go around the lake. What we \nare asking for is an exemption from onerous and overzealous regulations \nthat can slow the process of rebuilding a bridge or road by years. The \naverage time for an environmental review for a construction project is \n4 years.\n  The other side wants to pay lip service. They want to say something \nabout it but do nothing to fix the problem. The people who live in \nMarshall County and Trigg County want their bridge fixed. They want to \nget to work and not take an hour and a half to get to work.\n  The way we fix this is we get rid of the redtape. The way we do that \nis by changing the law. So what I propose is that we vote against the \nsay something, do nothing and vote for a reform that actually has teeth \nand would take away the redtape and allow us to immediately begin to \nrepair our bridges without Big Brother obstructing the reconstruction.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Hatch), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1556, offered by \nthe Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, currently, the bridge between Marshall \nCounty and Trigg County has been collapsed by a disaster. If you were \nto repair your bridges or repair roads that have been washed out, there \nis an enormous amount of government redtape that can slow the process \ndown. On average, to get an environmental study done, it can be 4 years \nat times.\n  This amendment would remove government redtape and allow us to fix \nour bridges when we have a disaster--such as a collapse--and fix our \nroads when a road is washed out.\n  This is different than the alternative. The alternative we just voted \non was: say something; do nothing. This is something that will say \nsomething and do something--an amendment that will get rid of \ngovernment redtape and allow us to repair our bridges in an expeditious \nfashion.\n  Often we wait years to go through the government redtape. This cuts \nthrough it and allows States to immediately repair and replace broken \nor collapsed bridges and roads. I urge support for and adoption of \namendment No. 1556.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Colleagues, I think we are now at the last amendment, so \nplease hear me out. If you care about your constituency, you have to \nvote no on this amendment. The implication is that the Senator is \nwaiving environmental rules, health and safety rules, after a disaster. \nIt is not true. Read the amendment. It is any kind of reconstruction \nfor any safety purpose.\n  If you have a bridge in your great State that is over 50 years old, \nit has lead and it has asbestos. Every health and safety reg that deals \nwith the safe disposal of just those two toxins--let alone PCBs and \nothers--they are waived. One little speck of asbestos in your lungs and \nyou know what could happen.\n  This is an overreach. In the base bill, in the underlying bill, \nSenator Inhofe and I have expedited reviews dramatically. We came \ntogether on it. It was tough negotiation. Stick with us and please vote \nno on this dangerous amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 311(a)(2)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could the Senator restate her point of order?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 311(a)(2)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974 and section 4(G)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go \nAct of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts for \npurposes of my amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 42, the nays are \n54. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having not voted \nin the affirmative, the amendment is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment fails.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my \nopposition to the Roberts amendment No. 1826, which, among other \nprovisions, would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for \ndrilling.\n  I should start by stating that there are several provisions in this \namendment that I would support, such as an extension of tax credits for \nour short-line railroads or those for brownfields remediation expenses. \nUnfortunately, these positives were outweighed by the negative \nprovisions, several of which we have already voted on, including \nKeystone XL and offshore drilling.\n  I guess it is only fitting that, in my last year to serve in the \nSenate, we should be faced with this challenge once again. In 1988, I \ntook up the protection of the Arctic Refuge in my first Senate \ncampaign; and since then, I have made it one of my missions to protect \nthis great unspoiled natural American treasure.\n  Throughout the years, many colleagues have joined together in this \nimportant bipartisan endeavor. Today I am proud to continue the fight \nto protect the refuge alongside my colleague from Washington, Senator \nCantwell, as well as with many others, including the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Boxer.\n  In keeping with Secretary of State George Schultz's dictum that \n``nothing ever gets settled in this town,'' some of our colleagues have \nfound a new way to\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\ntry and open the Arctic Refuge to drilling. Yesterday, they proposed \nthat we tie the as yet unknown proceeds from drilling in the Arctic \nRefuge to the transportation bill that the Senate is now debating. Is \nthere anyone in this chamber who believes that the purpose of this \namendment is to generate revenue to rebuild our Nation's \ninfrastructure? Of course not.\n  Instead, the true purpose of this amendment was to try and package \nthis provision, which has been defeated so many times already in the \nchamber, with other issues that Members may be inclined to support, in \nan attempt to finally jam it through.\n  Well, I can tell my colleagues that no matter how it is packaged, we \nwill remain steadfast in saying ``No'' to drilling in the Arctic \nRefuge.\n  Proponents of drilling use two principle arguments: that drilling in \nthe Arctic Refuge will lower oil prices and that it will be minimal in \nits disruption to the refuge. Let's look at these propositions more \nclosely.\n  With regard to the claim that drilling in ANWR could solve our \nNation's energy crisis, the Energy Information Agency tells us that \npeak production in the Arctic Refuge would be fewer than 1 million \nbarrels per day, and that peak will not be reached until 2030 at the \nearliest. At that point, if we continue our current oil consumption \ntrends, the refuge would only reduce our imports of foreign oil by 3 \npercent.\n  To put this level of production in context, the Department of Energy \nreported in 2008 that: ``ANWR oil production is not projected to have a \nlarge impact on world oil prices. . . . Additional oil production \nresulting from the opening of ANWR would be only a small portion of \ntotal world oil production, and would likely be offset in part by \nsomewhat lower production outside the United States.''\n  Destroying one of the greatest wilderness areas in the United States, \na region often referred to as ``America's Serengeti,'' under the banner \nof energy security would be a dubious proposition under any \ncircumstances. But to do despoil this wilderness when doing so would \nnot really enhance our energy security would be truly senseless.\n  We have plenty of untapped or unused wells and leases on public lands \nthat have potential energy resources. In fact, of the 41 million acres \nof Federal lands that are leased, oil and gas companies are only \ndrilling on about 12 million of those acres. Let's be sure the \nremaining 29 million acres are used effectively before we irreversibly \nruin a beautiful natural treasure such as the Arctic Refuge.\n  Proponents of drilling in the Arctic Refuge argue that if we drill, \nit will only be on this limited strip of land and will not alter the \nlandscape. But the effects of oil wells, pipelines, roads, airports, \nhousing, gravel mines, air pollution, industrial noise, seismic \nexploration, and exploratory drilling would in fact radiate across the \nentire coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.\n  Look at the Prudhoe Bay oil field. When it was opened for development \nin the 1970s, the oil industry argued that it could drill safely and in \nan environmentally friendly manner. What happened? It is a sprawl of \nindustrialization, emits more air pollution than many cities in the \nlower 48, and routinely sees oil and toxin spills.\n  And what about the wildlife, which the refuge was established to \nprotect? Crucial habitat for some of our Nation's most beloved wildlife \nspecies would be destroyed, and sacred land for the Gwich'in people \nwould be forever lost.\n  It makes no sense to destroy this awe-inspiring landscape for oil \nthat won't lower prices for our consumers or give us true energy \nsecurity.\n  We all agree that we have an urgent energy problem in this country. \nHowever, America can balance its energy needs with our conservation \nheritage. We can implement a new, diverse energy policy--one that \ncreates jobs through clean and sustainable energy solutions, even while \nprotecting precious natural resources such as the Arctic Refuge.\n  As I have said every time I have come to the floor to speak about the \nArctic Refuge, the mark of greatness in a generation lies not just in \nwhat it builds for itself, but also in what it preserves for the \ngenerations to come.\n  I want to close by quoting President Theodore Roosevelt, one of our \nNation's greatest leaders: ``Our duty to the whole, including the \nunborn generations, bids us restrain an unprincipled present-day \nminority from wasting the heritage of these unborn generations. The \nmovement for the conservation of wildlife and the larger movement for \nthe conservation of all our natural resources are essentially \ndemocratic in spirit, purpose, and method.'' His words are even more \nrelevant today; and as we consider the issue at hand, I am pleased my \ncolleagues recalled those visionary words and his legacy and voted no \non the Roberts amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted for the Roberts amendment No. 1826 \nbecause we cannot make perfect the enemy of the good. Approving the \nKeystone XL pipeline and increasing access to the Outer Continental \nShelf for drilling are practical steps we should be taking to not only \ndecrease our dependence on Middle East oil but help lower the price of \noil in the future.\n  Unfortunately, in addition to these provisions, this amendment \nincluded several tax credit extensions that should not be extended. Tax \ncredits for energy efficient appliances, alternative fuels, and \nalternative fuel vehicle refueling property should be eliminated \npermanently. The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property tax credit \nis particularly egregious. This credit would provide an additional \nsubsidy to build ethanol blender pumps at private fueling stations. \nTaxpayers already gave over $20 billion to the ethanol industry through \nVEETC alone; they do not need to continue the support of this industry \nby financing its infrastructure build out.\n  Although amendment No. 1826 received my vote, I feel it necessary to \nreiterate my opposition to the extension of these tax credits. \nAlternatively, I support the principles behind amendment No. 1589 that \nseeks to eliminate targeted subsides and lower corporate tax rates.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support our contract with \nrural America for decent roads and explain an amendment the Senate \nadopted last Thursday.\n  Counties lose local tax revenue due to large Federal landholding. So, \nfor over a century, Congress has supported payments to counties to make \nup the difference. Secure Rural Schools and Payments in Lieu of Taxes--\nknown as PILT--continue that important commitment to these communities.\n  Rural counties that are home to large swaths of Federal lands rely on \nthese funds to keep schools warm and keep the lights on at the county \nroad department. These investments are rightfully due to rural counties \nas part of their compact with the Federal Government. These funds \nsupport jobs in Montana, education, and important county road projects. \nFor counties such as Lincoln, Beaverhead, and Ravalli in Montana, these \npayments are a lifeline. My amendment keeps that lifeline intact, and \nit does so without adding a dime to the debt.\n  We are considering a 2-year surface transportation bill in the \nSenate. And let me make clear: county payments are about roads.\n  Secure Rural Schools requires payments to be spent either on roads or \non schools. Over the last decade, over 50 percent of payments went to \nroads. In States like Idaho and Oregon, this makes up 20 percent of all \nhighway spending in those States.\n  U.S. Census survey data suggests that much of PILT is spent on \nhighways too. For example, in Nevada and Iowa, counties spend one in \nsix dollars on highways. In Alabama, Arkansas, and Missouri that figure \nis one in five, and in the Dakotas and Oklahoma, it is nearly one in \nthree.\n  Each of my colleagues has a list of the payments that went to their \ncounties this year.\n  Last Thursday, I and Senators Murkowski, Bingaman, Crapo, Wyden, \nRisch, Merkley, Tester, and Bennet offered an amendment to extend \nSecure Rural Schools and PILT payments for 1 additional year. The \namendment was adopted by a vote of 82 to 16.\n  This amendment was paid for with commonsense offsets. One of the \nprovisions I wanted to highlight is the offset that establishes \nreporting requirements for the sale of a life insurance contract. Even \nthough we know it needs a little fine tuning, it is a tax gap provision \nthat has the support of all the industries affected, and we look\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nforward to working with them to improve it.\n  A second offset provides a new tool for Federal agencies to manage \ntheir workforce as well as for employees to manage their careers. \nCurrently, Federal employees who are eligible for retirement cannot \ncollect their retirement without quitting Federal service. This results \nin a drain on experienced Federal workers. It also encourages employees \nto leave government, even though they may want to stay.\n  This proposal will allow Federal employees to phase into retirement \nby reducing their workload and receive a portion of their retirement \nbenefit. It allows Federal agencies to save money because they don't \nhave to hire new employees and it allows the Federal retirement trust \nfund to save money by paying only a portion of retirement benefits. And \nit is totally optional to the employee, so it is a win for the employee \nand a win for American taxpayers.\n  Another offset in this proposal partially closes a loophole regarding \nroll-your-own tobacco. Congress raised taxes on tobacco to pay for the \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program in 2009. Tax \nrates on pipe tobacco were not increased as much as on roll-your-own \ntobacco; therefore, tobacco companies are selling bags of roll-your-own \ntobacco and labeling them as pipe tobacco. In other words, the pipe \ntobacco is masquerading as tobacco to be rolled into cigarettes to \navoid the additional tax.\n  That isn't right. We should close this loophole. The abuse is so \nprevalent that gas station owners now have cigarette rolling machines \nto facilitate the loophole. A customer purchases a bag of pipe tobacco \nand then uses the machine to roll cigarettes. This provision helps \nclose this loophole by treating establishments with cigarette rolling \nmachines as manufacturers and therefore subject to the Federal excise \ntaxes on tobacco manufacturers. This would raise $99 million.\n  This highway bill was the right place to extend Secure Rural Schools \nand PILT for rural Americans who deserve decent roads.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting my amendment. We have done great \nwork for rural America.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to state my strong support for this \nimportant legislation.\n  In particular, I am pleased that the legislation corrects an \narbitrary requirement by the Federal Railroad Administration regarding \nrolling stock for high-speed rail. As a strong supporter of American \nmanufacturing and high speed and intercity passenger rail service, I \nhave closely followed the grant awards that FRA has and continues to \nmake in this regard.\n  Seven months ago, the FRA awarded nearly $730 million to six States \nto acquire new passenger diesel locomotives and bilevel passenger cars. \nThe new rolling stock will be used on State-supported regional \ncorridors that Amtrak operates in the Midwest, California, and Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  Under FRA's instructions, the States were to consider locomotives \nwith 125 mph capability--even though none of the States have the \ninfrastructure now or in the near term to operate service on these \ncorridors at speed beyond 110 mph.\n  While a 15-mph difference in train speeds may not seem like much, the \ncost difference between 125 mph and 110 mph could be very significant. \nFirst, new advanced 110 mph locomotives will burn less fuel and have \nlower operating expenses. Second, Federal safety standards would \nrequire substantially more funding for States to upgrade the \ninfrastructure needed to accommodate 125 mph trains.\n  With my amendment to S. 1813, States will now be able to fully and \nfairly evaluate capital and operating costs of different U.S. \nmanufactured locomotives that are capable of meeting the statutory \ndefinition of high-speed rail, e.g., operating at 110 mph. A full and \nopen process that fairly considers all locomotives that can operate at \n110 mph will increase competition and ensure we maximize value for \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, we need to bring successful high-speed rail service to \nAmerica soon, with trains built with American technology by American \nworkers. I want to thank the leadership of the Commerce Committee, \nparticularly Chairman Rockefeller for his support in working with me \nand with my staff on this important issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it has now been more than 890 days since \nthe last long-term surface transportation bill, SAFETEA LU, expired. \nAnd what has Congress accomplished since September 30, 2009, when it \ncomes to crafting a new Federal policy regime for our roads, bridges, \nmass transit, and safety programs? Sadly, Congress has managed once \nagain to successfully abandon its responsibility to the American people \nby adopting a series of eight short-term extensions since 2009. In \neffect, Congress has placed our national transportation policy on \n``Auto-Pilot'' for more than 2 years.\n  So my question is this: Why has the time for procrastination long \nsince passed and the time for urgent action finally arrived? First, we \nface the March 31 expiration of the current, eighth short-term highway \nbill extension. So, it is imperative that the Senate approve a new \nhighway bill promptly in order for us to extricate ourselves from this \nvicious cycle of robotically approving short-term extension after \nshort-term extension. That is not legislating and it is not fair to the \nAmerican people. Not at all.\n  Secondly and more broadly, the Senate faces a larger and more serious \ndeadline: ensuring the solvency of the highway trust fund, which has \nbeen the primary funding source for all Federal roads, bridges, mass \ntransit, and safety programs for decades. The trust fund is running out \nof money, and rapidly.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, reports that the \nhighway trust fund will be bankrupt by October, barring action on a \ncomprehensive highway reauthorization bill. If this looming specter \ndoes not signal a clarion call to move a bill, I don't know what does.\n  The legislation before us, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st \nCentury, or MAP 21, is a 2-year highway authorization that takes a \nmodest step in the right direction toward meeting the March expiration \ndeadline as well as the urgency of shoring up the trust fund. Now, is \nthis the bill I wish we were debating? Frankly, I would have preferred \na much stronger, 6-year highway bill--the kind of legislation which, I \nwould like to add, is the norm and not the exception. Indeed, Congress \nhas traditionally approved highway and mass transit bills not by \nlimited extensions or quick-fix panaceas but for the long-term. That \nwas true for the 2005 highway bill, it was true for the 1998 highway \nbill, and it was true for the 1991 highway bill. All of these measures \nwere 6-year authorizations. All of them enjoyed bipartisan consensus. \nAnd what was the result?\n  The longer time frames engendered greater certainty, especially for \nthose States whose expiration dates for construction seasons are much \nshorter. Now, if only the past were actually prologue in this case. If \nonly today we were actually debating a multiyear authorization and not \nputting more dents in the can that we are kicking further and further \ndown the road--a road that needs to be repaired, I might add. If only \nwe were deliberating policy that fostered more than a modicum of \npredictability. But we are not, and that is a problem.\n  It is a problem for David Bernhardt, Maine's transportation \ncommissioner, who has observed that ``given the choice between a short-\nterm and a long-term extension, the long-term extension is preferable \nas it provides more certainty and predictability for our construction \nseason.''\n  It is a problem for the Maine Better Transportation Association, \nwhich has stated that ``Maine's rural transportation system--our roads, \nrail, ports--are woven into the future viability of every Maine \nbusiness; the uncertainty created with no long-term reauthorization \ncreates uncertainty, impeding job creation and investment.''\n  What we have as a consolation prize is a ``accept a half a loaf or \nget nothing'' proposition. So if this venerable Chamber can't muster \nthe will to produce a new long-term highway reauthorization bill--and \nthere is no reason, unfortunately, to think otherwise--then at the very \nleast, can there be any doubt whatsoever that we must break the current \ncycle of short-term extensions and that a 2-year authorization will \nhave to suffice for now?\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\n  As far as the State of Maine is concerned, MAP 21 is a slight \nimprovement over present law. MAP 21's $109 billion in funding for 2012 \n2013 will provide Maine with $195 million this year and $198 million \nnext year, up from the $192 million Maine received last year. While I \nwould have preferred if Maine were receiving larger increases in \nfunding, because its transportation funding needs are serious, I am \nnonetheless pleased to see Maine receive an increase in Federal \ntransportation funding.\n  A strong Federal highway reauthorization bill will help Maine \nmaintain our bridges and roads, while we wait to invest in the future \nfor the demands of the 21st century. We are considering this measure as \na stop-gap at a time when my State of Maine contains twice as many \nmiles of poor roads, 548 miles, as we have of very good roads, only 265 \nmiles, and at a time when 369 bridges are currently classified as \nstructurally deficient, which means that 15.4 percent of our bridges \nrequire significant repair, well above the 11.4 percent national \naverage.\n  Indisputably, the 2-year time frame of this bill is woefully short, \nand in total, this bill fails to make the requisite investments \nnecessary to bolster our transportation infrastructure. That said, \nworking within the strictures of a 2-year authorization bill, there are \nsome elements of MAP 21 that I would like to briefly highlight--\nprovisions I was particularly pleased to see incorporated.\n  This bill reduces burdensome redtape and bureaucracy that represent \nmajor speed bumps in streamlining. For example, it takes the more than \n150 highway infrastructure programs and consolidates them into five \ncore programs that address highway and bridge construction and \nmaintenance, freight improvements, safety, and nonmotorized \ntransportation. These changes will eliminate the bottlenecking \nemanating from Washington and will allow States to focus on their \nindividual areas of concern rather than Federal mandates. As ranking \nmember of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nand one who is fighting tooth and nail to curb meddlesome bureaucratic \nrigamarole, this undertaking is welcomed indeed.\n  Furthermore, MAP 21 rightly places a premium on enhancing vehicle \nsafety by making significant, vital changes to vehicle standards. In \nthe 21st century, cars are no longer just mechanical machines, they are \nhigh-tech, complex systems with the capacity to diagnose and \ncommunicate critical problems and convey that information to drivers. \nThis bill takes this new reality into tremendous account and will \ncodify industry standards for electronic data, providing cars with \nelectronic data recorders that will serve as the black boxes of new \ncars and help investigators determine the cause of crashes and prevent \nfuture accidents.\n  I am also particularly proud of the leadership of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation evident in its \nportions of MAP 21, and for that I want to express gratitude to my \nlongtime friend and colleague, our chairman, Senator Rockefeller, who \nserves with me on both the Senate Commerce Committee and the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Specifically, I want to recognize Chairman Rockefeller for his \ncollaboration with me and for supporting my antifraud amendment, which \nis included in the underlying bill. My amendment will ensure that \nbrokers of transportation services have the skills and knowledge \nrequired to aid in transportation of shipments within the rules of the \nlaw, marking a major reform of the brokering process which will ensure \nthat commercial truck drivers are paid for their work.\n  I want to publicly thank Barry Pottle, president of Pottle \nTransportation in Maine, who brought to light that some fraudulent \nbrokers were successfully contracting commercial truck drivers to \ndeliver freight, but then these brokers would not pay the truck drivers \nfor the work they had performed. In effect, these fraudulent brokers \nwere repeatedly taking advantage of truck drivers. When Barry alerted \nme to this deplorable outrage, I started drafting an amendment to end \nthis scam immediately. I am very pleased this common-sense solution has \nbeen included in the MAP 21.\n  I would also like to thank the bill's managers, Chairman Boxer, and \nRanking Member Inhofe for accepting my three amendments to the bill.\n  The 2005 highway bill provided Maine's Department of Transportation \nwith the flexibility to draw upon Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nprogram funds to cover the operating expenses of The Downeaster, \nAmtrak's passenger rail service in Maine.\n  I am pleased that my amendment to continue this policy, which \nenhances flexibility for States to focus funding on local priorities, \nwas accepted by the bill managers. At issue is an undertaking that \ncurtails congestion and improves air quality in a State that prizes the \noutdoors for recreation and tourism. We certainly did not want to turn \naway passengers coming to and from my State who patronized The \nDowneaster to the tune of half a million trips in 2011--or equivalent \nto nearly 40 percent of my State's population riding the train once in \na single year?\n  In addition, I was pleased to work with Senators Cardin, Klobuchar, \nRubio, Wicker, Rockefeller, and Tester to develop an amendment that has \nbeen accepted by the bill managers that will streamline the process for \nveterans with equivalent military driving experience to acquire \ncommercial driver's licenses, also known as CDLs. I should also thank \nthe many veterans service organizations, including the Air Force \nAssociation, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Fleet Reserve \nAssociation, and American Legion, which lent their expertise and \nsupport to this effort. Furthermore, I would like to thank \nRepresentative Randy Hultgren, whose leadership resulted in a similar \nprovision being included in the House version of this bill, which \nprovided the inspiration for the language before us today.\n  As my colleagues would undoubtedly agree, it is unconscionable that \nour Nation's veterans, including those who have most recently returned \nfrom service in Iraq and Afghanistan, find themselves facing \nunnecessary bureaucratic hurdles as they seek to transition into a \ncivilian profession for which they have already received world-class \ntraining provided by our Federal Government.\n  Instead, at a time when job creation is our No. 1 priority, our \ngovernment should be working to eliminate redtape, delays, costs, and \nunnecessary testing--where it is prudent to do so--to allow veterans to \nquickly pursue and secure employment in the private and public sectors.\n  Indisputably, Congress has made milestone strides over the past year, \nincluding the passage of provisions in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act and the VOW to Hire Heroes Act that require the \nFederal Government to identify equivalencies in military and civilian \njob skills and to carry out a pilot program to reduce or curb barriers \nto providing credentials, certifications, and licenses to qualified \nveterans. These yeoman efforts are vital and timely, and they dovetail \nwith our amendment, which directly addresses one specific opportunity \nto remove roadblocks to veteran licensing.\n  Over the past decade, many of our veterans safely drove large trucks \non some of the most dangerous roads in the world. They have also safely \noperated these same vehicles on local, State, and national highways \nduring their service, demonstrating their capabilities and \nqualifications to operate similar vehicles as civilian commercial \ndrivers. As such, our amendment requires the Secretary of \nTransportation to immediately convene a joint study with the Secretary \nof Defense, the States, and other stakeholders to assess the barriers \nto obtaining a CDL faced by our current servicemembers and veterans who \npossess the proper training and experience to operate commercial \nvehicles. As part of this study, the Secretary of Transportation must \nmake recommendations for legislative, regulatory, and administrative \nactions necessary to overcome these challenges, and, most important, \nupon completion of the study, the Secretary must implement those \nrecommendations for which he has the legal authority.\n  Although specific CDL requirements are a responsibility of the \nStates, our amendment will ensure that the Secretary of Transportation \nand the Secretary of Defense take a leadership role in helping States \nto understand the extraordinary skills and experience driving large \nvehicles that many of our\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\nveterans bring to the table when they apply for a CDL. As a result, I \nam very hopeful that our efforts here will soon eliminate unnecessary \nbarriers to CDL licensing for qualified veterans. And, perhaps of equal \nimportance, by adopting our amendment, we will have established a \ntemplate for legislation that this and future Congresses may follow for \nstreamlining licensing and certification processes for our Nation's \nveterans.\n  Quite simply, our best and bravest deserve nothing less than our \nNation's unwavering support and gratitude upon their return home, in \norder to rightly honor their enormous sacrifices. Frankly, who better \nfor any job than those trained to be the greatest fighting force on the \nplanet?\n  Mr. President, overall, I will agree that in the case of this highway \nbill we cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good--that a 2-\nyear authorization is preferable to yet another round of extensions. \nBut make no mistake, Congress has failed to do its due diligence in \naddressing this highway bill over the last 2 years. It is because of \nthat negligence that we have placed ourselves in the unenviable \nposition of having to play beat the clock, as both the House and the \nSenate must confront a fast-approaching March 31 deadline when the \ncurrent extension expires.\n  This bill represents the best we can offer the American people right \nnow, but it is not and I know my colleagues will agree--indicative of \nthe best this institution can offer. The American people deserve \nbetter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are long overdue to reauthorize our \nNation's transportation programs. The last reauthorization, SAFETEA LU, \nexpired in September 2009. Since then there have been seven short-term \nextensions, and the most current extension expires on March 31. I am \npleased the Senate is finally voting on a bill, S. 1831, Moving Ahead \nfor Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP 21. A path forward for \naction on the House bill is still unclear so we may indeed need another \nshort-term extension.\n  MAP 21 enjoys the strong support of a broad cross-section of \norganizations ranging from the AFL CIO, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nand the American Public Transportation Association.\n  This bill will improve the mobility of people and commerce while \nreducing traffic congestion and improving air quality. Investing in the \nconstruction and maintenance of our roads, bridges, public transit \nsystems, trails, and rail infrastructure means people and goods move \nmore efficiently and that improves our international competitiveness. \nAnd investing in infrastructure will create badly needed jobs. It is \none of the most obvious things we can do to help boost the economy as \nit struggles to emerge from the great recession.\n  So I will vote yes on final passage of S. 1813. MAP 21 is a \nbipartisan, 2-year bill that provides level funding with increases to \naccount for inflation. The bill would provide $109 billion over 2 years \nfor surface transportation programs. Given the difficult budget climate \nthis has to be viewed as a victory.\n  Our State transportation agencies need to be able to do long-term \nplanning and a 2-year bill helps that cause, and is surely better than \nthe short-term extensions we have been living under. Given the negative \nbudget climate and the difficulty we had finding the revenue to offset \nthe highway trust fund shortfall, a 2-year bill is what is possible, \nthough I would have preferred a longer term bill.\n  Under MAP 21's highway title, Michigan will get more than $1.1 \nbillion per year for 2 years, slightly more than under the current \nbill. Under the transit formulas, Michigan is projected to get a little \nover $131.3 million per year for 2 years, a little more than we got \nlast time in formula funds. When it comes to public transit, Michigan \nis an all-bus State except for the People Mover in Detroit. Whereas the \nhighway title takes great pains to ensure that the distribution of \nhighway revenue among States is largely unchanged, the transit title \nchanges the distribution of transit revenue among States to favor those \nStates with rail transit infrastructure over States like Michigan that \ndo not yet have rail transit. In an effort to keep Michigan whole in \nterms of transit funding, I cosponsored an amendment to restore funding \nto both urban and rural bus programs. I am pleased provisions of that \namendment have been adopted in the managers' package.\n  My primary area of concern with this bill is in the formula for \ndistributing funds to States and a lack of true donor equity based on \ncontributions to the highway trust fund. Historically, about 20 States, \nincluding Michigan, have been ``donor'' States, sending more gas tax \ndollars to the trust fund in Washington than are returned in \ntransportation infrastructure spending. Each time the highway bill has \nbeen reauthorized, I have joined Members from other donor States to try \nto correct this inequity in highway funding and we have made progress. \nIn 1978, Michigan was getting around 75 cents back on our Federal gas \ntax dollar. That went up to about 80 cents in 1991, 90.5 cents in 1998, \nand 92 cents in 2005. Unfortunately, there simply isn't enough money \nthis time around to improve the rate of return for donor States without \ntaking funding from donee States, which we don't have the votes to do.\n  Further undermining donor State efforts is the trend starting in 2008 \nof nonuser-fee money going into the trust fund. Before that, the trust \nfund was purely user-fee funded, primarily with gas taxes contributed \nfrom each State. When gas tax revenues started declining with increases \nin fuel economy and people driving less because of the recession, \nbillions of dollars were transferred from the general fund to keep the \ntrust fund solvent. Thus the blurring of the line between what was paid \ninto the trust fund by States versus what is given back to States in \nFederal highway dollars which is now both gas taxes and general revenue \nmonies. This means when calculated in dollar terms, donor States, \nincluding Michigan, are getting back more money than they put into the \ntrust fund, or well more than 100 cents on the dollar. When you look at \nthe percent, or share, contributed to the trust fund versus the \npercent, or share, paid out compared to other States, an inequity among \ndonor and donee States remains.\n  Overall, Michigan Department of Transportation, MDOT, officials view \nthe bill favorably, particularly the program consolidation, increased \nflexibility, realistic performance management, and provisions to \nexpedite project delivery. MDOT's director wrote to me that he is eager \nto see a long-term transportation authorization bill enacted because it \nis vital to providing the stability needed to improve transportation \nplanning and project development.\n  There are no earmarks in this bill and nearly all discretionary grant \nprograms allocated by the Federal Highway Administration would be \neliminated. The result is that most funding is allocated to the States \nby formula.\n  MAP 21 proposes a new core program intended to direct funds to \ninfrastructure segments that are particularly critical to freight \nmovement. It allows the Wayne County Aerotropolis project to apply for \ngrants under the freight program by specifically identifying as \neligible an ``Aerotropolis'' transportation system defined as a planned \nand coordinated multimodal freight and passenger transportation network \nproviding efficient, sustainable, and intermodal connectivity to a \ndefined region of economic significance centered around a major \nairport.\n  MAP 21 makes substantial changes to transportation planning \nrequirements at all levels, including using performance management \nthrough the planning process. It requires that State and metropolitan \nplanning organizations, MPOs, include performance measures and targets. \nAlong with these increased technical responsibilities, the bill raises \nthe designation threshold for MPOs from those serving a population of \n50,000 to those serving a population of 200,000, unless the Governor \ncertifies certain technical criteria are met.\n  This could have been a problem for a number of Michigan mid-sized \nMPOs, including those in Battle Creek, Jackson, Holland, Bay City, and \nSaginaw. The MPOs in these cities have expressed concern to my office \nthat they could lose their MPO designation. They argue that their \norganizations are comprised of local elected officials who are in the \nbest position to determine local transportation needs, and this \nproposal could exclude local officials and their\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\nconstituents from participating in the transportation decisionmaking \nprocess if the Governor does not certify them.\n  I agree that this local expertise in the planning process is valuable \nand that it should be retained. The MDOT officials who work with and \nrely on these organizations assured my office the State would want the \nexisting mid-sized MPOs in Michigan to retain their MPO designation. I \ncosponsored an amendment to grandfather in existing MPOs so that they \nare not at risk of losing their MPO designation and with it the \nplanning funds needed to operate, and I am pleased a modified version \nof this amendment was accepted.\n  I am also pleased the bill includes an amendment I authored with \nSenator Conrad which was adopted by voice vote. It would give Treasury \na discretionary power to fight against tax evasions. Under the PATRIOT \nAct, Congress gave the Treasury the power to take a range of measures \nagainst foreign financial institutions or jurisdictions that it finds \nto be of ``primary money laundering concern.'' The Levin-Conrad \namendment would authorize Treasury to impose the same types of measures \non the same types of entities if Treasury finds them to be \n``significantly impeding U.S. tax enforcement.'' Treasury could, for \nexample, prohibit U.S. banks from accepting wire transfers or honoring \ncredit cards from those foreign banks. This amendment, which is similar \nto a provision that I introduced as part of a broad offshore tax bill \nfor several Congresses, has been scored as raising over $1 billion over \n10 years.\n  I am pleased the bill managers worked with me to include language \nregarding the need to fully use the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for \noperating and maintaining our Federal navigation channels, including \nthe 69 Federal harbors and channels in Michigan. These ports and \nharbors support jobs, advance economic activity, and bolster exports. \nMaintaining these waterways is not only important for our economy and \ninternational competitiveness, but properly maintaining these harbors \nand ports keeps freight off of our highways and rails, relieving \ncongestion and improving the environment.\n  Somehow, keeping our ports and harbors in good repair has not been a \npriority in budgeting and funding decisions. This sense of the Senate \non harbor maintenance acknowledges the shortfall, and states that ``the \namounts in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund should be fully expended \nto operate and maintain the navigation channels of the United States.'' \nThis affirmative statement puts the Senate on record in supporting full \nfunding for our Federal ports and harbors, and is a good step forward \nin addressing this unfair situation. Every year, hundreds of millions \nof dollars collected from shippers are deposited into the Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund but never spent, despite the fact that our \nNation has a significant navigational maintenance backlog. Collecting \nfees from shippers and not using these revenues for their intended \npurpose is not only unfair, it threatens jobs and economic growth.\n  Including this important language in the Senate bill is an important \nfirst step to correcting our harbor maintenance problem, yet much work \nremains. I hope the House will take action on a transportation \nreauthorization bill so that we can work out any differences in \nconference committee. Along with my colleagues, I will be urging the \nconferees to retain and strengthen the harbor maintenance language to \nreflect S. 412, a bill I sponsored and which currently has 35 \ncosponsors, which would provide an enforcement mechanism to ensure that \nall of the funds deposited into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund are \nused for their intended purposes: for the operation and maintenance of \nour Nation's harbors.\n  This bill takes some important steps to support green automotive \ntechnology. I am pleased that the bill supports the expansion of \nelectric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds to be used \nfor new charging stations at existing or new parking facilities funded \nthrough the law. It also includes a provision authored by Senator \nCarper to include vehicle charging and refueling infrastructure \nimprovement projects among the projects eligible to be carried out \nunder the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program.\n  I am proud of the fact that Michigan has two fixed guideway projects \nunder development that will go through the Federal Transit \nAdministration's, FTA, New Starts Program which will provide Federal \nfunding to build them. These projects, one in Grand Rapids and a two-\npart interconnected project in Detroit, will finally bring light rail \nand bus rapid transit to Michigan to supplement our current all-bus \nsystem. I have worked closely with the Banking Committee to secure \nchanges to the New Starts Program that will benefit Michigan's \ninitiatives. I am pleased to report that this bill modifies the New \nStarts Program in a way that is favorable to these Michigan projects, \nincluding the Detroit project which has a more complex set of \ncircumstances.\n  Michigan is developing two connected projects in Detroit: a streetcar \ncirculator that will distribute riders within the downtown core along \nWoodward Avenue, built mostly with private funds, and a regional bus \nrapid transit network on multiple corridors leading into downtown \nDetroit, which will need Federal New Starts funds. Because it is \nlargely privately funded, the streetcar project will be able to advance \nbefore everything is in place at both the State and Federal levels to \nsubmit the New Starts application for the entire program. FTA officials \nhave told me they interpret the bill's ``Program of Interrelated \nProjects'' language as providing ample opportunity for the streetcar \ncirculator project in Detroit's Woodward Avenue corridor and the \nconnected bus rapid transit project in the same corridor to meet the \nNew Starts requirements to apply as a single program and that one \nproject can be built before the other project within a reasonable \ntimeframe and still be eligible. This is reassuring as we work to \nadvance this important project through the New Starts Program.\n  In conclusion, MAP 21 is a consensus, bipartisan bill that represents \nour best hope to get a longer term transportation bill enacted. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it and I hope the House of Representatives \nwill also adopt it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, given that the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee was unable to mark up the National Rail System \nPreservation, Expansion, and Development Act of 2012 prior to floor \nconsideration of S. 1813, I wanted to make a quick statement to thank \nRanking Member Hutchison for her help in reaching agreement on the bill \nso the Senate could consider it as part of this measure. In my formal \nfloor statement, I mention the virtues of and the needs for this bill. \nTo provide more clarity about the Committee's intention with the \nprovisions, I ask unanimous consent that this section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    TITLE V--THE NATIONAL RAIL SYSTEM PRESERVATION, EXPANSION, AND \n                        DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2012\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS\n\n     SEC. 35001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This section provides that the title may be cited as the \n     ``National Rail System Preservation, Expansion, and \n     Development Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 35002. REFERENCES TO TITLE 49, UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n       This section would stipulate that, except as otherwise \n     expressly provided, all amendments in this act would be made \n     to title 49, United States Code.\n\n Subtitle A--Federal and State Roles in Rail Planning and Development \n                                 Tools\n\n     SEC. 35101. RAIL PLANS.\n\n       This section would require the Secretary of the Department \n     of Transportation (DOT) to develop a long-range national rail \n     plan within a year, with the input of Amtrak, the Federal \n     Railroad Administration (FRA), and Surface Transportation \n     Board (STB), and a broad range of industry stakeholders. The \n     national rail plan would implement a national policy and \n     strategy to support, improve, and further develop existing \n     and future high-speed and intercity passenger rail \n     transportation and freight rail transportation. The plan \n     would be subject to refinement by regional and State rail \n     plans.\n       This section would require the plan to have a national map \n     with prioritized designations of existing and developing \n     markets. This section would also require the plan to define \n     corridors and service categories. This section would also \n     specify the content the national rail plan is to address.\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\n       This section would require regional rail plans that would \n     serve to refine and implement the national rail plan, along \n     with a map and phasing plan for new corridors. This section \n     would specify the requirements for regional plans, and \n     require yearly updates to the plans.\n       This section would update state rail plan requirements to \n     require that state rail plans be consistent with regional and \n     national plans, while synching rail with other state planning \n     goals. The section would require state rail plans to refine \n     and advance the implementation of the national rail plan. The \n     section would require minimum standards for state rail plans, \n     along with procedures for review. The section would specify \n     the contents of the state plans. This section would require \n     state plans to identify rail capital projects, along with \n     their potential benefits and financing.\n       The section would institute state and federal transparency \n     requirements for all rail plans, to provide adequate and \n     reasonable notice to comment to the public, other agencies, \n     and stakeholders. The section would also define the terms \n     being used in the chapter.\n\n     SEC. 35102. IMPROVED DATA ON DELAY.\n\n       This section would require guidance from the Secretary \n     within a year for developing automated or improved means for \n     measuring on-time performance delays.\n\n     SEC. 35103. DATA AND MODELING.\n\n       This section would require the Secretary to conduct a data \n     needs assessment to determine what data is needed to support \n     the development of intercity passenger rail. The section \n     would specify the parameters of the assessment.\n       This section would require the Secretary to develop or \n     improve modeling capabilities to support intercity passenger \n     rail development. This section would also require the \n     Secretary to improve benefit-cost analysis guidance and \n     training for applicants to the intercity grant programs.\n\n     SEC. 35104. SHARED-USE CORRIDOR STUDY.\n\n       This section would require the Secretary to conduct a \n     shared-use corridor study to evaluate means to best support \n     the further development of high-speed and intercity passenger \n     rail. The section would specify the content of the study.\n\n     SEC. 35105. COOPERATIVE EQUIPMENT POOL.\n\n       This section would improve the Next Generation Corridor \n     Equipment Pool Committee created by section 305 of the \n     Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) \n     and require that it create an equipment pooling entity that \n     would lease or acquire, maintain, manage and allocate \n     equipment to support State-supported service. Amtrak would be \n     permitted to transfer equipment to the entity.\n       This section would permit the entity to be eligible for \n     intercity passenger rail capital grants.\n\n     SEC. 35106. PROJECT MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT AND PLANNING.\n\n       This section would modify PRIIA to increase by \\1/2\\ \n     percent the amount of appropriations available to the \n     Secretary for project management oversight and joint capital \n     planning.\n\n     SEC. 35107. IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CAPITAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       This section would make improvements and clarifications to \n     the intercity passenger rail, congestion, and high-speed rail \n     grants. This section would amend the cost-share requirements \n     for grants and otherwise prioritize grant funding pursuant to \n     the national, regional, and state rail plans. It would \n     require applicants and recipients to provide sufficient \n     information and justification to the Secretary to assist with \n     grant-making. This section would authorize grants to be \n     transferred to Amtrak if it would facilitate the completion \n     of the grant.\n\n     SEC. 35108. LIABILITY.\n\n       This section would clarify commuter railroads liability \n     standards. This section would require a study regarding \n     options for clarifying and improving liability requirements \n     and arrangements necessary for supporting intercity passenger \n     rail.\n\n     SEC. 35109. DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.\n\n       This section would establish a disadvantaged business \n     enterprise program applicable to rail programs. It would \n     require the Secretary to make at least 10 percent of amounts \n     available from the rail grant programs available to small \n     business concerns owned and controlled by at least 1 or more \n     socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.\n       This section would also require each state to produce an \n     annual listing of disadvantaged small business concerns in \n     the state, along with details. This section would require the \n     Secretary to develop uniform criteria for State governments \n     to use in certifying whether a small business concern \n     qualifies under this section. States would be required to \n     fulfill minimum reporting requirements concerning \n     disadvantaged business enterprises.\n\n     SEC. 35110. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       This section would require the Secretary to complete a \n     study and provide recommendations relating to workforce \n     development needs in the passenger and freight rail industry. \n     The results would be due within a year of enactment and would \n     be submitted to the committees of jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 35111. VETERANS EMPLOYMENT.\n\n       This section would require the Secretary to conduct a study \n     and provide recommendations relating to the best means to \n     provide preference to veterans in the awarding of contracts \n     and subcontracts.\n\n                           Subtitle B--Amtrak\n\n     SEC. 35201. STATE-SUPPORTED ROUTES.\n\n       This section would permit the Secretary to award grant \n     funds to States to cover operating costs that exceed those \n     that States paid prior to the implementation of the cost \n     allocation methodology required by section 209 of PRIIA. It \n     would also require the Secretary to provide transition \n     assistance guidance once the appropriate methodology is \n     completed by the Surface Transportation Board. This guidance \n     would include criteria to phase-out the operating support by \n     2017, a grant application process, and policies governing \n     financial terms. This section would also clarify the criteria \n     for grants, and stipulate that the federal share of costs can \n     be up to 100 percent.\n\n     SEC. 35202. NORTHEAST CORRIDOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS \n                   ADVISORY COMMITTEE.\n\n       This section would clarify the responsibilities of the \n     Northeast Corridor Infrastructure and Operations Advisory \n     Commission and establish a deadline for it to develop the \n     access cost methodology required by PRIIA. It would require \n     FRA to work with Amtrak and the Commission to develop a \n     service development plan and the Commission to develop a \n     long-range Northeast Corridor strategy. It would also \n     establish a deadline for the Commission to complete its \n     Northeast Corridor Economic Development report.\n\n     SEC. 35203. NORTHEAST CORRIDOR HIGH-SPEED RAIL IMPROVEMENT \n                   PLAN.\n\n       This section would require Amtrak to complete a refined \n     vision for an integrated program of improvements on the \n     Northeast Corridor, along with a business and financing plan \n     to accompany it. This section would require the Secretary to \n     provide support, assistance, oversight, and guidance to \n     Amtrak in preparing the plan.\n       This section would require the submission of the plans the \n     Northeast Corridor Infrastructure and Operations Advisory \n     Commission and the FRA.\n\n     SEC. 35204. NORTHEAST CORRIDOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS.\n\n       This section would require the Secretary to complete a plan \n     and schedule for a programmatic environmental review for the \n     Northeast Corridor. This section would require the plan to be \n     completed within 90 days and the full environmental review be \n     completed within 3 years after enactment. It would also \n     clarify that the Secretary shall not preclude making funds \n     available for the purchase of high-speed rail equipment that \n     complies with Federal standards; however, it does not \n     override the Secretary's discretion to awards funds.\n\n     SEC. 35205 DELEGATION AUTHORITY.\n\n       This section would permit the Secretary to delegate to \n     Amtrak authority and responsibility for environmental \n     reviews.\n\n     SEC. 35206. AMTRAK INSPECTOR GENERAL.\n\n       This section would codify the existing Amtrak Inspector \n     General authorization of appropriations from PRIIA and \n     reaffirm the office's responsibilities. This section would \n     also clarify the Department of Transportation Inspector \n     General's and Amtrak Inspector General's ongoing duty to \n     assess the progress made by DOT and Amtrak in implementing \n     PRIIA.\n\n     SEC. 35207. COMPENSATION FOR PRIVATE-SECTOR USE OF FEDERALLY-\n                   FUNDED ASSETS.\n\n       This section would affirm that the Secretary may require \n     that private entities taking exclusive use of capital assets \n     built or improved with federal funds provide compensation to \n     the United States. This section is intended to discourage the \n     practice of selling or leasing passenger rail infrastructure \n     built with Federal funding to a private entity so that it can \n     increase profits for its shareholders, rather than use \n     profits to further the public's demand for a better passenger \n     rail system. This section is intended to encourage \n     responsible public private partnerships that will help deploy \n     a more robust intercity and high-speed rail system in the \n     United States and protect taxpayer investment into this \n     system. Alternatively, the Committee feels that, instead of \n     always requiring the private entity to pay back funds to the \n     Treasury, at times it may be appropriate that the Secretary \n     require that the entity invest those funds back into the \n     passenger rail system to help expand capacity and \n     performance.\n\n     SEC. 35208. ON-TIME PERFORMANCE.\n\n       This section would prohibit Amtrak from paying host \n     railroads incentive payments where the on-time performance of \n     any intercity passenger rail train averages less than 80 \n     percent for any two consecutive quarters and the failure to \n     meet such performance levels is solely the responsibility of \n     the host railroad.\n\n     SEC. 35208. BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\n\n       This section would make a technical correction to PRIIA to \n     ensure the proper political balance on the Amtrak Board of \n     Directors.\n\n                  Subtitle C--Rail Safety Improvements\n\n     SEC. 35301. POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL.\n\n       This section would clarify the Secretary is permitted to \n     review amendments to positive train control (PTC) \n     implementation plans and would establish time frames for \n     those review. This section would also require an annual \n     review of compliance with plan.\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\n       This section would require revise the deadline for the \n     Secretary to report on the progress of railroad carriers in \n     implementing PTC systems to June 30, 2012. This section would \n     also grant the Secretary authority to extend the \n     implementation deadline for a passenger rail service entity \n     in yearly increments after the Secretary makes a \n     determination that implementation is infeasible for reasons \n     beyond the entity's control, but in no case beyond December \n     31, 2018. This section requires that, in evaluating whether \n     to grant an extension, the Secretary consider the risk level \n     of the lines for which the rail carrier is seeking the \n     extension.\n\n     SEC. 35302. ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY FOR RAILROAD \n                   REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT FINANCING.\n\n       This section would make explicit that positive train \n     control system costs are eligible for Railroad Rehabilitation \n     and Improvement Financing (RRIF). It would also permit costs \n     of labor and materials associated with installing positive \n     train control to be considered collateral of the purposes of \n     the RRIF loan program.\n\n     SEC. 35303. FCC STUDY OF SPECTRUM AVAILABILITY.\n\n       This section would require the Secretary and Chairman of \n     the Federal Communications Commission to conduct an \n     assessment of the spectrum needs and availability for \n     implementing PTC systems, and issue recommendations to \n     resolve problems.\n\n                        Subtitle D--Freight Rail\n\n     SEC. 35401. RAIL LINE RELOCATION.\n\n       This section would make improvements to the Rail Line \n     Relocation grant program.\n\n     SEC. 35402. COMPILATION OF COMPLAINTS.\n\n       This section would require the Surface Transportation Board \n     to establish and maintain a database of complaints received, \n     and post the list quarterly on the STB's website. This \n     section would require the Board to receive the permission of \n     those submitting informal complaints for them to be posted.\n\n     SEC. 35403. MAXIMUM RELIEF IN CERTAIN RATE CASES.\n\n       This section would revise the maximum amount of rate relief \n     available to railroad shippers. The section would also \n     establish periodic reviews by the Board and revise the \n     amounts as necessary.\n\n     SEC. 35404. RATE REVIEW TIMELINES.\n\n       This section would establish specific timelines for the STB \n     to follow in stand-alone rate challenges. The deadlines would \n     apply, unless a request from a party or due process issues \n     are an issue.\n\n     SEC. 35405. REVENUE ADEQUACY STUDY.\n\n       This section would require the STB to initiate a study to \n     provide further guidance on how to apply its revenue adequacy \n     constraint. It would require the STB to consider whether to \n     apply the revenue adequacy constraint using a replacement \n     costs to value the assets. The study would provide public \n     notice, comment, and an opportunity for hearings. The study \n     would be due within 180 days of enactment, and the results \n     would be reported to the committees of jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 35406. QUARTERLY REPORTS.\n\n       This section would require the STB to provide quarterly \n     reports to the committees of jurisdiction on its progress \n     toward addressing issues raised in unfinished regulatory \n     proceedings.\n\n     SEC. 35407. WORKFORCE REVIEW.\n\n       This section would require the Chairman of the STB to \n     conduct a review of the Surface Transportation Board \n     workforce, and would require the Chairman to use the review \n     to assist in the development of a comprehensive, long-term \n     human capital improvement plan.\n\n     SEC. 35408. RAILROAD REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT \n                   FINANCING.\n\n       This section would allow the Secretary to accept the net \n     present value of a future stream of state or local subsidy \n     income as collateral to secure a loan for railroad \n     rehabilitation and improvement. It would also require the \n     Secretary to submit a report to relevant Committees with \n     recommendations for improving the Railroad Rehabilitation and \n     Improvement Financing program.\n\n                   Subtitle E--Technical Corrections\n\n     SEC. 35501. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS.\n\n       This section would make numerous technical corrections to \n     PRIIA legislation, and to Title 49 of the U.S. Code.\n\n     SEC. 35502. CONDEMNATION AUTHORITY.\n\n       This section would correct an existing reference to the \n     Interstate Commerce Commission in statute.\n\n  Subtitle F--Licensing and Insurance Requirements for Passenger Rail \n                                Carriers\n\n     SEC. 35601. CERTIFICATION OF PASSENGER RAIL CARRIERS.\n\n       This section would require the STB to establish a \n     certification process to authorize a person to provide \n     passenger rail transportation over a line subject to the \n     Board's jurisdiction. It would also grant the Board authority \n     to grant certificates and issue regulations relating to the \n     safety and insurance operations of passenger rail entities, \n     including Amtrak. It would not apply to freight railroads \n     providing or hosting passenger rail transportation over its \n     own line, tourist, historical, or excursion passenger rail \n     transportation, or other railroad that has obtained \n     construction or operating authority from the Board. The \n     provision is intended to make sure that passenger rail \n     operators, are sufficiently qualified, which is consistent \n     with the Federal government's authority in other \n     transportation industries.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, every day tens of millions of \nAmericans take to the roads, board buses, use Amtrak, to get to work, \ndrop off their kids at school, or visit friends and family. Our \ntransportation system binds our vast and diverse Nation together.\n  All too often, our crumbling and inadequate transportation \ninfrastructure makes all of these daily trips nothing short of \nunbearable. This issue is more than just a problem of personal \ninconvenience. Our aging transportation system is costing our economy \nwith lost productivity. It is hurting our ability to export goods. It \nis precluding us from generating the economic growth necessary to \ncreate the jobs our economy needs.\n  There is no disagreement that we need to improve the efficiency and \ncapacity of our transportation system. We have heard a lot in the \ndebate over this bill about the need to rebuild our crumbling bridges \nand expand our congested highways. But we also need to make sure that \nwe have the safest transportation system possible.\n  Safety is not an ancillary part of this debate. Reducing the number \nof fatalities on our nation's roads and rails must be the focus of this \nbill as it has been for previous transportation bills. It is one of the \nmost important responsibilities we have in Congress.\n  That is why I am here.\n  I am proud that the Commerce Committee plays the central role in \nimproving the safety of not only our transportation system, but the \nvehicles that travel upon it.\n  Consider this: More than 90 Americans a day die on the road. This \nbill aims to bring that number down. Horrific bus crashes, as my \ncolleague from Texas knows all too well, have happened in every State. \nThis bill includes provisions from Senator Hutchison that sets new \ntough standards for their safety. Hazardous materials, including deadly \nchemicals and explosives, move alongside minivans and motorcycles. This \nbill sets standards to improve the safety of their transport to \nminimize the risks to the public. The rail system has proven to be \nrelatively safe but all too avoidable accidents happen--both in \npassenger and freight rail. This bill sets higher standards for safety.\n  The dangers and challenges never stop. And so we need to step up, \nrespond to what is happening and make our transportation system as safe \nas it can be.\n  Let me offer some specifics about what exactly is in the Commerce \ntitle of bill.\n  We have the safety programs of the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, or NHTSA, as we call it around here.\n  NHTSA has led the way in raising safety standards on our roads and \nhighways. Last year, highway deaths fell to their lowest levels in more \nthan 60 years. But by reasonably asking more, we can save more lives.\n  Some of NHTSA's most visible efforts center on reducing drunk driving \nfatalities. Last year, they dropped 5 percent, which is good but again \nwe can do more. We can prevent more senseless deaths from drunk \ndriving. We can make sure fewer families have to suffer the agony of a \nteenager's life cut short by a drunk driver.\n  This bill recognizes the success and builds on it with new grant \nprograms and help for States to reduce drunk driving and increase \nseatbelt use.\n  It has an entire section on distracted driving, a growing crisis in \nthis country that killed 3,000 people last year. Think about that: \n3,000 people across the country dead because drivers were not paying \nattention to the road.\n  My State, West Virginia, is proactive on this. The General Assembly \nhas tackled the issue and things will get better. This bill follows the \nsame path: it creates grants so that States can fight this just as they \nhave with drunk driving and seatbelt use.\n  This bill also gives new authority for the government to control \nimports of defective motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment. Again, \nour priority is safety and it is something that I am proud to \nemphasize.\n  Let me tell you about another section in this bill. It's the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, which is aimed at reducing \ntruck and bus crashes.\n  Did you know truck crashes killed 3,675 people on our highways in \n2010\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nalone? The death toll is going up even though overall traffic \nfatalities are down. We need to reverse this trend.\n  In this bill, we work towards safer roads through the use of \nmodernized technology and data. For example, we can put electronic on-\nboard recorders on buses and trucks to cut back on fatigue-related \naccidents. These ``black boxes'' will make our highways safer and we \nmust embrace the technology.\n  There is more to the Commerce Committee's title than just vehicle \nsafety provisions. Our bill includes the Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Safety Improvement Act, which requires uniform standards \nfor the safe loading and unloading of hazardous materials on and off \nrail tank cars and cargo tank trucks.\n  In this bill we make commonsense improvements to safety, such as \nestablishing a program where shippers can electronically share \ninformation with carriers, emergency responders and enforcement \npersonnel.\n  Also, included is a provision to assist with the data collection that \nwill help DOT make smart investments; this authorizes DOT's Research \nand Innovative Technology Administration, RITA, and enhances its \nability to spur innovation in transportation research.\n  I started my remarks by talking about how often our roads are \noverlooked. We collectively drive on 90,000 miles of crumbling highways \nand under and over 70,000 structurally damaged bridges. Our neglected \ninfrastructure costs us $130 billion a year. We deserve better and this \nbill will get us there.\n  In closing, I want to make two final points.\n  First I would like thank all of my colleagues for their good word on \nthis effort. Senator Boxer, Senator Johnson, Senator Baucus, the \nleadership, we all worked hard to get to this point.\n  Second, I want to note that the art of legislating is finding \ncompromise and common ground. I know some are unhappy with this bill, \nthere are parts of it I would like to change myself. But the final \nproduct is good for West Virginia, good for the American people and an \nimportant step forward.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to thank Chairman Baucus for the work he \ndid on the Finance title of the transportation bill which we have just \npassed. He and his staff worked with me on a number of amendments both \nin the committee and on the floor, and their hard work has made this a \nbetter bill.\n  I am particularly pleased that Chairman Baucus chose to include a \nprovision of mine which closes the so-called ``Reverse Morris Trust'' \nloophole. This provision has allowed many profitable companies engaging \nin reorganizations to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars in \ncorporate taxes, while loading up companies with debt and laying off \nhardworking employees. This bill would finally stop that practice.\n  I also want to thank Senator Stabenow for graciously agreeing to \nmodify her amendment extending expiring energy tax credits and \ndeductions at my request so that the mine safety equipment and mine \nrescue team training tax incentives I have long championed could be \nincluded. These energy-related provisions should be a part of any tax \nextenders package and Senator Stabenow and her staff worked closely \nwith me to try and advance mine safety through this bill and their \nefforts are much appreciated. Though her amendment was defeated, we \nwill continue to work together to extend these important credits along \nwith the alternative fuels tax credits--which support coal based \nfuels--and the refined coal tax credit which were also included in her \namendment.\n  I will also briefly mention two items that were not included in this \nbill, both of which I filed as amendments at the Finance Committee's \nmark-up, that I hope to see acted upon this year.\n  One is the Steel Industry Fuel Tax Credit which expired at the end of \n2010. This credit, which I have worked with a number of members of this \nbody to enact and extend over the years, including the Finance \nCommittee's ranking member, Senator Hatch, provides an important \nincentive to one our Nation's most important sectors, the steel \nindustry. This credit encourages companies engaged in steel production \nto use a recycling process that both produces reliable energy and makes \neach plant more environmentally sound. I intend to advocate for this \ncredit's reinstatement and hope that it will be included in a tax \nextenders package later this year.\n  Finally, I want to mention an issue of great importance not only to \nWest Virginia but a number of States around the country. Multi-employer \npension plans have come under increased hardship in recent years due to \na combination of investment losses and business participants exiting \nthe plans. The victims, through no fault of their own, are retirees. \nUltimately Congress needs to address pension stability for all \nretirees, but in the meantime, I have introduced S. 621, the Coalfield \nAccountability and Retired Employee Act. This legislation would \nsafeguard the pensions of retired mineworkers--the hard working men and \nwomen who have helped power this country.\n  If the government does not work with multi-employer plan participants \nand employers, these retirees face the risk of reduced benefits down \nthe road, and the Federal Government risks assuming billions of dollars \nof liabilities. This legislation is important to the people of my State \nand I will continue to work to prevent these retirees from losing the \nbenefits they worked so hard to earn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will take just a minute to talk about the \nbill we are going to vote final passage on in just a few minutes. I \ncannot say it enough--I have said it a lot, I will continue to say it--\nthis is a wonderful opportunity for the Senate and a great \naccomplishment for our country. What I say just now I have said many \ntimes because it feels so good to say it. One of the most progressive \nMembers of this body and one of the most conservative Members of this \nbody got together and said they wanted to do a bill that was good for \nthe American people, a bill that will save or create 2.8 million jobs. \nWe have had some scuffles along the way, but that is what the Senate is \nall about. The rules of the Senate sometimes demand scuffles, as \ndifficult as they are. We now have a bill that will pass, and it will \nhave a significant bipartisan vote.\n\n  I so appreciate Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe helping us work \nthrough this bill. But for them we could not have done the bill. \nFrankly, Senator McConnell and I could not have accomplished this. But \nwith these two fine Senators working to move some of the obstacles in \nthe path, we were able to do this. As late as yesterday, we were unable \nto get this done. I so appreciate their hard and good work.\n  As everybody knows, I am a very good friend of Barbara Boxer's. We \ncame to Washington together 30 years ago. What a lot of people don't \nknow about is the very close personal relationship I have with Jim \nInhofe. One of the finest letters--and it brings tears to my eyes, \nfrankly--that I received during my wife's illness was a letter from him \nexpressing his friendship to me and, of course, saying they would say \nprayers for my wife. So this is, for me, an opportunity to talk about \nhow good the Senate can be. I am proud of every one of you for working \nour way through this.\n  Before propounding a unanimous consent request, I want to say that \nSenator McConnell and I have reached an agreement on the judges. He \nwill explain it to his caucus, as I will to mine. It is something that \nI feel is in keeping with what we do here. It is like all matters we do \nhere legislatively--it is an effort to work out a compromise.\n\n\n                         Cloture Votes Vitiated\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all of the \ncloture votes scheduled for 2:30 today be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I associate myself with the excellent \nremarks of the majority leader about Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe. \nThey have worked together in a collegial way to bring us to this point \non the highway bill.\n  The majority leader and I have worked out an agreement to go forward \nand handle the judges. Also, I am pleased that he has agreed to turn to \nthe jobs bill next. I think that is something everybody in the Senate \nwill be pleased about. So I am happy to say we have reached an \nunderstanding, which\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\nwe will have an opportunity to explain to our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have learned in my years in the Senate, \nespecially since Senator Leahy took over the Judiciary Committee, that \nI don't do anything with the Judiciary Committee--especially with \njudges--that I don't clear first with Senator Leahy. He has been an \nintegral part of our agreement on the judges issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have had very friendly conversations with \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell during the past couple of days. \nHaving served with both of them for a long time, I know that when an \nagreement is made, it is an agreement we will stick to. I am aware of \nthe agreement. I compliment both the Democratic leader and the \nRepublican leader for their help in moving this forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I simply want to thank both leaders for \ntheir kind remarks. Really, I have to say that Senator Inhofe and I and \nour staffs really became a close family as we worked through this bill. \nI am so moved by the way we were able to come together, all of us. Even \nthose on the other side and this side who had amendments that were \ntough, it was difficult, but we got through it.\n  I urge a resounding ``aye'' vote. I know you will not agree with \neverything, but we tried to work with each one of you. I urge a strong \n``aye'' vote. Let's get the House to pass our bill. This is a jobs \nbill, and 2.8 million jobs hang in the balance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield back our time, but Senator Inhofe \nhas something to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I will make this very brief. \nI appreciate the comments of the majority leader. It was not necessary, \nbut it is very meaningful to me personally.\n  Also, about Senator Boxer, she and I are at opposite extremes on many \nissues. I have always said that conservatives should be big spenders in \ntwo areas: national defense and infrastructure. We have to look at this \nin the future so that we don't have to go through it again. I thank all \nof those on her side and on my side who helped to move this forward.\n  I thank Ruth VanMark, who has been with me for 22 years. She is now \ngetting off of probation.\n  Again, I thank all of you for your cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider and to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am delighted that the surface \ntransportation bill that we just passed includes a very important \nprovision that will help to stabilize the level of contributions that \nemployers will have to make to their defined benefit pension plans.\n  When I talk with employers in Montana and throughout the country, one \nof the biggest drawbacks they cite for sponsoring a pension plan for \ntheir employers and the biggest reason most employers decide not to \nsponsor a plan is the inability to predict how much it is going to \ncost. Employers have to make a guess as to how much their benefits will \nbe in future years, discount that value to the present, and make a \ncontribution today that will meet that obligation. This is all in \naddition to guessing other variables, such as how long their employees \nwill work for them and how long they will live after retirement.\n  We all worked hard in 2005 and 2006 to develop pension funding rules \nthat work, so that assets will be in the plan to meet the employer's \npromise to its employees. However, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 \ndid not, and could not, account for the unforeseeable slide in asset \nvalues in 2008 and now the historically low interest rates that \nemployers have to use in valuing their obligations.\n  As a result of the artificially low interest rates today, employers \nwill have to put about twice as much into their plans this year as they \ndid last year, according to the Society of Actuaries, and that steep \nincrease in required contributions will continue until 2016. There is \nnothing that will discourage an employer from keeping its plan or \ncreating a new one than this kind of steep and unexpected increase in \nrequired contributions.\n  The bill we passed today provides significant stabilization in the \ninterest rates that employers have to use in determining their \ncontributions, and employers will be able to use the rules immediately.\n  I am pleased that we were able to do this for employers. More \nimportant, the provision is good for employees because it helps to keep \npension plans viable. I remain open to other proposals that will help \nemployers to continue to provide a secure retirement for employees and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Today, I voted against final passage of the Transportation \nbill that was considered in the Senate.\n  While modernizing America's infrastructure is an important goal that \ngovernment can play a role in advancing, S. 1813 crashes into our \nNation's hard fiscal realities and makes it impossible for me to \nsupport. The bill spends too much, at a level of $109 billion over the \nnext two years. This is despite the fact that the Highway Trust Fund is \ngoing broke, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that the \nfund will be insolvent sometime in 2013. Sadly, this is not a new \nissue. Taxpayers have already spent $34.5 billion to bail out the trust \nfund in recent years, and I see nothing in this bill that will prevent \nthis from happening again. With our national debt on course to exceed \n$16 trillion by year's end and taxpayers already struggling under the \nweight of Washington's fiscal policies, this legislation paves the way \ntoward yet another bailout.\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\n  Instead of making reforms that empower States instead of bureaucrats \nin Washington, the bill relies on Washington-style accounting gimmicks \nand proliferates costly mandates that sharply raise the cost of highway \nspending to the American taxpayer. I agree with my colleagues that we \nneed to pass a transportation bill, but not when we cannot meet the \nfinancial obligations that the bill requires. Therefore, I did not \nsupport it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1660-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXTENSION OF TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my \ngood friends the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, and the \nChairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus.\n  Earlier today the Senate completed action on a transportation measure \nthat provides for investment in our Nation's infrastructure. The Senate \nworks best when we work together, as evidenced by the broad bipartisan \nsupport for this bill.\n  I would like to take a moment to raise another issue of mutual \ninterest--the extension of tax provisions that have expired or are \nexpiring this year. These provisions, although temporary, are long-\nstanding features of our tax system, including the research credit, \nrenewable energy production and efficiency incentives, and the State \nsales tax deduction. They provide important benefits, not just for \nAmerican families and businesses, but to our economy as a whole.\n  Although we were unable to address the package of tax extenders as \npart of the transportation bill, I was encouraged by the level of \nSenators' interest in extending these provisions in a timely fashion.\n  I would welcome the opportunity to work with my friend from Kentucky \nin finding a path forward soon on tax extenders. It is important that \nwe take care of this early in the year so that taxpayers can plan and \nmake investment decisions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to respond to my friend, Majority Leader \nReid.\n  These tax provisions certainly are important to millions of American \nfamilies and businesses, and I would expect that Congress would act on \nthese sooner rather than later. The uncertainty that follows when we \nallow these to expire and don't allow families, small businesses, and \njob creators generally to properly plan is unacceptable and damaging to \nour economy.\n  That said, there are a number of members of my conference who have \nserious questions about some of the provisions that were voted on \ntoday. For a number of years Congress has reflexively extended all of \nthese measures without any meaningful review or oversight. I know that \nthe Republican members of the Finance Committee would gladly join in a \nbipartisan effort to conduct a much needed critical review of these \nmeasures and recommend to the Senate which should be dropped, which \nneed modification and which are worthy of support as currently \nconstructed. The repeated expiration and renewal of these various \ntargeted tax credits and the fact our corporate tax rate will soon be \nthe highest among our major trading partners underscores the need for \nCongress to take on corporate tax reform at the earliest possible date.\n  So while I join the majority leader in welcoming the opportunity to \nwork together to find a path forward, I would hope that both bodies of \nCongress would have the opportunity to look carefully at what is in \nthis package and see if we can't come to an agreement on what is best \nfor the country.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Republican leader. I look forward to working \nwith him and our Senate colleagues to pass tax extenders on a seamless \nand timely basis. It is important that we provide taxpayers with much-\nneeded certainty.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to thank leaders Reid and \nMcConnell for emphasizing the importance of getting extenders done. As \nwe prepare for tax reform, it will be important for us to examine these \nprovisions to determine whether we are getting the most bang for our \nbuck. Tax reform, however, will take some time and these provisions \nhave already expired. We should provide certainty to taxpayers by \nextending them through this year as soon as possible.\n  These provisions are important to American families and businesses. \nThese provisions include college tuition relief for working families. \nThese are tax provisions that help create jobs, support research and \ndevelopment, and bolster growth of American businesses across the \nglobe. It is also critical for our energy sector. A dozen energy tax \nincentives expired at the end of last year and several more expire this \nyear. Each day we fail to extend these incentives means jobs for our \neconomy. I am glad we are working on a bipartisan basis to extend these \nprovisions and I hope we can do so as soon as possible. We need to make \nsure that taxpayers don't see tax increases because Congress failed to \ndo its duty.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank leaders Reid, McConnell, and Chairman Baucus for \ndiscussing tax extender provisions this afternoon.\n  I want to reinforce a couple of points I raised earlier this year \nwhen the Finance Committee held a hearing on tax extenders.\n  My first point is that the explosion of temporary tax provisions in \nrecent years has been a very notable and problematic trend. The number \nof temporary tax provisions has grown from 42 in 1998 to 154 in 2011. \nNot many people can be found that will say that Congress should \ncontinue dealing with tax extenders in a business-as-usual manner. And \nwe should not continue doing business as usual when it comes to \nextenders. Recently, Congress has allowed important temporary tax \nincentives such as the research and development credit to expire. Then, \nafter the business decisions have already been made, Congress has \nretroactively extended the tax provisions. If a provision is worthy of \nbeing in the tax code, then optimally it should be permanent. For \ninstance, the R and D credit is an extremely worthy provision, and it \nshould be an enhanced and permanent tax incentive. That is what \nChairman Baucus and I have proposed in a bill we introduced in \nSeptember 2011.\n  My second point is that tax incentives play a very important role in \nbusinesses' planning of their affairs, making investments, and creating \njobs. And these job creators don't want bad certainty they don't want \nto hear that their taxes are going up. Congress should provide this \ncertainty by making permanent the provisions that are worthy of \nremaining in the law, and eliminating those that are not. Chairman \nBaucus and I agree, along with many of our colleagues, that the current \ntax code needs to be reformed. In the meantime, before tax reform is \naccomplished, Congress needs to decide what to do about the tax \nextender provisions that have expired. The Finance Committee should \nplay its role in considering these time-sensitive issues. The members \nshould debate the merits of each of these provisions and vote \naccordingly. After that exercise, then the full Senate should consider \nthe Finance Committee's recommendations and move that product through \nthe legislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1660-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I didn't want to take a lot of time before \nthe vote because I knew we were anxious to get it done, and certainly \nwe have been through this so many times--passing a transportation bill \nand a reauthorization bill. I was asked by one of my Republican \nMembers: We have done so many of these extensions, what would be the \ndifference between an extension and a short 2-year bill? I commented: \nYou can't get any of the improvements. You can't do any of the \nplanning.\n  I would also like to say this to my Republican friends: I regret some \nof them voted against it, not being fully aware of some of the great \nreforms we have in the bill. I appreciate the fact that Senator Boxer \nwas agreeing to some aspects that she didn't agree with\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nphilosophically, such as some of the streamlining and enhancements. We \nhave now resolved the enhancement problem so decisions can be made by \nthe States. So I think that was good.\n  I wanted to at this point mention our staff, even though I already \nmentioned Ruth VanMark earlier. I was kidding when I said she is off of \nprobation. She has been loyal to me for 22 years and been through \nseveral of these bills with me. Let me also mention James O'Keeffe, \nMurphie Barrett, Kyle Miller, Dimitri Karakitsos, and Alex Renjel. So \nwe have a great team over here, and, of course, they have a great team \nalso on the Democratic side, with Bettina Poirier, David Napoliello, \nAndrew Dohrmann, Grant Cope, and Tyler Rushforth from Senator Boxer's \noffice.\n  So, Mr. President, some good reforms have taken place, and we need \nnow to get serious about what we are going to do in the next short \nwhile in preparation of a much longer and better and more robust \nhighway reauthorization bill. Of course, first is to get with the House \nMembers, get into conference and see what we can accomplish.\n  Again, I thank all the staff, all the people working on this bill, \nSenator Boxer, and, of course, the majority leader, Harry Reid, as well \nas Mitch McConnell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks Senator Landrieu be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I again thank everybody. During our \nearlier morning business period I praised all of the staffs from both \nsides of the aisle, all of the chairmen, and all of the ranking \nmembers. So thank you so much. It was a great vote, 74 to 22. If \nSenator Lautenberg had been here, it would have been 75. So what more \ncan a chairman ask.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to thank Senator \nBoxer and Senator Inhofe and the staffs of both of those excellent \nSenators who have worked so hard on this bill that is so important to \nour country. From New York to California, from Alaska to Florida, this \nbill represents over $110 billion of investments in America. Whether we \nare talking about two-lane roads, farm-to-market roads, one-lane or \ntwo-lane roads, interstate, or rail that is running in our urban areas \nthat are congested, time consuming, and frustrating for our drivers; \nwhether it is for the trucking industry that depends on good, solid, \nstrong highways; the petrochemical industry, the oil and gas industry, \nor our small businesses, it is important for America's infrastructure \nto be strengthened, and that is what we did today.\n  I know the Senate has been criticized over and over again about not \nbeing able to function. But today we saw, as our leader said, one of \nour most conservative Members and one of our most progressive Members \nbring a bill to this floor and get 74 votes. That is hard work, and \nthat is the way the Senate should work.\n  I am so proud to have been a small part of this overall bill with \nSenator Whitehouse, Senator Shelby from Alabama, and many other \nSenators who joined us in an effort to put on a very important \namendment to the gulf coast and to the country in this Transportation \nbill. That bill, which was adopted as an amendment to the \nTransportation bill, as you know, Mr. President, is known as the \nRESTORE Act.\n  The reason we call it the RESTORE Act is because that is exactly what \nit will do. It will restore America's energy coast--the gulf coast. We \nare proud of our energy infrastructure. We are also proud of our \nfishing industry and our ecotourism industry. We are also proud of our \ncommercial fishing and recreational charter captains who take people \nfrom all over the world off the beautiful coast of Florida, \nMississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas with some of the best \nfishing in the world.\n  We have fisheries that are alive and vibrant, not overfished, with \npeople in business and restaurants serving this food all over the \ncountry. We are so proud to have passed the RESTORE Act, which is going \nto take not taxpayer money, not money adding to the deficit, but monies \nfrom a fine that is going to be levied by the courts very soon--very \nsoon. This fine will be levied against BP because of the single largest \nenvironmental disaster in the Nation's history.\n  BP, an operator of oil and gas wells not just in the gulf but all \naround the world, drills safely in many places. But, boy, they sure \nmessed up this one. There were 11 men killed, others were injured, and \nhundreds of millions of gallons of oil were spilled into the Gulf of \nMexico. It was a horrible accident. It should not have happened.\n  No industry is perfect. No operation like this, whether it is going \nto space or going below sea, whether it is producing sophisticated \nequipment or is involved in the mining or extraction business has a \ncomplete guarantee of safety and perfection. But this was a terrible \naccident. We wish it never would have happened.\n  The courts are sorting out whether this company was simply negligent \nor grossly negligent. We can have our opinions, but it is not something \nwe need to decide. What we did decide, though, is when the court set \nthat penalty, that what is right for the States that were so injured--\nwith marshes inundated with oil, and pelicans, dolphins, and other \nwildlife and birds that live and breed and count on this environment to \nbe there--is for that money to be redirected back to the gulf coast.\n  Because of the good work of our Presiding Officer and Senator \nBaucus--and I want to thank, particularly, Senator Bingaman--we were \nalso able to add--not in the RESTORE Act, not taking money away from \nthe gulf but in a side-by-side--some money to fund the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Now, it is only for 2 years, but there is going to \nbe more money in that fund than has been there for a while, which will \nalso accommodate the environment nationally, and that provides a \nbalance and a synergy.\n  The gulf coast wants to be fair. Our people have suffered. But we \nalso know the country has been very generous to us through a series of \nvery unfortunate events in the last 6 years: Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and \nIke, horrible hurricanes. But every part of the Nation has experienced \ndisaster, whether it was the fires in California or the flooding in the \nNortheast or the hurricane last season that raked the Northeast. Last \nseason, in fact, we will remember, was the season that had the largest \nnumber of disasters. There were 12 that cost over $1 billion. That has \nnot happened before.\n  So lots of parts of the country have suffered. But the gulf coast has \nsuffered in a special way, unfortunately, with a series of events, \nhurricanes, and oilspills. So we are grateful.\n  We tried to make this bill appropriate, leaving 20 percent of the \ngeneral fund, which will secure doubling the amount of money in that \nliability trust fund. That is a benefit to the Nation. We put in some \nmoney for land and water. That will benefit the Nation, and there is \nsome money to establish an oceans trust.\n  I ask for another 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That will benefit the Nation. But the bulk of that \npenalty money will go to the gulf coast, and it will not be wasted, I \npromise. The bill has tight safeguards and guidelines about the way \nthat money will be spent restoring our marshes, rebuilding our \ncoastline; we have lost the size of the State of Rhode Island.\n  I wish to thank so much the groups. There were over 200 \norganizations, from Ducks Unlimited to the National Environmental \nDefense Fund, to Nature Conservancy, to many of the Chambers of \nCommerce, locally and nationally, that supported the RESTORE Act. \nWithout their help, this never would have happened because we don't get \na vote as we did on the Senate floor without a lot of help. We got I \nbelieve it was maybe 76 votes on the floor of the Senate. It is hard to \nget a resolution on mom and apple pie to get 76 votes today. So I am \nvery humbled to say it was the work of many people. I was proud to lead \nthis effort with Senator Shelby, my partner from Alabama.\n  But my final comment is, work needs to be done. That is my final \npoint. The\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\namendment is in the Transportation bill. The Transportation bill has \nnow left the building, left the Senate. It is now on its way over to \nthe House. I hope the House will take this bill--and I know they have \ntheir own opinions about how things should be. But it is important to \nget this $110 billion of investments out for America. We need to keep \nthis recovery going. People are looking for jobs, well-paying jobs. \nSmall businesses get these contracts as well as large businesses for \nour rail, our water, our transportation.\n  I hope the RESTORE Act, because it is safely tucked in this bill, \nwill generate some additional votes on the House side. I hope my \ncolleagues from the gulf coast in the House, Republicans and Democrats, \nwill say: Overall, it may not be the House's Transportation bill, but \nyou know what. It is a good bill.\n  Twenty-two Republicans over here voted for this bill. As Senator \nInhofe said, there is streamlining, there are new approaches, there are \nbetter approaches, less waste, less fraud, less abuse in this bill. So \nthere are some good things they can vote on.\n  I thank, again, in conclusion, Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer and \nparticularly Senator Baucus for his help in helping us, at the very \nend, to put what we needed to get together to pass this RESTORE Act.

Mr. President, the big issue everyone is talking about \nis gasoline prices. Obviously, they are a scourge on average families \nand on our national economy. There are many long-term solutions we \ndebate: the pipeline, incentives for green energy, more exploration, \nnuclear energy, and of course conservation--probably the No. 1 way to, \nin the long term, reduce imports of foreign oil into the country and \nreduce the price.\n  But everyone is asking, what are short-term solutions?\n  To me, there is obviously one that would matter more than all the \nothers and that has the best hope of getting something done. So 2 weeks \nago, in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I asked the \nState Department to pressure the Government of Saudi Arabia to use its \nexcess oil capacities as a means to calm oil markets. It has been my \nposition that this is the quickest way to bring down gas prices, and \nthe reason is very simple. The No. 1 thing jacking up prices right now \nis the fear in the markets that Iran will shut off its production.\n  We have an economic boycott, a majority of nations of the world, of \nIran to prevent them from going nuclear. What are they trying to do? \nThey are saber rattling: Squeeze us too hard, we are going to cut off \noil. In fact, they cut off oil sales to Britain and France, although \nthose are symbolic because Britain and France do not buy much Iranian \noil. But with Iran's saber rattling that they might well cut off oil \nexports, the price has gone up and up and up. Those who speculate in \noil use that and probably have it go up even further.\n\n  So that is why I have been, for the last 2 weeks, suggesting the \nSaudis say they will produce more oil and that they will replace every \nbarrel of production Iran takes off the market for the foreseeable \nfuture with a new barrel. The Saudis of course can do that. The Saudis \nhave 2.8 million barrels of extra production, they and the Gulf States. \nIran's total sales to the rest of the world are 2.2 million barrels a \nday. Therefore, they have the ability to do it.\n  Today I was pleased Saudi Arabia declared it will fill any oil gap as \na result of the Iran oil embargo. At the 13th International Energy \nForum in Kuwait, the largest gathering of oil-producing and consuming \ncountries, the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said the following: \n``Saudi Arabia and others remain poised to make good any shortfalls--\nperceived or real--in crude oil supply.''\n  Right after the Saudi oil minister made this announcement, prices \ndropped 0.6 percent. My belief is that if the markets believe this is \nreal, the price will come down significantly further. So we are asking \nthe Saudis to repeat this promise because, make no mistake, the more \nthe Saudis repeat the promise to offset Iran's output, the more \nexplicit they are, the more emphatic they are, the more they assure the \nmarkets they are for real and that this is not just a psychological \ndevice to calm the markets for the moment, the more markets will calm \ndown more permanently and the more the price will come down.\n  I wish to compliment the Obama administration for doing tremendous \nwork behind the scenes. I have talked to many people in the \nadministration over the last few weeks and they assured me and told me \nsome details of what they were doing and their pressure has finally \ngotten the Saudis to make this statement. This statement is a great \nstart, but as I said, it should be repeated, reemphasized, and \nelaborated upon by the Saudis so the markets will be assured.\n  The President was right on money when he said we also need long-term \nto our dependence on foreign oil. He is right that drilling alone will \nnot solve our problems. We are producing more domestic oil in the \nUnited States than we have in 8 years, and we have discovered a huge \nsupply of natural gas. But we have to look at all fronts. We have to \nlook at green energy, wind, solar. There are tax breaks that encourage \nthese new industries that will employ thousands. We ought to pass them. \nOur colleagues voted against them on this highway bill. That doesn't \nmake much sense. I, for one, would look at nuclear as something that \nproduces clean energy, that doesn't produce global warming. It has to \nbe safe. Of course, we have to continue to look to produce more oil.\n  I was one of six or seven on this side, actually--as the Senator from \nLouisiana is importuning--who voted to open parts of the east gulf to \nproduce more oil and it has begun to do that and that will help.\n  The No. 1 one thing we have to do in the long run is conservation. \nThe fact that we are getting more miles per gallon by 2020 will reduce \nour importation of foreign oil--which raises the price--by more than \n1.1 million barrels a day. In fact, since we gave the President the \nability to increase those CAFE standards further, and he did it, the \nprediction is, by 2030, we will not need to import any oil as our cars \nget 45 and 50 miles a gallon and the demand for gasoline goes down. The \nNo. 1 reason we have to import oil is because of gasoline and diesel \nfuel and airplane fuel. Most of our energy can come from natural gas \nand can come from water power, wind power, and solar power.\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\n  The bottom line: This announcement is a good announcement. I hope the \nmarkets will heed it. I hope the Saudis will repeat it. I hope, as a \nresult, the price of oil will come down. It is the best news on a very \nbad front; that is, of rising gasoline prices, that we have had in a \nvery long time. Let us hope it brings together some good news.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there they go again. On Monday the Justice \nDepartment, under Attorney General Eric Holder, added another account \nto its litany of shameful actions by refusing to preclear a commonsense \nTexas State law that would require all voters to show a photo ID prior \nto casting their vote. The Justice Department's refusal to preclear \nthis change in Texas law by the Texas Legislature is simply \ninexcusable. The Texas voter ID law is constitutional, and it is a \npopular measure necessary to protect the integrity of the Texas \nelection process.\n  This is not and should not be a partisan issue. The polling I have \nseen shows that Republicans, Democrats, and Independents in the 70 \npercent range all agree that voter ID laws are commonsense responses to \nthe concerns many have about the integrity of the election process. \nBut, unfortunately, I can only conclude that Attorney General Holder \nand the Justice Department have chosen the low road of politics as \nopposed to the high road of the rule of law. I believe, unfortunately, \nthe evidence supports the conclusion that this represents the lowest \nform of identity politics. In the face of high gas prices, the sluggish \neconomy, and a struggling and rising national debt, the Obama \nadministration has used every tool in its political toolbox to try to \ndistract the American people from their priorities--jobs, the economy, \nand debt--and, unfortunately, divide the American people while they \ndistract them from the real issues.\n  Political games should not force the State of Texas or any other \nState to spend its taxpayer dollars suing the Department of Justice in \nFederal court, which it now must do, to enforce a State law that is \nclearly constitutional. One does not have to take my word for it--just \nread an opinion by Justice Stevens in 2008 upholding the \nconstitutionality of a similar Indiana law. It is nearly identical to \nthe one in Texas, and it is justified by a valid interest in protecting \nthe integrity and reliability of the electoral process.\n  But the Justice Department continues to insist there is something \nwrong with requiring every voter to prove their identity before they \nvote, just as you are required to do before you board an airplane, buy \na pack of cigarettes at a convenience store, or buy a six-pack of beer \nat that same convenience store. If you look on the Web site of the \nDepartment of Justice, in order to gain entry to the Department of \nJustice building, you need--you guessed it--a photo ID. Well, this may \nsound like common sense. Common sense is evidently not that common at \nthe Department of Justice these days.\n  You would have to be blind to reality to deny that a significant \namount of voter fraud exists in the United States. Every State has had \nits experience with voter fraud.\n  In Texas, back in the famous Box 13 election between Coke Stevenson \nand Lyndon Johnson for the U.S. Senate, they found a number of votes \nfrom voters who were not even alive--dead votes. Perhaps one of the \nmost recent books on this was written by John Fund in 2008, a book \ncalled ``Stealing Elections: How Voter Fraud Threatens Our Democracy.'' \nIn that book Mr. Fund demonstrates why the American people and Texans \nfear that their legally cast vote will be diluted with the vote of \npeople who are not legally qualified to cast a vote.\n  Unfortunately, we also know that identity theft is rampant. We have \nseen this in our broken immigration system, where people claim Social \nSecurity numbers and identification that is not their own but is \nactually someone else's. It is also very difficult to prove because \noften the legal authorities lack what they need in order to dispute a \nvoter's identity, thus the need for a government-issued photo ID. As a \nresult, officials frequently hesitate to accuse someone of casting an \nillegal ballot even when they are almost certain a crime is being \ncommitted. It is easy for identity thieves to use another person's \nvoter certificate to fraudulently cast a ballot when there is no real \nrequirement for voters to prove their identity. We should be all about \nmaking their job more difficult, not easier.\n  Every case of actual, alleged, or perceived voter fraud has the \npotential to drive prospective voters out of the Democratic process, \nundermine the legitimacy of our government, and swing the results in \nclose elections. The Texas voter ID law is necessary to prevent these \nevils.\n  This administration would have you believe that State ID laws are \nintended to drive down the turnout among certain ethnic groups, but \nthis could not be further from the truth. If people are legally \nqualified to vote, this is a law designed to protect their rights and \nto make sure their vote counts and that in a close election it will not \nbe swung by people who have no legal right to vote.\n  In fact, in their own letter to the Texas secretary of state, the \nJustice Department presented no evidence--zero, zip, nada--of \ndiscriminatory intent in the Texas voter ID law. This is because the \nlaw was clearly intended to uphold the sacred principle of ``one \nperson, one vote'' and is narrowly tailored to avoid all retrogressive \neffects on voting rights. For example, under Texas law every registered \nvoter is entitled to receive a photo identification card free. So if \nyou don't have a driver's license and you don't have any other form of \nphoto ID, you can get one for free. It also exempts from its \nrequirement anybody above the age of 70. What is more, let's say \nelection day comes and you don't have a photo ID, but you want to vote. \nYou can cast a provisional ballot even without a photo ID just so long \nas you come back within 6 days and produce one showing that you are who \nyou say you are and thus prove you are legally qualified to vote. The \nTexas voter ID law will also make sure no legitimate voter is caught \noff guard by requiring the State to inform and educate all citizens as \nto what the new law requires.\n  Despite these multiple layers of protection, the Justice Department \ninsists on pushing their false narrative that this law will somehow \nsuppress legitimate voter turnout. Just the contrary is true. The only \nvotes this ID law will suppress are those people who have no legal \nright to vote, and it will protect and preserve the right of legitimate \nvoters to cast their vote undiluted by votes of people who are not \nqualified to vote.\n  We also know there is data from States that have recently passed \nvoter ID laws that demonstrates there is no evidence whatsoever to \nsupport the claim of the Department of Justice that it will somehow \npotentially suppress minority votes. For example, in Indiana the \nsubject of the Supreme Court decision in 2008 was an Indiana voter ID \nrequirement. Election data in Georgia shows that turnout has increased \nsince the passage of these commonsense photo ID requirements.\n  The data also shows that the voter ID laws in Georgia and Indiana had \nno negative impact on minority groups. These findings should be \nunsurprising given some of the research that has been conducted by a \nnumber of universities, including the University of Missouri, the \nUniversity of Delaware, and the University of Nebraska, among others.\n  Research compiled by the University of Denver and the University of \nNebraska from 2000 to 2006 leaves no doubt about the conclusion. They \nsay: ``Concerns about voter identification laws affecting turnout are \nmuch ado about nothing.''\n  In spite of these facts, in spite of the evidence, in spite of the \nlaw, the Holder Justice Department continues to cling to their false \nnarrative, claiming that Texas has not demonstrated significant enough \nevidence of voter fraud to justify its voter identification law. That \nturns the law of the land on its head.\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\nTexas is not required to prove to the satisfaction of Eric Holder and \nthe Justice Department that there is sufficient basis for them to pass \na State law. As the occupant of the chair knows as a former attorney \ngeneral of his State, the burden is on those who would contest the \nconstitutionality of the law to prove it is unconstitutional or to \notherwise prove that it violates Federal law. Under Attorney General \nHolder's view, the State of Texas and any State that passes a voter ID \nrequirement is presumed guilty until proven innocent. As I said, that \nturns the legal question on its head. It is exactly the opposite of \nwhat it should be.\n  The Department of Justice also conveniently fails to mention that \nvoter impersonation is almost impossible to detect or prove without a \nphoto ID requirement such as the one passed by the Texas legislature. \nThey similarly fail to mention that this type of law is perhaps the \nbest way--the least burdensome way, the least intrusive way--to \neliminate in-person voter fraud. Why would the Justice Department want \nto prevent States such as Texas from enforcing laws that help detect \nand deter voter fraud? I can't find an answer to that any other way \nother than to say that it is pure politics.\n  The Federal Government should be doing everything in its power to \nencourage States to protect the integrity of the ballot, to make sure \nthat every legitimate voter's vote counts and is not diluted by the \nillegal vote of someone who is not qualified under the law to cast a \nballot. Instead, Eric Holder's Justice Department is throwing up \nroadblocks to those State-based efforts to protect the integrity of the \nelection process, forcing my State and taxpayers in my State to waste \nmoney to try to go to court and now to override his decision, which the \nCourt will do. Why will they do that? How can I be so sure? Because the \nU.S. Supreme Court is the law of the land, not Eric Holder and not the \nJustice Department, and the Supreme Court has spoken on this issue. But \nthat is irrelevant to Mr. Holder and the Justice Department, so my \nState has to spend--waste, really--taxpayer money to defend this \nlegitimate and evenhanded requirement when we should be focusing on \nother important issues.\n  This Washington game of divisive identity politics is reprehensible, \nand Attorney General Holder should be ashamed of himself for engaging \nin it. I hope my colleagues will join me in calling on Attorney General \nHolder to respect the rights of the people of Texas and of their States \nby reversing his decision to block our commonsense voter identification \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to praise the majority and \nminority leaders for coming together to make sure we get our pending \njudicial nominees confirmed in a timely manner.\n  Today, the Senate is back on track to do what we have always done for \ndecades: confirm judicial nominees--the vast majority of whom are \ntotally uncontroversial--as part of our day-to-day business.\n  Thanks to the hard work of the leaders of both caucuses, and to \nChairman Leahy, who has been persistent and smart and focused on this \nissue, we were able to avoid having 17 cloture votes this afternoon on \njudicial nominees--most of whom were unopposed; 13, in fact, were \nsupported by their Republican home State Senators.\n  While the details of the agreement have not yet been announced \npublicly--and they will be by Senator Leahy and Leader Reid and Senator \nMcConnell--we know there is an agreement, and that is a good thing.\n  The bottom line is, I hope we can continue at least at the same pace, \nwhen we have cleared the backlog that has existed.\n  Let's be clear: This is what doing our job is, and it is doing \nexactly what we have done literally for decades--nothing more, nothing \nless. I suppose each side could point fingers at the other as to why \nthis degenerated, but that is not the point today. The point today is \nthat we have come to an agreement and, hopefully, it will set the ball \nrolling on much smoother approvals of judicial nominees in the future, \nwith less altercation, more comity, and actually filling the bench more \nquickly.\n  There are more judicial vacancies now than at any time in recent \nhistory. One out of every 10 judgeships is empty. As a result of these \nvacancies, families and business must wait sometimes over 2 years \nbefore their civil trial can even start. Even worse, it cost the \ngovernment $1.4 billion in 2010 alone to detain inmates awaiting trial \nbecause there were not enough Federal judges to hear their cases.\n  The agreement we have reached to work through these judges is \ncertainly not an attempt to jam judges through the process. In one day \nin 2002--we were here in the Senate--we confirmed 17 district court \nnominees and 1 circuit court nominee.\n  I am glad we have come to an agreement. I want to give special thanks \nto my good friend, Senator Alexander of Tennessee. He and I have talked \nabout this for a long time. I know he has talked to Senator McConnell. \nI have talked to Chairman Leahy and Leader Reid. His encouragement to \nmove us forward has been very helpful indeed.\n  Let us talk just about district court nominees for a moment.\n  The vast majority of Americans want us to confirm good, moderate, \npragmatic judges to the U.S. district courts--exactly the nominees whom \nthis President has put forward. After all, judges on the district court \ndo not make law. Courts of appeals and the Supreme Court have a little \nmore latitude, depending on the case.\n  I have said time and time again--I will say it again--the Senate has \nan obligation to take a hard look at the President's judicial nominees. \nMy view remains that ideology does matter. Every Senator here has the \nright to make sure that a President's judicial nominees are within the \nmainstream. And the definitions of ``mainstream'' sometimes differ. We \nknow that.\n  There will always be nominees--especially to the courts of appeals--\nabout whom we will disagree. There will even be those who some of us \nview as so extreme, on either side, that we will refuse to give our \nconsent to holding an up-or-down vote.\n  But there is a hard look, and then there is purposeful delay, and we \nhave to avoid that by either party at all costs. We need to get the \nprocess moving again. When nominees come out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously or by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, there is no reason \nthey cannot be approved on the floor a few days later.\n  We have come together today. I know we can continue in the future to \nagree to confirm qualified judges without further obstruction, without \nfurthering the view ``it is my way or the highway.''\n  I wish to mention one specific way I think we can move forward on \njudicial confirmations in a meaningful and useful way. In the past, we \nhave cleared the calendar of nominees on whom there is a consensus \nbefore going out for recess. Lately, we have not done that. As a \nresult, there were 20 nominees who did not get confirmed before last \nAugust and 10 from December.\n  I hope wherever we are at the end of the summer, we can agree to \nconfirm consensus nominees--those who got unanimous support or close to \nit--as we always have in the past and fulfill our obligation to the \nthird branch of government.\n  One other point. Today, this morning, we passed a highway bill, \noverwhelmingly. It was led by Senator Boxer, one of the most liberal \nMembers of this body, and Senator Inhofe, one of the most conservative. \nThis afternoon, we are going to hear an announcement of specifics of an \nagreement to move judges forward. Tomorrow, we will be working on a \njobs bill that, while there are differences in the specifics, has broad \nbipartisan support and consensus.\n  Perhaps an idea; a moment of greater comity that we have seen this \nweek is not just momentary but will last on into the future. The lesson \nthe American people taught us is they do not\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\nwant obstruction, particularly for its own sake. They understand \ncompromises have to be made in a legislative body, that it cannot be \n``my way or the highway.''\n  Unfortunately, all too often in the past year we have seen too much \nof that attitude. The fact that we are batting 3 for 3 this week in \nterms of important issues: a highway bill, judicial nominees, and an \nIPO bill with broad bipartisan consensus, hopefully, augers well for \nthe future.\n  Perhaps the era of obstruction and confrontation has passed its high-\nwater mark. Perhaps it is now politically damaging to block legislation \nfor its own sake or because someone does not get 100 percent of what \nthey wanted. Perhaps a new era of more bipartisan consensus and more \naccomplishments for the American people to deal with our problems is \nupon us. I hope and pray it is so.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am in this Chamber with my \ncolleague, Senator Joe Manchin, who has as much interest in this as I \ndo and feels the happiness from a wonderful event which will happen, we \nhope, tomorrow in West Virginia, which will not necessarily be a moment \nthat most people around the country or even in this body will notice, \nbut it is an enormous moment to the people of West Virginia because it \nhas been a long festering problem that we believe will be ratified \ntomorrow.\n  What am I talking about? Tomorrow the retirees at Century Aluminum in \nRavenswood, WV, hopefully, are going to ratify a decision that has been \nreached by the Steelworkers, led by a local heroine, an icon of \nAppalachia, Karen Gorrell, who has stood out all night by the roadside \nprotesting.\n  Back in 2009, Century Aluminum--and aluminum is a volatile industry \nbut very much of an up-industry now--simply shut down. Hundreds of jobs \nand hundreds of retirees and their families were just cut out and cut \noff. Periods of negotiation went on with Century Aluminum under the \nparticular management then, but it wasn't going anywhere. There wasn't \na lot of goodwill that I was able to detect.\n  Then comes the kind of change you really want to see. You start with \ngood people, good workers. It is a hard job. It pays pretty good wages, \ngood benefits--not defined benefits in terms of health care but VIPA \nbenefits, which are benefits nevertheless for retirees. They are good \npeople who are located in a rural county in West Virginia, which is \nkind of the heartland of West Virginia where a lot of good people come \nfrom. They tend to work very hard and to be very wonderful. What these \nmen and women have always wanted is simply to be treated fairly.\n  In a world of big corporations, decisions are made from far away \nplaces by corporate leaders. But it doesn't necessarily need to work \nthat way--that the people on the line are out in the cold without \nbenefits, without health care at all. There they are picketing or just \nbeing miserable, and the world pays little attention because there is \nnot a lot of progress made, so the attention is pulled away from it. \nBut not if you are under the leadership of Karen Gorrell, the local \nunion leader there. She is a fantastic woman who brings not only \nferocity--she went to a corporate meeting--and the occupant of the \nchair will enjoy this because I know him well--wearing a T-shirt that \nwas sort of the hand of the corporation with blood dripping off it, and \nit was a stockholders meeting. She was so good that people sort of \nrespected her for that rather than resent her for it. But she is a \nstrong, classic Appalachian person, a very strong union leader.\n  What happened was there was new management at Century. The State had \nbeen extraordinarily helpful, the legislature, putting up a lot of \nmoney over a period of 10 years. What should have been able to happen \nwas that Century Aluminum would open again, people would go back to \nwork. But then the big enchilada would be if the Ravenswood plant \nitself, the old Kaiser plant, would open, for which there is a real \npurpose.\n  They reminisce in West Virginia about Henry Kaiser, who obviously \nbuilt that plant many years ago, going through the plant shaking hands \nwith workers, knowing their names. That was a different era, and he was \nan extraordinarily good man.\n  Senator Manchin and I want this situation to be worked out. We have \nboth worked very hard on it. Actually, the parties weren't that far \napart. What made them not that far apart was that the issues were \ncomplicated, but it was the will to settle that predominated. Each side \ndidn't get exactly what they wanted, but each side, in a sophisticated, \nnuanced way, understood there were very high stakes for losing \neverything and very high stakes, including a lot of money from the West \nVirginia Legislature over 10 years. The stakes for winning, for \nsettling were extraordinary.\n  Everybody rose to the occasion. This could never have happened \nwithout the leadership of Karen Gorrell and her particular type of \nleadership, which I found wonderful, just refreshing. I have been out \nthere many times over the years because Century Aluminum has had a lot \nof problems. I am sure Senator Manchin has too.\n  Now I am praying and hoping they are going to ratify this agreement \ntomorrow. If that is so, I am not sure the news will reach Baltimore, \nand I am certain it will not reach Vancouver, but it will reach all \nover West Virginia. It will be an example of labor and management, with \ngood corporate and union leadership, coming together at precisely the \nright moment, after a tremendous amount of strain and stress and anger.\n  I conclude my statement just praying that the retirees will do what I \nthink they are going to do tomorrow--I encourage that--and accept the \nagreement agreed to by the union and Century Aluminum. If that happens, \nwhether they know about it in Vancouver doesn't interest me much. They \nwill know about it in West Virginia, and I care about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I also rise in support, along with \nSenator Rockefeller. What a good job he has done. We have both had the \nhonor of serving our great State as Governors. As every Governor and \nlegislator knows, we fight for every job we can create. We fight like \nthe dickens to save every job we have.\n  As the Senator said, he has been fighting these battles for many \nyears. I was in the legislature when he was our Governor. We fought \nside by side then. When I became Governor, he was a Senator in \nWashington, and he fought along with me on every job we created and \nsaved. Now here we are again side by side fighting.\n  Ravenswood, in Jackson County, is a very unique place. In Ripley and \nall the surrounding towns, we have about 22,000 people who live there, \nand 4,200 people live in Ravenswood, 3,000 in Ripley. One can tell how \nthat is the lifeblood, truly, of the community. Lucy Harbert is the \nmayor. She is dogmatic. Karen Gorrell is unbelievable. There are men \nand women there fighting basically for what was promised to them, \nfighting for survival.\n  I think the big story is that in 2009, the plant closed, as the \nSenator said. In 2010, all the employees were told all of their health \ncare benefits that had been promised to them and negotiated in good \nfaith were gone--all gone by the stroke of a pen. The courts upheld it.\n\n  Lo and behold, we have a new management team. We have Mike Bless--and \nwe are talking about Monterey, CA. Clear out there. These people came \nin and saw what we had, the fabric of the town and the fortitude of \nthese people. So management said: We need to do something. Karen \nGorrell and the rest of them never let up. They said: We want to be \ntreated fairly. We want what we were promised. Everyone made \nconsiderations here.\n  What we have coming up with a vote tomorrow--as the Senator said, \nthere will be a vote for the retirees to accept the proposal they have \nbeen negotiating, which I am hopeful and I know Senator Rockefeller is \ntoo--will be\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\npassed tomorrow. That is the first step in the right direction. The \nState has entered as a partner also. With the State, they will work out \npower contracts and things of this sort. How important are power \nprices? How important is the coal and the power that coal produces? \nWithout that, we would be dead in the water.\n  There is so much promising going on. But when you see a community \ncome together--Governor Earl Ray Tomblin, our friend, worked hard in \nthe legislature. This is not a story we see today in America that much.\n  In 2009, the plant closed. Over 600 people lost their jobs in a \nlittle town of 4,200 people. Now we have a chance to at least get 400 \nor 500 back on the job. We have not seen that turn around too much. You \ncan imagine why Senator Rockefeller and I are so excited, and I think \nmore than anything we are so proud that we represent a State that has \nso much resilience. They have stuck together. So our hat is off, from \nthe corporate end to the union end, to the people working together from \nthe community.\n  I need to say that the President of the Steelworkers Union, Leo \nGirard, has just been a rock. Leo gets right in there. The Steelworkers \nstood behind their retirees. They stood behind them. They would not \ntake anything less than the retirees being treated fairly. That brought \neverybody to the table and gave us the glue it took.\n  Senator Rockefeller is persuasive, as you know, in his ability to get \ninvolved and persuade people to do the right thing, and all of us were \nbehind this effort. It came to fruition. Today, West Virginia is a \nbrighter spot, and Ravenswood is a brighter place. Hopes are up again. \nThe people are enthusiastic, and we can see they have a little skip in \ntheir step. That means an awful lot. These are the hardest working \npeople, who don't ask for a whole lot--just an opportunity to take care \nof themselves and their families.\n  To Lucy Harbert, Karen Gorrell, Mike Bless, and Leo Girard, Senator \nRockefeller, and the entire West Virginia delegation, I think everybody \nshould be extremely pleased. Tomorrow we know it will be a successful \nvote. We are going to show the country we can compete with anybody in \nthe world. I know the occupant of the chair feels the same way in \nMaryland, and you have been able to. We will work together on this and \nstart rebuilding America one job at a time. This is 400 jobs at one \ntime.\n  With that, I say thank you to all of the good people in West Virginia \nwho made this happen. I thank Senator Rockefeller for his leadership \nover the years. I have been honored to work with him. He has been a \ntremendous mentor. We will continue to work together for many years.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1666-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1666-S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A SECOND OPINION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have for \nthe last 2 years since the health care law was signed by the President, \nto give a doctor's second opinion about the health care law. I do this \nweek after week because we need to recall that it was Nancy Pelosi, \nthen Speaker of the House, who famously said that Congress had to first \npass President Obama's health care bill to find out what was in it.\n  It has now been 2 years, and we continue to find out more and more \nwhat is in the law as people read it. Even this morning the Wall Street \nJournal had a story about the upcoming 2-year anniversary and, of \ncourse, the Supreme Court hearings, which will begin in a little over a \nweek, as to whether this health care law is constitutional. I believe \nit is not, but there will be 3 days devoted to that discussion. And the \nWall Street Journal article today has a poll covering the time period \nsince this health care law was passed all the way through today which \nreflects that the health care law is still more unpopular than it is \npopular. More people are opposed to the health care law even 2 years \nafter it was passed than are supportive of it.\n  Interestingly, other studies of the American populace show that the \nmore people know more about the health care law, the less they are \nactually likely to support it. And for those people who have talked to \na health care provider--a nurse, a doctor, or a therapist--they are \neven less likely to be supportive of the health care law. The more \npeople learn about the health care law, the more they do not like it.\n  So much of this specifically relates to the mandate that everyone in \nthe country is going to be obligated to buy a government-approved \nproduct. That is the crux of the debate that will be held within the \nSupreme Court in the weeks ahead and in the decision to come within the \nnext couple of months.\n  It is interesting to go through the process of how this law was \npassed: a party-line vote, votes in the middle of the night, closed-\ndoor negotiations in spite of the President saying all deliberations \nand discussions would be on C SPAN, and the American people saying: No, \ndo not pass this. In spite of the objections of people all across the \ncountry, this bill was crammed through the House and the Senate and \nsigned by the President at a time when people said: This isn't going to \ngive us what we want. What we want is the care we need from a doctor we \nwant at a price we can afford.\n  The President made lots of speeches and lots of promises to let the \npublic know he was listening to them. But he wasn't listening to the \npublic. He wasn't listening to this side of the aisle. That is why this \nhealth care law actually fails patients, it fails providers--the nurses \nand the doctors who take care of those patients--and it fails the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  I remember the President saying: If you like your plan, you can keep \nit. And when he was running for the Presidency, he said: You will not \nhave to change plans. He said: For those who have insurance now, \nnothing will change under the Obama plan except you will pay less. That \nis what he said. Yet at a townhall meeting in Wyoming--I go home to \nWyoming every weekend and visit with people--when I asked a group of \n100 citizens how many, under the President's health care plan, believe \nthey are actually going to pay more, every hand went up--every one. The \nPresident said the law would save $2,500 per family. The American \npeople haven't seen that. So they listened to the President's promises, \nbut now they say: I am not sure I can believe what he has to say.\n  The President talked about protecting Medicare. He did that in an \naddress to Congress in 2009. Yet, with the health care law, they took \n$500 billion away from Medicare--not to save it or to strengthen it but \nto start a whole new government program for other people. So when I \ntalk to seniors, they have great concerns about the way Medicare has \nbeen handled in this health care law. Specifically, their concern is \nthat they are not going to be able to find a doctor to take care of \nthem.\n  First of all, in terms of the health care law, it has failed in \nhelping us have more doctors and nurses and nurse practitioners and \nphysician assistants. But when I talk to doctors at home in Wyoming--\nand I practiced medicine for 25 years--what I see is offices that are \nfull, and what I hear is that they continue to care for patients they \nhave taken care of for years who are on Medicare, and they continue to \ncare for patients who are currently Medicare age, but in terms of \nsomeone who may move to a new town or someone whose doctor may retire, \nit is getting harder and harder for patients on Medicare to find \ndoctors to take care of them.\n  A lot of it has to do with the concerns about reimbursement--the so-\ncalled doc fix that was part of the debate recently when we extended \nthat with the payroll tax holiday legislation. But there is very little \ncertainty that comes out of Congress, and doctors look at that and say: \nHow can I make decisions about my practice and my life when I don't \nknow if they are going to cut Medicare fees by 27 or 30 percent at the \nend of the year? They faced a similar situation at the end of last \nyear, and they faced a similar situation at the end of February. So it \nis not a surprise that doctors are more and more reluctant to accept \nnew\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\nMedicare patients when their offices are already full with patients.\n  When we look at all of this, we wonder, is it surprising that this \nhealth care law is as unpopular as it is?\n  The President said that this health care law will not add one dime to \nour deficit. It will add not a dime to our deficit. We had another \nbudget this year, another deficit looking at $1 trillion. The CBO \nreport came out yesterday talking about more money being spent than had \nbeen anticipated--a higher deficit. The President promised. He said: I \nwill not sign a health care plan that adds one dime to our deficits \neither now or anytime in the future, period. But if you take a look at \nan honest accounting of the health care law, it is going to find that \nthis will increase the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars in \nthe first 10 years alone and much higher beyond that.\n  I remember listening to the debate in 2008--and now here we are, in \nanother Presidential election year--when President Obama, who was then \na Senator, a Member of this body, and Hillary Clinton, who was also a \nSenator and Member of this body, were debating what they saw as the \nfuture for health care. At the time candidate Obama opposed a mandate \nto buy insurance--a mandate which is now part of and which, actually, \nmany call the linchpin of this health care law. It is the very thing \nthat is going to be argued before the Supreme Court and upon which the \nCourt will rule whether it is constitutional. It is at the heart of \nPresident Obama's health care law. He opposed it when he was a \ncandidate. He actually made his opposition to the mandate one of the \nhallmarks of his primary campaign against then-Senator Clinton. So \npeople scratch their heads and say: What is he really for? What does he \nstand for? When he was a Senator, he claimed that penalizing people for \nnot buying health insurance was like ``solving homelessness by \nmandating everyone buy a house.'' Those were his words in talking about \nthe impact of a mandate.\n\n  So here we are now, 2 years later, and three-quarters of the American \npeople believe it is unconstitutional for this body, for Congress, and \nfor any President to sign something that mandates they buy a \ngovernment-approved product. We don't know what the Supreme Court will \ndo, but the American people are significantly opposed to the key \ncomponent of the President's health care law.\n  The President also said he wouldn't raise taxes. Yet there is a list \nof taxes that have been raised as a result of this health care law.\n  So it is not surprising that 2 years later there are more people \nopposed to the health care law than are supportive. Think about the \nPresident and the statements he has made and the statements made on the \nother side of the aisle in the runup to the health care law, and it is \nnot a surprise that 2 years later people are saying: That is not what \nhappened.\n  I remember the discussions and the debate on this floor about small \nbusinesses and the expenses this would place on our small businesses. \nThe President said that 4 million small businesses may be eligible for \ntax credits. The key word there, of course, was ``may.'' In fact, the \nIRS spent $1 million in taxpayer money to mail millions of postcards to \nsmall businesses promoting the so-called tax credit. But the Treasury \nDepartment's inspector general--now 2 years later--testified recently \nthat the volume of credit claims has been lower than expected--lower \nthan Democrats promised, lower than the President talked about, but not \nlower than people who actually read the bill thought would occur \nbecause of the requirements and what would need to happen to apply, \nwhat the incentives were, and what the consequences were. Out of these \npromised 4 million small businesses that would get help, the Treasury \nDepartment's inspector general says only 309,000 firms have received \nthe credit. That is 7 percent of the 4 million firms the administration \nand the Democrats in the Senate said would receive the tax credit. So \nwhen people look at that, they say: Did they really help me? The answer \nis no.\n  That is why, when I ask the second question at a townhall meeting--\nnot the first, which is, Do you think you will end up paying more under \nthe Obama health care law, the one that promised you would pay $2,500 \nless, and all the hands go up, that they believe they are going to pay \nmore--the second question is, Do you believe the availability and \nquality of your care under the Obama health care law is going to go \ndown? And nobody wants that for themselves or their parents or their \nkids. When I ask, how many of you believe it is going to go down, \neveryone raises their hand. They all believe they will receive less--\nless availability, less quality, less timely care than they were able \nto achieve before the health care law was passed.\n  So that is why I come to the floor each and every week with a \ndoctor's second opinion about the health care law, because each and \nevery week there is something new that has been found out or a new \nregulation that comes out because let's not forget that in this very \nlengthy, very heavy health care law, 1,700 times it says the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services will write rules and regulations, really \ndescribing what the law says.\n  When they take a very small part of the law, 4 or 6 pages relating to \naccountable care organizations, and come out with 400 pages of \nregulations about accountable care organizations, even those places the \nPresident holds up as models of where it works well, places such as the \nMayo Clinic or the Utah health care system or Geisinger in \nPennsylvania, many of those say: We cannot comply with all these rules \nand regulations that are now coming out from the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services.\n  Every week, a new series of rules and regulations comes out, a new \nseries of mandates. Doctors and nurses are finding they are spending \nless time with patients and more time with paper and it is hurting the \njob creators of the country. They don't know what it is going to cost \nthem, but they know it is going to cost more. The incentives and the \nconsequences within the law are not those that are going to encourage \nbusinesses to continue to provide health insurance. I believe it is \ngoing to result in more and more people being dumped by their employers \nonto a different system, with significant expense to taxpayers around \nthe country.\n  That is why I come to the floor, week after week, to talk about this \nhealth care law and say it is bad for patients, it is bad for the \nproviders--the nurses and doctors who take care of those patients--and \nit is going to be terrible for taxpayers. That is why I believe we need \nto repeal and replace this terrible, broken health care law with \nsomething that is actually patient centered, which puts the patient at \nthe center of the discussion. It is not government centered, it is not \ninsurance company centered but patient centered.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1667-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1667-S1671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is a bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Its supporters \nhave characterized it as a jobs bill. It is a bill which, frankly, \nchanges many laws and comes over to the Senate. The minority leader, \nthe Republican leader, has been on the Senate floor almost every single \nday urging us to take up this bill as quickly as possible and to pass \nit because of the impact it might have on employment across America.\n  I might say for the record, I believe the bill we passed today, the \nTransportation bill, is the true jobs bill--2.8 million jobs across \nAmerica. I will tell you, the House bill will not even get close to \nthat on a good day. Our bill will save and create millions of jobs. It \nwill build an infrastructure for our economy for years to come, and it \npassed with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Over 70 Members of the \nSenate, Democrats and Republicans, voted for this bill. An \nextraordinary effort by\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\nSenator Boxer of California and Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma and many \nothers resulted in a bill that was well crafted, balanced, and will, in \nfact, fund our infrastructure needs in this country for the next 2 \nyears.\n  The House has been at a loss to produce a similar bill, even though \nwe are both facing a March 31 deadline for this trust fund that is used \nacross America to maintain our infrastructure. The House has moved from \none extreme to another. They have crafted bills which were way too \npartisan.\n  This used to be the easiest lift in Washington. Every 5 years, the \nFederal Transportation bill was an opportunity for both parties to work \ntogether. Oh, it is true, Members would put in projects for their \ndistricts and States. That is to be expected. But at the end of the \nday, a bill would emerge which ultimately had strong bipartisan \nsupport. I cannot think of a single instance in the time I have been in \nthe House and the Senate that was not the case.\n  The House effort, however, to this date has failed. I hope they can \nuse our bill as a starting point. They should. If they bring our \nbipartisan bill to the floor of the House of Representatives and open \nit to amendment, then we will be at a position where we can sit \ntogether in a conference committee and work this out, as we should, on \na bipartisan basis. It is a good jobs bill. In fact, it is the biggest \njobs bill the Congress will have considered in the last year.\n  Let's go back to the bill that passed the House, which the \nRepublicans have characterized as a jobs bill. I think it is important \nthat before we rush into this, taking a look at it, we take a careful \nlook at it and ask: What does this bill do?\n  This bill is designed to change disclosure, accounting, and auditing \nstandards, and to exempt many firms and corporations from the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission's oversight. One part of the bill \nexempts newly public firms with less than $1 billion in revenue from \ncertain disclosure, accounting, and auditing standards over a \ntransition period of 5 years after they first go public. It exempts \nfirms with less than $1 billion in revenue and less than $700 million \nin traded stock--what they characterize as ``emerging growth \ncompanies.'' They would be exempt from regulation for the most part. \nThat would, in fact, exempt more than 90 percent of the companies going \npublic in America.\n  These so-called emerging growth companies would be exempt from SOX \n404(b), which requires a firm's auditor to attest to and report on \ninternal controls. It would exempt firms from safeguards we adopted in \nthis country after Enron.\n  There is little justification for rolling back the Dodd-Frank \nprovisions on executive compensation. But firms would be exempt in many \nrespects because of this bill. It is hard to imagine that a firm with \n$1 billion in revenue does not have the resources to disclose golden \nparachutes in executive compensation agreements.\n  Exempting firms from new accounting standards would create a two-\ntiered accounting system that is bound to be confusing. The Financial \nAccounting Standards Board, FASB, says provisions legislating \naccounting standards would ``undermine the rigorous, independent \nstandard-setting process [already] undertaken. . . . '' One other part \nof this bill increases the amount of capital private companies may \nraise under a public offering from $5 million to $50 million annually \nand remain exempted from SEC oversight.\n  They want to take a lot of this capital formation and business \nformation off the grid. They do not want oversight and disclosure and \ntransparency. That is what this bill does. It fails to include a \nmultiyear cap on the amount firms may raise and allows firms to raise \n$50 million annually indefinitely while avoiding SEC registration and \ndisclosures.\n  It goes on with something called crowdfunding. It allows firms to \nremain exempt from SEC registration and raise up to $1 million annually \nthrough crowdfunding. What does that mean? Large numbers of individuals \ncontributing a small amount of money to a company. Retail and \nunsophisticated investors will be allowed to invest up to $10,000 \nthrough crowdfunding sites with few disclosure requirements.\n  There is another provision that allows private firms that sell more \nthan $5 million in securities to generally solicit or advertise private \nofferings without being required to register with the SEC, provided the \nfirm verifies all purchasers are accredited investors. The risk of \nfraud through cold calls and other sales tactics increases \nsignificantly with the elimination of the requirement that firms have a \npreexisting relationship with potential investors.\n  In the early 1990s, the SEC allowed general solicitation but again \nrestricted general solicitation in 1999 because of widespread fraud. \nThe accredited investor standard is so low as to include individuals \nwhose net worth is $1 million or who have earned $200,000 annually. It \nallows banks to raise capital while avoiding SEC registration by \nincreasing the shareholder threshold from 500 shareholders to 2,000 and \nfrom $1 million in assets to $10 million.\n  It is no surprise that when we look carefully at this bill, even \nthough it received a large vote in the House--I do not dispute that--\nmany organizations oppose it. They include the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, AARP, Americans for Tax Reform, AFL CIO, the Coalition for \nSensible Safeguards, U.S. PIRG, the National Education Association, the \nNational Consumers League, and the National Association of Consumer \nAdvocates. There are other organizations with serious concerns, which \ninclude the Council of Institutional Investors, FASB, and North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial from the New York Times from March 11 entitled ``They Have \nVery Short Memories.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     They Have Very Short Memories\n\n       House Republicans, Senate Democrats and President Obama \n     have found something they can all support: a terrible package \n     of bills that would undo essential investor protections, \n     reduce market transparency and distort the efficient \n     allocation of capital.\n       Of course, supporters don't describe it that way. They say \n     the JOBS Act--for Jumpstart Our Business Startups--would \n     remove burdensome regulations that they claim have made it \n     too difficult for companies to raise money from investors, \n     impeding their ability to grow and hire.\n       Never mind that reams of Congressional testimony, market \n     analysis and academic research have shown that regulation has \n     not been an impediment to raising capital. In fact, too \n     little regulation has been at the root of all recent bubbles \n     and bursts--the dot-com crash, Enron, the mortgage meltdown. \n     Those free-for-alls created jobs and then imploded, causing \n     mass joblessness.\n       Unfortunately, election-year politics and powerful \n     constituencies--rather than research and reason--are driving \n     the JOBS legislation forward. It passed the House on \n     Thursday, after the Obama administration endorsed it; the \n     Senate leadership is expected to introduce a similar package \n     this week.\n       Republicans love it because deregulation is at the core of \n     their corporate-centered agenda. President Obama wants to \n     burnish his pro-business credentials. Most Senate Democrats, \n     keenly aware of big business's deep campaign contribution \n     pockets, are eager to go along.\n       The centerpiece of the bill would curb investor protections \n     in the Sarbanes-Oxley law that require companies to meet \n     specific disclosure, accounting and auditing standards before \n     going public. The legislation is promoted as applying only to \n     small companies, but the parameters would encompass all but \n     the nation's biggest new companies.\n       It would also let new public companies delay compliance \n     with provisions of the Dodd-Frank law on executive \n     compensation and shareholder ``say on pay.'' Another \n     provision would permit ``crowd funding''--raising money from \n     small investors through the Internet--without requiring those \n     companies to provide meaningful disclosure and without \n     adequate oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n     John Coffee Jr., a securities law expert, has dubbed that the \n     ``Boiler Room Legalization Act.''\n       Yet another provision, opposed by AARP and state \n     regulators, would allow private companies to solicit \n     investors, a move that could expose unsophisticated investors \n     to offerings that they cannot properly evaluate.\n       Dozens of legal experts and advocates for investors and \n     consumers have written to Senate leaders warning that \n     extensive revisions must be made to the House legislation for \n     it to be even minimally acceptable.\n       We know memories are short in Washington. But Enron was \n     just 10 years ago. And the entire system almost imploded in \n     2008. There is no excuse.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. This editorial states, in part:\n\n       House Republicans, Senate Democrats and the President have \n     found something they can\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\n     all support: a terrible package of bills that would undo \n     essential investor protections, reduce market transparency \n     and distort the efficient allocation of capital.\n       Never mind that reams of Congressional testimony, market \n     analysis and academic research have shown that regulation has \n     not been an impediment to raising capital. In fact, too \n     little regulation has been at the root of all of our recent \n     bubbles and bursts--the dot-com crash, Enron, the mortgage \n     meltdown. Those free-for-alls created jobs and then imploded, \n     causing mass joblessness.\n       The centerpiece of this bill would curb investor \n     protections in the Sarbanes-Oxley law that require companies \n     to meet specific disclosure, accounting and auditing \n     standards before going public. The legislation is promoted as \n     applying only to small companies, but the parameters would \n     encompass all but the nation's biggest new companies.\n\n  I have been down this path before. I have been in Congress long \nenough to remember some of these bubbles, remember the victims and the \nlosers when it was all over, the exuberance of deregulation which led, \nsadly, in many instances, to an unregulated marketplace where greed \ntriumphed.\n  After each financial crisis, the savings and loan crisis, Enron, the \nhousing and economic crash of 2008, this body has investigated and \nattempted to learn from the lessons of the past. How many times on this \nfloor have Senators debated measures to ensure that we do not face \nanother Enron, where shareholders lost between $40 and $60 billion in \ninvestments and employees lost $2.1 billion in pension plans, not to \nmention their jobs. We promised that would never happen again. We \nestablished standards of regulation, which we are now proposing to \nwaive in this so-called jobs act.\n  I worked with my colleagues in the wake of the 2008 economic slide to \npass the Dodd-Frank Act, to close the loopholes that resulted in \nmillions of families losing their homes and $17 trillion in lost \nhousehold and personal wealth. We learned from the past and worked \ntogether to provide oversight where regulation was just too lax. We \npassed commonsense rules to ensure consumers and investors were \nprotected.\n  Just a few years later, after that crisis brought our economy to its \nknees, it seems some have forgotten those lessons. It was not too much \nregulation that led to the financial crisis of 2008. We did not get \ninto that mess because agencies such as the SEC had too much power. It \nwas the other way around. It was deregulation of the 1990s and Federal \nagencies turning a blind eye to activities that precipitated the global \nfinancial meltdown.\n  Regulatory agencies were underfunded, overwhelmed, and often limited \nin their authority. That does not mean we should do nothing. There are \nthings we can do to ease the burden on companies looking to raise \ncapital and create jobs.\n  There are commonsense measures to help small businesses access \ncapital. We can exempt employees from counting toward shareholder \nlimits, so these companies can reward their employees with stock \noptions. We can increase the amount of money startups can raise, while \nstill being exempt from SEC registration. There are things we can do to \nhelp companies grow and create jobs, while still protecting investors.\n  But the bill passed by the House does not do that. The House-passed \nbill says that more than 90 percent of newly public firms do not have \nto comply with Federal disclosure, accounting, and auditing standards. \nThis means that when an investor is making a decision about which newly \npublic firms to put their hard-earned money in, they will not have \naccess to basic vital information about those firms.\n  How can investors make good, sound decisions about where to invest \ntheir savings and their money when some firms, those that have recently \ngone public, will not have to comply with new and improved accounting \nstandards but all other firms will? The House-passed bill does not have \nenough protection for everyday investors who are considered \nunsophisticated in the financial sector, those who may not fully \nunderstand the risks of investing through an online crowdfunding Web \nsite.\n  At a recent Senate Banking hearing, Professor John Coffee, from the \nColombia University Law School, said: The crowdfunding technique is \nespecially open to fraud because the companies that use it are most \nlikely brandnew entities that do not have any operating history and \nmight not even have financial statements.\n  Professor Coffee said: Those firms would be flying on a wing and a \nprayer, selling more hope than substance. The House-passed bill would \nallow firms to advertise and sell their stock through cold calls and \nother sales tactics. That is an invitation for fraud.\n  In this situation, someone can promise investments with high return \nwith little risk. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College \ncalls this ``the magician'' and reports that seniors are three times \nmore likely to be the victims of this type of fraud.\n  There is room to improve this bill to allow small businesses to grow \nand create jobs, but we have to do it with an eye toward oversight, \ntransparency, and rules of the road which protect the average investor.\n  This so-called jobs bill creates a job opportunity for any individual \nsalesman to set up shop with a barstool and a laptop computer. They can \nbe selling worthless stock for phantom companies. This bill invites \nthem to fleece unsuspecting customers of up to $10,000, promising that \nthey will own certain companies. It can turn out that these companies \nhave no assets, no business model, and may not even exist.\n  In the name of deregulation, these fraudsters could even include \nthose who have been banned for life from the securities industry. That \nwas a point that was raised by Professor Coffee's testimony. This bill \nis written to allow new salesmen to come on the scene and does not put \nany provision in there to prohibit those who have been banned by the \nsecurities industry from sales of securities.\n  Why would we invite the thieves back into the marketplace? This half-\nboiled concoction of ill-conceived ideas skirts, evades, and nullifies \ninvestor protection and market transparency standards that were enacted \nin response to the dot-com crash, the Enron debacle, and the litany of \nbubbles and bursts that have cost legions of unsuspecting Americans \ntheir savings, their jobs, and their retirement.\n\n  I requote one paragraph from the New York Times editorial:\n\n       The centerpiece of the bill would curb investor protections \n     in the Sarbanes-Oxley law that require companies to meet \n     specific disclosure, accounting and auditing standards before \n     going public. This legislation is promoted as applying only \n     to small companies, but the parameters would encompass all \n     but the nation's biggest new companies.\n\n  Literally, 90 percent of the new companies would be exempt under this \nprovision. Exempting firms with less than $1 billion in revenue and \nless than $700 million in traded stock, so-called emerging growth \ncompanies, would exempt more than 90 percent of the companies going \npublic, according to testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n  The delay in compliance with Dodd-Frank on executive compensation is \nparticularly cheeky. Do you recall this? We sent billions of dollars to \nbanking institutions as a result of the bailout to save them from their \nown stupidity and greed, and they turned around and gave executive \ncompensation and bonus awards right and left to the very people who had \nengineered this disaster. We said when we passed Dodd-Frank, that was \nthe end of that story. We were going to change it.\n  One of the Dodd-Frank provisions: In February 2009, Senator \nChristopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who was chairman of the Senate \nBanking Committee, inserted a rule about pay at bailed-out banks into \nthe economic stimulus. The rule did nothing to change the bonuses that \nhad just been paid a few weeks earlier, but it required that bonuses \npaid in the future be paid in stock and not exceed one-third of total \ncompensation. The idea was to create the right incentives, the \nincentives to be a larger owner of the company, into decisionmaking, \nnot take the money and run.\n  Now comes this so-called jobs bill and exempts executive compensation \nstandards. Firms with $1 billion in revenue certainly have the \nresources to disclose golden parachutes and insidious good old boy \ncompensation packages.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a stunning \narticle from the New York Times this morning, written by Greg Smith, \nentitled, ``Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs.''\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 14, 2012]\n\n                     Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs\n\n                            (By Greg Smith)\n\n       Today is my last day at Goldman Sachs. After almost 12 \n     years at the firm--first as a summer intern while at \n     Stanford, then in New York for 10 years, and now in London--I \n     believe I have worked here long enough to understand the \n     trajectory of its culture, its people and its identity. And I \n     can honestly say that the environment now is as toxic and \n     destructive as I have ever seen it.\n       To put the problem in the simplest terms, the interests of \n     the client continue to be sidelined in the way the firm \n     operates and thinks about making money. Goldman Sachs is one \n     of the world's largest and most important investment banks \n     and it is too integral to global finance to continue to act \n     this way. The firm has veered so far from the place I joined \n     right out of college that I can no longer in good conscience \n     say that I identify with what it stands for.\n       It might sound surprising to a skeptical public, but \n     culture was always a vital part of Goldman Sachs's success. \n     It revolved around teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility, \n     and always doing right by our clients. The culture was the \n     secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to \n     earn our clients' trust for 143 years. It wasn't just about \n     making money; this alone will not sustain a firm for so long. \n     It had something to do with pride and belief in the \n     organization. I am sad to say that I look around today and \n     see virtually no trace of the culture that made me love \n     working for this firm for many years. I no longer have the \n     pride, or the belief.\n       But this was not always the case. For more than a decade I \n     recruited and mentored candidates through our grueling \n     interview process. I was selected as one of 10 people (out of \n     a firm of more than 30,000) to appear on our recruiting \n     video, which is played on every college campus we visit \n     around the world. In 2006 I managed the summer intern program \n     in sales and trading in New York for the 80 college students \n     who made the cut, out of the thousands who applied.\n       I knew it was time to leave when I realized I could no \n     longer look students in the eye and tell them what a great \n     place this was to work.\n       When the history books are written about Goldman Sachs, \n     they may reflect that the current chief executive officer, \n     Lloyd C. Blankfein, and the president, Gary D. Cohn, lost \n     hold of the firm's culture on their watch. I truly believe \n     that this decline in the firm's moral fiber represents the \n     single most serious threat to its long-run survival.\n       Over the course of my career I have had the privilege of \n     advising two of the largest hedge funds on the planet, five \n     of the largest asset managers in the United States, and three \n     of the most prominent sovereign wealth funds in the Middle \n     East and Asia. My clients have a total asset base of more \n     than a trillion dollars. I have always taken a lot of pride \n     in advising my clients to do what I believe is right for \n     them, even if it means less money for the firm. This view is \n     becoming increasingly unpopular at Goldman Sachs. Another \n     sign that it was time to leave.\n       How did we get here? The firm changed the way it thought \n     about leadership. Leadership used to be about ideas, setting \n     an example and doing the right thing. Today, if you make \n     enough money for the firm (and are not currently an ax \n     murderer) you will be promoted into a position of influence.\n       What are three quick ways to become a leader? a) Execute on \n     the firm's ``axes,'' which is Goldman-speak for persuading \n     your clients to invest in the stocks or other products that \n     we are trying to get rid of because they are not seen as \n     having a lot of potential profit. b) ``Hunt Elephants.'' In \n     English: get your clients--some of whom are sophisticated, \n     and some of whom aren't--to trade whatever will bring the \n     biggest profit to Goldman. Call me old-fashioned, but I don't \n     like selling my clients a product that is wrong for them. c) \n     Find yourself sitting in a seat where your job is to trade \n     any illiquid, opaque product with a three-letter acronym.\n       Today, many of these leaders display a Goldman Sachs \n     culture quotient of exactly zero percent. I attend \n     derivatives sales meetings where not one single minute is \n     spent asking questions about how we can help clients. It's \n     purely about how we can make the most possible money off of \n     them. If you were an alien from Mars and sat in on one of \n     these meetings, you would believe that a client's success or \n     progress was not part of the thought process at all.\n       It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping \n     their clients off. Over the last 12 months I have seen five \n     different managing directors refer to their own clients as \n     ``muppets,'' sometimes over internal e-mail. Even after the \n     S.E.C., Fabulous Fab, Abacus, God's work, Carl Levin, Vampire \n     Squids? No humility? I mean, come on. Integrity? It is \n     eroding. I don't know of any illegal behavior, but will \n     people push the envelope and pitch lucrative and complicated \n     products to clients even if they are not the simplest \n     investments or the ones most directly aligned with the \n     client's goals? Absolutely. Every day, in fact.\n       It astounds me how little senior management gets a basic \n     truth: If clients don't trust you they will eventually stop \n     doing business with you. It doesn't matter how smart you are.\n       These days, the most common question I get from junior \n     analysts about derivatives is, ``How much money did we make \n     off the client?'' It bothers me every time I hear it, because \n     it is a clear reflection of what they are observing from \n     their leaders about the way they should behave. Now project \n     10 years into the future: You don't have to be a rocket \n     scientist to figure out that the junior analyst sitting \n     quietly in the corner of the room hearing about ``muppets,'' \n     ``ripping eyeballs out'' and ``getting paid'' doesn't exactly \n     turn into a model citizen.\n       When I was a first-year analyst I didn't know where the \n     bathroom was, or how to tie my shoelaces. I was taught to be \n     concerned with learning the ropes, finding out what a \n     derivative was, understanding finance, getting to know our \n     clients and what motivated them, learning how they defined \n     success and what we could do to help them get there.\n       My proudest moments in life--getting a full scholarship to \n     go from South Africa to Stanford University, being selected \n     as a Rhodes Scholar national finalist, winning a bronze medal \n     for table tennis at the Maccabiah Games in Israel, known as \n     the Jewish Olympics--have all come through hard work, with no \n     shortcuts. Goldman Sachs today has become too much about \n     shortcuts and not enough about achievement. It just doesn't \n     feel right to me anymore.\n       I hope this can be a wake-up call to the board of \n     directors. Make the client the focal point of your business \n     again. Without clients you will not make money. In fact, you \n     will not exist. Weed out the morally bankrupt people, no \n     matter how much money they make for the firm. And get the \n     culture right again, so people want to work here for the \n     right reasons. People who care only about making money will \n     not sustain this firm--or the trust of its clients--for very \n     much longer.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will tell my colleagues, read this article, read it and \nunderstand that there is a changing ethos and a changing standard at \nsome of these major corporations; that the pursuit of profit has led \nthis man who was one of the stars on the horizon in this industry to \npick up and leave one of the largest firms in America.\n  It is also an indication of why we need to continue our vigilance \nover this industry to make certain that the right market forces \nprevail. Crowd-\nfunding, where they try to get a lot of small investors in a hurry, \nbrings organized fleecing to the Internet, letting the next generation \nof Ponzi players go viral.\n  Let's call this crowdfunding for what it is. It is Internet gambling, \nand the odds will never favor the investor. When these wired Willy \nLomans are finished exploiting the unsuspecting investors out of their \nsavings, their retirements and their homes, guess what will happen. \nCongress will be called on again to come in with a reform bill to clean \nup the mess and repeal this pitiful package until the next wave of \nderegulation is called for by those who are inspiring this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I know who ends up holding the bag when the deregulators have their \nday. I know who ends up losing when we open the so-called market forces \nwithout oversight transparency. First, ordinary folks investing their \nsavings in something that looks like a good idea, trying to recover \nfrom the beating they took in the market, trying to rebuild their \nretirement accounts, buying worthless stock in worthless companies that \nis being invited by many of the provisions in this bill.\n  Then, when it certainly goes to the bottom, when everyone is \ndesperate, no one knows which way to turn, who will step in? Taxpayers \nand Congress. We will be called on to clean up this irrational \nexuberance that is supposedly going to create new jobs. I think we got \nit right. I think the standard we have now establishes the transparency \nand accountability which we need to demand of every aspect of the \nmarketplace.\n  Certainly, we can change some of these laws. We can be mindful and \nsensitive to some aspects of it. But this bill goes entirely too far. \nThere will be a substitute offered. I am working with several of my \ncolleagues: Senator Jack Reed, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Jeff \nMerkley, Senator Michael Bennet, Senator Mary Landrieu, and others to \nput a provision forward, a substitute, which makes the changes to allow \ncapital formation but does not take down the basic protective regimen \nwe have established in the law for those who are in this industry.\n  We make a serious mistake and we ignore history if we turn our backs \non 80 years of this government stepping up to make sure the marketplace \nin America was safe for investors, to make certain the person selling a \nstock was actually a well-qualified person,\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\nregistered so they knew what they were doing and were held accountable \nfor any wrongdoing, to make certain that companies we buy stock in \nactually exist, and to make certain those who are the most vulnerable \nin America do not lose everything because this Congress decided to look \nthe other way because someone wants to take a profit out of an idea.\n  This is an important measure. Every day, the Republican leaders came \nto the floor and said: Call it immediately. Let's go. Let's get it \ndone. We need to at least take the time to reflect on it, to offer an \nalternative to it, and to do something which is exceedingly rare on the \nfloor of the Senate, have a debate. How about that? The Chair was \nengaged in debate in his youth. He knows that perhaps good ideas can be \nexchanged in that process.\n  The closest we have to debates now is 2 minutes, equally divided. \nThat does not cut it, not for the Senate and not for a bill of this \nimportance. I urge my colleagues, before they rush to judgment, that \nbecause it passed the House with a big measure, that it certainly has \nto be a good bill, take the time to read it.\n  Many people, including myself, who years ago were lured into the \nrepeal of Glass-Steagall because of the notion of letting 1,000 flowers \nbloom, realized what happened. When it was all over, there were no \nflowers. Unfortunately, what was left was the rubble of the recent \nrecession. It is time for us to vow not to make that mistake again.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am pleased that my friend Senator \nMcConnell and I have been able to reach an agreement to approve a \nnumber of judicial nominations in the coming weeks. The senior Senator \nfrom Vermont, Chairman Leahy, has kindly added his wisdom to make this \na better agreement, and for that I am very grateful. This is a victory \nfor our Nation's justice system.\n  While I still believe the Senate should confirm all these nominations \nthis afternoon to address the judicial vacancy crisis we face in this \ncountry, the step forward is one we should all feel good about. The \nSenate will hold up-or-down votes on seven district court judges before \nthe end of this work period. We will vote on another five district \ncourt and two circuit court nominations by Monday, May 7.\n  Among the 14 judges, the Senate will consider Miranda Du. Miranda Du \nis a very well known lawyer in Nevada, but the interesting thing about \nthis good woman is that she is representative of the true American \nsuccess story.\n  She was born in Vietnam. At the end of the war in Vietnam, people who \nwere of Vietnamese ancestry could not leave if they were fullblooded \nVietnamese. If they weren't, as Miranda was, they let them go, and she \nleft Vietnam with her family in a boat when she was just 8 years old. \nShe was in refugee camps and finally, when she was 9 years old, wound \nup in Alabama--not, of course, speaking any English--with her family. \nShe speaks--not that it matters--without a single trace of any accent.\n  She is such a good lawyer, and I was so happy when I introduced her \nbefore the Judiciary Committee at a hearing. Her parents were there, \nher family was there. It was a wonderful opportunity to see what \nAmerica is all about.\n  As I have indicated, she has extensive litigation experience and an \nenormous love and appreciation for Nevada. I look forward to confirming \nthis woman who has such a tremendous dedication to public service.\n  Approving 14 new judges speaks to the progress we can make when we \nhere in the Senate work together. More work remains to fill all the \nNation's vacant judicial seats and ease the backlog of cases in our \ncourts. We can't jeopardize the right to a fair and speedy trial for \n160 million Americans who now live in districts with judicial \nvacancies. Some of them even have judicial vacancies that are \nemergencies. It is crucial that bipartisan cooperation continue and the \npace of confirmations move forward. With 1 in 10 Federal judgeships \nvacant in our country, more delays would circumvent the will of the \npeople.\n  The American Bar Association says that shortage of judges and the \nbackup in our courts is ``bad for business, it's unfair to individuals, \nand it . . . ultimately costs taxpayers money.''\n  This shortage of judges is also unnecessary.\n  Again, I am pleased there has been agreement to confirm these 14 \njudges without wasting any more of the Senate's time.\n  I think we can all agree, regardless of political party, that we must \nact quickly on the small business jobs bill that was passed \noverwhelmingly by the House. Democrats are eager to move this bill \nforward, which will improve innovators' access to capital and \nstreamline how companies sell stock.\n  Democrats will also introduce bipartisan legislation to reauthorize \nthe Export-Import Bank--referred to as the Ex-Im Bank--which will \ncreate 300,000 jobs and generate more than $1 billion of new revenue \nfor our country. The minority leader has supported the Export-Import \nBank in the past. This legislation also has the total support of the \nnational chamber of commerce. So it will build on the important work we \nhave done this week to help create jobs. It isn't a 2.8 million job \ncreator as is our highway bill, but it is an important piece of \nlegislation to allow capital formation to be made much more rapidly.\n  Today the Senate passed this Transportation jobs bill which is such a \njob creator that it is one of the rare occasions we have here in Senate \nwhere we can really look to creating, with one vote, millions of jobs. \nToday we also, of course, as I have just indicated, reached a \nbipartisan agreement to ease the delays in our Nation's courts. Passing \na small business jobs bill that helps companies expand and export their \nproducts would be yet another bipartisan accomplishment of which the \nSenate can be proud. To that, I refer the Ex-Im Bank.\n  I appreciate my friend from Iowa being patient. It seems that there \nare times when he wants to really speak, and sometimes I don't know he \nis coming, but it seems I show up at about the same time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, one or two times a year, out of the \nmany speeches I give on the floor of the Senate, I report to my \ncolleagues on a crusade I have to wake up the Department of Defense to \ngive more respect to audit reports coming out of the Office of \nInspector General.\n  In the last 2 years I have been very critical, and I am somewhat \ncritical now, but there has been vast improvement by the Department of \nDefense in responding to their use and the quality of their audits.\n  So I am coming to the floor once again to report on the latest \nresults of my ongoing audit oversight and review. I will refer to some \nfigures, but to kind of give you an overview, each year for the last 3 \nyears we have roughly reviewed in my office between 100 and 120 audit \nreports.\n  You have all those reports that have recommendations in them, and we \nhave seen a reluctance to move ahead to carry out the results of those \naudits, and in so many instances we would save so much money if the \naudit reports were carried out. When you spend $100 million every year \nin the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Defense, you \nwould expect that you ought to get some results from that $100 million \nexpenditure, and we are seeing some improvement.\n  Our work examines audits issued by the Office of Inspector General of \nthe Department of Defense. After receiving anonymous letters in early \n2009 alleging mismanagement of audit resources, I and my staff \ninitiated an in-depth oversight review. This is my third report in that \nseries. The goal of the report is to assess audit quality in 2011 and \nmake recommendations for improvements.\n  I am doing this work for one important reason. Like investigations, \naudits are a primary oversight tool. In fact, audits may be the most \nimportant tool, and that is because the auditor's core mission is to \nwatchdog how the taxpayers' money is being spent in the Department of \nDefense. That puts them on the money trail 24/7. If fraud is occurring, \nthat is where it will happen. That is where they need to be, and \nhopefully the auditors will find it.\n  These audits cost the taxpayers, as I said before, roughly $100 \nmillion a year. Are the auditors getting the job done? Are they rooting \nout waste and fraud, and as a result are they attempting to save the \ntaxpayers money?\n  My first report was published on September 7, 2010, and clearly \nindicated that the audit oversight capabilities in the Office of \nInspector General were seriously degraded. The inspector general at \nthat time, Gordon Heddell, responded to my first report in a very \nconstructive way: he promptly approved a transformation plan designed \nto improve audit quality.\n  In order to assess progress on reforms, I issued a second report on \nJanuary 1, last year. I called this one a report card. It evaluated and \ngraded 113 reports issued during fiscal year 2010. I awarded those 113 \nreports a grade of D-minus. The low overall score was driven by the \nvery same deficiencies pinpointed in my very first report. Instead of \nbeing hard-core, fraud-busting audits, most reports were policy and \ncompliance reviews. There was little or no attempt to even verify the \nexact dollar impact of the misguided policies examined. Such reports \noffered zero benefit to the taxpayer, though many of these reports were \nmandated by the Congress of the United States.\n\n  Out of those 113 reports, I identified 27 good reports that involved \ncommendable and credible--and in some cases nitty-gritty--audit work. \nWere it not for their long completion times, all of those 27 reports \nwould have earned very top scores.\n  At the conclusion of the second audit report, my staff presented a \nlist of the ``Top Nine Audit Roadblocks'' standing in the way of \nreform. After the second report was issued, Inspector General Heddell \nissued a sharp rebuttal, disagreeing with me very much. He complained \nthat I did not give sufficient credit for 18 audits that identified \n$4.2 billion in potential monetary benefits.\n  I addressed Inspector General Heddell's criticism on the floor of \nthis Senate on two separate occasions, July 5 and July 28 of last year. \nAt that time I admitted he had a legitimate gripe about my report. My \nstaff reviewed the matter and upped the score on 12 of the 18 reports, \nbut those adjustments did not move the overall score of the 113 reports \nout of that D range.\n  Today I am issuing my third audit oversight report. This one examines \nthe latest batch of reports, the 121 reports issued between October 1, \n2010, and September 30, 2011. They are known as the fiscal year 2011 \naudits. I am giving those reports an overall score of 3.51 or C-plus.\n  As my report indicates, there was an across-the-board improvement in \nevery category except one, timeliness. I am very happy to report to my \ncolleagues that audit quality appears to be improving. The best \npossible indicator of improvement is the doubling of top-rated reports. \nThose numbers jumped from 27 reports, or 25 percent of the total in \n2010, to 70 reports or 58 percent of the total production last year. \nThat is better than a twofold increase. The auditors have achieved a \nbreakthrough. The apparent progress is promising.\n  The most important area of improvement in audit quality was in the \nstrength of the recommendations. There was a surge in this key area. It \nwas propelled by calls for accountability and recovery of wasted money. \nAlthough modest and limited in number, these initiatives had force. \nRecommendations are the business end of an audit, and these \nrecommendations were based on rock-solid findings.\n  At least 50 reports of the 121 arrived at findings that documented \nflagrant mismanagement, waste, negligence, fraud, and even potential \ntheft. Sixteen of these reports recommended that responsible officials \nbe considered for administrative review. A comparable number contained \nrecommendations for the recovery of improper payments, and 10 reports, \nlargely those on ``stimulus'' projects coming out of the $814 billion \nstimulus bill that was voted on in February of 2009, recommended--on \nthose 10 reports--that wasteful projects be terminated.\n  These reports jumped out at me, as I hope they would you, if you read \nthese. These are quite remarkable. But 50 reports with rock-solid \nfindings should generate 50--not just 16--sets of hard-hitting \nrecommendations. So I am sorting out 16 out of the 50 for special \nrecognition. These 50 reports add up to a good beginning, but they do \nnot confer world-class status on the inspector general's audit office. \nWithin the grand totality of the 121 reports published in 2011, they \nare a drop in the bucket. The vast majority of the reports still offer \nweak recommendations. Most reports merely instruct audit targets to do \nwhat they already are required to do under law and regulation. In my \nopinion, that is a waste of ink and paper.\n  There are still four distinct trouble spots needing intense \nmanagement attention. The biggest problem continues to be the number of \nunsatisfactory reports. While I can no longer say most reports were \npoor, at 40 percent the proportion of low-scoring reports remains \nunacceptably high. Those reports continue to suffer from the same \ndeficiencies identified in a report commissioned by Inspector General \nHeddell in response to my first report 3 years ago. This report was \nproduced by two independent consulting firms and dated October 7, 2010. \nIt is known as the Quest Report.\n  Their conclusion, which matched by own, was as follows:\n\n       We do not believe Audit is selecting the best audits to \n     detect fraud, waste and abuse. The organization does not \n     audit what truly needs to be done. Some audits hold little \n     value in the end.\n\n  As I have said many times, far too many audits offer little or no \nbenefit to the taxpayers. That was still true in 2011.\n  Long audit production times remain another big problem. Old reports \noffer stale information that weakens the power and relevance of audit \nreports. Between 2010 and 2011, the average time needed to complete \nreports jumped from 13 months to 16 months. As I understand it, those \nnumbers do not tell the full story because they do not include the \nextra weeks or months reportedly needed for the planning and approval \nprocess that occurs before an audit even begins. Add those numbers\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\ntogether and we are looking at probably 1\\1/2\\ years to publish a \ncompleted audit. Stale information reduces audit impact to zero over a \nperiod time.\n  The Quest Report previously referred to pinpointed the root cause of \nthis problem: ``It is apparent that in the planning phase of audit \nselection, audits are written to fit a team as opposed to a team \nestablished to conduct the needed audit.''\n  Such organization inflexibility drives long completion times. It also \nleads to the publication of audits having objectives that are so narrow \nand limited in scope that they are virtually worthless. Audit teams \nneed to be organized to support more challenging and relevant audit \ntasks. Mr. Blair indicated recently he was moving in that direction.\n  There are two other outstanding problems. Far too few reports--just \nthe nine in all--verified actual payments using primary source \naccounting records. Failing to nail down exact dollar amounts of waste \nand mismanagement, including those resulting from misguided policies, \nends up undermining the credibility and completeness of audit reports.\n  I will give you an example. Using invoices and contracts to estimate \npayments would not appear to meet the most stringent audit standards. A \nmore acceptable procedure is essential because of the Defense Finance \nand Accounting Service's longstanding track record of making erroneous \nand unauthorized payments. In the face of such sloppy accounting \npractices, verification of payments should be mandatory.\n\n  Last, referral rates to the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, \nthe DCIS, are still far too low. Only five reports generated potential \ncriminal referrals, which appears to point to a lack of concern about \nfraud. Surely there was enough grist in the 50 reports which documented \negregious waste and misconduct to warrant additional referrals to the \nDefense Criminal Investigative Service and/or the Justice Department.\n  A number of audits stand out as candidates for further review and \npossible prosecution. I have urged Secretary Panetta and the acting \ninspector general to reexamine some of these issues. Acting IG \nHalbrooks has put the public spotlight on disgraceful and scandalous \nwaste and alleged misconduct that demands accountability. \nUnfortunately, unless the recommendations in those hard-hitting audits \nare somehow converted to concrete action, all this good work will \namount to nothing more than a bunch of auditors ``howling in the \nwilderness.'' It will simply ``fall through the cracks.''\n  Converting tough recommendations into concrete action takes \ndetermination and it takes relentless followup. The key is making such \nagencies do what they agreed to do at the conclusion of an audit. \nHowever, all indications suggest that corrective actions proposed in 16 \nhard-hitting reports have run into some serious roadblocks in the \nPentagon bureaucracy. Without high-level intervention--in other words, \neliminating those roadblocks in the Pentagon bureaucracy--most if not \nall accountability and savings measures could be slowly and quietly \nquashed in the bureaucracy.\n  A recent report from the Navy surely indicates that this fate awaits \nat least 1 of those 16 reports, and probably all the others as well. In \norder to assist in the audit resolution process, I have asked Secretary \nPanetta to conduct a top-level review of all the allegations contained \nin those 16 most disturbing reports, out of the 121 that we looked at \nin this last year. I urge the Secretary to establish a reasonable path \nforward on all unresolved recommendations. Until there are meaningful \nconsequences and real penalties for such gross waste and misconduct, \nthe culture of the organizations involved will not change.\n  In other words, that culture is going to perpetuate a lack of concern \nand action on the recommendations of these auditors because in a \nbureaucracy, not just in the Department of Defense, if heads don't roll \nyou are not going to see any change in the culture. Without \naccountability there will be no positive results. Good audit value will \ngo down the drain. Unabated waste of the taxpayers' money will \ncontinue.\n  Clearly, significant progress was achieved between 2010 and 2011, but \nthe inspector general's audit capabilities are not yet out of the \nwoods. Much more work remains to be done. Management needs to build on \nthe strengths exemplified by the 50 reports containing rock-solid \nfindings and 16 sets of hard-hitting recommendations. Those reports \ncould be used as models or building blocks for improving audit quality \nin the future.\n  In order to start producing more top-quality reports, management \nneeds to consider the following suggestions, of which I have eight: \nBring report recommendations into balance with the findings; increase \ncalls for accountability and recovery of improper payments; verify all \npayments using primary source accounting records; organize audit teams \nto match more complex and challenging tasks; pick up the pace of fraud \nreferrals to the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; develop a more \neffective audit followup strategy; and lastly, follow up to ensure that \nprosecutions occur where warranted or necessary.\n\n  These adjustments should be achieved using available resources. \nCorrect these problems and top-quality reports will be the norm. All \nthese goals are within easy reach. Once accomplished, audits will be \nfully aligned with the core mission of the inspector general.\n  In closing, I want all the auditors in the inspector general's office \nto know that I consider their oversight mission to be of the highest \nimportance. There is nothing more important to the taxpayers than \nhaving an aggressive team of auditors watchdogging how the taxpayers' \nmoney is being spent. I know there has been a concerted effort over the \npast few years to improve the quality of their work. I deeply respect, \ndeeply appreciate, and will support these efforts. They are starting to \npay off. I can see the results of all the hard work.\n  I encourage all the auditors to keep moving ahead until the job is \nfinished, and I urge Mr. Blair to unleash the auditors. I want them to \nbe tigers. Encourage them to call waste what it is--waste. Let them \nfollow their instincts and the guidance in their audit manuals that \ninstructs them to: ``Think fraud and plan audits to provide a \nreasonable assurance of detecting fraud.''\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have come to the floor to \nspeak about an opportunity to expand capital for small businesses by \nlifting the arbitrary limit on the credit unions ability to serve small \nbusinesses. I have done this on a number of occasions over the last \ncouple of years so the President knows that this is a cause that is \nimportant to me. It is important to me because there is a phenomenon in \nour country where small businesses are starving for credit. Yet the \nFederal Government is still standing in their way.\n  I am talking about the smallest of small local businesses. These are \nthe men and women who need $50,000, $100,000 or maybe $200,000 to move \nfrom their garage to a retail storefront, to renovate their sales floor \nor upgrade their equipment and expand. They are often too small to be \nworth a bank's time or they don't fit the lending guidelines of the \nbank's corporate headquarters. But these small business owners know \ncredit unions in their community have money to lend and these credit \nunions truly want to help. They probably see each other at Little \nLeague games, church, play cards together--they socialize. Instead of \nbeing able to offer the bridge loans that the small local businesses \nneed, the credit unions end up saying: Sorry, we want to help you but \nthe Federal Government has set a limit on how many businesses we can \nloan funds to.\n  Now we are moving to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\nJOBS Act, that the House passed last week. That bill is aimed at \nincreasing the availability of credit to startup companies by \nexpediting and easing the process of undergoing an IPO, or an initial \npublic offering. I think that is a noble goal, especially as our \neconomy still struggles to create jobs. But the problem is we are still \nleaving the little guys behind--the people in each and every one of our \nneighborhoods who want to expand their businesses and hire people as \nsoon as possible.\n  Unfortunately, the JOBS Act is aimed at companies with revenue under \n$1 billion. Let me repeat that--billion with a B. These companies may \nwell need help with IPOs, but I am talking about offering relief to \ntraditional Main Street businesses.\n\n  I am still committed to allowing credit unions to increase the amount \nof money they can lend to small businesses. So I will, once again, \nintroduce the bipartisan Small Business Lending Enhancement Act as an \namendment which would open additional credit to small businesses \nwithout costing taxpayers a dime.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has many small, wonderful towns in her \nState where she sees many small businesses. I wish to talk about a \ncouple small businesses in my State. Stacy Hamon is a Coloradan who \nowns the 1st Street Salon in Thornton. She was turned away by a bank \nbecause her loan was too small to be worth the risk. She went to her \ncredit union. They wanted to help her. They helped her. She opened a \nlarger business and she has created jobs in the process.\n  I am also talking about people such as Lisa Herman of Broomfield, CO. \nShe is the co-owner of Happy Cakes Bakeshop in Denver's Highland \nSquare, and she needed a loan to expand and cater more weddings. She \nwas turned away by her bank. She went to her local credit union and \nthat credit union was able to provide her with the loan she needed to \ncontinue to grow her successful business and hire more Coloradans.\n  Stacy and Lisa don't need a $1 billion IPO, they need a small bridge \nloan. We could be making an enormous difference in these local \ncommunities with mere pennies on the dollar, which is what the JOBS Act \nis focused on. Yet my amendment would be the only single piece of the \nJOBS Act that would actually help small businesses or directly create \njobs.\n  Put simply, credit unions specialize in these small loans to small \nbusiness. In fact, the average credit union small business loan is just \n$219,000. In contrast, the Federal Reserve has told us many banks have \nquit considering loans under $200,000 because they are not worth their \ntime.\n  Credit unions know these small business owners and they have money to \nlend to them. Unfortunately, Federal law still limits the amount of \nsmall business loans a credit union can extend to 12 percent of their \nassets. Nearly 350 credit unions are facing this cap and over 500 are \nhaving to slow down or stop their business lending altogether. That is \nhard to believe; it seems such a missed opportunity. In effect, we in \ngovernment are telling these financial institutions they cannot help \ncreate jobs in their local communities. That is why my amendment would \ndouble the amount of money credit unions can offer small businesses.\n  Let me turn to my friends in the banking sector. We have heard from \nbanks over the years, and they say they think it is unfair that they \nhave to compete with the credit unions. The fact is this isn't about \nbanks or credit unions; it is about small business. These financial \ninstitutions, quite frankly, serve very different small business \npopulations. Credit unions serve the smallest of small businesses that \noften must resort to relying on credit cards with comparatively high \ninterest rates in order to invest in equipment to grow their \nbusinesses.\n  These are business owners who have been turned away or ignored by \nlarge banks. We are talking about new loans to new and growing small \nbusinesses. After over 100 years of lending to small businesses, credit \nunions only represent 5 to 6 percent of all small business loans. Even \nif increasing the limit on credit union lending were to double their \nmarket share, banks would still have 90 percent of the market to \nthemselves.\n  I have also heard the banks say this proposal is unproven or somehow \nan unsound way of increasing small business loans. But the truth is \ncredit unions have been making small business loans since their \ninception in the early 1900s. That is, by my math, over 100 years. It \nwasn't until 1998 that there were any limits whatsoever on how much \nthey could lend.\n  The credit unions' own regulator, the National Credit Union \nAdministration, has endorsed lifting or even eliminating the small \nbusiness lending cap. The NCUA chairman testified before Congress that \n``increased business lending is good not only for the credit union, but \nalso for its members and the communities in which the credit union \noperates.''\n  I have to say I am frustrated. Why can we not agree on uninhibited \nsmall business support growth and job creation? Let's not let the \nsquabbles between banks and credit unions keep these jobs from out-of-\nwork Americans.\n  I will conclude by acknowledging that we passed earlier today a \nbipartisan transportation bill and, in so doing, we voted on amendments \ndealing with everything under the Sun, from contraception to \nprivatizing rest stops. So I sure hope we can have an open amendment \nprocess during consideration of the JOBS Act and include this important \namendment, this important legislation, which would help small business. \nAfter all, if we are going to tell the American people this bill is \nabout increasing access to capital--we have heard that said over and \nover, that this is about access to capital--we sure better be willing \nto start with those small business owners on Main Street. Colorado \ncommon sense and New Hampshire common sense could prevail. We ought to \nat least have a chance to consider this important issue and to debate \nthis idea on the floor of the Senate and, I hope, include it in the \nJOBS Act. Because access to capital is what is needed right now and the \ncredit union sector is willing and able to do so.\n  Madam President, thank you for your attention.

Is there objection? The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am going \nto explain my concerns. Let me start by quoting George W. Bush. George \nW. Bush said, ``Free markets are not a jungle in which only the \nunscrupulous survive, or a financial free-for-all guided only by \ngreed.''\n  He continued:\n\n       Tricking an investor into taking a risk is theft by another \n     name.\n\n  We are in the process of considering taking a health bill related to \nthe production of capital for small and emerging businesses and \nconsidering it on the floor of the Senate without due\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nprocess by the Senate Banking Committee. We need that process because \nthe House bill is full of problems for investors. It will create a \nmarketplace where investors can be deeply damaged.\n  It is our responsibility in this body to make sure that as we produce \na streamlined system for small companies and startup companies to \naccess capital that we don't create, basically, a scheme for pump-and-\ndump operators seeking to defraud American citizens. That is why we \nneed due consideration in committee.\n  I can't speak to the challenges with all the portions of the House \nbill, but I can speak to a specific section of the House bill called \ncrowdfunding because I have been working with others, including the \noccupant of the chair, Senator Bennet from Colorado, and Scott Brown \nfrom Massachusetts, to say let's utilize this crowdfunding tool but in \nan effective manner. Crowdfunding is saying let's take the power of the \nInternet, just as we have person-to-person lending facilitated by the \nInternet, let's take that and enable people who see small startup \ncompanies seeking capital investments and give them a chance to present \ntheir ideas and for folks to invest in those companies. So they might \nreceive thousands of small investments enabling them to take their \ndream forward for the benefit of the investor and the company.\n  But what is wrong with the way the House drafted this bill? I will \ngive short examples. It enables companies to raise up to $1 million by \nproviding no financial information--no financial information. That is \nnot an investment market; that is a scam.\n  Second, companies do not have to go through a registered \nintermediary. In other words, you or I, tomorrow, could start up a Web \nsite and say: Companies, sign up; investors, sign up--with no sort of \nprotocol for the registering of information and no system required for \nthe protection of investors. That is a major mistake in this \nlegislation.\n  Third, under the House bill, a person could say: Here are 10 stocks, \n10 potential companies to put your money into. Through that action they \ncould take 100 percent of your annual income in one fell swoop. So as \nwe create this new, this particularly interesting marketplace, full of \npotential, we don't want it to be a place where no financial \ninformation occurs, no rules for the intermediaries, and people can be \ntaken for their whole annual income in one fell glance. That is no way \nto build this wonderful potential marketplace.\n  To continue, the House bill lacks any advance public notice. So a \ncompany can provide notice to the SEC on the same day they offer the \nstock, and upon getting 60 percent of the amount they are seeking, the \ntarget amount, they can walk away with the investors' cash just like \nthat. In other words, offer it, no chance for the SEC to look at it, \ncollect their $1 million, walk away, and they didn't provide one ounce \nof financial information.\n  If you haven't seen the movie ``The Boiler Room,'' I encourage you to \ndo so because you will see how scams actually not permitted by law were \nused to defraud honest American families. In this case, we are just \npaving the path to predatory investing schemes. So that is a problem.\n  The House bill allows anonymous stock promoters so that it encourages \nthe opportunity for pump and dump. This is a reference to promoters \nsaying how wonderful something is and not identifying themselves to \nhaving a connection to the company offering the stock. It doesn't \naddress the issue of delusion.\n  If you had a chance to get in on the start of Starbucks, when they \nsaid they wanted to start up a coffee company, wouldn't that have been \ngreat to be in on the ground floor? You say: You bet--and you got 1 \npercent of Starbucks stock as a result. You would be very rich today.\n  But what about a company that proceeds to use a strategy of deluding \nthe original investors so that your initial investment is worth nothing \nwhen the company actually gets traction as a successful entity? That \ncertainly is an issue. These issues have all been wrestled with and \naddressed by the bill Senator Bennet, Senator Brown, and I have put \ntogether.\n  The other sections of the House bill have similar problems. I will \nnot speak to those problems because there are other folks who are much \nmore knowledgeable about it. I will stick to my section and use it as \nan analogy of why this entire bill should go through the Banking \nCommittee.\n  Let me read to you a letter from Motaavi. Their slogan is \n``Investment for Everyone.'' Isn't that the perfect slogan for \ncrowdfunding, ``Investment for Everyone''?\n  They address their letter:\n\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell:\n       We are a crowdfunding intermediary based in Durham, NC. We \n     understand the Senate will take up the [House bill] shortly. \n     We are very concerned about language in title III. While we \n     appreciate the broad exemption written by the House, the \n     language does not protect investors and puts the crowd \n     funding industry at risk of significant fraud. However, more \n     responsible language does exist.\n\n  Then it refers to the bill the Senate has been working on. Then they \nproceed to list many of the flaws I have just listed.\n  So here are folks out in the private sector who want to see a \nsuccessful process, and they want to be an intermediary. They don't \nwant to see this potential industry brought to a halt with a terrible \nreputation because it becomes a predatory industry.\n  I have another letter from Launcht:\n\n       This latest bill, the CrowdFund Act [the Senate version] is \n     important because unlike previous bills, for the first time \n     we have a Senate bill with bipartisan sponsorship, a balance \n     of oversight and Federal uniformity, industry standards, \n     investor protection, workable funding caps.\n\n  It lays out what this work should be in this bill.\n  Finally, I want to note the perspective in the New York Times \neditorial, entitled, ``They Have Very Short Memories''. It is scathing \nin its critique of this process we are engaged in:\n\n       House Republicans, Senate Democrats, and President Obama \n     have found they support: a terrible package of bills that \n     would undo essential investor protections, reduce market \n     transparency and distort the efficient allocation of \n     capital.\n  They go on:\n\n       Of course, the supporters don't describe it that way. They \n     say the JOBS Act--for Jumpstart our Business Startups--would \n     remove burdensome regulations that they claim have made it \n     too difficult for companies to raise money from investors.\n       Never mind that reams of Congressional testimony, market \n     analysis, and academic research have shown that regulation \n     has not been an impediment to raising capital. In fact, too \n     little regulation has been the root of all recent bubbles and \n     bursts--the dot-com crash, Enron, the mortgage meltdown. \n     Those free-for-alls created jobs and then imploded, causing \n     mass joblessness.\n\n  Wouldn't it have been great if, when those deregulatory efforts that \ndidn't deregulate in a positive way, cutting out unnecessary redtape \nbut in negative ways, which created a Wild West marketplace with all \nkinds of predatory practices, would it not be nice if the Senate stood \nin and said we are the cooling saucer--I have heard that term ever \nsince I came here, that we are the ``cooling saucer.''\n  We cooled our heels for 3 weeks with the Transportation bill on the \nfloor, and we weren't able to consider one single amendment during that \n3-week period. That is a deep freeze, not a cooling saucer. Now we have \ngone from deep freeze to bullet train. We need to slow this train down. \nWe need to have due deliberations to recreate the sort of deregulation \nthat is so important for the future growth of the United States and the \nfuture success of American families.\n  I am going to withdraw my objection, Mr. President, because I wanted \nto make a point now that, hopefully, will help guide our deliberations \nover the next couple of days. It is not that we should not be getting \nto this topic; we certainly should. But we need to do so in a manner \nthat works for American businesses, small businesses, startups, and \nfamilies, and the House bill doesn't do it.\n  I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the work done by the Presiding \nOfficer and the junior Senator from Oregon on this most important piece \nof legislation, and especially the problems the two Senators I \nmentioned believe is evident with this legislation. I appreciate the \nopportunity I have had to work with the two of them today. We will \ncontinue to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1675-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1675-S1677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MR. JIM BOOTH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to someone\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nwho has given so much back to the great Commonwealth of Kentucky--\nsomeone who has taken it upon himself to make an investment in the \nbetterment of his community, county, and State for generations to come. \nI am speaking of Mr. Jim Booth of Inez, KY.\n  Mr. Booth has kept the town of Inez, located in Martin County, close \nto his heart his entire life. In this town he graduated from high \nschool, met his wife, Linda, and paid his way through Morehead State \nUniversity by working part-time in the region's coal mines. So many \nmilestones in Jim Booth's life have taken place in this eastern \nKentucky town, it is no surprise that he is so devoted to giving \nsomething back to the place that's given him and his family so much.\n  Jim Booth combined a business administration degree, love for his \ncommunity and its residents, and hard work to stimulate the local \neconomy across the board. It has been said that there isn't a single \ngrowth project in Martin County that doesn't have Jim and Linda Booth's \nfingerprints all over it. The couple manages a coal company, a Ford \ndealership, real-estate agencies, convenience stores, hotels, insurance \nagencies, and a building supply store.\n  With so many successful projects in so many industries, it may seem \nthat Jim Booth has a lot to brag about. But Jim is a man of modesty and \nhumility. He makes it a point not to boast about his own \naccomplishments, but the accomplishments others have made from the \nlittle push that he gave them. Jim has helped to bring over 2,000 jobs \nto the area, and he is grateful for the exceptional employees that he \nhas been so blessed with.\n  Booth's story is one of success in the free market, and a testimony \nto what can happen when a small business is given room to take root and \ngrow. Mr. Booth bought his first coal mine when he was just 25 years \nold. At the time, the tax rate was 70 percent, and he remembers having \nto borrow against his own income for the next year just to pay the \nbusiness's taxes. ``Then, when Reagan became President and taxes went \ndown--BOOM. We're the best story you'll find for how success comes from \ntax relief,'' says Jim.\n  Over the next few years, the business experienced tremendous growth \nand success. Jim went on to start a building supply company, and from \nthis he put into effect his most important piece of business advice--be \nyour own best customer. Mr. Booth made the necessary purchases from the \nbuilding supply store to assist in building numerous hotels, \nconvenience stores, and other various buildings and business over the \nyears.\n  Mr. Booth has a vision of renovating and remodeling virtually the \nentire city of Inez's local infrastructure at some time or another. He \nis almost halfway through this process, as he has already made headway \nproviding new facilities for the Martin County Board of Education and \nthe Martin County Economic Development Board, of which he is the \nchairman.\n  The most prized accomplishment of Mr. Booth is the Roy F. Collier \nCommunity Center, named in honor of Jim's late friend and business \npartner who passed away in 2005. The facility houses a movie theater, \nindoor track, fitness center, arcade, and large meeting rooms available \nfor reservation. The versatile community center provides entertainment \nto over 200,000 residents of Kentucky from across the state annually.\n  Along with all of these major improvements to his local community, \nJim has also sponsored a local basketball tournament, provided the \nchance for anyone who is interested to become a certified coal miner, \nand headed up a campaign that helps combat youth obesity called \n``Martin County on the Move'' with United States Representative Hal \nRogers. While it may seem like Jim has a lot to celebrate, he stays \nfocused on what all of his hard work is really about.\n  ``This is home, Linda and I decided to stay here; build here and \nimprove our community for the next generation,'' Jim says. Jim is \ndetermined to providing as much inspiration and as many opportunities \nas he can to those individuals who share with him the same ``home'' of \nMartin County, KY.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my Senate colleagues \nto join me in commemorating the accomplishments of this treasured \ncitizen of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  In 2011, an article was included in a publication released by the \nSoutheast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce that featured the many \naccomplishments that Jim Booth has been able to generate throughout his \nlife thus far. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record that article.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n        [From the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, 2011]\n\n                               Jim Booth\n\n\n                   Committed to Economic Development\n\n       There's an old adage that says ``Bloom where you are \n     planted.'' It's apparent that Jim and Linda Booth have taken \n     that saying to heart. Not only have their family and \n     businesses prospered in Martin County, but they have worked \n     to make the entire county ``bloom.'' You can hardly enter a \n     building, walk a trail, or have a bite to eat in which the \n     Booths weren't involved. A short list of businesses the \n     Booths operate include coal mining, a Ford dealership, \n     convenience stores, real estate, building supplies, hotels, \n     and insurance, but the underlying theme is their dedication \n     to cultural and economic development in their hometown.\n       ``There's no question, we could have gone other places and \n     it would have been easier, and maybe more profitable as far \n     as the retail side goes,'' Jim explains, ``but I really know \n     that someone had to be involved here in our community. There \n     haven't been very many people willing to do that, but I can \n     tell you, the team we've put together has been able to make \n     our enterprises profitable. Mostly, it has allowed us to \n     employ a lot of people. We employ about 800 in retail and we \n     have around 1,400 coal miners. One way we have made our \n     enterprises work is that we are one of the best customers of \n     about every business we've started. That's given us a base \n     for some sustainability.''\n       ``One of the first businesses we started was a building \n     supply, and the next one was a mine supply business, so we \n     were, of course, good customers of both of them. When we \n     built hotels, we used our building supply to furnish the \n     materials. Then we put a team together to build the hotels. I \n     entered into a partnership with my brother-in-law, Kevin \n     Davis, who operates Fast Change Lube & Oil, a chain of \n     Pennzoil Lube Centers. Kevin has done an excellent job in \n     growing our stores, which today we have over 21 lube centers \n     and six car washes. We're a good customer of our insurance \n     companies and, of course, our convenience stores. Even the \n     Ford dealership, we're probably one of the best customers of \n     the dealership. It's not necessarily all been calculated in \n     advance--sometimes opportunities just arise. We entered into \n     the car dealership business in order to keep one here, then \n     we lost the Chevrolet store when the government took over GM. \n     But we still have Ford.''\n       Jim and Linda Booth both graduated from Warfield High \n     School; Linda a year after Jim. Jim started college at \n     Morehead State University and Linda began next year. In order \n     to pay their way through school, Jim became a part-time coal \n     miner. ``We drove here (Inez) on weekends,'' Jim remembers, \n     ``and I worked in a service station for my brother. Then, \n     during the day, I worked underground in the mine. Linda and I \n     would drive back to Morehead in time for school. I had Monday \n     through Thursday classes typically, so we could come home on \n     Thursdays. When I graduated, I interviewed for a couple of \n     personnel jobs--I have a business administration degree--and \n     I realized I made more money working part-time as a coal \n     miner than any other offer I was getting at the time.\n       I said to Linda, `Let's go back and let me work a little \n     while at the mine,' '' Jim remembers. ``I had a hard time \n     talking her into it but I convinced her,'' he smiles. ``Real \n     quickly I got into management, and by the time I had \n     completed three years' experience, I became a foreman. When I \n     was 25 years old, I got the opportunity to start my own mine. \n     Then, when I was 27, I incurred a hefty sum in income tax! \n     That was when the tax rate was 70 percent. I had a hard time \n     scraping up the money, and then there was no money left for \n     us--it all went to the federal government and I was \n     struggling. I had to borrow money from the next year's \n     earnings to pay the taxes. Then, when Reagan became president \n     and taxes went down--BOOM. We're the best story you'll find \n     for how success comes from tax relief. We would not have \n     survived if the taxes had stayed the same. We bought a brand \n     new set of equipment for our mine. We'd been in business nine \n     years and had not been able to afford new equipment. We had \n     money to use to invest then, and we started growing. We had \n     operated only contract mines until 1988, at which time we \n     were able to get our own operation. We bought an Ashland coal \n     operation in Johnson County, and we began cleaning and \n     washing the coal at the prep plant, marketing the coal--the \n     entire process.''\n       ``During that time was when we started to diversify,'' Jim \n     continues. ``We built our first development building--a \n     building that we leased to the post office--it had apartments \n     upstairs. That was the very first investment we completed. We \n     bought the building supply in the early '80s and put the\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\n     group together that started using our supplies--we buy from \n     ourselves when we build houses, apartments, hotels, and any \n     other retail developments.''\n       Jim Booth has many things to be proud of--building an \n     economic conglomerate from scratch, for one--but he is very \n     modest when speaking of his business accomplishments. What he \n     seems most proud of are the jobs and opportunities he's been \n     able to bring to the local people.\n       ``We started the convenience stores in '84. The first Fast \n     Lane was in Lovely, KY. We have a really good team--James \n     Mills manages Fast Lane, Fast Lane Tobacco Stores, and \n     Mountain Petroleum, and he does a really good job. Fast Lane \n     has been a great success--not just for Martin County but for \n     the region. Locally, we do tremendous things for the school \n     system. The Fast Lane Classic is second to none--I doubt \n     there is a better pre-season basketball tournament in the \n     state of Kentucky. It's held at Sheldon Clark High School on \n     the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, and some of the best \n     teams in the tri-state participate. UK Wildcat Patrick \n     Patterson participated in our tournament when he played at \n     Huntington High.\n       ``Through our businesses, we're able to help a lot of these \n     kids get into the workforce,'' Jim continues. ``They'll tell \n     me, `I got to buy a car because of Taco Bell or KFC' because \n     that's where they work. There wouldn't be those kinds of \n     opportunities here for kids if we didn't have the retail \n     jobs.\n       ``On the coal mining sector, we've allowed anybody from the \n     area who wants to be a miner and is qualified to train and \n     become a certified coal miner. To be honest with you, we need \n     coal miners right now. We have several vacancies in our \n     mining operations. We could hire qualified people right \n     now.''\n       After Fast Lane, knowing the area needed a hotel, Jim and \n     his team built the Inez Super 8 Hotel. He chose the location \n     because the site had the necessary infrastructure. From \n     there, they moved out from Martin County and began what he \n     refers to as the Interstate Hotels--located in Mt. Sterling, \n     Catlettsburg, and two in Huntington--all on I 64. They're all \n     doing well.\n       When asked to describe his business plan, Jim explains it \n     very simply: ``We have mostly grown from within based on \n     common synergies. Almost everyone in management has started \n     on the ground floor and worked their way through the system. \n     Most are local residents. We have a lot of families that \n     every member of the family has worked for us. We try to \n     provide all the opportunities this area can support.''\n       The companies have ventured out of Martin County. Jim's \n     son-in-law, Jeff Fraley, operates the United States \n     Achievement Academy in Lexington, which is similar to Who's \n     Who. They do all the printing for the book and have about 100 \n     employees. Two other businesses in Lexington are Southeast \n     Mail, the largest bulk mailer in Lexington, and a Bluegrass \n     branch of Elite Insurance.\n       Booth Enterprises has gone into Louisa with the new \n     Yatesville Crossing shopping center, containing retail \n     businesses such as Wal-Mart, Appalachian Wireless, and Radio \n     Shack. Plans are to build a medical center on the lower \n     level. As an offspring of the building supply in Lovely, a \n     Surplus Home Center has been opened in Louisa. The company \n     buys oversupply items from different places and ships them to \n     the Center. The buyer is Martin County native Carolea Mills \n     who is also a board member of the Roy F. Collier Community \n     Center.\n       Jim Booth really lights up when describing the Collier \n     Community Center and its programs. ``It is probably the most \n     unique centralized facility Martin County has ever \n     established, and it is highly utilized by the community,'' he \n     says. ``Roy Collier was one of my business partners when I \n     started out, and he passed in 2005. I donated the property, \n     so I was allowed to name the building in honor of Roy. The \n     Community Center has four digital 3 D cinemas with surround \n     sound, an indoor walking track, a gift store, a Fun Zone \n     Arcade, a fitness center, video conferencing, a computer lab, \n     and large rooms for receptions or meetings. Over 125,000 \n     people per year make use of it. It's a real drawing card--\n     people come from surrounding counties--especially for the \n     cinema.''\n       Jim was also instrumental in working with Morehead State \n     University, where he has served as chairman of the Board of \n     Regents, to bring the ``Martin County on the Move'' program \n     to Martin County and the Collier Community Center. He and \n     President Wayne Andrews of Morehead State University met with \n     U.S. Representative Hal Rogers to discuss the problem of \n     obesity in young people. The Congressman secured a year's \n     grant to encourage Martin County kids to be more active and \n     to select healthy food. Although the program is based at the \n     Collier Community Center, the health directors work through \n     the local school system. One year, Jim bought pedometers for \n     all the kids in 6th grade! Started in Martin, the program \n     will progress into other counties, with Lawrence County the \n     next possible choice. ``Martin County on the Move'' has been \n     hugely successful in creating new health and wellness \n     initiatives in the community.\n       Jim's personal involvement throughout Inez is evident by \n     his leadership as chairman of the Martin County Economic \n     Development Board, which has oversight of the new Business \n     Center. The Martin County Board of Education and the office \n     of the Kentucky Health & Human Services were both in \n     buildings that were falling apart around them. Now an open, \n     light-filled, modern building with walls filled with art and \n     the very best in technology stands as a beacon of progress in \n     the community. It is home to both organizations and has \n     additional leasable space as well. Built with coal severance \n     tax money and the support of Judge Kelly Callaham, the county \n     is allowed to keep the revenue to maintain the facility. \n     Christi Brown, executive director of the Martin County \n     Economic Development Authority, spearheaded development of \n     the Business Center and presently manages the Center.\n       The Martin County Historical Society was also built on \n     property Jim and Linda Booth donated. The Historical Society \n     has a small privately owned gift shop, located on the first \n     floor of an adjoining building, and the rent helps with \n     operating expenses of the Society. Mike Duncan, president of \n     Inez Deposit Bank, allows students from their summer intern \n     program to volunteer at the Society. The students work at the \n     bank, participate in cultural programs, hear business \n     speakers (including Jim Booth), and work on their own family \n     trees at the Historical Society.\n       Jim transitions seamlessly from recalling the past to \n     looking toward the future. ``County Judge/Executive Kelly \n     Callaham wants to build a new courthouse and continue to \n     utilize the existing facility as a redesigned cultural \n     center. We're also looking at doing some redevelopment on the \n     east side of Inez's Main Street. We want to remodel or \n     replace most of the buildings, and we hope to make retail \n     space downstairs and office or living quarters upstairs. \n     We're working with the Appalachian Regional Commission to \n     develop a plan.''\n       It's safe to say that whatever Jim puts his efforts into \n     will exceed expectations, will definitely be something to \n     benefit both Martin County and southeastern Kentucky, and \n     will be a source of pride and inspiration.\n       It's plain to see that Jim Booth is dedicated to making \n     things happen in Martin County, buy why does he put such \n     effort and heart into every project?\n       ``This is home,'' he says. ``Linda and I decided to stay \n     here; build here and improve our community for the next \n     generation.'' That they have done, and they are to be \n     commended for their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1677-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1677-S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor to express my \nhope that Republicans would join together with Democrats to end the \ndamaging filibusters of judicial nominations. With a judicial vacancies \ncrisis that has lasted years, and nearly 1 in 10 judgeships across the \nNation vacant, this is something the Senate needs to do. I hoped that \nwe could work together to ensure that the Federal courts have the \njudges they need to provide justice for all Americans without needless \ndelay.\n  Today there are 22 circuit and district court nominations ready for \nSenate consideration and a final confirmation vote. They were all \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee after thorough review. \nAll but a handful are by any measure consensus nominations. There was \nnever any good reason for the Senate not to proceed to votes on these \nnominations. It should not have taken cloture motions to get agreement \nto schedule votes on these qualified, consensus judicial nominations. A \ndozen of the nominations on which agreement has now been reached have \nbeen stalled for months and were reported last year.\n  These are qualified judicial nominees. They are nominees whose \njudicial philosophy is well within the mainstream. These are all \nnominees supported by their home State Senators, both Republican and \nDemocratic. The consequence of these months of delays is borne by the \nnearly 160 million Americans who live in districts and circuits with \nvacancies that could be filled as soon as Senate Republicans agree to \nup-or-down votes on the 22 judicial nominations currently before the \nSenate awaiting a confirmation vote.\n  In light of the agreement reached between the leaders, the Senate \nwill finally be allowed to consider the nomination of Judge Gina Groh \nof West Virginia. Her nomination has been stalled for more than 5 \nmonths. We will also finally be able to consider other long-stalled \nnominations like that of Michael Fitzgerald to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Central District of California, which has been \nready for a vote for well over 4 months. The delays in confirmations \nmean justice delayed for millions of Americans.\n  I went back and checked my recollection of how we considered \nconsensus Federal trial court nominees in President Bush's first term. \nNearly 60 were confirmed within a week of being reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. By contrast, there have only been two judicial \nnominees voted on so\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\npromptly since President Obama took office. I said at the time we were \nable to vote on the Alabama nominee supported by Senator Sessions, who \nwas at that time the committee's ranking Republican member, and on \nJudge Reiss of Vermont that I hoped they would become the model for \nregular order. Instead, they stand out as isolated exceptions to the \nmonths of delay Senate Republicans have insisted on before considering \nconsensus Federal trial court nominees of this President.\n  I am glad that there is finally agreement to proceed, as well, with \ncircuit nominees. Two delayed from last year are outstanding women: \nStephanie Dawn Thacker of West Virginia, nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California, nominated to fill \none of the many judicial emergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Ms. \nThacker, an experienced litigator and prosecutor, has the strong \nsupport of her home State Senators, Senators Rockefeller and Manchin. \nJudge Nguyen, whose family fled to the United States in 1975 after the \nfall of South Vietnam, was confirmed unanimously to the district court \nin 2009 and would become the first Asian Pacific American woman to \nserve on a U.S. court of appeals. Both were reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee last year and both should be confirmed by the \nSenate without additional damaging delays.\n  I am pleased that the majority leader and the Republican leader have \nnow come to an understanding and a path forward on these important \njudicial nominations. Their agreement not only helps work through the \nbacklog of nominations stalled before the Senate, it paves the way for \nvotes on 14 of the 22 current judicial nominations and provides a \npattern for continuing to make progress beyond those 14 and beyond the \ncurrent 22. There are another 8 judicial nominees who have had hearings \nand are working their way through the committee process. In addition, \nthere are another 11 nominations on which the committee should be \nholding additional hearings during the next several weeks. By working \nsteadily and by continuing the resumption of the regular consideration \nof judicial nominations, I hope the understanding between the leaders' \nsignals we can have a positive impact and reduce judicial vacancies \nsignificantly before the end of the year. In 2004 and 2008, both \nPresidential election years, by working together we were able to reduce \njudicial vacancies to the lowest levels in decades.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hard-working Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge hears the \ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  Never before in the Senate's history have I seen the confirmation of \nqualified, consensus district court nominees supported by their home \nState Senators and reported by the Judiciary Committee blocked for \nmonths. We remain 40 confirmations and 9 months behind the pace we set \nduring 2001 through 2004, during President Bush's first term. The \njudicial vacancy rate remains nearly double what it was at this time \nduring his first term.\n  We 100 Senators stand in the shoes of over 300 million Americans. It \nis good to see the Senate agreeing to end the partisan stalling and \nschedule votes on these long-delayed and much-needed judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1678-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITALIAN UNIFICATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for the past year the people of Italy have \nbeen commemorating the 150th anniversary of Italian Unification with a \nseries of events and exhibitions throughout Italy and the world.\n  In this country, the Italian Embassy hosted a series of concerts, \nmuseum exhibitions, and lectures, which were widely attended and have \neducated and entertained Americans about the stirring story of Italy \nand the beauty of its culture. The Ambassador of Italy who initiated \nthis series of commemorative events, Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata, \ndeserves recognition for organizing this remarkable program for the \nAmerican people. We wish Ambassador Terzi well in his new job as \nForeign Minister, and we welcome his successor, Claudio Bisogniero, as \nthe new Ambassador of the Italian Republic to the United States.\n  There were many outstanding moments on the road to Italian \nunification--most notably March 15, 1861, the day Victor Emmanuel II \nwas proclaimed the King of a single Italian state. But several weeks \nearlier, on February 18, 1861, the future King of Italy convened the \nfirst Italian Parliament in Turin, establishing an Italian democratic \ntradition that has known both triumph and tragedy. Of course, Americans \ndon't have to go to Italy or a cultural event to appreciate the Italian \nroots of our own democratic tradition. Not only did Roman history and \nconceptions of government inform and inspire the Founders of our own \ngovernment, but the sons and daughters of Italy are all around us \nserving the cause of American democracy. It would be impossible to name \nmore than a few, but even a partial list gives a sense of the magnitude \nof the Italian-American contribution to our democracy: John Pastore, \nthe first Italian-American elected to this Senate; Fiorello LaGuardia, \nthe legendary mayor of New York; Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to \nbe on a national ticket; Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker of the \nHouse; Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito; and Leon \nPanetta, our current Secretary of Defense.\n  This week the Senate adopted a resolution that I introduced \ncommemorating this anniversary and the abiding relationship between our \ntwo countries. I am glad to be joined by my colleagues, Senators \nBarrasso, Casey, Enzi, Gillibrand, Lugar, Schumer, and Shaheen, as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  This 150th anniversary year closes during challenging times for a new \ngeneration of Italians. It is worth pausing here in Washington to \nsalute our ally, from whom we have drawn so much talent and \ninspiration. We wish the citizens of the Italian Republic our best, \nwith knowledge that during the past 150 years their Republic has \nendured many challenges and confidence that they will rise even higher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1678-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1678-S1679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO XURON CORPORATION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the American manufacturing sector is \ncritical for economic expansion and job creation, employing nearly 12 \nmillion Americans across the country. Today, due to global economic \ndownturns and increasing competition from abroad, American firms must \nadapt to compete in an international marketplace by incorporating \ncreative and innovative designs. With this in mind, I rise to commend \nXuron Corporation, located in Saco, ME, a shining example of an \nAmerican company adapting and succeeding in an increasingly complex \ninternational economy.\n  Xuron, originally founded in Danbury, CT, began producing high-grade \nprecision hand tools in 1971. In 1986, this small firm relocated to \nMaine to take advantage of expansion opportunities and the State's \nexpert workforce. For over 40 years, this company has been an industry-\nleading developer, manufacturer, and seller of high-grade precision \nhand tools for multiple industries from aerospace to jewelry. With \nhundreds of distributors, Xuron tools can be found in factories and \nworkshops around the world.\n  Just recently, the National Institute of Standards and Technology's \nHollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, program recognized \nXuron for ``Making it in America'' due to their innovative designs, \naccess to foreign markets, and continually creating jobs for American \nworkers. While the great recession drastically affected businesses \nacross the United States, Xuron surmounted all obstacles by readjusting \ntheir operations to combat the economic downturn. For instance, the \ncompany began cross-training its employees to perform a multitude of \ntasks ranging from manufacturing to accounting. Furthermore, the \ncompany actively removed inefficiencies along\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\nits shipping and receiving chain, enabling it to save jobs and \neliminate waste in the process. These resourceful changes have created \na sense of company-wide camaraderie and further enhanced Xuron's \ncompetitiveness overseas.\n  While Xuron's products can be found around the world, the company's \nsuccess directly helps people in the United States. For example, after \nHurricane Katrina ravaged the gulf coastline in 2005, Xuron generously \ngave employee and corporate donations to the Bush-Clinton Katrina \nRelief Fund to rebuild areas damaged by the catastrophic natural \ndisaster. The company's donations helped Gulf State Americans rebuild \nafter an unprecedented tragedy, demonstrating Xuron's selfless \ncommitment to helping individuals across the country.\n  Throughout history, Americans have shown a unique ability to overcome \nand succeed through hard times. Xuron is a shining example of American \nresilience as employees have worked together, retrained, and excelled \nthrough tough and uncertain economic climates. Their inspiring story \ndemonstrates the tenacity of American small businesses, and \nparticularly illuminates the strength found within the American \nmanufacturing sector. I am extremely proud of Xuron's ingenuity and \nsincerely wish the company continued success in the coming \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/14/senate-section/article/S1679-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 2191.

The tiered approval process shall \n     establish standards designed to ensure that the new business \n     lending capacity authorized under the amendment made by \n     section 802 is being used only by insured credit unions that \n     are well-managed and well capitalized, as required by the \n     amendments made under section 802, and as defined by the \n     rules issued by the Board under this subsection.\n       (c) Considerations.--In issuing rules required under this \n     section, the Board shall consider--\n       (1) the experience level of the institutions, including a \n     demonstrated history of sound member business lending;\n       (2) the criteria under section 107A(a)(2) of the Federal \n     Credit Union Act, as amended by this title; and\n       (3) such other factors as the Board determines necessary or \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 804.
