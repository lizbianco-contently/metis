In one of his poems, T.S. Eliot wrote, ``Hurry up please. \nIt's time.'' He could have been writing about us in the U.S. Senate.\n  Yesterday, this great Nation celebrated its 235th birthday. In those \n235 years, we have accomplished many admirable things, and we have done \nit together. We have landed on the Moon, invented new ways to save \nlives, and fought for democracy and freedom all around the world. Now \nwe stand poised to make a different kind of history.\n  For the first time, the United States of America stands at the brink \nof defaulting on our financial obligations. The Chief Economist for the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce said allowing America to default on the debt \n``would be tantamount to writing a bad check.''\n  Unless we take action, tarnishing this great Nation's sterling \nreputation will be the least of our concerns. We also risk the very \nfate of this country's economy and the world's economy along with it. \nThe last time this country was plunged into a major recession, just 3 \nshort years ago, we took the world with us.\n  When Wall Street greed caused the financial collapse of our financial \nsystem, Americans across the country lost their jobs, their homes, and \ntheir savings, and so did people across the globe. This country is only \nbeginning to recover and the world with us. But the crisis we now face \nis one of even greater proportion without exception. The most respected \nbusiness economists and business minds of our time have said if America \ndefaults on its debt, it will have dire consequences here and around \nthe world. ``Catastrophe,'' they called it.\n  That same U.S. Chamber of Commerce economist said a failure to avert \nthis crisis ``is not a possibility.'' He could not even conceive the \nRepublicans in Congress could shirk their duty. Defaulting on our debt \nwould risk millions of American jobs, halt tax refunds, Social Security \nchecks, Medicare payments, and even paychecks for our troops. The \ndepression it would cause at home would ripple around the globe. Some \nhave suggested instead of getting Social Security checks, Social \nSecurity recipients would get an IOU from the Federal Government.\n  This default crisis is not a new problem. It has been around for \nmonths. But we no longer have months or even weeks to avert this \ncatastrophe. We have days. Yet my Republican colleagues have walked \naway from the negotiating table when we were nearing a solution--and so \nclose to disaster. Why? To protect oil companies, to protect the owners \nof yachts and corporate jets, to protect corporations that ship jobs \noverseas, to protect millionaires and billionaires from paying their \nfair share.\n  Twenty percent of all the income earned in this Nation is earned by \nless\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\nthan 1 percent of its citizens. It is this top approximately 1 percent \nthe Republicans are determined to protect. Republicans walked away from \nthe negotiations to protect them. Meanwhile, the rich are getting \nricher and the poor are getting poorer, and all that the middle-class \nDemocrats have worked to make stronger is disappearing. Middle-class \nfamilies are struggling to make ends meet.\n  That is why I brought to the floor legislation demanding millionaires \nand billionaires contribute their fair share to this crucial deficit \nreduction struggle. When Republicans talk about shared sacrifice, they \nmean the sacrifice should be shared by those who can least afford it. \nDemocrats believe that sacrifice should be shared by the richest 1 \npercent as well. The others have all sacrificed too much already.\n  As we debate in the Senate this week, negotiations with the Vice \nPresident and the President should continue. The invitation to \nRepublicans to help prevent a catastrophic default remains out there. \nTo become part of the solution rather than part of the problem, all \nRepublicans have to do is accept our invitation. The time is here for \nmy Republican colleagues to put politics aside. Simply put, we are out \nof time. But Democrats cannot negotiate with ourselves. When one side \ncomes to the table and the other refuses, it is impossible to \nnegotiate. So this week we will debate the solution to this crisis with \nthe Republicans, like it or not.\n  Democrats will be clear about what is at stake: the fate of our \ncountry and the global economy. We will be clear about our priority: to \navert a catastrophic default and protect our fragile economic recovery. \nWe will be clear about the middle ground we have already found: We must \ncut the deficit in order to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Democrats are willing to compromise, but compromise does not mean \nallowing our Republican colleagues to put the wants of a few \nmillionaires and billionaires ahead of the needs of the Nation and the \nworld.\n  I repeat the words of T.S. Eliot: ``Hurry up please. It's time.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/05/senate-section/article/S4312-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Washington is engaged in a debate right \nnow over the kind of country we want to be. The specific issue is this: \nAt some point over the next several weeks, the Federal Government will \nno longer be able to borrow the money it needs to cover the cost of \npromises it has already made. So the President wants Congress to raise \nthe statutory debt limit set by Congress. He wants us to raise the \nlimit on the national credit card.\n  Now, what Republicans have said is that the only way we will do it is \nif Democrats agree to change their ways so we don't end up with the \nkind of situation that we are witnessing over in Greece. Make no \nmistake, that is exactly where we are headed if we don't do something \nsignificant and do it now. Democrats so far have refused. Instead, they \nare making what can only be described as a bizarre request under the \ncircumstances.\n  In the middle of what we all agree is a debt crisis, they would like \nto spend even more. They want a second stimulus, more deficit spending. \nIn the middle of the jobs crisis, they want to raise taxes that we know \nwould kill even more jobs when even the President has said raising \ntaxes would leave job creators with less ability to hire. These are \ntheir solutions. This is what the President came off the campaign trail \nto defend last Thursday, and this is what Republicans oppose.\n  Our view is that the way to solve a debt crisis is to go on a diet, \nnot a shopping spree. Our view is the way to create jobs is to make it \neasier for businesses to hire, not harder. Frankly, we don't think the \nvoters sent a wave of Republicans to Washington last November because \nthey wanted us to raise taxes. They sent us here to restore some \nsanity. But the President and his Democratic allies in Congress don't \nseem to get it just yet.\n  Right now they are calling for a tax on aircraft manufacturers \nbecause they think it is good politics. It is their cheap attempt to \ntry to make anybody who opposes it look bad. What they forgot is many \nof them voted to repeal a similar tax during the Clinton administration \nbecause of the devastating effect it had on jobs. They made the same \narguments then, that we need to raise taxes on luxury goods to get more \nmoney, and it backfired. The shipbuilding industry alone lost tens of \nthousands of jobs.\n  Our Democratic colleagues surely must remember this, but apparently \nthey would rather have fun trying to caricature their political \nopponents than working out a bipartisan solution that would actually \nenable us to balance the books.\n  Here is the point: Washington needs to find a way to spend less. \nTaxing more is their easy way out. They will start with aircraft \nmanufacturers. Then when that is enough, and it never is, it is some \nother industry. Then another, and before we know it we are going after \nabsolutely everybody. Why? Because it is easier to find a bill than it \nis to make tough choices. But most Americans know what it is like to \nmake tough choices, and they want to know if they have to do it, why \ncan't Washington.\n  That is why I invited the President over here last Thursday to talk \nwith Republicans. My hope, as I made clear, is that he would listen to \nRepublicans and hear firsthand why we think raising taxes in a weak \neconomy is a bad idea and what the realities are over here.\n  My goal, as I said on Thursday, was to get together and talk about \nwhat is actually possible. The Obama administration said it wasn't a \nconversation worth having. Republicans in Congress believe finding a \nway to reduce the deficit and put Medicare on a more secure footing is \na conversation worth having.\n  So today I would like to reextend the offer. I think the best way to \nsolve this impasse is for the President to hear what needs to be done \nand how we can do it; hear what can actually pass in Congress. He needs \nto understand the principles at stake from our point of view.\n  It is not about rich and poor. It is not about an election. It is \nabout Washington taking the hit for a change. It is about having \nWashington make some tough choices for a change.\n\n  Americans want to see accountability here in Washington. They have \nseen Democrats spending trillions of dollars we don't have, and they \nhave seen the economic situation get worse in many respects than it was \nseveral years ago. The facts speak for themselves.\n  Since the President took the oath of office, nearly 2 million more \npeople are unemployed. That is a 17-percent increase in the \nunemployment rate under President Obama. Gas prices have nearly \ndoubled--up 86 percent since January of 2009. In the past 2 years, the \nFederal debt has increased 35 percent. Debt per person has increased by \nover $11,000. Health insurance premiums for working families have shot \nup 19 percent. All this while home values across the country have \ndeclined by 12 percent. They have clearly made the economy worse.\n  Americans get this. They think Washington, DC, should find a way to \npay its bills or scale back its commitments, as everybody in the \ncountry is doing. Americans have made enough sacrifices the past few \nyears. It is time for Washington to learn to make some sacrifice of its \nown.\n  Hopefully, the President will agree that reducing the debt is indeed \na conversation worth having. I think we can do it. But I think he needs \nto understand what the legislative realities are and why and we are \ncommitted to a result that will restore the people's confidence not \nonly in our economy but in our government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the clerk is about to report a \nmotion to proceed.\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/05/senate-section/article/S4313-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n5 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees \nand that any time spent in a quorum call be equally divided. There is \nalready an order in effect that Republicans will be limited to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          International Trade\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, international trade is one of the best ways \nto create more good-paying jobs for our people--as long as our workers \nand our companies are treated fairly in the tough global markets in \nwhich they compete.\n  That is not the case today. Chinese trade cheats, after being found \nguilty of dumping their goods in America, now launder these goods by \nillegally shipping them through Korea and other countries. This \nillegality is undercutting our workers, undercutting our companies, and \nis driving hard-working Americans out of jobs. All this is taking place \nunder the sleepy eyes of America's so-called trade enforcement \nagencies.\n  Because this trade rip-off is growing and the Senate will soon take \nup trade agreements that could fix this problem, I wish to take just a \nfew minutes this afternoon to make clear how this scam actually works. \nThe reason I have this information is because as chairman of the Senate \nFinance Subcommittee on International Trade, my staff set up a dummy \ncompany that intervened directly with suppliers in China in order to \nlearn firsthand how the Chinese firms brazenly shirk America's trade \nlaws.\n  First, after a thorough and substantial investigation, what happens \nis that the U.S. Department of Commerce imposes antidumping duties on \ncertain Chinese merchandise that was shown to be dumped, which is to \nsay the merchandise is being sold at below-market prices. The next \nthing that happens is the Chinese supplier of the merchandise is tagged \nwith the antidumping duties. Rather than stop selling and dumping goods \ninto the United States, the Chinese essentially shore up their American \nbuyers by soothingly conveying that these duties are not going to \nimpact their prices. The suppliers sometimes characterize complying \nwith U.S. trade law as merely a political issue.\n\n  After that, the Chinese goods are shipped into Korea, for example, \nwhere the goods are repacked into boxes that say ``Made in Korea.'' The \ndocumentation then follows the merchandise that is also going to be \naltered or forged to suggest that the merchandise indeed originates in \nKorea rather than China. From there, the merchandise enters our \ncountry, often at the Port of Long Beach in California, and U.S. \nCustoms officials declare the goods to not be subject to antidumping \nduties because, purportedly, if one looks at all the labeling, they \ndon't originate in China.\n  This transshipment is laundering, plain and simple, and it is a rip-\noff of the American worker.\n  My concern is once the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement goes into \nforce, Korea would become a supermagnet for this kind of merchandise \nlaundering. Why would any Chinese supplier launder merchandise through \nSingapore, for example, when doing so through Korea would bless their \nmerchandise with the duty-free status that the U.S.-Korea Free Trade \nAgreement provides? The answer is obvious. They wouldn't.\n  That is why the Congress needs, through legislation, to send clear \ninstruction to the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection--and these \nare our cops. They are the commercial cops at America's ports. They \nneed to be instructed about how to identify and combat the invasion of \nAmerica's trade laws. In my view, this is absolutely critical to \nensuring the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement is not a tool that further \nempowers unscrupulous Chinese exporters.\n  For almost a century, our trade laws, the antidumping and the \ncountervailing duties, have been enforced by Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. They represent the frontline defense that protects our \nAmerican workers. They are the laws that protect our businesses and our \nfamilies from unfair and unscrupulous trade practices employed by \nforeign competition. But what we are seeing around the country is that \nthese antidumping and countervailing duties are being evaded, and the \nproblem is growing. What we have seen is, it takes years for the \ngovernment to look into and conclude investigations on merchandise \nlaundering. During this period of foot-dragging, our companies get \nhammered by foreign trade cheats, and when the cheats get caught, the \nenforcement agencies have almost never taken the steps necessary to \nensure that the duties that are owed are actually collected.\n  The discrepancy between how much the U.S. Government is owed by these \nforeign trade cheats and how much is actually collected is \nembarrassing. We are collecting something on the order of 20 percent of \nwhat is owed to our government, and that is only from the companies \nthat actually got caught\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\nand were prosecuted. The fact is, there are many more that are missed \nevery year.\n  So I hope colleagues, as we go to the trade debate, understand that \nthe point of trade agreements is, it is possible to export more of our \ngoods and services around the world. What we want in trade agreements \nis to grow things here. We want to make things here. We want to add \nvalue to them here, and we want to ship them somewhere. So we want to \nexport our goods and services, not export our jobs. But, unfortunately, \nagain and again, as a result of our competitors evading the trade laws, \nwe have a broken enforcement process.\n  That is why three Democrats and three Republicans in the Senate have \njoined me in introducing a piece of legislation that puts the teeth \nback in our trade laws. Senators Snowe and Blunt and McCaskill and \nBrown of Ohio and Portman and Schumer and I all joined--three Democrats \nand three Republicans--to introduce S. 1133.\n  This legislation requires Customs to quickly and transparently \ninvestigate duty evasion. It requires the Customs agency to use \nexisting law to ensure that it can collect the correct duties on \nmerchandise. The legislation requires Customs to appropriately share \nthis information with other Federal agencies because we have seen, \nagain and again, that often one of the agencies doesn't talk to the \nother. Finally, it requires the appropriate agencies to make sure that \nin the future, they are going to report to the Congress promptly on \nwhat is being done to fully address the problem.\n  Let me wrap up--I see colleagues on the floor--by simply saying that \nI believe trade agreements create more jobs for our people, but the \nfact is trade agreements without enforcement can cost our people jobs. \nSo this time, as the Congress goes forward with considering trade \nlegislation, it is important to show the American people that as our \ntrade agenda moves forward and moves forward aggressively in the days \nahead, instead of major trade competitors laundering merchandise, as we \nhave seen in our committee's investigation, to avoid the trade laws, \nour trade laws would finally be fully enforced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I understand I have 10 minutes to speak on \nthe resolution before us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if the Chair would let me know, if I speak \nfor 8 minutes or longer, when I have 2 minutes left, I would appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague from Mississippi \nwill yield at this time.\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes, sir. It is my understanding the Senator from \nMississippi wishes to speak for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. Yes, I appreciate that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                            The Federal Debt\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, this weekend, a local newspaper in \nMississippi ran a lead editorial that wondered aloud whether the \ncancellation of the Senate's Independence Day recess signaled a \n``serious effort on the part of Senate leaders'' and the White House to \nmake headway in addressing the Federal debt. Regrettably, the answer to \nthat question is obviously no. For that reason, I wish to announce at \nthis point that I will be voting no this afternoon on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to a debate on Libya.\n  Clearly, Libya is an important issue. I am a member of the Armed \nServices Committee. I have the greatest of respect for both my chairman \nand the ranking member. But I will remind colleagues what the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff said recently: The most important national \nsecurity issue facing the United States of America is the national debt \nand we should not move to a vote on Libya and to a discussion on \nLibya--which, frankly, is almost academic at this point--until we \ndebate the crucial issue facing the Senate; that is, the issue of the \nnational debt.\n  If we had a serious effort to talk about the national debt, in this \nweek of recess that has been canceled, we would be convening the Budget \nCommittee today and asking them to report a budget on the floor for the \nfirst time in almost 800 days so we could have a debate on the floor \nabout the budget.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have another \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. If the Senate majority were serious about their efforts \nto reduce the Federal debt, the administration would not be continuing \nits efforts to spend our way to prosperity. We would be bringing to the \nfloor a budget to cut spending, to make a serious effort against these \nhuge Federal deficits we are seeing. We would not be engaging in the \npolitics of fear. We would not be engaging in the politics of class \nwarfare. We would be getting to business this week. I hope that is what \nwe will do.\n  The only way I know to get that debate is to vote ``no'' on the \nmotion for cloture this afternoon. I think a number of my colleagues \nwill be doing so. If some 41 of us can muster a ``no'' vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture, then we can have the debate on Libya at \nanother time and we can get today and this week to the one and only \nreason we are back in town; that is, this debt that consumes us, that \nthreatens our national security, our national well-being and we are \ncalled upon to debate by our colleagues and our constituents.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my friend from Tennessee for yielding.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis comments.\n  As I mentioned, I rise to speak about S.J. Res. 20. I think there has \nbeen some misinformation about what we are doing this afternoon. I know \nthe Acting President pro tempore and I were in a Foreign Relations \nCommittee meeting last week and offered several amendments that were \nnot passed. But many people have said what we are going to be debating, \npossibly this evening--I hope we do not--is something the President has \nasked for. The Acting President pro tempore, I know, knows differently.\n  The President did not ask for what it is we are going to be debating \nthis evening. The President earlier asked for a resolution of support \nbut not an authorization for this third war we are undertaking right \nnow in Libya. That is not what the President asked for.\n  As a matter of fact, the President, in a very cutely worded letter to \nCongress, tried to state that we were not involved in hostilities in \nLibya, and he did so in order to circumvent a law that has been on the \nbooks now for many years called the War Powers Act. So the President is \nnot seeking what the Senate is getting ready to debate on the floor at \nall. As a matter of fact, the President is trying to circumvent the War \nPowers Act. So there is no question, in my opinion, the President \nshould be made to seek authorization.\n  But then that brings us to the issue at hand. There is no way \nanything we do on the Senate floor--other than possibly pulling our \ntroops out of Libya, which is not what the resolution is about--is \ngoing to affect anything we are doing in Libya one iota. Let me say \nthat one more time. If the resolution we are debating, possibly this \nevening, were to actually be debated and passed, it would not affect \none iota of what we are doing in Libya. The fact is the House has \nalready turned down the same resolution. So, basically, we are burning \na week's time on something that is totally irrelevant to what is \nhappening in Libya and certainly irrelevant as it relates to what is \nbefore us as a country.\n  As the Senator from Mississippi mentioned, the biggest issue facing \nour country today is this issue of the debt ceiling and our debt, the \nfact that we have $14.2 or $14.3 trillion in indebtedness, and we are \nmoving beyond that, the fact that we have $1.5 trillion in deficits \nthis year, the fact that we are spending $3.7 trillion and only have \n$2.2 trillion, the fact that we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar \nwe spend every day we are here, and that 47 percent of that is coming \nfrom people overseas. That is the most important issue before us. That \nis the reason we are back\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\nhere this week during the July recess. I am glad we are here. But we \nneed to focus on the issue at hand.\n  To speak to how dysfunctional the Senate is, we are here over the \ndebt ceiling, we are here over the fact that we have huge deficits, and \nwe do not have an agreement to deal with that. But instead of focusing \non the issue at hand, which is what most people back in Tennessee or \nVirginia or some other place would do if they had a problem, we are \ngoing to focus on something possibly that is irrelevant and has nothing \nwhatsoever to do with the issue at hand, just to make the American \npeople think we are doing something.\n  I also will vote against cloture this evening, and I am here on the \nfloor to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--I have gotten \ncalls since I landed this morning from Tennessee, from Democratic \nSenators who want to figure out a way to resolve this issue, from \npeople who understand that our country is heading for a train wreck as \nit relates to our debt ceiling because there have not been serious \nnegotiations that have taken place.\n  So the Senator from Mississippi is right. Believe it or not, in a \nbody that spends $3.7 trillion a year, we have not had a budget in 797 \ndays. I cannot believe that as a citizen. I certainly cannot believe \nthat as a Senator. I do not think most citizens in our country realize \nwe are spending, right now, $3.7 trillion of their money this year and \nwe do not even have a budget that is passed. One has not come out of \ncommittee, a committee that, by the way--not to be pejorative here--has \na majority of people on the other side of the aisle who could easily, \nif they wanted to, pass a budget out to the Senate floor to be debated.\n  I know sometimes things are difficult to get done around here. But \ncertainly it is difficult to address the No. 1 issue we have before us \nin our country: these huge deficits which are creating this issue of \nthe debt ceiling that ``has to be raised.'' The fact is, again, we are \npossibly, this evening, getting ready to move to an issue that is \ntotally irrelevant--very important and certainly something that has \nbeen mishandled tremendously--but certainly something that, whatever \naction we take this week in the Senate, is going to be unaffected. It \nis not going to have any effect on it whatsoever other than Senators \nfeeling good about the fact that they did something that actually ends \nup bearing no fruit.\n  I urge people on both sides of the aisle to vote against cloture to \ntake up this issue--that we are in a third war, a war the President \ndoes not want to call a war by saying we are not involved in \nhostilities. Obviously we are. We have Predators doing what Predators \ndo. We have aircraft bombing military installations. If North Korea \nwere in our country bombing military installations and using Predators \nto do what Predators do, I think we would say that is hostilities. No \ndoubt we are involved in hostilities, and that issue should not be left \naside and undealt with. But, again, today, the big issue--the issue of \nthe day--is our debt ceiling. The issue is our debt. The issue is we do \nnot have a balanced budget. The issue is we do not have a fiscal \nstraitjacket to cause us to act responsibly. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' this evening for cloture. Let's \nnot take up an issue we will have no effect on, that has nothing to do \nwith the debt ceiling, and let's move to those kinds of issues that \nwill.\n  I know there is not a budget, unfortunately, to debate at present. It \nis my understanding the chairman of the Budget Committee is going to \nunveil some plans. That would be wonderful. There are some budget \nprocess issues that are at least relevant to the topic at hand. So I \nurge people to vote ``no'' this evening.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the courtesy of time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I understand our leader, Senator McConnell, \nis asking we speak for no more than 10 minutes, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed to speak for 25 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  Mr. President, our debate today takes place in the context of deep \neconomic uncertainty at home, coupled with extraordinary dangers \noverseas. Our country is suffering from high unemployment, with 9.1 \npercent of Americans out of work--many for years. Our national debt \nstands well above $14 trillion, and our credit rating is in doubt. Gas \nprices are still near $4 a gallon in many locations. The number of \nAmericans requiring food stamp assistance has reached 45 million. Some \nbusinesses are returning to profitability but long-term economic growth \nis threatened by numerous forces, including the skyrocketing national \ndebt, declining home values, high energy costs, and increased \ncompetition for export markets.\n  Overseas, almost 100,000 American military personnel are fighting a \ndifficult war in Afghanistan. More than 1,600 of our troops have been \nkilled in Afghanistan, with roughly 12,000 wounded. Meanwhile, we still \nhave 46,000 troops in Iraq, a deployment that has cost almost 4,500 \nAmerican lives, with more than 32,000 wounded. Our troops have \nexperienced multiple deployments over the last 8 years that have \nstrained our Armed Forces. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are \nextremely high, with no resolution to the problem of North Korea's \nnuclear program. We continue to pursue international support for steps \nthat could prevent Iran's nuclear program from producing a nuclear \nweapon. We remain concerned about stability in Pakistan and the \nsecurity of that country's nuclear arsenal. We are attempting to \ncounter terrorist threats emanating from Pakistan, East Africa, Yemen, \nand many other locations.\n  Into this confluence of economic and national security commitments, \nthe President has involved our Nation in a civil war in Libya. We find \nourselves in a situation where Congress is debating vast cuts in \ndomestic programs to make essential progress on the deficit, even as \nPresident Obama has initiated an expensive, open-ended military \ncommitment in a country that his Defense Secretary said is not a vital \ninterest.\n  Any Member who has been here to witness the last 10 years should \nunderstand that war is an inherently precarious enterprise that is \nconducive to accidents, unintended consequences, and miscalculations. \nThe last 10 years have also illuminated clearly that initiating wars \nand killing the enemy is far easier than achieving political stability \nand reconstructing a country when the fighting is over.\n  This is why going to war should be based on U.S. vital interests. It \nis also why Congress has an essential role to play in scrutinizing \nexecutive branch rationalizations of wars and their ongoing management. \nThis holds true no matter who is President or which war is being \nfought.\n  The President stated he intervened in Libya in conjunction with the \ninternational community to save lives that would have been lost had \nQadhafi's forces been left unchecked. But saving lives alone cannot be \nour standard for using military force. There is no end to the global \nhumanitarian emergencies in which U.S. military and economic power \nmight be devoted. Saying that American military power in Libya is \nmorally justified is not the same as saying it is wise. There are many \nother questions that must be answered in a disciplined examination of \nwhether to go to war.\n  The administration placed much weight on expressions of approval by \nthe United Nations and the Arab League. It is better to have \ninternational support than not when considering war. But neither of \nthose institutions is determinative to an assessment of U.S. vital \ninterests.\n  Even after Qadhafi leaves power, we will be at risk of substantial \ncosts. Already NATO has called for a U.N. peacekeeping force to be \ndeployed on the ground in Libya to help secure a transitional \ngovernment. As the largest contributor to the United Nations, the U.S. \nprobably will bear a significant share of that cost, even if no \nAmerican troops participate. What follows Qadhafi's regime will be a \ntrue nation-building exercise. Despite massive natural resources, Libya \nwas a poor and largely undeveloped country before the first NATO bomb \nfell. We have been assured that the Libyans will have the financial \nresources to pay for this reconstruction effort, but we have heard\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nthis assurance before. We have had ample experience during the last \ndecade with the difficulties of reconstructing nations in which we have \nintervened.\n  In justifying our intervention in Libya's civil war, the President \nhas claimed that failure to do so would have emboldened other dictators \nto resort to violence in the face of popular protests. At a minimum, \nthe unfolding tragedy in Syria is evidence that our intervention in \nLibya has done little, if anything, to deter such repression.\n  In fact, I think it is more likely that dictators such as Bashar al-\nAssad have learned the opposite lesson from the Libyan example. That \nlesson is do not let an opposition force gain control of territory or \nthe West might intervene to protect it from the sky. Is this the \nthinking behind the Syrian government's brutal military takeover of the \ncities along its border with Turkey? At the same time, our Libyan \ninvolvement has made it more difficult to obtain Security Council \naction of any sort, even rhetorical, against the Syrian regime.\n  American intervention in Libya did not come as a result of a \ndisciplined assessment of our vital interests or an authorization \ndebate in Congress. In the broader strategic context that I have \ndescribed, a civil war in Libya is not a priority that required \nAmerican military and economic investments. It is an expensive \ndiversion that leaves the United States and our European allies with \nfewer assets to respond to other contingencies.\n  President Obama's assertion that he does not need a congressional \nauthorization to wage war in Libya represents a serious setback to the \nconstitutional limits on Presidential war powers. Historians will point \nout that this is not the first time that a President has gone to war \nunilaterally. But saying that Presidents have exceeded their \nconstitutional authority before is little comfort. Moreover, the Libya \ncase is the one most likely to be cited the next time President Obama \nor a future President chooses to take the country to war without \ncongressional approval.\n  Declarations of war are not anachronistic exercises. They force the \nPresident to submit his case for war to Congress and the American \npublic. They allow for a robust debate to examine that case, and they \nhelp gauge if there is sufficient political support to commit American \nblood and treasure. And they define the role and strategy of the United \nStates. Neither U.N. Security Council resolutions nor administration \nbriefings are a substitute for a declaration of war or other deliberate \nauthorizations of military operations.\n  Actions leading up to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan at least \nacknowledged that congressional authorization was vital to initiating \nand conducting war. Despite deep flaws in the process of authorizing \nthose wars, there was recogition that both required a deliberate \naffirmative vote by Congress.\n  During this debate there will be appeals to set aside discussion of \nwar powers issues in favor of expressing support for the military \nmission underway. We will be asked to send a message to Colonel \nQadhafi, notwithstanding our displeasure with President Obama's \nunilateralism.\n  I understand that one can be for the Libya mission while \nsimultaneously being critical of the President's failure to involve \nCongress in his decisionaking. But I also believe that it would be \ndifficult to render a judgment on the Libya operation without reference \nto the process failures that have preceded this debate, for two \nreasons. First, in the long run, the significance of the war powers \nprecedent created by President Obama's unilateral intervention in Libya \nand his subsequent rationalization for not needing congressional \nauthority may be far more significant than the short term geopolitical \nconsequences of what happens in Libya. Second, we are debating an \nauthorization that the President has taken no affirmative action to \nseek, that he asserts is not necessary under the Constitution or the \nWar Powers Act, and that presumably will have little impact on his \nactions.\n  Even if one believes that the President somehow had the legal \nauthority to initiate and continue U.S. military operations in Libya, \nit does not mean that going to war without Congress was either wise or \nhelpful to the operation. There was no good reason why President Obama \nshould have failed to seek congressional authorization to go to war in \nLibya. A few excuses have been offered ranging from an impending \ncongressional recess to the authority provided by U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1973. But these excuses do not justify the President's lack \nof constitutional discipline. Twelve days before the United States \nlaunched hostilities I called for the President to seek a declaration \nof war before taking military action. The Arab League resolution, which \nis cited as a key event in calculations on the war, was passed a full \nweek before we started launching cruise missiles. There was time to \nseek congressional approval, and Congress would have debated a war \nresolution if the President had presented one.\n  That debate would not have been easy. But Presidents should not be \nable to avoid constitutional responsibilities merely because engaging \nthe people's representatives is inconvenient or uncertain. If the \noutcome of a congressional vote on war is in doubt, it is all the more \nreason why a President should seek a debate. If he does not, he is \ntaking the extraordinary position that his plans for war are too \nimportant to be upset by a disapproving vote in Congress.\n  The Founders believed that Presidents alone should not be trusted \nwith war making authority, and they constructed checks against \nexecutive unilateralism. James Madison, in a 1797 letter to Thomas \nJefferson, stated, ``The Constitution supposes, what the History of all \nGovernments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power \nmost interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly with \nstudied care, vested the question of war in the legislature.''\n  Clearly, there are circumstances under which a President might be \njustified in employing military force without congressional \nauthorization. But as Senator Jim Webb has pointed out systematically, \nnone of the reasons apply to the Libyan case.\n  Our country was not attacked or threatened with an attack. We weren't \nobligated under a treaty to defend the Libyan people. We were not \nrescuing Americans or launching a one-time punitive retaliation. Nor \ndid the operation require surprise that would have made a public debate \nimpractical.\n  In this case, President Obama made a deliberate decision not to seek \na congressional authorization of his action, either before it commenced \nor during the last 3 months. This was a fundamental failure of \nleadership that placed expedience above constitutional responsibility.\n  Moreover, the highly dubious arguments offered by the Obama \nadministration for not needing congressional approval break new ground \nin justifying a unilateral Presidential decision to use force. The \naccrual of even more war making authority in the hands of the Executive \nis not in our country's best interest, especially at a time when our \nNation is deeply in debt and our military is heavily committed \noverseas.\n  At the outset of the conflict, the President asserted that U.S. \nmilitary operations in Libya would be ``limited in their nature, \nduration, and scope.'' Three months later, these assurances ring \nhollow. American and coalition military activities have expanded to an \nall but declared campaign to drive Qadhafi from power. The \nadministration is unable to specify any applicable limits to the \nduration of the operations. And the scope has grown from efforts to \nprotect Libyan civilians under imminent threat to obliterating Libya's \nmilitary arsenal, command and control structure, and leadership \napparatus.\n  Most recently, the administration has sought to avoid its obligations \nunder the War Powers resolution by making the incredible assertion that \nU.S. military operations in Libya do not constitute hostilities, a view \nthat has been rejected by many supporters of the war.\n  Let us be clear that we are deliberately trying to overthrow the \ngovernment of Libya with military force. We were instrumental in \nputting the alliance together, we were the major force behind the U.N. \nresolution authorizing the war, we set the table for the NATO operation \nthrough an intensive bombing campaign to open the war, our planes and \ndrones continue to bomb Libya, and most missions flown by allied pilots \nare dependent on the\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\nintelligence and refueling capabilities that we are providing. The \nmeans that we are using to overthrow the Libyan government are limited \nin the sense that we could be applying more military force to the task, \nbut the goal of the operation is not limited. We are using military \nforce to achieve regime change. Defining these actions as something \nless than hostilities requires extraordinary legal contortions.\n  Administration analysis focuses on the question of whether U.S. \ncasualties are likely to occur, thereby minimizing other considerations \nrelevant to the use of force. Such an interpretation would deny \nCongress a say in other questions that are obviously implicated in \ndecisions to go to war, including the war's impact on U.S. strategic \ninterests, on our relations with other countries, and on our ability to \nmeet competing national security priorities.\n  The administration also implies that because allied nations are \nflying most of the missions over Libya, the U.S. operations are not \nsignificant enough to require congressional authorization. This \ncharacterization underplays the centrality of the U.S. contribution to \nthe NATO operations in Libya. We are contributing 70 percent of the \ncoalition's intelligence capabilities and the majority of its refueling \nassets. The fact that we are leaving most of the shooting to other \ncountries does not mean that the United States is not involved in acts \nof war. If the United States encountered persons performing similar \nactivities in support of al Qaida or Taliban operations, we certainly \nwould deem them to be participating in hostilities against us.\n  This state of affairs is at odds with the President's own \npronouncements on war powers during his Presidential candidacy. For \nexample, in December 2007, he responded to a Boston Globe question by \nsaying: ``The President does not have power under the Constitution to \nunilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not \ninvolve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.''\n  American combat forces are so efficient at certain types of \noperations and our over-the-horizon technology is so potent that the \nuse of the military instrument to right wrongs exists as a tremendous \ntemptation for Presidents. If we fail to come to grips with this now, I \nfear that we are setting the stage for Presidents to undertake other \nhumanitarian interventions without congressional approval.\n  The President does not have the authority to substitute his judgment \nfor constitutional process when there is no emergency that threatens \nthe United States and our vital interests. The world is full of \nexamples of local and regional violence, to which the U.S. military \ncould be applied for some altruistic purpose. Under the Constitution, \nthe Congress is vested with the authority to determine which, if any, \nof these circumstances justify the consequences of American military \nintervention.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee markup of S.J. Res. 20 significantly \nimproved the resolution in several key respects. First, the committee \nadopted amendments that Senator Webb and I introduced, establishing \nlegally binding prohibitions on the introduction of American ground \ntroops and contractors into Libya. The original resolution addressed \nthis issue only through nonbinding language that the President could \nhave ignored.\n  Second, the committee adopted an amendment I offered requiring \nspecific reports on the Libya operation from the administration on \nstrict deadlines. These deadlines were strengthened further by an \namendment from Senator Bob Corker. The original resolution lacked \nsufficient provisions for congressional oversight of the operations, \ntheir costs, and their potential impact on other U.S. national security \nobjectives.\n  Third, I offered an amendment specifying that the War Powers \nresolution applies to current U.S. military operations in Libya, and \nthat continuation of those operations requires congressional \nauthorization. This was adopted by acclamation after Members on both \nsides delivered statements supporting the amendment. In doing so, the \ncommittee repudiated the administration's contention that U.S. \noperations in Libya do not constitute ``hostilities'' and therefore are \nnot subject to the War Powers resolution.\n  Fourth, the committee adopted a sense of the Congress amendment \nstating that postwar reconstruction costs should be borne primarily by \nthe Libyan people and Arab League nations.\n  Even with the success of these amendments, S.J. Res. 20 remains \noverly broad, despite its stated purpose of authorizing a limited use \nof force. Specifically, it contains no meaningful limits on the use of \nAmerican air assets over Libya.\n  This resolution clearly would give the President the authority to \nescalate the American role in the bombing campaign. I understand that \nsome Members of the Senate may favor that course. But Members who have \nconcerns about a re-escalation of the U.S. combat role should \nunderstand that passage of the resolution not only gives the President \nthat authority, it makes such a re-escalation more likely.\n  The defining limitation in S.J. Res. 20 is U.N. Security Council \nresolution 1973, which calls on nations to protect Libyan civilians. \nEffectively, any use of airpower consistent with this U.N. resolution \nis permitted under S.J. Res. 20. Using resolution 1973 as \njustification, the President already engaged in an intensive bombing \ncampaign against Libyan targets at the beginning of our intervention. \nBy definition, the administration and our allies would regard S.J. Res. \n20 as permitting at least the intensity of American bombing that was \nundertaken in the first week of the war.\n  Moreover, President Obama publicly has defined the removal of Colonel \nQadhafi as in the interest of protecting Libyan civilians. From the \nadministration's point of view, almost any airstrike that degrades \nLibyan military capabilities or contributes in some way to the \npotential for the ouster of Qadhafi can be justified as contributing to \nthe protection of civilians. This could include the use of slower fixed \nwing aircraft flying close air support missions and perhaps \nhelicopters.\n  Passage of this resolution does not guarantee that there will be a \nfull-scale re-escalation, but if President Obama is armed with this \nresolution and if the Libyan operation drags on, it is almost \ninevitable that the American role in Libya will expand. We know that \nsome of our allies are running short of munitions. We also know that \npublic opinion in some allied nations may trend against continuing this \nmission. Our military is the best and most capable in the world. If the \nPresident has this broad authorization from Congress in hand, allies \nwill be far more confident that the United States will pick up the \nslack if they withdraw or limit their participation. In a recent press \nconference, the President said, ``There's no risks of additional \nescalation.'' But the only barrier to escalation would be the decision-\nmaking of the President himself.\n  I do not believe that our intervention in the Libyan civil war was \nprudent in the context of U.S. vital interests. I continue to be \nconcerned that the U.S. role in Libya will escalate, that Libya \nreconstruction burdens could fall on our country, and that the Libyan \noperation siphons attention and resources away from more important \nnational security priorities. I cannot support the broad mandate that \nthis resolution would give to the President to expand U.S. military \nactivities over Libya. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing \nadoption of S.J. Res. 20.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to just briefly say that \nthe matter of the merits of the Libya resolution the majority leader \nwants to move to is not something I am addressing at this point. It is \na significant issue, and good Senators can disagree about that, but the \nreason we are here this week is because 46 Senators from the Republican \nside objected to the Memorial Day recess, because we have done nothing \non the budget, and were clearly going to object again when it came to \nthe Fourth of July because we have the debt ceiling issue that we are \ntold creates an emergency by August 2.\n  We haven't passed a budget in 797 days. The Democratic majority has \nnot\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\neven brought one to the floor in that time. The country is spending \nitself into decline and damaging our future. We know that. It has been \ntalked about for months. We have had no discussion in the Budget \nCommittee, of which I am ranking member, about marking up any kind of \nbudget this year. The Budget Act in the United States Code says we \nshould pass the budget by April 15. So the objection I and others had \nto going home and recessing this week was not in order to discuss the \nLibya resolution; it was to get to work now to confront the financial \nsituation we are in.\n  We are not going to be serving our constituents well if some sort of \nsecret agreement comes to fruition and a bill is plopped down on the \nSenate floor on August 1 that has to be passed by August 2. That is not \nresponsible. It is not acceptable. Even the President understands that. \nLast week, he said this:\n\n       And so there's no point in procrastinating. There's no \n     point in putting it off. We've got to get this done. And if \n     by the end of this week, we have not seen substantial \n     progress, then I think members of Congress need to understand \n     we are going to start having to cancel things and stay here \n     until we get it done.\n\n  He is talking about spending--debt, the debt ceiling, the limit on \nthe amount of money the U.S. Government can borrow. That is what he \nsaid last week. And that is what we have been saying for over a month.\n  Regardless of how one feels about the Libya resolution, that is not \nwhat we need to be doing this week. The letter we wrote to Senator Reid \nconcerning the Memorial Day recess said this. This was a month ago.\n\n       Until a budget plan is made public, and until that plan is \n     scheduled for committee action, on what basis can the Senate \n     justify returning home for a 1-week vacation and recess when \n     our spending and debt continue to spiral dangerously out of \n     control?\n\n  That is what we said then and it remains true now. This Congress is \nacting in an irresponsible manner and it is not healthy for us. I am \nbeginning to wonder if the Senate is, in fact, beginning to lose its \nreason for being. Are we supposed to just sit here and wait for two, \nthree, four, or five people to meet in secret and then tell us at the \neleventh hour that we have to pass a bill? Is that legislating? Is that \nwhat Congress should do?\n  We certainly are in violation of the Budget Act, which says a budget \nshould be marked up in the Budget Committee by April 1 and passed by \nApril 15. We haven't even called one up, and we haven't passed one in \n797 days.\n  I recall, as we make the decision on our vote today, what Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen said recently, which is that \nthe greatest threat to our national security is the debt. That is what \nhe said. The President has not asked for a Libyan resolution. It is not \nsomething he cares about, apparently. He hasn't asked for it. He \ndoesn't consider it important.\n  I will tell you one thing we have to do: We have to fulfill our \nresponsibility as a Congress, as the people who control the purse. That \nis our ultimate constitutional responsibility. We are not fulfilling it \nand, therefore, I urge my colleagues not to move to the Libyan \nresolution but to send a message to our Democratic leadership that we \ninsist on moving toward solving the financial crisis this Nation faces.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as of now, we are scheduled to vote on \na motion to proceed to S.J.R. 20 regarding Libya. We have been called \ninto session--having made plans to spend this week in our States \nmeeting with constituents, as we try to do at least once a month--\nbecause there is a budget crisis in this country, because we have a \ndebt ceiling of over $14 trillion that is getting ready to be hit and \nwe need to focus on that and that alone during this week. We have been \ntalking about it, we have been talking around it, but, honestly, we \ndon't seem to be making much progress. If we are going to do anything \nthis week, we should be talking about how we are going to address this \nissue.\n  This is what is on the minds of the people of our country today. I \nwas home over the weekend, having just gotten back, and everyone I \ntalked to is scared to death about this debt, about what is going to \nhappen. People think there does need to be significant change, reform, \na different way of doing business than borrowing and borrowing and \nborrowing. They are also concerned about hitting the debt ceiling and \nnot lifting it. They are wondering what in the heck we are going to do.\n  So now we are back here in session because of that crisis, and \nsomehow we are talking about Libya. Libya is important. It is important \nbecause there are American troops, part of a coalition that was put \nthere by the President without consulting Congress, and now there is a \nresolution, which, frankly, I cannot support. I will not give the \nPresident authority to continue. I think we need a full and fair \ndebate. But now is not the time to be doing this, when we are 4 weeks \naway from a potential debt crisis that could affect the people in our \ncountry right now--people who depend on our government to function--as \nwell as our global standing.\n  So let's talk about what we could do. What we could do is produce a \nbudget. It has been 797 days or so since the Senate has passed a budget \nresolution. So we haven't set the level of spending and the priorities \nfor spending that are our constitutional responsibility. It is \nCongress's responsibility to pass a budget. We haven't passed a budget \nin almost 2 years--almost 2 years.\n  We have to do that because we are coming up on--in about 3 months--\nthe end of a fiscal year. We should be passing appropriations bills \nthat are based on a budget. But we don't have a budget. So I would say, \nlet's get back to basics. When you have a big problem, you go back to \nthe basics, where you have to start to solve a problem. And the basics \nare a budget. I think we all agree if we get a budget on the floor \nthere is going to be a lot of amendments. There is going to be a lot of \namendments to a budget resolution. Let's get started. Let's use this \nweek to produce a budget resolution and let's start having the \namendments about spending levels, about spending priorities. That will \nbe a way we can start the process of determining if we can, in fact, \nlift the debt ceiling.\n  There are significant cuts in spending we can make as a country that \nwould show the rest of the world--those holding our debt, as well as \nthe American people who are living with this government and holding \npart of the debt--that we are serious; that we are going to get our \nfinancial house in order, and we are going to do it with a budget \nresolution that cuts spending and sets priorities as every family and \nevery business in this country is required to do. Most States, by the \nway, are required to do it as well. A few don't, and we see them sort \nof ambling over toward the ``B'' word--bankruptcy--which is just not a \npossibility. That is not a possibility for this country. We need to \ntake the reins right now to assure the world knows we are not going to \nhandle our fiscal responsibilities by continuing to borrow when we know \nwe don't have the revenue coming in to pay for all these programs.\n  So I am going to vote against cloture today. I am going to vote \nagainst cloture, along with, I know, many people for different reasons. \nSome people are voting against cloture because they do not think we \nought to be giving the President the authority to continue going into \nanother country's civil war when we have such commitments in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, when we are overdeploying our troops, when we are \nspending money that we are having to borrow, when we are taking the \nlion's share of this responsibility for our allies. Many of us think we \nshouldn't be adding another country, where it is supposed to be a \nsupport function, when we all know that is what leads to something \nmore, and then something more. I thought Senator Lugar said it very \nwell when he said that then you have the aftermath of the end of a \ncivil war and the responsibilities for that. This is not the time, in \nmy opinion, to be giving that kind of authority to the President.\n  But above that--above that--we are here because there is a crisis \nupon which I think we have a united view of\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nthe goal, and that is to put our fiscal house in order. But we are not \nunited in the Senate about how to do it. So let's have that debate this \nweek. Let's have that debate that says we should be spending more or we \nshould be spending less; that we should be taxing more or taxing less, \nbecause we have real disagreements on that.\n  I am in the spend less, tax less group, but there are views that are \ndiffering. Let's put it out there and start the debate. Because if we \nhave a budget resolution, then everything can be solved from there. If \nwe have a budget resolution that we can agree is the right amount of \nspending for the debt crisis we are in, then we will know the way \nforward to dealing with the debt crisis. That is a real possibility, \nand that is what we ought to be talking about.\n  I will not support cloture on a motion to proceed to a Libya \nagreement that says the President can continue the involvement. I think \nwe need to deal with the crisis that Congress has a say in doing. \nCertainly Congress had a say in producing it, and we are the ones \nresponsible to the American people for solving the problem that has \nbeen created.\n  I urge my colleagues not to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed \nto the Libya resolution and, instead, turn to the budget, put a budget \nresolution out, and, for the first time in almost 2 years, we can begin \nto talk together to solve this problem by passing a budget resolution \nthat will lower spending and hopefully keep taxes low so our fragile \neconomy can continue on the path toward improvement, that would have \nbusinesses feel confident to hire people, rather than putting obstacles \nin place, and get this unemployment rate of over 9 percent off the \nbooks. That would be the answer for this week, in my opinion.\n  I hope the majority leader will turn to the budget and let's solve \nthe crisis at hand. I think that is why we are in session this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate was scheduled today at 5 p.m. to \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nbipartisan Libya resolution, which is sponsored by Senators Kerry, \nMcCain, Levin, Kyl, Durbin, Feinstein, Graham, and others. I spoke with \nthe Republican leader just a short time ago, and we have agreed that, \nnotwithstanding the broad support for the Libya resolution, the most \nimportant issue for us to focus on this week is the budget. So we will \nwork to set up the vote on the sense-of-Senate resolution that I have \noffered on shared sacrifice and perhaps a Republican alternative as \nwell. Meetings are in process now and will continue on the debt limit \nand on larger budget matters throughout the Capitol and I am confident \neveryone knows the White House is involved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion, with respect to the \nmotion to proceed to Calendar No. 88, S.J. Res. 20, be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw my motion to proceed to Calendar No. 88, S.J. \nRes. 20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Audit of Department of Defense\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to extend some remarks I made on \nthe Senate floor on June 6. The report I was reporting on on June 6 \nevaluated audits produced by the Department of Defense Office of \nInspector General in fiscal year 2010. I called that report a report \ncard because that is exactly what it was. Each of the 113 unclassified \nreports published in fiscal year 2010 was reviewed and evaluated and \ngraded in five categories. My report was produced by the Department of \nDefense Office of Inspector General in fiscal year 2010. After each \nreport was graded individually, all the scores for each report in each \ncategory were added up and averaged to create a composite score for all \n113 reports.\n  Although 15 top-quality audits were highlighted in the report, the \noverall score awarded to the 113 was basically D-minus. That is low, I \nknow. Maybe the score should have been a little higher. Clearly, none \nreflected any of the reforms Inspector General Heddell, DOD, put in \nplace in December of 2010, as all were published well in advance of \nthat date.\n  My oversight staff read these reports as educated consumers. We \nexpected these reports to provide leverage in the monumental day-to-day \nDepartment of Defense oversight task. We want them to provide assurance \nthat the Defense Department is spending taxpayers' money wisely. Some \nreports did that but most did not.\n  This report, prepared by this Senator from Iowa, is sure of one \nthing: The audits which are the subject of my report card are not \nsomehow exempt from oversight and public scrutiny. In other words, \nthese audits should just not sit on the shelf and collect dust; they \nneed, as well, to be put under the public microscope, especially when \nthey cost almost $1 million apiece to produce. Mr. President, $1 \nmillion for an audit report is a heck of a lot of money. So that is \nexactly what we did in the report card--put these reports in the public \nspotlight, and I will keep them there until I see sustained improvement \nat the inspector general of the Department of Defense.\n  As the report states and as I explained in my speech on June 6, this \ngrading system was subjective and imperfect. However, as subjective and \ninexact as it may be, I believe it provided a reasonable and rough \nmeasure of audit quality.\n  Following my speech, Defense Department Inspector General Heddell \npounced on my report. He expressed strong opposition to the low score. \nHe complained that it did not adequately reflect $4.2 billion in what \nhe called ``achieved monetary benefits,'' identified in fiscal year \n2010 reports.\n  To address IG Heddell's concerns, my staff asked the audit department \nto prepare an information paper that linked the $4.2 billion in savings \nto the audit where those savings were reported. That information was \nprovided to me on June 20. I call it a crosswalk. It takes me to the \nexact page in each report where the savings were discussed. This \ndocument listed $4.4 billion in identified potential monetary benefits \nand collections of $4.2 billion.\n  After reviewing the crosswalk, I have concluded that Inspector \nGeneral Heddell had a legitimate gripe about my report card. He is \nright. It should have included a section that addressed potential \nsavings. So I will address those issues right now, focusing on four \nreports that contain almost all of the $4.2 billion in savings listed \nin the collections column.\n  In grading these reports, we did not give sufficient credit for \npotential savings and inefficiencies. They were a casualty of the \ngrading system for one simple reason: If the exact dollar amounts of \nthe alleged fraud and waste were not verified using primary source \naccounting records--and using primary source accounting records is very \nimportant--then they did not pop up on my oversight radar screen.\n  My staff is attempting to work with the audit office to develop a \nmutually\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\nagreed upon set of standards for grading audits. The purpose of these \ndiscussions would be to create a grading process that would accurately \ncapture the true quality of all reports, including policy reviews that \nuncover real savings and efficiency.\n  From the beginning, I have been very critical of the audit office for \nproducing far too many policy reviews and far too few hardcore contract \nand payment audits. For the most part, the policy audits have no \nmeasurable monetary impact whatsoever. However, I have learned recently \nthat at least a few are important for other reasons. I am told that \nsome of these reports are a real value in the work of our Armed \nServices Committee here in the Senate. Contract and payment audits are \nalso very important and I would say most important. They go right to \nthe heart of the IG's core mission: to root out and deter fraud, waste, \nand theft. If done right, they, too, can produce big payoffs. Those \naudits earned top scores in my report card. I am not saying the audit \noffice should do nothing but contract and payment audits. What I am \nsaying is this: The current mix of audits creates a huge imbalance in \nfavor of policy reviews as opposed to monetary reviews. So a better \nbalance needs to be established by the Inspector General's Office.\n  That said, I have an admission to make to my colleagues. I finally \nfound a policy audit that I like. This report is entitled \n``Recapitalization and Acquisition of Light Tactical Wheel Vehicles.'' \nThat audit report is No. 2010-039, dated January 29, 2010. It \nidentified potential savings of $3.84 billion. That is 90 percent of \nthe savings uncovered in all the fiscal year 2010 audits.\n  In my report card, I gave this audit a low grade. This audit failed \nto connect the dots on the money trail and verify dollar amounts using \nprimary source contracts and payment records, plus it took 16 months to \ncomplete. When you add the 4 to 6 months of planning that often \nprecedes an audit start date, you are probably looking at 2 years to \ncomplete the audit, and that is far too long. But this report had other \nimportant qualities that were overlooked. It uncovered gross violation \nof applicable procurement regulations, including the use of sole-source \ncontracting arrangements. It also determined that the proposed vehicle \nmight duplicate the capabilities of existing vehicles.\n  In the midst of this audit, for reasons that remain unclear, the \nproject manager decided to stop the program ``and put the $3.84 billion \nin funding to better use in fiscal years 2010-2013.'' This language \nsuggests that all of the money was reallocated within Army accounts for \nother purposes. Clearly, the audit may have helped to stop $3.84 \nbillion in potential waste. That is excellent. But this does not \nconstitute savings in the classical sense, as all the money was shifted \nto other Army projects. Waste could have happened in those other \nprojects as well.\n  It reminds me, while we are here in session in what normally would be \na recess and I am reporting that the inspector general found $3.84 \nbillion in potential waste, now that they are trying to find trillions \nto cut down on the budget deficit, it might be a time to look at the \nDefense Department and stop the reprogramming of money. If it is going \nto be saved, it ought to be saved, and that means it will cut down on \nthe deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator has used 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to continue, if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Using a modified grading system to reflect the good \nquality of this audit, it would have earned a higher score were it not \nfor an excessively long completion time. In this particular case, \nhowever, the impact of the audit was apparently felt while the audit \nwas still in progress, so the timeliness rule may not apply here and \nprobably should be set aside.\n  There are three other audits containing savings and inefficiencies \nthat I would like to discuss.\n  The next one is entitled ``Implementation of the Predator/Sky Warrior \nAcquisition Decision Memorandum,'' No. 2010-082, dated September 10, \n2010. The purpose of this audit was to determine whether the Air Force \nand Army had complied with the Department of Defense directives and law \nto combine the Predator and Sky Warrior drone programs. The Defense \nDepartment estimated that $400 million could be saved by merging the \ntwo programs.\n  While the audit was in progress, the Department of Defense pulled the \nrug out from under the auditor. A new directive was issued stating that \nthe two programs did not have to be combined. To counter this move, the \nauditors recommended administrative action against those who failed to \ncomply with the original directive. The Department of Defense \nnonconcurred and tossed the auditors a bone. The Department of Defense \nwiggled out of harm's way by offering to do a meaningless lessons-\nlearned exercise. In the end, the auditors caved in, agreeing that the \nDepartment of Defense plan was responsive and backed off.\n  Despite what appeared to be an unsuccessful outcome, the Office of \nInspector General still claimed that this audit produced $60 million in \nsavings. The audit itself indicates that the $60 million was, in fact, \n``reprogrammed to meet higher priority operations.'' That means it was \nreallocated to other Department of Defense accounts and thus not saved.\n  Since this audit was all about an opportunity to save $400 million \nand the Department of Defense balked, maybe these so-called savings \nmight be better characterized as lost savings. In my report card, this \naudit earned low scores mainly because it failed to verify actual costs \nof two drone contracts using primary source accounting records, and it \nfailed to assess the validity of the Department of Defense estimated \nsavings of $400 million. I am not convinced this audit deserves a \nhigher score, especially since it took 22\\1/2\\ months to complete, and \nthe recommendations, though initially tough, were watered down in the \nend.\n  The last one I wish to report on is entitled ``Deferred Maintenance \nand Carryover on the Army Abrams Tank,'' No. 2010-43, dated March 2, \n2010. This report concluded that contrary to the Army's claim, depot \nmaintenance on M-1 tanks was not deferred in fiscal year 2008. All \nplanned overhauls were, in fact, completed, but a large sum of money \nwas left over. The Army requested and received a formal, written waiver \nto carry over $346 million in unneeded and unused fiscal year 2008 M-1 \nmaintenance funds for use in 2009 and beyond. The reason given was \ninadequate capacity at the Lima, OH, tank plant. Without the waiver, \nthis money would have been canceled and lost.\n  The report concluded that the Army documents contained ``inaccurate, \nmisleading'' information that may have caused a violation of the \nAntideficiency Act. It recommended that the waiver be rescinded and \n$275 million in fiscal year 2008 money be canceled and reprogrammed or \nreduced.\n  The Army appeared to agree with the recommendations to disclose the \n$275 million carryover to Congress but did not concur with other \nrecommendations.\n  This report does not point to any real savings. This report probably \ndeserves higher scores except for the timeliness and strength of the \nrecommendations. It was untimely, taking 22 months to complete.\n  In addition, there were unresolved issues about the waiver document. \nDid the official who signed the waiver know that the document may have \nallegedly contained false and misleading information? And was he \nquestioned about its truthfulness? If so, the report should have \nrecommended that he be held accountable.\n  The last of four reports uncovered $2.2 million in purported savings, \nbut this one appears to be more about helping the Army spend--not \nsave--money.\n  It is entitled ``Controls Over Unliquidated Obligations for \nDepartment of the Army Contracts,'' number 2010-073, dated July 19, \n2010.\n  This report deserves high scores for hitting most of the dots on the \nmoney trail, including verification of exact dollar amounts using \nprimary source accounting records. Such nitty gritty accounting work is \nhighly commendable.\n  Unfortunately, the objective of this audit appears to be \nquestionable. The report finds that sloppy Army accounting work ``could \nincrease the risk that funds are unavailable for other needs\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nbecause funds available for de-obligation are not identified in a \ntimely manner.'' Now what does that really mean?\n  It means the money in question is no longer needed and is at risk of \nbeing ``lost'' because it is about to expire.\n  Having un-needed money lying around in the Pentagon is almost always \na recipe for more waste. In the Pentagon, there is no such thing as un-\nneeded money. Every dollar has a mission.\n  This report is all about managing money to make sure every cent is \nspent before it expires. Avoiding the loss of appropriations is the \nprimary responsibility of the Army Comptroller or Chief Financial \nOfficer--not the IG.\n  In this scenario, the IG's primary focus should be to ensure that \n``lost'' appropriations are not used illegally--or that un-needed \nmonies are not wasted by being shifted to another questionable project. \nMoney that is not needed should be reported to Congress and returned to \nthe Treasury.\n  Although this audit deserves high scores in several categories, its \nlong completion time--16 months--and questionable focus lowers its \noverall score.\n  To summarize, there are two main problems with these four reports on \nsavings and collections. The fourth one I am not going to go into now \nto save time, but I will include that for the Record. None was timely, \nNo. 1. No. 2, reported savings are unverified and elusive.\n  First, these four reports took an average of 19 months to complete. \nTwo took a total of 45 months, or almost 4 years, to finish. That does \nnot include the 4 to 6 months it takes, I am told, to get an audit \nrolling. As I have said on other occasions, the power of top quality \naudit work is greatly weakened by stale information.\n  Secondly, these four reports supposedly produced $4.2 billion in \ncollected savings. But all of that money appears to have been shifted \nto other Department of Defense accounts and spent. To the best of my \nknowledge, not one cent was saved or redeposited in the taxpayers' bank \naccount. Only in government could all the money be spent and still \nclaim savings.\n  What we are talking about here is lost savings that grew out of waste \nthat was thankfully discovered and avoided. Waste that is avoided \nsurely has monetary benefits.\n  In closing, I wish to share a simple observation with my colleagues. \nFor some reason, auditors in the Office of Inspector General show a \ngreat reluctance to use the word ``waste''--w-a-s-t-e--in their \nreports. That word rarely, if ever, appears in their audits. At the \nsame time, auditors seem overly eager to tout savings and efficiency. \nWhy would that be? Could it be that their superiors in the Pentagon \ntake a dim view of the word ``waste''?\n  Savings may be nothing more than the flip side of waste. Auditors \ndetect and verify potential waste and then convert it to potential \nsavings by proposing remedies to eliminate the waste. Maybe the \nauditors need to start calling it what it is--call it waste--and then \ntalk about savings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Pilots' Bill of Rights\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, we came back. We weren't \nanticipating coming back from this recess that we were going to be on. \nI can't help but think a lot of that was a result of the statements \nPresident Obama made, criticizing the Senate for leaving at a time when \nthe debt was so bad when, in fact, I think that is a bum rap. We have a \nserious problem I think we need to address and that is spending. All of \nthese things President Obama is doing right now to make everyone think \nwe are trying to address it--appointing committees and groups to get \ntogether; having the Vice President head up this group and the other \ngroup; and Republicans and Democrats meeting--all the President has to \ndo is quit spending.\n  I have been here for a few years and I remember during the Clinton \nadministration in 1995, I came down to this podium on the floor \ncomplaining that President Clinton had come out with a new budget and \nthat budget was $1.5 trillion. I said, this is unbelievable. It is not \nsustainable. We can't do it. That was $1.5 trillion to run this country \nfor a period of 1 year. Now this President has come up with three \nbudgets. Each one of the budgets is a multitrillion-dollar deficit \nbudget. The last one was $1.65 trillion. This is more than the total \namount of money it took to run the entire country. It is all in the \nPresident's budget. It comes out initially $800 billion for stimulus \nthat didn't stimulate. This was something that--I don't know why--\neither nobody cares or the American people aren't listening. It is very \nsimple. We have a problem because the President spends money as no one \nelse has in history. Here he has right now actually raised the debt--\nfrom every President, George Washington to George W. Bush--yet he comes \nout and says, What are we going to do about spending? The answer is to \nquit spending.\n  I hope the American people remember this. This is not the reason, \nfrankly, why I am down here today. In spite of what we have been led to \nbelieve in various publications, other things are going on.\n  There is one piece of legislation I will be introducing tomorrow. I \nhave been working on it for about 6 months, and I have talked to \npeople. We have caucuses in the Senate about every kind of concern. We \nhave an Army caucus, and we have an Air Force caucus. We have caucuses \non caucuses. One of the caucuses we have is a general aviation caucus. \nI am particularly sensitive to this in that I have been flying \nairplanes for over 50 years, and it is one where we are dealing with \nsingle issue people.\n  Anyway, tomorrow, Wednesday, I am going to introduce legislation that \nis going to be very important to people who are the single issue people \nwho fly airplanes. I know a lot of us don't even care. I have heard \npeople say they are all fat cats. I defy anyone to go up to Osh Kosh \nonce a year, the last weekend of every July, and see the hundreds of \nthousands of people there who are not wealthy people, they are single \nissue people. Many of them have made experimental airplanes in their \ngarages. This is something we have enjoyed for many years, and it is \nsomething I have enjoyed. I think because of my involvement, I have \nprobably received more complaints and more requests from people out \nthere in the real world--pilots--over things that have happened when \nthe Federal Aviation Administration has cause to try to either revoke \ntheir license or give them the fear of revocation.\n  Over the years, there have been several instances where I have passed \nlegislation to fix the system by which the FAA proceeds in these \nenforcement actions. I can remember back in the year 2000. Probably yet \ntoday the greatest single pilot, most gifted pilot in America is a guy \nnamed Bob Hoover. Bob Hoover is up in years now. He is actually older \nthan I am. As am I, he is still flying airplanes. They did what is \ncalled an emergency revocation on Bob Hoover. I never did find out what \nallegedly he did wrong. But it was actually in the field where this \ngreat pilot would take a twin engine Shrike up to 10,000 feet, come \ndown and roll right up where the crowd is. He does all of that with a \nglass of water up there on his dash. He is one of these unbelievable \nhuman beings.\n  Anyway, he came to me and said, What am I going to do? They have \ntaken away my livelihood. All of these airline pilots who make a living \nflying airplanes could have a revocation. I passed a law. It took 2 \nyears to do it--and it shouldn't have--so if something happens with a \npilot and he gets his license revoked, there is a process he can go \nthrough that offers appeals and makes it a fair process. So I have been \ndealing with this for a long period of time. I have to say this: With \nany bureaucracy that has the power to take action against an \nindividual, it is our job in Congress to ensure there are appropriate \nsafeguards in place to prevent agency overreach. This bill provides \nthat. The bill does simply four things. Those out there who are pilots \nwill understand exactly what I am talking about. First, it requires in \nan FAA enforcement action against a pilot, in a case where there is \nenforcement action, the FAA has to grant to the pilot all the relevant \nevidence, such as the air traffic communications\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\ntapes, flight data, investigative reports, flight service station \ncommunications, and other relevant air traffic data 30 days before any \naction can proceed, an enforcement action against the pilot. That is a \nmatter of fairness. If a person is going to be accused of something, he \nhas to know what he is being accused of. This is currently not done. It \noften leads to a pilot being grossly uninformed of his alleged \nviolation and recourse.\n  The same section of the bill requires the FAA to advise a pilot who \nis the subject of an investigation relating to approval, denial, \nsuspension, modification, or revocation of an airman certificate of the \nnature of the investigation, that an oral or written response to a \nletter of investigation is not required, that no action can be taken by \nthe FAA against a pilot for declining to respond, that any response can \nbe used as evidence against the pilot, and that the FAA's investigative \nreport is available.\n  That sounds like a lot of talk. All we are saying is the pilot is \nentitled to have all the information other people have. I will give a \ngood example. One of the things we know--and I have heard this all of \nmy 55 years of flying--is that when you talk to a controller--he can be \na controller at a control tower or anything else--that they have to \nkeep that recording and the pilot can have access to the recording. I \nhave always thought this was true until something happened to me and I \nfound out that isn't true. So this means that until we change it, that \nis not going to happen.\n\n  Secondly, it clarifies ``statutory deference''--that is a legal \nterm--as it relates to the National Transportation Safety Board on \nactions by the FAA. This is what happens. The FAA would do something, \nand this could theoretically be appealed to the NTSB. The problem with \nthat is, the NTSB--the National Transportation Safety Board--has \nroutinely rubberstamped anything that comes from the FAA. It is called \nstatutory deference. So that decision has been able to take place in \nthe appeals process.\n  To give an example, in fiscal year 2010, there were 362 aviation \ncertificate appeals filed with the NTSB's Office of Administrative Law \nJudges. The Board's judges held 61 hearings on these appeals and \nreversed the FAA order only 5 times. Also during this time period there \nwere 40 petitions seeking review of FAA emergency determinations. Of \nthese, 6 were procedurally defective and were dismissed and on that \nbasis, and 10 were voluntarily withdrawn. The remaining 24 petitions \nwere considered on their merits with only 1--1--being granted out of 23 \nbeing denied. So we know this is a serious problem.\n  What this does is not only clean up statutory deference, but it does \na second thing. It allows an airman at his own discretion to be able to \nappeal to the Federal District Court.\n  The third thing the bill does is require that the FAA undertake a \nnotice to airmen. This is kind of complicated. But a notice to airmen \nis called a NOTAM. A NOTAM is something they are supposed to involve \nthe people in--the pilots flying--so if they are going to go to a \ncertain airport, they will have all the information as to what is wrong \nwith that airport--a system might be down; a number of things can take \nplace. But, nonetheless, it simplifies that system. Any pilot knows \nwhat a NOTAM is, but for those who don't, they are notices provided by \nthe FAA to give information to pilots about air space, runways, flight \nconditions, and all that. The procedure hasn't worked, because they \nhave actually said there are NOTAMs and they didn't even file the \nNOTAMs and there is no way for the pilot to be able to tell if there is \na NOTAM out there, even though he is required to determine that there \nis. The current system says it is the pilot's responsibility to be \naware of a NOTAM even if the FAA has not posted it.\n  Fourth and finally, the FAA's medical notification process has long \nbeen known for a multitude of problems. Of all the requests for \nassistance the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association receives each \nyear--28 percent of all of the legal assistance--28 percent are related \nto the FAA's medical certification process. The bill requires a review \nof the FAA's medical certification process and forms, to provide \ngreater clarity in the questions and reduce the instances of \nmisinterpretation that have, in the past, led to allegations of \nintentional falsification against pilots. Nonprofit general aviation \ngroups, aviation medical examiners, and other qualified medical experts \nwill make up an advisory panel to advise the Administrator, again \ngiving the right people a voice in the overall determination. So this \nis just an advisory board. The same way with revamping the NOTAM \nprocess. These are advisory boards that are to work with the FAA in \ncoming up with a system.\n  There are two provisions in the bill that will require an FAA review \nof current practices and two other provisions that make the system \nspecifically fairer for pilots.\n  After years of intervening to help fellow pilots, I was never fully \nappreciative of the feeling of desperation until it happened to me. \nThis happened last October. I was flying a group of nonpilots in my \ntwin engine--one of my planes, a twin engine, it holds six people--we \nwere flying into Cameron County Airport. A lot of people don't realize \nhow big Texas is. It is way down on the tip of Texas. It is about the \nsame distance south as Key Biscayne, FL, or some place down there, but \nit is way down there. I used to be a builder and developer there. I \nhave landed there over 200 times. I was flying a group down there. The \nCorpus Approach handed me off to Valley Approach who took me all the \nway down to runway 13. I will actually read what they said. Approach \ncontrol said: You are cleared for visual approach to runway 13. Then I \nresponded, and he said: Yes, 115 echo alpha roger, before you go there \nis traffic that appears to be in the pattern landing there at 900 feet. \nThat is fine.\n  So this is what they do. That is wonderful.\n  I started landing, and you get to a point in a twin-engine plane full \nof people where you have slowed down enough where you cannot make a go-\naround. I was almost touching down when I saw they were working on the \nrunway. It was too late to go around.\n  The three problems I had and have heard about countless times from \npilots, which we correct with this legislation: When I tried to get the \nvoice recording, it took me 4 months, and I am a Senator. I thought: \nWhat about these people out there and the frustration they are going \nthrough? We will correct that. I was required to respond to allegations \nwithin 10 days or they would proceed in an enforcement action against \nme. By the time I received the 10-day notice, there were only 4 days \nleft to respond to the accusations, enforcement actions, and I did not \neven know the reason for the enforcement actions. And, No. 3, we found \nout the NOTAMs were never posted by the FAA until 11 days after this \ntook place. In other words, I did nothing wrong. But at any time I \ncould have suffered a revocation of my license.\n  I think it is important to mention that most of the people who work \nat the FAA--be it the controllers, inspectors, investigators--are \nhelpful.\n  This year is my 32nd consecutive year to attend the Osh Kosh fly-in. \nThe first thing I always do is go up there and talk to all the \ncontrollers. They are up there as volunteers, and I thank them for what \nthey are doing.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, I was flying from Oklahoma to Wyoming. I \ncalled on an instrument flight. I had to get an IFR clearance at 5 \no'clock in the morning. The guy was so courteous, I asked him his name. \nIt is Bill Liebeno. He could not have been more helpful to me. Talk \nabout giving me all the NOTAMS, he said: The localizer is out, the DME \nis out, Runway 14-32 is closed, taxiway B is closed, the approach \nlights are out. He could not have been more factual.\n  I have a lot more to talk about. I know there are others who want to \nspeak before this very significant vote that is coming up at 5 o'clock, \nwhich I think is a live quorum call. I would only say this: I am going \nto introduce this bill on Wednesday. If there is anyone here--we \nalready have Senators Begich and Johanns, who are the cochairs of the \nSenate Aviation Caucus. Of course, this is bipartisan. They are on as \ncosponsors. We have several others as cosponsors.\n  I would say to any staff--I know no Members are listening--who happen \nto be listening right now, if your Member wants to at least be \nsensitive to the needs of general aviation, this may be\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\nhis or her only chance this year. I suggest those individuals who care \nabout the problems I outlined become cosponsors of this legislation \nbefore I introduce it tomorrow afternoon.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I, as well as many Americans, am concerned \nabout the future of our country. I am concerned we may not be able to \ncontinue to pay our bills. I am concerned one day in the near future we \ncould look like Greece. I do not want to see America rioting in the \nstreets because we cannot pay our bills. That day is coming. It is \ncoming in the near future if we do not wake up to the problem.\n  I am not alone. Members of the President's own administration have \nsaid that the No. 1 threat to our national security is our national \ndebt. It is out of control. August 2 is fast approaching. August 2 is \nwhen the debt ceiling is reached.\n  What is the debt ceiling? It is like reaching your credit card limit. \nIf you have a $5,000 a month credit card limit, and you have reached \nit, do you call the company and say: Give me more credit or do you try \nto live within your means? Do you try to only spend what money you \nhave? We as a country have been spending money we do not have. But it \nhas now gotten out of control. We owe China $1.1 trillion. We owe Japan \nnearly $1 trillion. A spending addiction is our problem. It is out of \ncontrol.\n  We are spending $10 billion a day. Of that $10 billion a day, we are \nborrowing $4 billion. We are spending $100,000 every second. Of that \n$100,000 a second, we are borrowing $45,000 a second.\n  We are paying for our debt at historically low interest rates, about \n2.5 percent. But many of us have lived through a time when interest \nrates were much higher. The historic average is over 5 percent. If \ninterest rates go back to the historic average, we will be swamped in \ndebt. Interest will become, over the next 10 years, $5 trillion.\n  This is what looms. Our future is not a good one unless we get things \nunder control. So last week a group of us said no more. We do not want \nto discuss anything else until we start discussing solutions for the \ndebt, solutions for the looming debt crisis. We said no more. So today \nwe will win and draw attention back to the debt ceiling. We are not \ngoing to talk about anything until we resolve this issue. But we have \nto have a real discussion. It has to include Republicans and Democrats \nand Independents and everyone. But do you know what is going on. There \nis a resolution before the Senate now. The Democrats say: Raise taxes \nand that will fix the problem.\n  The problem is not revenue. The problem is spending. We used to spend \nabout 1 in 5 dollars up here. Now we are spending 1 in 4 dollars. So 1 \nin 4 dollars of the economy is coming to Washington. Twenty-five \npercent of the GDP is spent in Washington. That is money that is not \nleft in the marketplace, not left in the hands of those who earned it, \nand not left in the hands of people who can create jobs. It is being \nwasted up here.\n  We are not spending the money wisely. We spend more than we take in, \nso the interest to finance this profligate spending is bankrupting us. \nThe vast majority of our problem is interest, and it will grow. It is \ngrowing exponentially. You can look at this chart I have in the Chamber \nand you will see that interest is going to consume us. As you can see \nfrom the chart, as the debt rises, it rises exponentially in the next \nfew years, unless we do something about it.\n  Unfortunately, I do not think the Democrats are serious. They have \nproduced a resolution that says they can raise taxes, which is a \nnonstarter. It is a horrible prescription for an economy in the middle \nof a recession, and it is not going anywhere.\n  We have proposed a resolution that could fix the problem. Our \nresolution says that government can simply not act any differently than \nindividuals, that they should have to balance their budget. We have \nintroduced a resolution that says we, as Republicans, will vote to \nraise the debt ceiling if we do three things: significant cuts in \nFederal spending, at least back to the percentage we were before we got \ninto this administration; statutory caps, saying we are limited as to \nhow much money we can spend each year; and the third thing is we want a \nbalanced budget amendment. If we have these, we will raise the debt \nceiling. But short of that, we cannot possibly vote to raise the debt \nceiling unless government changes its ways.\n  Government is not spending your money wisely. People cannot account \nfor--even the Pentagon cannot balance its books. They refuse to be \naudited because they say they are too big to be audited. We have to do \nsomething about a government that is out of control. But we want a \nserious dialog with the other side. Instead what we are getting is \nfrivolousness.\n  What I would say to the Democrats today is: You want to vote on \nraising taxes? You think that is an answer? They have a resolution. I \ndo not want to filibuster their resolution. I will vote on it tonight. \nIf you want a vote on raising taxes--if the Democratic Party wants to \nbe the party of raising taxes, I am happy to be in the party that says \nthat is not the answer.\n  I call for a vote immediately, today. If Democrats want to raise \ntaxes, let's do it. I am happy to vote on that today because it is not \nthe answer. If the other side wants to have a full-throated debate on \nthis issue, let's do it. Let's debate over the next 2 days, and then we \nhave a solution. Let us vote on raising the debt ceiling. We will do it \nin the next 2 days. We do not have to wait. Raise the debt ceiling, \ncontingent upon a balanced budget amendment. The American people demand \nit, and I think we should ask for nothing less.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleague from South Carolina after I make a few \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Libya\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is pretty obvious that the Senate \nfeels that its priorities--and I think they are well placed, \nparticularly in light of the fact that the Fourth of July recess was \ncanceled because of the issue of the debt limit and the deficit and our \nlack of action and need for action on the issue--I understand that and \nhave suggested and agreed that this resolution on Libya be delayed. \nHowever, I would point out that the Senate does need to have a debate \nabout United States policy and military action in Libya.\n  Whether my colleagues are supportive of what we are doing in Libya or \nnot I think is an issue that needs to be debated on the floor of the \nSenate. I believe the Senate does play a constitutional role and maybe \neven a more unique one than the other body. So I think it is time we \ndid have a debate, discussion of this issue, and an opinion rendered in \nkeeping with the War Powers Act.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has made it far more difficult than \nit otherwise might have been if we had carried out our responsibilities \nand the President carried out his responsibilities some months ago. The \nfact is this conflict would have been over if we had taken a leadership \nrole and declared a no-fly zone when the rebel forces were on their way \nto Benghazi.\n  The fact is, if the United States had used the full weight of its air \nassets in this conflict, Qadhafi would be gone now. And I would tell my \ncolleagues, have no doubt, Qadhafi will go. He will go. The question is \nwhen. And what role did the United States of America play in supporting \nthese people who are fighting for freedom? What role did the United \nStates of America play in trying to free up Qadhafi's ill-gotten gains \nand have them given to the Transitional National Council? What role did \nthe United States play in leading from behind in Libya?\n  The United States of America leads, not NATO. We lead NATO. And when \nsomeone says NATO is leading on this conflict, I would remind my \ncolleagues, of the 28 members of NATO, only 8 members are actually in \nthe fight, and one of our major allies, Germany, has taken a hike.\n  So if we had used the AC-130 gunships, the A-10 Warthog close air \nsupport capability, Qadhafi would be\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\ngone now. But the fact is, he will go, and it is up to us, in my view, \nto express our support of people who are seeking the same rights and \nfreedoms that are guaranteed to us.\n  I would remind my colleagues who said we never should have been \ninvolved in any way, it is a fact that Qadhafi and his forces were at \nthe gates of Benghazi, a city of 700,000 people, and Qadhafi has said \nhe would go house to house and kill--and kill--whoever they thought had \nresisted them.\n  We say we should never have allowed Srebrenica, where 8,000 people \nwere massacred. We say we should never have allowed Rwanda to happen. \nWe say we should never have allowed the Holocaust to happen. The United \nStates did the right thing by stopping Qadhafi's forces at the gates of \nBenghazi and preventing the massacre of I do not know how many \nthousands of innocent civilians.\n  There is no doubt what Qadhafi has promised if he is able to remain \nin power--a man who has the blood of Americans on his hands because of \nthe bombing of Pan Am 103, because of terrorist acts he supported in \nAfrica--he will do so again and has pledged to do so.\n  When my colleagues ask what American national security interests are \nat stake, look at the man's past actions and look at what he has \npromised to do if he is able to stay in power; and that is, to pose a \ndirect threat to the United States of America's vital national security \ninterests.\n  We are involved in Libya. My colleague from South Carolina will \ntestify we are providing refueling. We are providing intelligence. We \nare providing all kinds of assistance. We are including using \nPredators, which are killing the bad guys. So to somehow allege that \nthe United States is not engaged in hostilities which would trigger the \nWar Powers Act is simply sophistry. The Senate has been silent on this \nissue for too long, in my view.\n  But I also want to caution my colleagues about preventing United \nStates action as well as authorizing.\n  The last time the Congress of the United States of America engaged in \ncutting off funding was at the end of the Vietnam war. Whether \nhistorians or people happen to acknowledge it, a lot of bad things \nhappened after we cut off funding in Vietnam. Amongst them was millions \nof Vietnamese put in reeducation camps and thousands slaughtered. So I \nwould caution my colleagues about actions of Congress which prohibit \ncertain actions on the part of the administration. But most of all, \nAmerica should lead.\n  We should use our air assets, not our ground assets, to get rid of \nthis brutal dictator and his regime. Every day that goes by innocent \ncivilians in Libya are wounded and killed.\n  So I would ask my colleague from South Carolina if he has a few \nwords, but also to address the issue of how much U.S. involvement \nactually is there, which would then--by most objective observers--\ntrigger the Congress's requirement to act in keeping with the War \nPowers Act and our constitutional obligations.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I thank the Senator. I will give my thoughts as \nbriefly as I can. My first thought is that we live in incredibly \ndangerous times--exciting and dangerous. What is the Arab spring about? \nWhat are people asking for in Libya? They are asking to replace Qadhafi \nand form a new government where they will have a say. I do not think \nthat is too much to ask.\n  All I can say is that America's freedom is best secured when she, \nAmerica, is assisting others to obtain theirs. And the one thing \nhistory tells us, free people settle their differences without \nresorting to the evils of war. So to those in this body and throughout \nthe country--I know we are broke. We are here today to supposedly talk \nabout the budget. Well, we are not doing anything but talking. We are \n$14.3 trillion in debt. There are all kinds of ideas between \nRepublicans and Democrats about how to get the country's fiscal house \nin order. It is July 5. We are here looking at each other doing \nnothing. But there is another part of the world, as the Senate and the \nHouse basically talk about America being in debt, where people are \ndying, as I speak, trying to change their government for the better.\n  What should we do? I will tell you what we should do. We should help \nwhere we can. Senator McCain has experienced war unlike very few people \nin this body. He knows when we go to war bad things happen to good \npeople. The idea that he or myself or anybody else relishes trying to \ngo to war or being in war is offensive, quite frankly. He knows better \nthan I, and I have a pretty good understanding of what happens when we \ngo to war.\n  But here is what happens when we do not go to war sometimes: Bad \npeople are able to do incredible things that we wind up having to \nconfront later, and it costs everybody more to have waited.\n  So what are we doing in Libya? We are following rather than leading. \nNow, to Senator McCain's question. NATO's bombing activities are being \ndone without American air power. We spend more money than all NATO \nnations combined on defense. I know a lot of Americans do not like \nthat. I do not like it either, but it is the way it is. We are the \narsenal of democracy.\n  When America does not fly, wars go on longer, more people get raped, \nmore people get killed. Let me tell you, if Qadhafi survives this is \nthe end of NATO.\n  If you do not want America to go alone in this dangerous world, count \nme in. But who are we going to partner with? If the U.N. is seen by the \nAmerican people as an unreliable group to deal with dictators--and it \nis--what if NATO is no longer an organization that people throughout \nthe world respect on the side of good, and the evil side of the ledger \ndoes not care if NATO gets involved because they do not have the will \nto do anything about it?\n  So we should be involved with our NATO partners. Our NATO partners \ndepend on Libya more than we do. They came to Afghanistan not because \nthey were attacked but because we were attacked. They are our friends. \nThey are our allies. They have been with us trying to make sure \nAfghanistan never goes back into the darkness, a place that attacked us \nor them again.\n  So when they need us, I will tell President Obama: Now is not the \ntime to sit on the sidelines. I know we are a war-weary Nation, but \nthere is no upside to Qadhafi staying in power. That is a national \nsecurity nightmare for this country.\n  Here is a recent headline: Qadhafi threatens to attack Europe over \nairstrikes. Colonel Qadhafi has threatened to carry out attacks against \nhomes, offices, families in Europe unless NATO stops its campaign of \nair strikes against his regime in Libya. He actually means it. Hitler \nmeant it. He means it.\n  So we should be talking about the debt; we are not. We should be \ntaking a stand against Qadhafi in an effective way. As Senator McCain \nsaid, we are leading from behind. I just cannot tell you how upset I am \nwith policies coming from this administration that are sending the \nsignal to our allies that we are not as reliable as we should be, and \nto our enemies that we do not have the same amount of will to protect \nour freedom as they do to take it away from us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my friend, is it not true that we are \nproviding tanker support, logistics support, Predator strikes, \nintelligence, and all kinds of assets to those eight nations that are \ninvolved in the fight? When we are using Predators and killing people, \nthat pretty well fits the definition of ``hostilities.'' Yet, for \nreasons which are still not clear to me, the administration fails to \nacknowledge that.\n  Could I also say one thing that is very concerning as well is this \nrecognition of the Transitional National Council. I know my colleague--\nbecause we were just in Turkey--noticed that another country, Turkey, \none of the most important nations in the Middle East, just recognized \nthe Transitional National Council, froze the assets that Qadhafi has. \nYet this administration refuses to do so. There is some $30 billion, I \nam told, of Qadhafi assets that we could freeze and make available to \nthe Transitional National Council. It may require some legislative \naction, but it requires administration leadership. They could then pay \npeople, could provide arms and weapons to their own people, as well as \nsubsidies for the government.\n  Again, an example of leading from behind--the French, the Italians, \nthe Turks, and other nations have all now recognized the Transitional \nNational\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\nCouncil. Yet the United States has failed to do so.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could try to answer the hostility question. When we \nare using Predator drones to bring down military targets, that, to me, \nis an acceptable situation in Libya. I do not want ground troops in \nLibya. The people in Libya do not want a ground invasion by NATO \nforces. They want our help. And what do we have to offer better than \nanybody in the world? Intelligence gathering. These platforms that are \ngathering information about targets are unique to America.\n  The target packages that are being put together are being done mostly \nby Americans, and we are turning these target packages over to NATO \ncountries. Some of the aircraft that are flying--and God bless our \nallies for taking this risk--are 30 years old. No one has the ability \nlike the American Air Force and naval forces to carry on aerial \ncampaigns.\n  But some people in this body have a right to have their say like we \ndo. We should be debating this, but the administration's position that \na Predator drone attack is not a hostile act is dangerous because in \nYemen, the administration, with my full support, is taking the fight to \nYemen today. They are using Predator drone attacks against al-Qaida \ngroups in Yemen. We just had special forces involved in killing al-\nQaida operatives in Somalia. We have to be on the offensive. We need to \nbe hitting these people over there before they can reorganize and hit \nus here.\n  So I support the administration's ability and constitutional right to \ntake the fight to the enemy. But for them to tell the body these are \nnot hostile acts is the ultimate confusion. It is confusing to the \nenemy; it is confusing to our allies; it is confusing to the American \npeople. I reject this definition being offered by this administration \nthat using Predator drones to attack targets is not a hostile act.\n\n  I believe the War Powers Act is unconstitutional. There are two \nthings we can do in this body as a Member of Congress: We can declare \nwar and we can cut off funding when we do not like things the way they \nare going. We very seldom declare war in this Nation from a \ncongressional point of view for a reason. But we have constantly \nengaged forces that wish to attack us and our allies without \ndeclarations of war. If you do not like what we are doing in Libya, cut \noff funding. Do not try to micromanage the war through congressional \nfiat.\n  So $30 billion is available to the Libyan people. It is money frozen, \nstolen by Qadhafi. The Turkish Government, the French, the British in \nsome sense have recognized this Transitional National Council. If we \nwould do that, they would have access to the $30 billion.\n  Senator McCain met with the leadership of this council. I have too. \nThey would gladly pay us back for any assistance we could provide if \nthey could get their hands on the money. Does the Senator agree with \nthat?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have been assured personally by the leadership of the \nTransitional National Council--by the way, one who has a doctorate from \nthe University of Pittsburgh, and their Finance Minister was an \neconomics professor at the University of Washington. So let's dispel \nany illusions about we do not know who they are. They are good and \ndecent people who have risen up against an oppressive and repressive \ndictator and murderer. They want to reimburse the United States for our \nexpenses, the way the Kuwaitis and the Saudis did after Operation \nDesert Storm.\n  But the point is that, again, anybody who believes that it is not in \nAmerica's national security interest to see Qadhafi gone has paid no \nattention to his words and his actions. History will record how the \nUnited States stood on people who were struggling both peacefully and \nwhere it necessitated the use of force of arms, is where the United \nStates of America was.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, we have our good colleague, a Naval \nintelligence officer, Senator Kirk from Illinois, and we will certainly \nyield to him now. But one last thought.\n  America needs to do two things quickly: We need to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. We need to balance our budget and decide among \nourselves how important is this national security. To me, it is the No. \n1 thing we should do in Congress. If we do not get that right, there is \nnothing else that is going to matter. There will never be economic \nprosperity in America if the world is in the hands of evil people who \nwill make it very difficult to travel and trade and do business.\n  The other thing we need to do, after we balance our budget, is to \nhave a clear vision of who we are and what we believe. I believe we are \ndestined to lead the free world. I do not consider it a burden. I \nconsider it the birthright of all Americans, not only to maintain our \nfreedom but to help others secure theirs.\n  A word of warning: The day that America rejects that leadership role \nis a day we will eventually lose our freedom and more damage will be \ndone to this country if we disengage than if we do engage.\n  So with that, I would like to recognize Senator Kirk from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. I would like to agree with the Senator on the Libya \nresolution. But I understand from the majority leader that we are not \ngoing to take up the Libya resolution now. I would just urge them--\nbefore we descend into any potential partisan warfare on any other \nissue, there is a bill that is ready for the Senate's consideration \nright now that was overwhelmingly, unanimously approved by Democrats \nand Republicans on the Appropriations Committee, and it is ready for \nSenate consideration this week.\n  My hope is that we will now, or maybe tomorrow, take up the Military \nConstruction and VA appropriations bill, which Senator Johnson and I \nhave coauthored, and which Senator Inouye and the Senator Cochran have \napproved. It is $1.2 billion in discretionary spending below the \nPresident's request. It is $620 million below the enacted level. It is \neven $2.6 million in budget authority below the House mark. This is \nready to go.\n  So absent debate on some other resolution which has little to no \nfuture in the House of Representatives, my hope is that we will follow \nthe House that has already approved the VA-MILCON appropriations bill, \nand we will take up overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation that benefits \nour men and women in uniform and those veterans, and that we will not \nwaste this week on legislation that has little to no future. Instead, \nwe will achieve something this week by having taken up the MILCON-VA \nbill, which was so overwhelmingly approved by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee just last week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend's advice. We are \nworking to make sure the week is spent relating to the No. 1 issue \nfacing the country today; that is, how to make sure we get a handle on \ndeficit spending.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                             [Quorum No. 3]\n\n     Casey\n     Cornyn\n     Graham\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kirk\n     McCain\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Paul\n     Reid\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Webb\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week in Budapest there are two events \nof particular interest to Americans. First, Hungary has unveiled a \nstatue of President Ronald Reagan in front of\n\n[[Page S4328]]\n\nthe U.S. Embassy in honor of his contribution to the goal of ending \ncommunist repression and commemorating the 100th anniversary of his \nbirth. Second, Hungary dedicated the Lantos Institute, named after Tom \nLantos, our former colleague from the House of Representatives who \nworked tirelessly to promote democracy and human rights in the country \nof his birth. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary \nof State Clinton have represented the United States at these respective \nevents.\n  These gestures shine a light on Hungary's historic transformation as \nwell as the close bonds between our two countries. Unfortunately, other \ndevelopments in Hungary have cast a dark shadow over what should \notherwise be happy occasions.\n  Last year, Hungary held elections in which a right-of-center party, \nFIDESZ, won a landslide, sweeping out eight years of socialist \ngovernment rejected by many voters as scandal ridden and inept. With \nFIDESZ winning 52 percent of the vote, Hungary has the distinction of \nbeing the only country in Central Europe since the 1989 transformations \nwhere a single party has won an outright majority--not necessarily a \nbad thing, especially in a region where many governments are \nperiodically hobbled by factionalism.\n  Those elections were also notable because more than 850,000 \nHungarians--16 percent of the vote--cast their ballots for Jobbik, an \nanti-Semitic, anti-Roma, irredentist party. While Jobbik is an \nopposition party, it has clearly and negatively influenced public \npolicy discourse.\n  Under Hungary's electoral system, FIDESZ's 52 percent of the vote has \ntranslated into a two-thirds majority of the seats in parliament. The \ngovernment of Prime Minister Viktor Orban has used that supermajority \nto push through one controversial initiative after another.\n  One initiative that has generated particularly sharp criticism is \nHungary's new media law. The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the \nMedia warned it could be used to silence critical media and public \ndebate, it overly concentrates power in regulatory authorities, and it \nharms media freedom. In Ukraine, where democracy has put down only \nshallow roots, the Kyiv Post editorialized that ``Hungary's media law \nshould not come here.''\n  Another area of concern stems from the government's fixation on \nethnic Hungarian identity and lost empire in ways that can only be seen \nas unfriendly by other countries in the region. One of the government's \nfirst acts was to amend Hungary's citizenship law to facilitate the \nacquisition of Hungarian citizenship by ethnic Hungarians in other \ncountries--primarily Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine. This \nexpansion of citizenship was pushed through even though, in a 2001 \nstatement submitted to the Council of Europe, the Hungarian Government \nfirmly renounced all aspirations for dual citizenship for ethnic \nHungarians.\n  In a further escalation of provocative posturing, a few weeks ago \nSpeaker of the Hungarian Parliament Laszlo Kovar said that military \nforce to change the borders with Slovakia--a NATO ally--would have been \njustified and, in any case, he added, the ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia \nare ``ours.''\n  If one side of the nationalism coin is an excessive fixation on \nHungarian ethnic identity beyond the borders, the other side is \nintolerance toward minorities at home. For example, one increasingly \nhears the argument, including from government officials, that while the \nHolocaust was a 20th-century tragedy for Jews, the worst tragedy for \nHungarians was the 1920 Treaty of Trianon--the treaty that established \nthe borders for the countries emerging from the defeated Austro-\nHungarian Empire.\n  This comparison is offensive and disturbing. Ethnic Hungarians were \nnever targeted for extermination or subjected to mass murder by \nTrianon. Moreover, this line of argument presents Hungarians and Jews \nas mutually exclusive. But more than 400,000 Jews were sent from \nHungary to Auschwitz, and more than 10,000 Jews were shot along the \nbanks of the Danube--were they not also Hungarian? How could this not \nbe a tragedy for Hungary?\n  The government has also used its supermajority to adopt a completely \nnew Constitution which has been reviewed by the Council of Europe's \nVenice Commission on Democracy through Law, a body of judicial experts.\n  The Venice Commission expressed particular concern with the \nrequirement that numerous issues can now only be addressed through \nsupermajority or so-called cardinal laws. In other words, ``The more \npolicy issues are transferred beyond the powers of simple majority, the \nless significance will future elections have and the more possibilities \ndoes a two-thirds majority have of cementing its political preferences \nand the country's legal order.''\n  In short, the Commission concluded, ``the principle of democracy \nitself is at risk.''\n  This combines, by the way, with a court-packing scheme--the expansion \nof the size of the Constitutional Court from 11 to 15--and a reduction \nof the retirement age for ordinary judges from 70 to 62, which will \nreportedly mean 10 percent of all judges will be replaced.\n  To make exactly clear what he has intended with these reforms, Prime \nMinister Orban declared that he wants to tie the hands not only of the \nnext government, but of the next 10 governments--that is, future \nHungarian governments for the next 40 years.\n  It is no wonder then that in Freedom House's latest ``Nations in \nTransit'' survey, released this week, Hungary had declined in ratings \nfor civil society, independent media, national democratic governance, \nand judicial framework and independence.\n  Ironically, just as attention shifts to the tantalizing possibility \nof democratic reform in the Middle East, the red flags in Budapest keep \nmultiplying: Transparency International has warned that transferring \nthe power to appoint the Ombudsman from the parliament to the president \nmeans that he or she will not be independent of the executive. NGOs \nhave warned that a new draft religion law may result in a number of \nreligions losing their registration. Restrictions by Hungarian \nauthorities on pro-Tibet demonstrations during last week's visit to \nBudapest of the Chinese Premier were seen as an unnecessary and \nheavyhanded limitation of a fundamental liberty. Plans to recall \nsoldiers and police from retirement so that they may oversee Romani \nwork battalions have predictably caused alarm.\n  In 1989, Hungary stood as an inspiration for democracy and human \nrights advocates around the globe. Today, I am deeply troubled by the \ntrends there. I understand that it sometimes takes new governments time \nto find their bearings, and I hope that we will see some adjustments in \nBudapest. But in the meantime, I hope that other countries looking for \ntransformative examples will steer clear of this Hungarian model.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/05/senate-section/article/S4328-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4328-S4329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING PETER FALK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Peter Falk, the iconic actor who entertained \ngenerations of Americans throughout an illustrious 50-year acting \ncareer. Mr. Falk passed away on June 23, 2011, at his home in Beverly \nHills, CA. He was 83 years old.\n  Peter Falk was born in New York City on September 16, 1927. Despite \nthe loss of his right eye from a surgery to remove a malignant tumor at \nthe age of 3, he became a standout 3-letter athlete, a debate team \nmember and senior class president in high school. It was in high school \nthat he developed a love for acting when he first appeared on stage in \na musical.\n  After graduating from high school, Mr. Falk fulfilled a 1-year \ncommitment as a cook in the Merchant Marines. In 1953, he earned a \nmaster's in public administration from Syracuse University and landed a \njob with the Connecticut State Budget Bureau in Hartford.\n  While in Hartford, he pursued his love for acting by joining the Mark \nTwain Maskers, a community theatre group, and learned under the \ntutelage of actress Eva Le Gallienne at White Barn Theatre. At the age \nof 28, he quit his job and moved to New York City to become a \nprofessional actor.\n  Mr. Falk first gained acclaim for his portrayal of a bartender in the \n1956 Off-Broadway production of ``The Iceman\n\n[[Page S4329]]\n\nCometh.'' Over the next half century, he embarked on a career that \nincluded Broadway, television, and movies. He received two Academy \nAward nominations for best supporting actor for roles in ``Murder, \nInc.'' and ``Pocketful of Miracles.'' In 1962, he won the first of five \nEmmys for a role in ``The Dick Powell Show.''\n  Mr. Falk became a household name in 1971 for his title role in the \ndetective series, ``Columbo.'' His portrayal of the iconoclastic Los \nAngeles Police Department homicide detective made the character one of \nthe most memorable and beloved in television history. Columbo placed \n7th in TV Guide's 1999 ranking of ``TV's Fifty Greatest Characters \nEver.''\n  Mr. Falk's legendary career and his many successes on stage, the \nsmall screen and the silver screen highlighted his talents as an actor. \nA consummate professional, his love for performance and acting brought \njoy to generations of fans across the world. He will be missed.\n  I send my deepest sympathies to his family, especially to his wife \nShera, and daughters Catherine and Jackie.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/05/senate-section/article/S4329-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING VIRGINIA WAGNER\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, our State of Mississippi lost one \nof its finest citizens when Virginia Wagner of Bay St. Louis died last \nweek.\n  I ask that the article entitled ``Virginia Wagner Left Legacy of \nGenerosity'' which was posted by the Sun Herald in Gulfport, MS, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article is an excellent tribute to the life and legacy of one of \nour State's finest citizens.\n  She and her family are in our thoughts and prayers.\n  The information follows.\n\n               Virginia Wagner Left Legacy of Generosity\n\n                          (By Michael Newsom)\n\n       Bay St. Louis resident Virginia Wagner--member of a \n     prominent Hancock County family known for good deeds--died \n     Monday. Friends said she left her own legacy of generosity.\n       Wagner was the daughter of Leo W. Seal Sr. and Rebecca \n     Baxter Seal, and also the younger sister of the late Leo W. \n     Seal Jr., a well known Coast philanthropist, businessman and \n     community leader. Wagner, 81, died Monday morning, a few days \n     after a fall at her home. Her husband, Fred Wagner, said his \n     ``extraordinary'' wife spent her life helping others.\n       ``She was from a distinguished family who valued public \n     service and helping other people and looking for \n     opportunities to be responsible citizens,'' he said. ``There \n     was a heritage of that in her family. Her brother was very \n     much that way and her mother and father were very much that \n     way. She constantly was interested in and concerned about \n     others. You don't see that kind of philosophy often. A great \n     part of it was her spiritual heritage and her faith. She was \n     a committed Christian.''\n       Fred and Virginia met in the early 1950s when they both \n     lived in New Orleans. A mutual friend introduced them and 57 \n     years after their marriage, Fred Wagner remembered his wife \n     Monday when speaking to the Sun Herald as ``absolutely the \n     most wonderful wife any man could ask for'' and ``a wonderful \n     mother to our children.''\n       Her daughter, Lisa Yearwood, said that even into her 80s, \n     Virginia Wagner kept a social calendar that would rival most \n     people 60 years younger. She kept recent letters from her \n     mother that laid out her entire week's plans that involved \n     meetings, charity work and other engagements. The writings \n     serve as a testament to her tirelessness.\n       ``She was not a typical 81-year-old lady,'' Yearwood said.\n       Yearwood said she would remember her mother for the way she \n     treated others--something she tries to mimic.\n       ``She was amazingly welcoming and hospitable,'' Yearwood \n     said. ``That was across the board. Whether that was with a \n     waiter in a restaurant or people in Washington, it didn't \n     matter. She was incredibly loving and welcoming and I hope I \n     picked that up from her.''\n       She kept a busy schedule. In May, Wagner worked a booth at \n     the Bay Bridge Fest selling T-shirts, despite the sweltering \n     temperatures. She was a member of Gulf Coast Blessings, a \n     women's Bible study group. Years ago, Wagner and others began \n     teaching children how to swim and that evolved into a swim \n     team that competed in events across the state. She was also \n     an avid tennis player in the 1950s and 1960s--at a time when \n     her husband said there weren't many others on the Coast \n     playing the sport. She worked as a chaperone for the Miss USA \n     pageant when it was held on the Coast for several years in \n     the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n       Virginia Wagner also organized a Mardi Gras marching club \n     known as ``The Marching Fools From Istanbul'' and she carried \n     a silver whistle that helped her keep the group in line.\n       ``She was a fun person and she was always in charge,'' Fred \n     Wagner said.\n       Friend Carrie Rester said she will remember Virginia \n     Wagner's generosity and ``giving heart.''\n       ``She loved people and wanted to share that love whether it \n     was with a birthday card, inviting people into her home, \n     delivering a treat she made or checking in by phone or \n     email,'' Rester said. ``She was always thinking about others, \n     going the extra mile for her friends and family.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/05/senate-section/article/S4329-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/05/senate-section/article/S4329-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/05/senate-section/article/S4329-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 1326.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating sites in the Lower \nMississippi River Area in the State of Louisiana as a unit of the \nNational Park System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nentitled the Lower Mississippi River National Historic Site Study Act. \nThis bill will direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating sites in Plaquemines Parish \nalong the Lower Mississippi River Area as units of the National Park \nSystem. This area in Southeastern Louisiana has contributed much to our \nNation's history and there are many stories that have yet to be \npreserved for future generations. Unless Congress acts to preserve \nthese historical assets, they will be lost forever. That is why I am \nagain, for the third time, introducing this legislation. It is \nimportant that this legislation become law and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to enact it.\n  In order to be designated as a unit in the National Park System, the \nDepartment of Interior must first conduct a special resources study to \ndetermine whether an area possesses nationally significant natural, \ncultural or recreational resources to be eligible for favorable \nconsideration. This is exactly what my bill does. It asks the \nDepartment of Interior to take the first step in determining what I \nalready know, that the Lower Mississippi River Area would be a suitable \nand feasible asset to the National Park Service.\n  As many from Louisiana are already aware, this area has vast \nhistorical significance and is rich with cultural history. In the \n1500s, Spanish explorers traveled along the banks of the river. In \n1682, Robert de LaSalle claimed all the land drained by the area. In \n1699, the area became the site of the first fortification on the Lower \nMississippi\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\nriver, known as Fort Mississippi. Since then, it has been home to ten \ndifferent fortifications, including Fort St. Philip and Fort Jackson.\n\n  Fort St. Philip, which was originally built in 1749, played a key \nrole during the Battle of New Orleans when American soldiers blocked \nthe British Navy from going upriver. Fort Jackson was built at the \nrequest of General Andrew Jackson and partially constructed by famous \nlocal Civil War General, P.G.T. Beauregard. This fort was the site of \nthe famous Civil War battle known as the ``Battle of Forts'' which is \nalso referred to as the ``night the war was lost.'' Mr. President, as \nyou can see, from a historical perspective, this area has many \ntreasures that provide a glimpse into our past. These are treasures \nthat have national significance and they should be maintained and \npreserved.\n  In addition, there are many other important and unique attributes to \nthis area. This area is home to the longest continuous river road and \nlevee system in the U.S. It is also home to the ancient Head of Passes \nsite, to the Plaquemines Bend, and to two National Wildlife Refuges.\n  Finally, this area has a rich cultural heritage. Over the years, many \ndifferent cultures have made this area home, including Creoles, \nEuropeans, Indians, Yugoslavs, African-Americans and Vietnamese. These \ncultures have worked together to create the infrastructure for the \ntransport of our Nation's energy, which is being produced by these same \npeople off our shores in the Gulf of Mexico. They have also created a \nvibrant fishing industry that contributes to Louisiana's economy.\n  I think it is easy to see why this area would make an excellent \naddition to the National Park Service. However, the longer Congress \ntakes to act, the greater the opportunity for these treasures and their \nrich history to erode away. Unfortunately, this area has weathered the \npassing of several hurricanes, including Katrina, and is now suffering \nfrom the impacts of the BP oil spill. All of these events threaten to \ndestroy these historical assets, but this need not be the case. These \nassets need protection and this is the first step in securing it. That \nis why I am reintroducing this bill to conduct a study to determine the \nsuitability and feasibility of including this area in the system and \nultimately to begin the process of adding this area as a unit of the \nNational Park Service. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nquickly enact this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/05/senate-section/article/S4331-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n           committee on health, education, labor and pensions\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
