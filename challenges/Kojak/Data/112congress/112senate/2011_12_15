Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today, as I \nhave just about every week since the health care law was passed, to \ngive a doctor's second opinion about the health care law. I do that \nbecause I practice medicine in Casper, WY, as an orthopedic surgeon, \ntaking care of families from all across our State, and I have \nsignificant concerns about the health care law as it was passed, the \nway it was passed, and what was included in the law.\n  So I come to the floor today because the American people continue to \nsee one news story after another uncovering another error in the health \ncare law, another mistake in the health care law, another glitch in the \nhealth care law. Call it what you will, we continue to see more of the \nhealth care law's unintended consequences--something that those who \nvoted for it didn't foresee as happening--and we are also seeing \nanother one of the President's broken promises.\n  I come to share with the American people concerns I have as more and \nmore of these things come forward because hard-working individuals and \nfamilies all across the Nation realize this health care law was not \npassed for someone such as them. What people asked for, the reason we \nwent through the discussion and the debate had to do with the fact that \npeople wanted the care they need, from the doctor they want, at a cost \nthey can afford.\n  When I say people all across the country realize the health care law \nwas not passed for someone such as them, and it was passed for someone \nelse, that is the reason I come to the floor to talk specifically about \nsomething called the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, which is part \nof the health care law.\n  On Friday, December 9--1 week ago--the Department of Health and Human \nServices announced its plan to shut down the Early Retiree Reinsurance \nProgram at the end of this month--shut it down.\n  Remember, President Obama and Washington Democrats touted their early \nretiree program. They touted that as one of the health care law's \nearly--they called it an early deliverable, something that would be \nthere immediately. The health care law's supporters said this early \nretiree program would act, they said, as a bridge. They said the \nprogram would help employers maintain health insurance coverage for \nretirees over the age of 55 but not yet eligible for Medicare. They \nsaid this program would help people keep their insurance plan until the \nnew health insurance exchanges were up and running in 2014.\n  It is only 2011 now, and they are trying to talk about a bridge to \n2014. It quickly became clear the program was intended to be a \nbailout--a bailout--for companies with a large number of union \nemployees.\n  On October 31 of this year--Halloween day--the senior Senator from my \nhome State of Wyoming, the ranking member of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Mike Enzi, released a report. \nThat Halloween day report is a report the Senator asked for. It was a \nreport he asked the Government Accountability Office to conduct, \nspecifically looking into the early retiree program's implementation.\n  This is why the report is so scary: The GAO, the Government \nAccountability Office, said through the end of September of 2011, the \nadministration had already spent more than half the $5 billion \nallocation--more than half already spent by September of 2011.\n  Let's fast forward to December 14, 2011. We are talking about \nyesterday. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released updated \ninformation about the early retiree program's spending. As of last \nFriday, December 9, 2011, the Obama administration--the people in \ncharge of this bill, the people who wanted it, passed it, said it would \nwork--said: Oh, we have now spent over $4.5 billion of the $5 billion \nbudget--91 percent of the total early retiree program budget. It was \nsupposed to last through 2014, and 91 percent of it is gone. The budget \nshould have lasted 1,300 days. Instead, this administration drained the \nmoney--taxpayers' money, hard-earned dollars--in just 579 days.\n  The early retiree program has run out of money so fast that it is \ngoing to be forced to close 2 years early. The administration has said \nit is no longer going to pay out claims submitted after December 31 of \nthis year.\n  The health care law's supporters promised the early retiree program \nwould stay in place through January 1st of 2014. What we have is \nanother broken promise. Just a little over a month after the GAO report \nwas released, we are now finding out this administration spent more \nthan $4.5 billion of the total $5 billion allocation that was supposed \nto last until 2014.\n  How did this administration--one that claims to be fiscally \nresponsible, one that claims to be accountable, one that claims to be \nopen--how did this administration allow this program to run out of \nmoney years ahead of schedule? It went broke because certain \ncorporations and union-affiliated organizations rushed to grab a \ntaxpayer bailout.\n  It is astonishing that the health care law's supporters forced the \nAmerican taxpayers to foot the bill to keep private companies' and \nunions' health insurance benefit promises to their workers. Most \nAmericans would be shocked and outraged to learn the administration did \nnot even require companies to disclose their earnings in order to get \nthe early retiree program funding.\n  Let me repeat that. The Department of Health and Human Services chose \nto not mandate that employers prove--prove--they needed funding from \nthe early retiree program before approving the applications and then \nsending them--those corporations and those union plans--taxpayer \ndollars. The Department of Health and Human Services said: No. Here is \nyour money.\n  News reports indicate small businesses asked the administration to \nset up a review process to stop government entities and unions from \nconsuming all this early retiree program money. According to the GAO \nreport, the administration refused. They decided to distribute early \nretiree subsidies on a first come, first served basis.\n  The GAO findings and the House Energy and Commerce Committee report \nsuggest the Obama administration used the Early Retiree Reinsurance \nProgram to reward its political allies. These two reports suggest this \nadministration did so by directing most of the program's resources to \nplans serving unionized auto and government workers.\n  This is based on the administration's own data: Based on the \nadministration's data, nearly half of the entire $5 billion program \nwill be spent on just 20 entities. It is fascinating that the most \nmoney of all--the most money of all--went to the United Auto Workers \nRetiree Medical Benefits Trust. So how much did the United Auto Workers \nneed? They took over $387 million.\n  Administration officials said the reason they are giving away the \ntaxpayers' money so fast is because the program is so popular. Spending \nmoney fast does not mean this government and this administration is \nspending taxpayer dollars wisely.\n  Similar to so many parts of the health care law, the early retiree \nprogram just throws money at a problem rather than trying to fix it. We \ncould have worked together in Congress. We could have worked together \nto help our Nation's early retirees have better access to health \ninsurance. We could have done it by enacting meaningful health care \nreform--health care reform that actually lowers the cost of medical \ncare.\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\n  Remember, that is what the President promised. That is what he \npromised in a joint session of Congress. He stood there, and he said \nunder his plan the cost of health insurance would actually go down. He \nused the term ``about $2,500 per family per year.'' That is what he \npromised; that the cost of health insurance for American families would \ngo down by $2,500 a year.\n  What are families at home seeing? They continue to see the cost of \ntheir health insurance go up--and go up a lot. The President and \nWashington Democrats squandered their chance to enact real health care \nreform, and they did that the moment they decided to ram a very \npartisan health care law through Congress and ignore the cries of the \nAmerican people--people at home who said: Stop. Do not do this.\n  Now the American people are seeing, once again, the consequences of \nthose actions by this President and the Democratically controlled \nCongress, seeing that the consequences are ones they, the American \npeople, continue to have to pay for.\n  It is time to repeal the President's health care law. We need to get \nback to patient-centered care, the care people need, from the doctor \nthey want, at a cost they can afford.\n  At this point, I continue to come to the floor because I continue to \nbelieve this health care law is bad for patients, it is bad for \nproviders--the nurses and doctors who take care of those patients--and \nit is terrible for the American taxpayers. That is why, as I go home \nevery weekend and talk to people around my home State, they say: This \nwas not passed for me. This was a law passed for somebody else. It is \nwhy seniors on Medicare know $500 billion under the health care law was \ntaken from Medicare, not to save Medicare but to start a whole new \ngovernment program for other people. It is why the popularity of this \nhealth care law actually continues to go down--and it is less popular \ntoday than it was the day it was passed.\n  It is time to repeal the President's health care law and replace it \nwith health care proposals to help Americans get the care they need, \nfrom the doctor they want, at a cost they can afford.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about an issue \nthat the American people expect us to take action on, and that is to \nprovide another extension of the payroll tax cut we put into place in \n2010.\n  I want to provide a little bit of background by way of recent \nhistory. We started this debate a number of weeks ago when I proposed \nlegislation which would do the following--this is a brief summary. But \nhere is what I proposed: that we would not only continue the payroll \ntax cut for workers, but that we would enlarge it, make it a bigger \ncut. So instead of having the payroll tax cut for employees across the \ncountry that would amount to $1,000, as we did last year--that was the \nright thing to do last year as part of the larger bill--I thought we \nshould go further and cut the payroll tax in half for workers across \nAmerica.\n  What we are talking about here is 160 million American workers. This \nis not some small matter. This is a major issue for the American people \nand for those 160 million families in America. That is what I proposed \non the employee side; instead of cutting it to the level we did last \nyear, we cut it even more--cut it in half.\n  Then I added to that a provision for business so that you would have \nbusinesses across the United States, 98 percent of them, also get their \npayroll taxes cut in half as well. So you have employees and employers \ngetting a cut of their payroll tax obligations in half. I added a third \nelement, which would be a credit, so that if you are a business and you \nadd to your payroll, meaning you hire someone, you increase wages, you \nsomehow increase your payroll, you could get not just a cut in your \npayroll tax as applies to those new employees or wages, you would have \na full cut. In other words, you would pay zero, zero payroll tax if you \nadded to your bottom line.\n  What you have here is three elements in legislation that would not \nonly help 160 million workers but would help most of the businesses in \nAmerica. I put into the legislation a provision that says if we are \ngoing to do all of this, we need to pay for it. We had a full series of \nways to pay for it. One of those was, of course, the provision of the \nsurtax on individuals with incomes above--the key word is ``above''--$1 \nmillion. So if you are making $1 million, that entire million dollars \nwas tax free; not a dime of surtax until you went above it. We had it \nat 2.2 percent. We had a vote on it. It was rejected by the other side. \nI said: Well, okay, let's come together. We will work with the other \nside, our leadership, and take into consideration some of the concerns \nthe other side raised, trying to be reasonable, trying to compromise \nand come together.\n  What we did is we reduced the surtax substantially to 1.9 percent, a \nbig cut, a big reduction in the level of the surtax. As I said, I \nwanted to have a payroll tax cut for businesses across America. The \nother side did not want that, for whatever reason. The other side did \nnot want to cut payroll taxes for business. I do not understand that, \nbut that is what they wanted. They wanted that out of the bill. So that \nwas out of the bill. The surtax was reduced. We are at the point where \nwe are talking mostly about expanding and extending--I should say \nextending first, extending and hopefully expanding the payroll tax cut \nthat we put in place last year for workers, 160 million workers, and as \nwe cut it in half, $1,500 in the take-home pay of workers, $1,500 in \nyour pocket, so you would not have, absent this action, as last year, \n$1,000 dollars in your pocket in take-home pay, because of the action \nwe took last year.\n  Here we are now, all of these days later, several weeks now of \ndebating this issue. For whatever reason, the other side does not want \nto have a vote on a measure the House passed. I do not understand that. \nI realize the votes are not there, but I think it is very important \nthat we move forward and come to an agreement on a very fundamental \nissue for the American people.\n  They know, as well as everyone here knows, this is not in dispute, it \nis a fact, that if we pass a payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans, \nthe impact on the economy will be seismic, substantial--you can pick \nyour word--it will have a huge positive impact on our economy.\n  The corollary to that is if we do not do this, it will have a very \nadverse, negative impact on gross domestic product and on jobs. So if \nyou want to reduce the number of jobs created in America in 2012--I do \nnot know anyone who wants to do that, but if that is what you want to \ndo, not taking action is a way to do that.\n  We hear phrases in Washington all of the time: Job killer. Not \npassing a payroll tax cut extension for 160 million Americans is a job \nkiller, without a doubt.\n  Anyone who is credible in this town knows that. This is something the \nAmerican people want us to do. They are tired of the finger-pointing \nand whining and the politics of Washington. They want us to get this \ndone. We should get it done--if we are doing the right thing--today or \ntomorrow, but we have some people who are playing games.\n  I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle, who talk a lot \nabout tax cuts and a lot about helping folks through this recession, \nwill vote with us to cut the payroll tax and end this long debate that \ndoesn't make much sense. We have a lot of other issues to debate, but \nthis should not be one of them because we have been working on this for \nweeks.\n  The American people understand what this is about. This is about \ntake-home pay. This isn't a complicated issue. We are either going to \nput more money in their pockets or we are not. It is very simple. We \nbelieve, on this side of the aisle--and I think the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans believe this--that if workers have more take-home \npay in their pockets, the impact on the economy will be very positive.\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\n  We had Mark Zandi do some analysis. He is a great economist who has \nprovided data and information for people on both sides of the aisle for \na long time. He is a very credible, capable economist. Our staff asked \nhim to look at the impact just on Pennsylvania--just one State but a \nbig State, and I think it is reflective of the country in a lot of \nways. The basic analysis was, if we don't pass the payroll tax cut for \nworkers, what happens in Pennsylvania? The impact in 2012 would be a \nloss of just shy of 20,000 jobs, roughly 19,500 jobs. This is in a \nState where we need to create a lot more jobs. But we know that in \n2011--the year is not over--the most recent number of jobs added in \nPennsylvania in the last year was over 50,000. I believe we can come to \na number like that in 2012.\n  If we don't pass the payroll tax cut for those 160 million workers, \nin a State such as Pennsylvania the effect is that we lose 20,000 jobs. \nYou can do the math and extrapolate from that to indicate what would \nhappen to the country. So in a State where we had a net gain of more \nthan 50,000 jobs last year, we are talking about not putting in place a \ntax cut policy, and that would cut that job gain a little less than \nhalf. So instead of creating 50,000 jobs, you would create 40 percent \nless. That doesn't make any sense under anyone's analysis about what we \nshould be doing.\n  It is critically important that we take steps in the next few days--I \nhope in the next few hours--to finally pass a payroll tax cut and to \nalso make sure we don't harm the economy as well by failing to take \naction on unemployment insurance. Again, unemployment insurance is not \njust for that worker and his or her family to get back on their feet \nafter they lost their job through no fault of their own, it also has a \npositive impact on the economy. You spend a buck on unemployment \ninsurance, and you get back almost two bucks--$1.90. Whether it is \n$1.50 or $1.90, we know that if you spend a dollar, all of us get in \nreturn something much more substantial than that dollar we put in.\n  We need to do both of these things, take both of these actions for \nthe larger economy. This isn't about one group benefiting and another \ngroup not. Both of these actions--reducing the payroll tax for workers \nand unemployment insurance--will have a substantial impact on \neverybody. It will help the economy for the American people.\n  In the payroll tax cut, there is a particular significant group of \nAmericans who would be most positively impacted; that is, those 160 \nmillion American workers. I believe most folks out there who are in the \nholiday shopping season--maybe they are finished shopping or maybe they \nare still making purchases--would like the peace of mind to know they \ncan spend a little extra for that gift for a loved one, and maybe they \ncan have a little more peace of mind knowing that the economy is still \nin difficult shape but that their own lives--and so many people are \nleading lives of struggle and sacrifice and anxiety about the future. \nBut this is one step we can take--passing the payroll tax cut--that \nwould give them some peace of mind that moving into 2012 they will have \nmore dollars in their pockets. I hope it will be $1,500, but at least \nwe should do what we did last year and make sure those 160 million \nworkers in America have as much as $1,000, on average, in their \npockets. That would be good for that worker and his or her family, the \ncommunity, and all of us because it would help kick-start, jump-start \neconomic growth and job creation when we badly need that in the midst \nof a still very difficult recession.\n  Mr. President, we are going to keep on this, keep pushing, and keep \nmaking sure the American people know what is at stake. For those 160 \nmillion Americans who are waiting for us to take action, as well as \nwhat is at stake for the larger economy, if we do this--pass the \npayroll tax cut--and if we do the right thing on extending unemployment \ninsurance, we can move into 2012 with some confidence, while being \naware it is still difficult, that the economy will grow a little more, \njobs will be created at a higher rate, and we can have some confidence \nthat we can end 2012 with a stronger economy than we had at the end of \nthis year.\n  I hope our friends will come across the aisle, so to speak, and work \nwith us to get this done because the American people are tired of the \npolitics and the fighting. They want us to come together on a new \npayroll tax cut for 2012. We can do it, they support it, and we should \nget this done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8622-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8622-S8624]\n                       TAX CUTS AND UNEMPLOYMENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are all in the holiday spirit, at least \npartially, knowing that our families and the people we love are waiting \nfor us back home and around the country to celebrate this once-a-year \nholiday occurrence. But we know we can't leave. We can't leave \nWashington until we get our job done.\n  The job we have to do is to be mindful of important measures that \nneed to be enacted into law before any of us can leave this town with a \nclear conscience. One is the payroll tax. Currently, those working--160 \nmillion Americans--get a 2-percent reduction in the payroll tax every \npay period. For the average family in Illinois--making about $53,000 a \nyear--the amount that payroll tax deduction has been calculated to be \nis somewhere in the range of $1,000 a year. Now, that means about $100 \na month for families who are working and enjoying this payroll tax cut.\n  I know what is happening with that money. It is being spent, and \nspent quickly, by many working families who have a job but are \nstruggling from paycheck to paycheck. If gasoline prices go up, if \nutility bills are higher than expected, then the amount they thought \nthey had put away as a reserve quickly vanishes. Particularly at the \nholiday season, when kids need warm clothes, when they need to keep the \nhouse warm for the family, and they are trying to put a few things \nunder the Christmas tree, that $100 is more than just a small amount. \nIt could mean a lot to a family, and it is going to expire. On January \n1 it goes away.\n  As of January 1, these working families will see their paychecks \nreduced by about $100 a month, on average. Now, Members of Congress--\nMembers of the Senate--may not feel that, but a lot of working families \nwill. We cannot leave Washington in good conscience without extending \nthe payroll tax cut.\n  President Obama has been talking about this for 3 months. He has \ntaken his case to the American people--first to Congress then to the \nAmerican people. He has gone from State to State, community to \ncommunity, and identified what this payroll tax cut means to individual \nfamilies. Then he has spoken to America and said it is more than just \nbeing compassionate to those who are struggling, it is an important \npart of restoring economic growth in America. Money that is given in \npayroll tax cuts to working families is spent and respent in salaries \nfor those who work at the shops and businesses that provide goods and \nservices where working families do their work.\n  So the payroll tax cut is more than helpful to individual families; \nit is good for the overall economy to reduce our unemployment. That is \nwhy we cannot leave without enacting it. We have come up with what I \nconsider to be a responsible, thoughtful way to pay for it. We impose a \nsurtax on those making over $1 million a year, but we exempt the first \n$1 million in income they receive.\n  So if a person is being paid $20,000 a week--that is what a \nmillionaire would make each year--their taxes don't go up. But for the \nnext $1 million they make, there is a surtax of a few percentage \npoints. I think that is reasonable. I think people who are comfortable \nand well off and, frankly, lucky to be living in this country should be \nwilling to sacrifice a little to help working families.\n  We could only find one Republican Senator who would join us in this \neffort to put a higher tax on the wealthiest in America to help working \nfamilies across America--only one. We need more. It takes 60 votes in \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\nWe have a nominal majority in the Senate on the Democratic side with \n53, but it takes 60 to do anything of great controversy, and this is \none that is controversial. We could only get Senator Collins of Maine \nwho would step over and join us in this bipartisan effort. We are \nsearching for other ways to do this, with the understanding that it has \nto be done. The payroll tax cut has to be done.\n  But let me say there is another part to this that I think is equally \nimportant; that is, maintaining unemployment benefits for the millions \nacross America who are out of work. This recession has gone on for a \nlong period of time. People are unemployed for longer periods than they \never imagined. In fact, there are four unemployed people for every \navailable job.\n  As I visit the centers where people are struggling to make their \nresumes more timely and to respond to classified ads and requests from \nthose who would like to hire, I find these people working day in and \nday out in an effort to try to find a job. They are serious about it.\n  Those who would dismiss them and say, as long as they are receiving \nunemployment benefits, they are going to be too lazy to look don't know \nwhat that life is like. They do not understand what these people go \nthrough.\n  When I meet with unemployed people who have been out of work for some \nperiod of time, the first question I ask is, What has happened to your \nhealth insurance? Overwhelmingly, the answer is, Gone; no health \ninsurance protection for my family because I lost my job, and my job \nbrought me my health insurance protection. That is the reality.\n  When I saw the bill that came over from the Republican side this \nweek, it troubled me. There are two provisions in there that I think \nare mindless and, frankly, don't reflect the reality of what people \nface in this recession. One of them would authorize the States to give \ndrug tests to people who are unemployed before they can get \nunemployment benefits.\n  Is there a notion somewhere that people are not applying for work \nbecause they are addicted to drugs? I haven't seen any evidence of \nthat. This plays into the thought process these people aren't really \ntrying because they do not want to try. I don't buy that. I think that \nkind of attitude reflects the fact that those who support it and \nsponsor it never sit down to talk to these people and to their families \nand understand what they are going through.\n  There is an element that I think hasn't been spoken of much but \nshould be. What happens to a family when the major breadwinner is out \nof work for 3 months, 6 months, a year or more? It turns out that some \nof the problems may not be anticipated by some Members of Congress or \nthe Senate that should be.\n  I received a letter from Lanesia Hoskins, wife and mother of three, \nfrom the south side of Chicago. She wrote that her husband Theodis \nHoskins, who has a college degree, had been out of work for more than 2 \nyears. His unemployment insurance had run out, and Mrs. Hoskins had \njust started a second job to help support their family. She wrote, ``My \nbody is tired and I often feel weak.''\n  This is how Mrs. Hoskins described her husband's job search in an \neconomy where there are still five job seekers for every available job:\n\n       My husband has stood in long lines at the job fairs located \n     at Chicago State University, St. Sabina Church, and for the \n     Ford plant in Chicago. He has stood out in these hot lines \n     just to have people inside the building take his resume and \n     say, `apply online.' What a waste and how humiliating after \n     having news cameras expose your current situation with no \n     results.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       He has applied for state jobs, federal jobs, temp jobs, and \n     gone through city agencies and has not had any results. \n     Interview after interview. This is humiliating for a man who \n     used to take two buses and two trains to get to work from the \n     Southside of Chicago to Rosemont, Illinois.\n\n  Mrs. Hoskins said she could never understand politicians who say that \npeople like her husband were ``lazy and did not want to get up and find \na job because they are getting unemployment checks.''\n  She asked:\n\n       How could they make such a statement about a man who had \n     steady employment and good benefits? Who wants to collect an \n     unemployment check and not have benefits for their family?\n       We have a modest home, one automobile, and we do not live \n     above our means. We are trying to keep things together, but \n     it is difficult.\n\n  She closed her letter with a request:\n\n       Can you please get this message across to the politicians?\n\n  Like so many American families, the Hoskins family lost a lot of \nground financially while Theodis Hoskins was out of work.\n  Fortunately, there is a happy post-script to this family's story.\n  After more than 2 years of looking, Mr. Hoskins found a job. He is \nworking about 23 hours a week at a Costco store in Chicago and he is \ngrateful for the work.\n  The last thing the Hoskins family needs now is to lose $1,000 in \nincome next year. Yet that is what will happen if Republicans refuse to \nextend the payroll tax cut for working families.\n  The Hoskins family and 160 million other working Americans will lose \nan average of $1,000 in income next year if Republicans insist on \nkilling the payroll tax cut, which expires at the end of this month.\n  This past summer, working families in America suffered their biggest \nloss in wealth in more than 2 years. At the same time, corporations \nraised their cash stockpiles to record levels.\n  Our Republican friends say all the time that businesses need \ncertainty. You know what businesses need even more than certainty? \nCustomers.\n  Continuing the payroll tax cut puts money into the hands of consumers \nwho are likely to spend that money. That is how you jump start an \neconomy that is driven by consumer spending--not by giving bigger tax \nbreaks to individuals and corporations that are already sitting on \nrecord amounts of cash.\n  We also need to maintain unemployment benefits for workers who have \nlost their jobs through no fault of their own, have exhausted all of \ntheir state unemployment benefits and still can't find work.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of holiday traditions we look forward \nto. This new holiday tradition our Republican colleagues have started--\nthreatening to cut off unemployment benefits--isn't one of them.\n  For the second holiday season in a row, unemployed workers and their \nfamilies are being threatened with an imminent cutoff of federal \nunemployment benefits.\n  If Republicans refuse to maintain unemployment benefits, 2 million \nAmericans will lose their jobless benefits by the end of February.\n  The Congressional Budget Office analyzed 11 different steps Congress \ncould take to stimulate the economy. The most efficient short-term \neconomic stimulus by far is extending unemployment benefits.\n  Every dollar we spend on unemployment generates $1.90 in economic \nactivity. That is a 90 percent return on investment. Nothing else comes \nclose.\n  According to the U.S. Census, emergency unemployment benefits kept \n3.2 million Americans from slipping into poverty last year.\n  If the extended benefits aren't renewed, economist warn, economic \ngrowth next year could slow by up to a half-percentage point.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues who want to end the payroll tax cut \nfor working families say they are concerned about the budget deficit.\n  We also have a serious jobs deficit in America.\n  They may be handing out million-dollar bonuses again on Wall Street \nand corporations are sitting on record amounts of cash. But there are \nstill five job seekers for every available job in America.\n  Here is a sobering statistic. In the recoveries from the previous \nthree recessions, the longest average length of unemployment was 21 \nweeks; that was in July 1983.\n  The average length of unemployment for this last recession, the Great \nRecession, is about 41 weeks--nearly twice the previous record.\n  That is the longest average unemployment since the government started \nkeeping records in 1948.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke calls long-term unemployment a \n``national crisis.''\n  He is right. The idea that we would abruptly end unemployment \nbenefits for millions of Americans in the midst\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nof this national crisis is hard to believe.\n  Not since the Great Depression have so many Americans been out of \nwork for so long.\n  When I talk to people in my state who are running food pantries and \nemergency shelters, they all tell me the same thing. They have never \nseen so many families struggling so hard for so long.\n  Go to an emergency food pantry and you will see America's ``new \npoor'': families who were solidly middle class just a few years ago, \nwho are now having to ask for help for the first time in their lives.\n  It may start with a job loss. As weeks without a paycheck stretches \ninto months, many families find themselves in financial free fall. They \nmay lose their homes.\n  The inability to support one's family financially very often leads to \nfeelings of shame and fear, which can lead to isolation, which makes it \neven harder to find work.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 6.6 \npercent of Americans were ``clinically depressed'' in 2001 and 2002. By \nlast year, that percentage had increased to 9 percent--an almost 50 \npercent increase in 8 years.\n  Last year, the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at \nRutgers University in New Jersey released a comprehensive study of the \nemotional and mental health consequences of long-term unemployment on \nindividuals.\n  The title of the study is, ``The Anguish of Unemployment.''\n  Overwhelming majorities of the survey's respondents said they feel or \nhave experienced anxiety, helplessness, depression, and stress after \nbeing without a job.\n  Many said they have experienced sleeping problems and strained \nrelationships and have avoided social situations as a result of their \njob loss.\n  Carl Van Horn, a professor of public policy and economics at Rutgers \nand head of the Heldrich Center said that America faces ``a silent \nmental health epidemic'' as jobless Americans face the financial, \nemotional, and social consequences of being unemployed.\n  One of the respondents in the Rutgers survey said:\n\n       The lack of income and loss of health benefits hurts \n     greatly, but losing the ability to provide for my wife and \n     myself is killing me emotionally.\n\n  Children are especially sensitive to the effects of unemployment in \nthe family. They pick up on their parents' stress and are more likely \nto suffer from poorer school performance and low self-esteem.\n  One recent study found that children in families with an unemployed \nparent were 15 percent more likely to repeat a grade in school.\n  In extreme cases, people who are emotionally fragile and overwhelmed \nmay see suicide as the only way out of their troubles.\n  A study released last April by the Centers for Disease Control shows \nthat suicide rates rise and fall with the economy.\n  It is the first study to examine the relationships between age-\nspecific suicide rates and the economy.\n  It found that suicide rates rose to an all-time high during the Great \nDepression, fell during the expansionary period following World War II, \nrose again during the oil crisis of the early 1970s and the double-dip \nrecession of the early eighties, and fell to its lowest level ever \nduring the booming nineties.\n  It also found the strongest link between business cycles and suicide \namong people in prime working ages, 25 to 64 years old.\n  It is too soon to know for certain whether we will see another \nincrease in suicide as the result of the Great Recession that started \nin 2007, because government figures lag. But a preliminary estimate by \nthe CDC shows that suicide ticked up slightly in 2009, becoming the \n10th leading cause of death in the United States.\n  It is important to stress: It is never just one factor that drives \npeople to suicide, and most people who suffer terrible losses never \neven think about suicide. But for those who are already emotionally \nvulnerable, this time of unprecedented longterm unemployment can be \nvery dangerous.\n  One more measure: Between 2004 and 2010 calls to the National Suicide \nPrevention Lifeline increased 72 percent. Last year, almost 40 percent \nof calls to the hotline involved people with financial and unemployment \nconcerns.\n  The Atlantic magazine recently asked readers to share the one thing \npeople didn't understand or appreciate about looking for work. The \nresponses poured in.\n  One reader wrote:\n\n       For those of us prone to depression, the job search can \n     amount to a heroic effort.\n\n  Another wrote:\n\n       Possibly the worst thing about being unemployed is having \n     to suffer through the pundit and the politician classes \n     gassing on interminably about what it's like to be \n     unemployed, what kind of people are unemployed and how they \n     think and act, when none of them knows or understands one \n     damn thing about it, nor do they even want to. Get down here \n     on the ground, and try to go a year on $350 a week with no \n     hope in sight, and then tell us why the lazy unemployed just \n     need a good swift kick to get the country moving again.\n\n  Still another wrote:\n\n       I am over the bruises to my ego . . . The worst thing \n     though is the impact on my kids. We were making $120K plus \n     two years ago. Now, about $35K. Lost the house. Thankfully \n     still in the same school. That said, the kids went from being \n     respectably comfortable in their cohort to being comfortable \n     if tattered (used clothes, battered rental, same old car, no \n     summer trips, etc.). Thank God they are still young (just \n     started third grade) but we're not having any sleepovers here \n     no matter how much they ask. I am afraid for the social \n     impact on them. They are so upbeat, so enthusiastic. They \n     don't know we're in a ditch. It would break my heart if they \n     figured that out.\n\n  Yet another wrote:\n\n       Unemployment dehumanizes the real person. They lose the \n     essence of their identity and value. To become a number, a \n     label, a resume, a failure, a defect, unproductive, \n     desperate, wishful, delusional, depressed, poor and separated \n     from respectful society. Being unemployed is to be silently \n     disrespected. On a par with being homeless, mentally ill or \n     addicted.\n\n  The website Unemployed-friends.com is another place you can hear the \nstories of unemployed Americans who are trying to hang on.\n  One person wrote:\n\n       Living in constant fear and feeling helpless to do anything \n     about it is bound to take its toll. I really feel like I am \n     going to have heart attack. Severe chest pains, shortness of \n     breath, heartburn, but it has been going on for months and \n     I'm still here. By the way, no doctor will see me without \n     money for tests up front. I've already had the consult and \n     that almost broke me.\n\n  Another wrote:\n\n       Another rejection notice from Lowe's today. Second time \n     they've rejected me with the automated rejection notice--this \n     time for ``seasonal plumbing department associate.'' . . . I \n     am willing to go from a 17-year professional to working doing \n     anything I can. Retail, washing cars, pumping gas, flipping \n     burgers . . . be it whatever. I cannot even land that!!!!!.\n\n  This is what one woman posted at 1 o'clock in the morning:\n\n       I'm so tired. I have no more fight left in me. I am a tough \n     NY girl but this recession has sucked the life out of me. . . \n     . I've exhausted all resources, borrowed from everyone, lost \n     most of everything including my pride and self esteem. I feel \n     like nothing, a total zero, non-productive person. . . . I \n     fully expect to look in the mirror one day and see no \n     reflection. I am fading away, becoming irrelevant. How will I \n     ever recover?\n\n  Peter Kramer is a professor of psychiatry at Brown University and the \nauthor of two best-selling books, ``Listening to Prozac'' and ``Against \nDepression.''\n  In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, he wrote:\n\n       I began my psychiatry residency at a community mental \n     health center. The director liked to put trainees in their \n     place. He'd trade any of us, he said, for a good employment \n     counselor. Medication and psychotherapy were fine, but they \n     worked better if a patient had a job. . . . There is no \n     substitute for the structure, support and meaning that jobs \n     offer.\n\n  He went on to say that if Congress wants to do something about this \nsilent mental health crisis that is hurting so many Americans, the best \nthing we can do is work with the President to pass programs that will \nget Americans back to work.\n  I couldn't agree more and I urge our Republicans colleagues to do \njust that.\n  In the meantime, at the very least, we need to maintain unemployment \nbenefits for people who have lost jobs and are still looking and \ncontinue the payroll tax cut so that families that are working aren't \nhit next year with a $1,000 tax increase.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8624-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8624-S8625]\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Her \nnomination has the strong support of both of Alaska's Senators, \nRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski and Democratic Senator Mark Begich, \nwho introduced Justice Christen to the Judiciary Committee at her \nhearing on July 13. Several Republican leaders from Alaska also wrote \nto the Judiciary Committee to express their support, including former \nAlaska State Senator Arliss Sturgulewski, and Walt Monegan, the former \nAlaska commissioner for public safety appointed by then-Governor Sarah \nPalin. Connecticut State Representative Lile Gibbons, a Republican, has \nalso written to the committee to express her support.\n  Justice Christen is the kind of qualified, consensus nominee who in \npast years would have been considered and confirmed by the Senate \nwithin days of being reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, \nnot stuck for months unnecessarily on the Senate calendar. She is an \nexperienced jurist who has served on Alaska's highest court for the \npast 3 years. She was nominated to that position by then-Governor Sarah \nPalin, and she is the second woman in Alaska's history to serve on its \nsupreme court. Justice Christen previously served for 7 years as a \njudge on the Superior Court for Alaska's Third Judicial District, 3 of \nthose years as the presiding judge. She worked in private practice for \n13 years in Anchorage, clerked for Judge Brian Shortell of the Alaska \nSuperior Court, and has demonstrated a deep commitment to her community \nthroughout her career. Once she is confirmed, Justice Christen will be \nthe first woman from Alaska to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit.\n  The unexplained Republican delay in consenting to consider her \nnomination has caused unnecessary delays in filling judicial emergency \nvacancies on the Ninth Circuit, the busiest Federal circuit court in \nthe country. Sixty-one million Americans live in the jurisdiction \nserved by the Ninth Circuit. At a time when judges on that circuit are \nbeing called upon to handle double the caseload of the other Federal \ncircuit courts, the Senate should have expedited the consideration of \nJustice Christen's nomination, not needlessly slowed it down. The chief \njudge of the Ninth Circuit, Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan appointee, \nalong with the members of the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit, \nhave written to the Senate emphasizing the Ninth Circuit's ``desperate \nneed for judges,'' urging the Senate to ``act on judicial nominees \nwithout delay,'' and concluding that they ``fear that the public will \nsuffer unless our vacancies are filled very promptly.''\n  The judicial emergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit are harming \nlitigants by creating unnecessary and costly delays. The Administrative \nOffice of U.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly 5 months longer for \nthe Ninth Circuit to issue an opinion after an appeal is filed, \ncompared to all other circuits. The Ninth Circuit's backlog of pending \ncases far exceeds other Federal courts. As of March 2011, the Ninth \nCircuit had 13,913 cases pending before it. The second closest--the \nSixth Circuit--had 5,231 cases pending.\n  If caseloads were really a concern of Republican Senators, as they \ncontended when they filibustered the nomination last week of Caitlin \nHalligan to the DC Circuit, they would not have delayed Justice \nChristen's nomination to fill a judicial emergency vacancy for over 3 \nmonths. If caseloads were really a concern, Senate Republicans would \nconsent to move forward to confirm Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia, another well-qualified nominee, to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit. Her nomination was also \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee and needs only a final \nup-or-down vote by the Senate. Judge Nguyen is nominated to fill the \njudicial emergency vacancy that remains after the Republican filibuster \nof Goodwin Liu. I hope the Senate will be allowed to take up and \nconfirm her nomination to finally fill that vacancy before the Senate \nconcludes its work for the year.\n  I also hope we can continue to make progress early in the New Year by \nconsidering two nominations to the Ninth Circuit now pending before the \nJudiciary Committee. Earlier this week we held a hearing with Paul \nWatford of California, nominated to fill yet another judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit. I would have included another nominee to \nthe Ninth Circuit at that hearing, Justice Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona, \nwho has the support of Senator Kyl, but committee Republicans were not \nready to proceed on that nomination. I hope both can be considered and \nconfirmed early next year.\n  The Senate should act to address the continuing crisis in judicial \nvacancies that affects not only the Ninth Circuit but Federal courts \naround the country. It is now December 15, with only days left in the \nSenate's 2011 session. There is no time to further delay votes on the \nother 20 judicial nominations now pending on the Senate calendar and \nawaiting a final vote. Sixteen of these nominations, in addition to \nthat of\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nJustice Christen, were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. \nMany were reported last summer and early in the fall. At a time when \nnearly 1 in 10 Federal judgeships remains vacant, further delays are \ndamaging. Judicial vacancies have remained at or above 80 for over 2\\1/\n2\\ years. This hurts the millions of Americans who live in those \ndistricts and circuits and rely on our Federal courts.\n  We should not repeat the mistakes of last year, when the Senate \nRepublican leadership held back its consent at the end of the year to \nconsideration of 19 judicial nominations that had been reported by the \nJudiciary Committee and were ready for final Senate action. That was an \nabusive exercise in unnecessary delay that I believe was without \nprecedent with respect to such consensus nominees. It took us until \nJune of this year, halfway into 2011, to consider and confirm 17 of the \nnominations that could and should have been considered before the end \nof 2010.\n  In contrast, Democratic Senators proceeded to up-or-down votes on all \n100 of President Bush's judicial nominations reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee during his first 2 years in office, and all 100 were \nconfirmed before the end of the 107th Congress.\n  Before we adjourn this year, there is no reason the Senate cannot at \nleast consider the other 16 judicial nominees reported unanimously by \nthe Committee this session, who are by any measure consensus nominees. \nI hope we do not see a repeat of the damaging decision by Senate \nRepublican leadership at the end of last year to refuse to agree to \nvotes on those nominations.\n  With vacancies continuing at harmfully high levels, we cannot afford \nto repeat these unnecessary and damaging delays. There is no reason we \ncannot make significant progress during the days left in this session \nand consider all of the consensus nominations now pending on the Senate \ncalendar. That is what we did at the end of President Reagan's third \nyear in office and President George H.W. Bush's third year in office, \nwhen no judicial nominations were left pending on the Senate Calendar. \nThat is what we did at the end of the 1995 session, President Clinton's \nthird year in office, when only a single nomination was left pending on \nthe Senate calendar. That is, in fact, also what we did at the end of \nPresident George W. Bush's third year. Although nine judicial \nnominations were left on the calendar, they were among the most \ncontroversial, extreme, and ideological of President Bush's nominees. \nThey had previously been debated extensively by the Senate. The \nstandard then was that noncontroversial judicial nominees reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee got Senate action before the end of the year. \nThat is the standard we should follow this year. If we do, another 16 \njudges will be confirmed.\n  Chief Justice Roberts, the Attorney General, and the White House \ncounsel have all spoken about the serious problems created by \npersistent judicial vacancies. More than 160 million Americans live in \ndistricts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled \ntoday if Senate Republicans would just agree to vote on the nominations \nnow pending on the Senate calendar. The Senate should act to bring an \nend to the harm caused by delays in overburdened courts. The Republican \nSenate leadership should consent to votes on the qualified, consensus \ncandidates nominated to fill these judicial vacancies before the Senate \nadjourns for the year. Their consideration should not be unnecessarily \ndelayed until next spring.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again, with the indulgence of my \ncolleagues, if I might, just for a moment, call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the several provisions of the Defense authorization bill we \nare going to consider for final passage today. These provisions will \nhave a major impact on our defense structure and performance in the \nyears to come. These reforms were previously included in a bill I \nintroduced with Senator Lindsey Graham in May, S. 1025, which Senator \nGraham and I nicknamed ``Guard Empowerment II.''\n  As cochair with Senator Graham of the Senate National Guard Caucus, I \nam pleased to report that the most important of these Guard empowerment \nreforms are included in the final version of the Defense authorization \nbill. They include a provision that will make the Chief of the National \nGuard Bureau a statutory member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint \nChiefs--our highest military policy council--has not added a member \nsince 1978--and I remember that because I voted for it--when the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps was finally added as a full participant.\n  This is truly a historic day for the National Guard and for all the \nGuard does for our Nation. One might ask: Why now? Why is this change \nso important? Our Guard has been bravely serving in near constant \nrotation with Active-Duty Forces overseas for the last decade. Each of \nus has gone to Afghanistan or Iraq and seen our Guard serving. At the \nsame time, these Guard troops have been the military's first responders \nat home. The Pentagon hasn't caught up with the institutional changes \nthat have to accompany this. It is a whole different world for the \nNational Guard today than what it was 20 years ago.\n  In fact, after all the National Guard has done over the past 10 \nyears, we are hearing rumors the Air Force is already planning serious \ncuts to its Guard and Reserve components. General Schwartz, Air Force \nChief of Staff, announced:\n\n       We're going to get smaller. Active duty, Guard, and \n     Reserve--we're going to get smaller together.\n\n  I question the logic of an across-the-board cut. I hope most of us \nwould. That is why we have to have a Guard Chief on the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff to provide a vital voice, perhaps a dissenting voice, when it is \nneeded most.\n  When I look at the Vermont Guard, it demonstrates why these kinds of \ncuts don't make sense. The Vermont Guard deployed nearly 1,500 troops \nto Afghanistan last year. Before that, the Vermont Guard deployed to \nIraq during one of its most violent periods and made unspeakable \nsacrifices for this country. I know because I went to the funerals of \nVermont Guard members and because we are such a small State, many times \neverybody knew the person who had died.\n  The Vermont Air Guard flew more than 100 consecutive days of air \nmissions over New York City and Washington after the attacks of \nSeptember 11 around the clock. If we properly man, train, and equip our \nState Guards, our military leaders will find them the peer of any \nActive-Duty unit. In fact, the Vermont Air Guard is one of the first \nthree units to be considered to receive the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. \nAnd not only will the service Chiefs find their reserve components \nready to serve when called, they will find them a lot less expensive.\n  The Defense bill also includes several other provisions of our Guard \nempowerment bill. It reinstates the three-star Vice Chief of the Guard \nBureau, it institutes the recommendations on Federal-State military \nintegration offered by the Council of Governors, it includes a limited \nauthorization of the State Partnership Program, it mandates the \nconsideration of Guard generals for certain vacant positions at U.S. \nNorthern Command, and on and on.\n  I think it is going to lay the groundwork for further collaboration \nbetween the Armed Services Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and \nthe Senate National Guard Caucus. Our National Guard is a superb 21st-\ncentury military organization, but it has been trapped in a 20th-\ncentury Pentagon bureaucracy.\n  These reforms will help clear away the cobwebs.\n  It shows what happens when Democrats and Republicans work together. \nSometimes it is not noted in the press, but a lot gets done around here \nwhen Democrats and Republicans work together. Senator Graham and I \nintroduced a bill in May that has more than 70 cosponsors from both \nparties. We have accomplished a lot for our Guard with this bill, \nagain, by having Democrats and Republicans work together. There is more \nto be done, but what a great start.\n  As I have said about Democrats and Republicans working together, I \nhave to applaud the two Senators from Alaska. Because of their hard \nwork, we have this nominee before us, and that is something every one \nof us should take pride in, the way the two have worked together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, first I want to comment on the work the \nSenator from Vermont has done with regard to the Guard. It affects us \nin Alaska a great deal, and I want to thank him for all of the hard \nwork he has done.\n  In regard to the nomination today, again the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, has done an incredible job bringing \nso many judges to the floor. I come to the floor today in strong \nsupport of the nomination of Morgan Christen to fill a vacancy on the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I have known Morgan for years and am continually impressed with her \nkeen legal mind, her outstanding record of public service, and her \nability to carve plenty of time out of her schedule for her extensive \nvolunteer work.\n  For decades, Morgan has been recognized by her peers as one of the \nfinest attorneys and judges in Alaska. She is currently one of the five \njustices on our State supreme court. I am confident she will continue \nto be a fair and impartial judge as a member of the Ninth Circuit.\n  Justice Christen was born and raised in Washington State and excelled \nat the Golden Gate School of Law where she earned her J.D. in 1986. \nRight after graduating from law school, Morgan came to my State to \nclerk for the Alaska Superior Court. As many people do, once she got a \ntaste of Alaska, she decided to stay and raise her family.\n  Morgan worked for one of the finest law firms in Anchorage and \nquickly became a partner. In 2001, Morgan was appointed to the \nAnchorage Superior Court by my former boss, Gov. Tony Knowles. The \nAnchorage Superior Court is an important one in my State, handling \ncriminal cases, family law, and even civil matters. As she always does, \nMorgan did an excellent job in the court.\n  Before long, she became the presiding judge at Alaska's Third \nJudicial District, the busiest court in Alaska. As a presiding judge, \nshe supervised over 40 judicial officers and 13 court locations.\n  When I was mayor of Anchorage, our city was fighting against youth \ngangs, who were committing serious offenses and pushing up the crime \nrates in our community. Anchorage has an unusual judicial system and \narrangement with the State. The city police provide basic law \nenforcement, but the State of Alaska runs the court and the corrections \nsystem. I worked closely with Judge Christen across municipal and State \nlines to crack down on these gangs and make Anchorage streets safer. I \nfound her to be an energetic innovator who is sensitive to the broad \ncultural diversity of our State. In 2009, she was elevated to the \nhighest court in the State, the Alaska Supreme Court.\n  In addition to Justice Christen's impressive record of public service \non Alaska's State courts, she also finds time to be one of the most \nprolific volunteers in our State. Her volunteer resume is pages long. \nIf there is a volunteer organization in Alaska, more than likely Morgan \nhas probably worked on it, with it, or served on the board. She is a \nmember of the Rotary Club, the YWCA, the Alaska Community Foundation, \nthe Athena Society. She has been on the board of directors of the \nUnited Way of Alaska. She has also been on the board of directors of \nBig Brothers and Big Sisters of Alaska, and the Rasmussen Foundation. \nIn 2004, Morgan and her husband Jim were jointly recognized as \nOutstanding Alaska Philanthropists of the Year--truly an impressive \nhonor.\n  I am proud to support such an outstanding Alaskan to sit on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and I want to urge all of my Senate \ncolleagues to support her nomination as well.\n  Justice Christen has bipartisan support. She received the unanimous \nsupport of every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in September. \nIn Alaska, she was elevated once by a Democratic Governor and once by a \nRepublican Governor. The American Bar Association has recognized her \nlegal capability and rated her as ``unanimously well qualified'' to \nserve as a judge on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Morgan is one of the greatest legal minds and one of the most caring \nindividuals Alaska has to offer. I am honored to support her for this \nposition and honored to count her as a friend. I strongly urge every \nMember of this body to confirm her nomination to the Ninth Circuit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I too rise in support of Morgan \nChristen, the nominee who is before us today, and I add my thanks to \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee and, in fact, the entire \nJudiciary Committee, for their work in advancing not only Judge \nChristen as she has moved forward through the process, but it was \nseveral weeks ago that we were pleased to move through this body the \nnomination of Judge Sharon Gleason.\n  I think it is worthy of note that Alaska in the past month now has \nmoved forward two extraordinary women jurists who will work to serve us \nin an incredible way. If there is any regret I have, it is that such \nexceptional women are being taken from our State judiciary system and \nmoved on to other positions, so there is a loss there. We are going to \nhave to work to fill those back benches. But I am very pleased today to \nspeak in support of Morgan Christen, a justice of the Alaskan Supreme \nCourt who has been nominated to serve on the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court \nof Appeals.\n  This is a historic nomination. Only two Alaskans have had an \nopportunity to serve on the Ninth Circuit, and both of those judges \nwere, somewhat predictably, men. The first Alaskan to serve was Robert \nBoochever, who was appointed by President Clinton. Judge Boochever \naccepted senior status in 1986, and we were saddened when he passed \naway on October 9, 2011, at the age of 94. The second on the Ninth \nCircuit was Andrew J. Kleinfeld, who accepted senior status on June 12 \nof last year. Justice Christen has been nominated to fill the vacancy \ncreated when Justice Kleinfeld took senior status. That vacancy has \nexisted now for 18 months, which should concern all of us, given the \nheavy workload that faces the Ninth Circuit. That said, it often takes \na little bit of time to get the best, and there is no doubt in my mind \nthat when President Obama selected Morgan Christen for the Ninth \nCircuit, he selected the best.\n\n  I have known Justice Christen for almost 25 years now. We graduated \nfrom law school at about the same time. We both clerked for the Alaska \ncourt system at the same time and we have kept in touch over the years. \nI have come to know Morgan, her husband Jim, and her family.\n  Morgan Christen is an experienced, very well-rounded attorney. She is \nan exceptionally well-rounded jurist with experience on the trial and \nthe appellate bench. She is an individual with a keen intellect and an \nimpeccable reputation for integrity. She is highly regarded across the \nideological spectrum in Alaska as a judge who keeps politics and \nideology off the bench.\n  Given the bruising nomination battles that have taken place here in \nthe Senate over the past few years, a few of our colleagues might be \ninclined to challenge the notion that there is any such thing as a \nnonideological, nonpolitical judicial nominee. But in response, I would \nsimply note that Morgan Christen was elected to serve on the Alaska \nSuperior Court by Gov. Tony Knowles, a very well-known Democrat. She \nwas then later selected to serve on the Alaska Supreme Court by Sarah \nPalin, our very well-known Republican Governor. Under Alaska's \nnonpolitical judicial selection process, she was vetted by the Alaska \nJudicial Council before her selection to the superior court in 2001, \nand once again prior to standing for retention election in 2004. \nJustice Christen was then vetted for yet a third time before her \nselection to the Alaska Supreme Court in 2009. In each case, she \nsecured high marks from Alaska's very diverse legal community. In fact, \nshe was ranked the top candidate for the supreme court position in a \nscientifically conducted study of Alaskan attorneys.\n  I have appreciated that Justice Christen has been mindful of the \nseparation of powers throughout her judicial career, and mindful of the \nfact that her personal views have no bearing when it is time to \ndetermine the rule of law. I know we can expect her to continue in that \nvein when she moves on to the Federal bench.\n  Morgan Christen was educated at the University of Washington and \nGolden Gate University School of Law. She\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\nspent portions of her undergraduate years studying in England, \nSwitzerland, and China. Following law school, she clerked on the Alaska \nSuperior Court and then entered private practice in the Anchorage \noffice of Preston Gates & Ellis. As a private practice attorney, she \nrepresented the State of Alaska in the litigation that followed the \n1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.\n  As a member of the superior court bench, she served as the presiding \njudge of the Third Judicial District there in Anchorage which, as was \nnoted, is the busiest judicial district in the State of Alaska. She \nheld that position for 4 years. As a supreme court justice, she is \ndeeply engaged in community outreach. In fact, she won the Alaska \nSupreme Court Community Outreach Award back in 2008. She also holds the \nLight of Hope Award for work on behalf of Alaska's children. I think \nher voluntarism has been acknowledged and highlighted. Not only does \nshe meet the demands of a busy bench practice, but also takes the time, \nwith her family, to be very engaged in our community.\n  I inquired with some of my friends, former colleagues on the Alaska \nbar, about her reputation in anticipation of my comments today. One \nAlaskan stated:\n\n       Morgan is extraordinarily talented and is well respected by \n     her peers. She constantly brings justice and fairness to her \n     professional and personal life. Friends and colleagues across \n     the country have savored her wild raspberry jam.\n\n  I have yet to have the opportunity to savor her wild raspberry jam. I \ndo a pretty mean raspberry jam myself, so I think we are going to have \nto trade and see. But it is yet one more aspect about this pretty \namazing woman I wanted to share today.\n  Another colleague stated, very simply, that she is a calm, \nthoughtful, and strong woman. Good words.\n  In closing, let me simply say that Morgan Christen is more than just \na good judge; she is a good person. Justice will be well served by her \nconfirmation to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this nomination with enthusiasm, as I do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate is expected to confirm \nan additional judicial nominee. With this vote, we will have confirmed \n62 article III nominees during this Congress. More than half of these \nhave been for vacancies designated as judicial emergencies. That is \nreal progress. Over 72 percent of President Obama's judicial nominees \nhave been confirmed.\n  Morgan Christen is nominated to be U.S. circuit judge for the Ninth \nCircuit. Justice Christen received her B.A. from the University of \nWashington in 1983, and her J.D. from Golden Gate University Law School \nin 1986. After graduating from law school, she clerked for the Hon. \nBrian Shortell on the Alaska Superior Court in Anchorage.\n  In 1987 she was hired at Preston Gates & Ellis LLP, working as an \nassociate until 1992. She was a partner in the firm from 1993 to 2002. \nAt that firm she was a general civil litigator, primarily representing \nplaintiffs. She began by assisting with large litigation projects. One \nof her most notable early matters involved serving on the liability \nteam representing the State of Alaska in its claims for compensation \narising from the Exxon Valdez oilspill. After the State settled its \nliability claim in 1991, she defended claims brought by individuals who \nargued the State's response to the spill was inadequate.\n  By the time Justice Christen became a partner in 1993, she had \ndeveloped a practice in Jones Act personal injury claims and was lead \ncounsel in a case in the U.S. Court of Claims representing the parents \nof an infant who died after receiving a childhood vaccination. She also \nserved as lead counsel on four aviation fatality cases between 1993 and \n1999, representing the estate of an FAA employee who was killed in a \nmid-air collision, the estate of a pilot killed during a catastrophic \nengine failure and in-flight failure, among others. She has also served \nas the lead counsel in the Equal Pay Act and represented a fuel barge \nline in several commercial disputes. Finally, from 1999 to 2001 over \nhalf of her practice was devoted to defending two physician practice \ngroups in a Federal Medicaid fraud investigation and related False \nClaims Act case, and assisting with the defense of a class action \nantitrust case brought against purchasers of salmon harvested in \nAlaska.\n  In 2001 she was appointed to the Alaska Superior Court, where she \nserved from January 9, 2002, until her elevation to the supreme court \nin 2009. The superior court is the court of general jurisdiction in \nAlaska. As a superior court judge, her docket was comprised entirely of \ncivil cases. From 2005 to 2009 she served as presiding judge of the \nThird Judicial District of the Superior Court. In this position she \nsupervised approximately 40 judicial officers in 13 court locations.\n  Justice Christen was appointed to the Alaska Supreme Court on March \n4, 2009, and has been a member of that court from April 6, 2009, to the \npresent. She was nominated for that seat by the Alaska Judicial \nCouncil, composed by three members of the bar, three members of the \npublic appointed by Governors, and the chief justice. She was then \nselected from a slate of two nominees by Governor Sarah Palin.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Justice Christen with a unanimous ``well \nqualified'' rating.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \njudgeship?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Republican side, there is 7 minutes 16 \nseconds; on the Democratic side, 3 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to reiterate what I said before \nabout Senator Murkowski and Senator Begich for their support of this \nwoman for the Ninth Circuit. I appreciate the work they have done on \nthis nomination. I also appreciate the personal comments the senior \nSenator from Alaska made, going back to her law school days. I think \nsometimes we forget that these judicial nominees are real people and \nthey have a real life and are a real part of the community. So I \nappreciate that.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time on our side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield back all the time on the \nRepublican side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8628-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8628]\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio).

Mr. President, shortly we will begin debate on the \nconference report of the Defense authorization bill, the 50th year the \nCongress of the United States has authorized the equipment, the \nprograms, and all that is necessary to defend this Nation's security.\n  I want to talk today about a very important aspect of our national \nsecurity, and that is the problem we are having with out-of-control \nspending which has, in its own way, endangered our national security as \nalmost any threat that we face. It is unsustainable, it is \nunacceptable, and it is a stain on our Nation's honor.\n\n  Fifty years ago, on January 17, 1961, Dwight David Eisenhower bid \nfarewell to the Nation as the President of the United States. At the \nheart of his farewell address was a warning, one keenly insightful in \nits sense how, in a way new to the American experience, an immense \nmilitary establishment and large arms industry had developed in the \n20th century post-war period. While acknowledging the need for a strong \nnational defense, President Eisenhower called for the American people \nto understand the grave implications of this new aggregation of \npolitical and industrial power. In particular he warned:\n\n       In the councils of government, we must guard against the \n     acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or \n     unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential \n     for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will \n     persist.\n\n  The 50th anniversary of President Eisenhower's address gives us an \nopportunity to carefully consider have we considered President \nEisenhower's admonition. Regrettably and categorically the answer is \nno. In fact, the\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\nmilitary-industrial complex has become much worse than President \nEisenhower originally envisioned. It has evolved to capture Congress. \nSo the phenomenon should now rightly be called the military-industrial-\ncongressional complex.\n  On July 16, 2009, in a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago, then-\nSecretary Gates described the military-industrial-congressional complex \nin this way:\n\n       First, there is the Congress, which is understandably \n     concerned . . . about protecting jobs in certain states and \n     congressional districts. There is the defense and aerospace \n     industry, which has an obvious financial stake in the \n     survival and growth of these programs. And there is the \n     institutional military itself--within the Pentagon, and as \n     expressed through an influential network of retired generals \n     and admirals. . . .\n\n  One aspect of the military-industrial-congressional complex I have \nfocused on considerably over the last few years is its role in \ncongressional earmarks, congressional pet projects, unwanted by the \nadministration but amounting to billions of dollars annually that \nfrequently take on a life of their own in a way that continues to waste \ntaxpayer resources for years and sometimes decades. In the military-\nindustrial-congressional complex, earmarks are the currency of \ncorruption.\n  Another manifestation of the military-industrial-congressional \ncomplex I have called attention to is the revolving door that exists \nbetween the Pentagon and the defense industry. In 1969, then-Senator \nWilliam Proxmire said this about the revolving door in the context of \ndefense procurement:\n\n       The easy movement of high-ranking military officers into \n     jobs with major defense contractors and the reverse movement \n     of top executives in major defense contractors into high \n     Pentagon jobs is solid evidence of the military-industrial \n     complex in operation. It is a real threat to the public \n     interest because it increases the chances of abuse. . . . How \n     hard a bargain will officers involved in procurement planning \n     or specifications drive when they are one or two years from \n     retirement and have the example to look at over 2,000 fellow \n     officers doing well on the outside after retirement?\n\n  Probably the most recently publicized example of the revolving door \nbetween the Department of Defense and private industry and the \nprevalence of the military-industrial-congressional complex in the \nDepartment's planning and procurement processes is its mentorship \nprogram. In its most recent story in a series exposing this program, \nUSA Today reported that the Air Force allowed a retired general officer \nwho was then serving as an executive in the Boeing Company to \nparticipate as a mentor in a war game involving the aerial refueling \ntanker that Boeing was at the same time competing to build for the Air \nForce under a multibillion dollar procurement program. Over the last 2 \nyears, I have exercised keen oversight of the mentorship program, which \nI understand has been essentially shut down under the weight of newly \npromulgated public disclosure requirements. In other words, former \ngeneral and flag officers serving as Department mentors prefer to exit \nthe program rather than publicly disclose their corporate affiliations \nand compensation.\n  I ask unanimous consent my most recent investigative letter on the \nissue be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. The aspect of the military-industrial-congressional \ncomplex I would like to focus on relates to how the Pentagon buys its \nvery largest weapons systems. That covers the top 100 or so of the \nDefense Department's weapons procurement programs into which taxpayers \nhave invested to date about $1.7 trillion. In particular, I would like \nto focus on how the military-industrial-congressional complex has kept \neven some of the most poorly performing programs funded, siphoning off \nprecious resources even while they go over budget, face years of \nschedule delays, and fail to deliver promised capability to the war \nfighter.\n  To be clear, the military-industrial-congressional complex does not \ncause programs to fail, but it does help create poorly conceived \nprograms, programs that are so fundamentally unsound that they are \ndoomed to be poorly executed. It does help keep them alive long after \nthey should have been ended or restructured.\n  By ``poorly conceived,'' I mean major programs that are allowed to \nbegin, despite having insufficiently defined requirements, unrealistic \ncost or schedule estimates, immature technology or too much \nmanufacturing and integration risk or unrealistic performance \nexpectations.\n  By ``poorly executed,'' I am referring to programs that poorly \nperform because of, among other things, unanticipated design, \nengineering, manufacturing or technology problems. These sorts of \nprograms should never have been started to begin with or should have \nbeen significantly restructured or terminated at the end of the day. \nYet through the influence of the military-industrial-congressional \ncomplex, they are allowed to enter the defense procurement process and \nto persist, often under the guise of a concurrent development \nacquisition strategy and executed under cost-plus contracts.\n  Specifically, the military-industrial-congressional complex helps \nensure that poorly conceived programs get on rails and stay there with \nproduction money when they are supposed to be still in development. For \nindustry and many of their sponsors in the Pentagon and on the Hill, \nthat is desirable because it is far more difficult to restructure or \nterminate a production program, even one that is performing poorly, \nthan one that is in development. In the military-industrial-\ncongressional complex, if excessive concurrency is a drug, then the \ncost-plus contracts used to facilitate it are its delivery vehicles.\n  Over the last decade or so, what I have described has resulted in a \nmassive windfall for industry. But for the taxpayer and the war \nfighter, it has been an absolute recipe for disaster.\n  With the Federal budget deficit having hit $1.3 trillion for the 2011 \nbudget year and facing the fact that the defense budget will likely not \ngrow to any significant extent in the near term, we in Congress must be \nmindful of how the military-industrial-congressional complex can \nnegatively affect decisions to buy and keep major weapons systems.\n  How does the military-industrial-congressional complex help create \nproblem programs and keep them going long after they should have been \ncanceled or restructured? A review of some of the problems with the \noriginal Air Force tanker lease deal is instructive. From that first \nattempt by the Air Force to replace its aging airborne tanker aircraft, \nwhich started nearly a decade ago, we now know, very early in the \nplanning of a major defense acquisition program, senior officials from \nindustry and the relevant services work with senior Members of Congress \nto ensure that the economic and therefore political benefits of the \nprograms would be distributed widely among key congressional States or \ndistricts. That ensures long-term political buy-in and support.\n\n  How much could the military-industrial-congressional complex's \nnegative influence ultimately cost taxpayers? Once again, consider the \noriginal tanker lease deal as just one example.\n  That deal would have had new aerial refueling aircraft developed \nunder a cost-plus contract, which exposes the taxpayer to and protects \nthe contractor from the negative impacts of cost overruns and schedule \ndelays. Once developed, those new tanker aircraft were supposed to be \nleased--leased, not bought outright--from a sole-source contractor, as \nprovided under a multibillion dollar earmark stuck in a defense \nappropriations bill, without having been vetted by the administration \nor reviewed by the relevant congressional oversight committees.\n  That unusual acquisition strategy was based on a case that the Air \nForce presented at that time, which the deal's congressional sponsor \nroundly endorsed, that the legacy fleet of tankers needed to be \nreplaced urgently. Needless to say, that case was proven false. There \ncan be no doubt that the original tanker lease deal was a classic \ncreation of the military-industrial-congressional complex.\n  When we compare the likely costs of the sole-source tanker lease with \nthe costs of the recently concluded tanker competition, which calls for \nfixed-price development and a purchase under full and open competition, \nthe difference is dramatic. According to recent analysis by the \nDepartment of Defense, the original tanker lease deal would have, over \nthe lifecycle of the aircraft, cost\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\ntaxpayers billions of dollars more for a less-capable airplane. Those \nbillions that could have been lost under the original tanker lease deal \nare effectively the cost associated with the military-industrial-\ncongressional complex when it is allowed to run unchecked and \nunchallenged, and they are, particularly in the current fiscal \nenvironment, utterly unsustainable.\n  The lesson of the original tanker lease deal is that the powerful \ncombination of interests that comprise the military-industrial-\ncongressional complex can be strong enough to both give birth to \nprocurement programs that should never have been started in the first \nplace and nurture programs that should have been killed or \nfundamentally restructured early on to the grave detriment of the \ntaxpayer and our service men and women.\n  While over the last couple years former Secretary Gates ended some of \nthe most poorly performing major programs in the defense enterprise, \nthe situation remains serious. The new national military strategy calls \nthe growing national debt a ``significant security risk,'' and as the \nGovernment Accountability Office noted in its March 2011 report, since \n2008, the total acquisition costs of the Pentagon's major defense \nacquisitions programs in its current portfolio has increased by $135 \nbillion, about half of which is attributed to pure cost growth and the \nother half due to cuts in the intended number of weapons we plan to \nbuy.\n  It should not come as a surprise that as a result, about half the \nPentagon's very largest weapons procurement programs exceed cost-\nperformance goals agreed to by the Pentagon, the Office of Management \nand Budget, and the Government Accountability Office. In fact, the \nGovernment Accountability Office's March report found that about one-\nthird of all major weapons systems since 1997 have had cost overruns of \nas much as 50 percent over their original projections.\n  Noting that ``the costs of developing and buying weapons have \nhistorically been, on average, 20 to 30 percent higher'' than Pentagon \nestimates, the Congressional Budget Office recently projected that in \naddition to health care, higher costs for weapons systems will increase \nthe Pentagon budget by about $40 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Congress and current leadership at the Department of Defense have \ntried to attack these problems, but they have not been successful in \nchanging the prevailing culture yet.\n  For example: After several attempts to change the Pentagon's buying \napproach--which, as CBO noted rarely, if ever, correctly predicts how \nmuch a program will likely cost--the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform \nAct of 2009 created the Office of Cost Assessment and Program \nEvaluation to analyze the cost of new programs and why they fail. It \nalso required the Pentagon to keep closer tabs on technology maturity \nand emphasized testing new weapons before they entered production.\n  As a result of that act, some newer major programs are not making the \nmistake of relying on overly optimistic cost estimates provided by the \ncontractor or staking too much production money too early--before \ncritical technologies, design drawings, and manufacturing processes \nhave stabilized and matured. But even this new law will be judged well \nonly if the Pentagon can demonstrate some success with its largest \nacquisition programs, even those that went into development before the \nlaw's enactment.\n  The F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Program is a good example \nof one such program. Last week I spoke at length about this program, so \ntoday I will keep my remarks about it brief. Currently, the F-35 is the \nPentagon's largest weapons procurement program. It was originally \nintended as a revolutionary, affordable solution to the Navy, Marine \nCorps, and Air Force's tactical aviation needs for the future. With \nthree different versions of the aircraft for each service and \ncommonality in design among those versions, the Pentagon sold this \nprogram as a fifth generation strike fighter that would--more so than \nany other major defense procurement program--be cost effectively \ndeveloped, procured, operated, and supported.\n  According to the Pentagon, the program ``was structured from the \nbeginning to be a model of acquisition reform.'' This has not been the \ncase.\n  When the program was first launched, the Pentagon planned to buy over \n3,000 Joint Strike Fighters, but the development effort was performed \nso poorly that we can now only afford to buy 2,457. Given recent delays \nin restructuring rules, that number could go down further. To date, the \ntotal cost to buy all of the aircraft as intended has grown by about \n$150 billion to $385 billion. The cost of each Joint Strike Fighter is \nnow 80 percent over the original baseline estimate, and that is \nexpected to increase. It would be hard to buy a car at 80 percent over \nthe original sticker price without looking for major tradeoffs.\n  Currently, the Joint Strike Fighter costs an average of about $133 \nmillion each, and that is without an engine. We have invested about $56 \nbillion in R costs in this project through fiscal year 2010.\n  Over the nearly 10-year life of the F-35 program, Congress has \nauthorized and appropriated funds for 135 of these aircraft. But as of \ntoday, the program has delivered just 20 flying aircraft with most of \nthem being used for testing. Early production aircraft just started to \nbe delivered a few months ago--3 years late.\n  The main problem with the program has been this: Before the Pentagon \nwent all in on the F-35 program, it never understood the risk \nassociated with developing and integrating the F-35's critical \ntechnologies and manufacturing each version of the plane, much less how \nmuch money and time would be needed to overcome these risks. So ever \nsince the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a contract to develop the \nJoint Strike Fighter contract in 2001, and despite having signed \nseveral follow-on contracts for blocks of production aircraft, the \nprogram has effectively been stuck in development. Experts call what \nthe Pentagon has been trying to do ``concurrent development.'' I call \nit a mess.\n  Using a concurrent development strategy to procure high-risk weapon \nsystems that promise generational leaps in capability when, one, their \nunderlying design is unstable; two, the risks associated with \ndeveloping their critical technologies and integration are not fully \nknown; and, three, their manufacturing processes are immature is a very \nbad idea. Trying to do this under cost-plus contracts is a recipe for \ndisaster.\n  In July 2011, the Department revealed that the cost for the first \nthree lots of early production aircraft amounting to 28 aircraft bought \nunder cost-plus contracts exceeded by about $1 billion the original \nestimate of about $7 billion. The Department also indicated that the \ntaxpayers' share of this overrun amounted to $771 million. The \nprogram's prime contractor would absorb approximately $283 million. By \nthe way, that program's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, declared \nrecord profits of $3 billion last year.\n  Moreover, just a few days ago, the Department indicated the cost of \nthe fourth lot of the early production aircraft bought for the first \ntime in the program's history under a fixed-price-type contract may be \nas high as 10 percent over that contract's $3.46 billion target cost. \nThis is a $350 million overrun with only about 40 percent of that work \ncompleted to date. This suggests the costs of the program have still \nnot been contained despite 2 years of concentrated effort by the \nPentagon to bring costs under control.\n  Just last week the executive officer of the Joint Strike Fighter \nProgram indicated in a media interview that the Joint Strike Fighter \nProgram needs to slow down production and deliveries of the aircraft. \nHe attributed this to the need to open the aircraft and install fixes \nto numerous structural cracks in ``hot spots'' that the program has \ndiscovered in the plane over the last year or so. He estimated the work \nneeded to remedy these cracks could add an additional $3 million to $5 \nmillion per aircraft.\n  From these comments, I understand the overlap between development and \nproduction, called ``concurrency,'' that persists in the program is \nstill too great to assure taxpayers they will not have to continue \npaying for costly redesigns or retrofits due to discoveries late in \nproduction.\n  My frustration--and, more importantly, the taxpayers' frustration--\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\nwith the chronic failure of this program to deliver required combat \ncapability on time and on schedule cannot be overstated. This \nfrustration is conveyed well in a provision in the conference report \naccompanying the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act \nthat would require that the sixth lot of early production aircraft be \nprocured on a firm fixed-price basis. Apparently, the fixed-price \ncontract used for the fourth lot, which provides the overruns between a \n``target cost'' and ``ceiling price'' be shared between the government \nand prime contractor is failing to incentivize the contractor to \ncontrol its costs, so tougher measures are warranted. We should all \nhope they work.\n\n  Another example is the Marine Corps' Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, \nthe EFV. The Marine Corps and General Dynamics originally promised that \nthe EFV was going to be the most advanced and operationally effective \namphibious assault vehicle ever produced. It was originally designed to \nbe an over-the-horizon platform to protect the Navy ships from mines \nand shore-based missiles and maximize our flexibility and the enemy's \ndifficulty in planning a defense.\n  The EFV was intended to be capable of being launched from a ship up \nto 25 miles away from shore and speed to a landing zone at 25 knots. \nOnce ashore, the EFV would then be able to travel at speeds equal to \nthose of the Abrams tank. The Marines were originally supposed to buy \nover 1,000 of these vehicles, which were to be initially operable by \n2010, at a total cost of $7.3 billion. Needless to say, things did not \nturn out that way.\n  Prototypes of the EFV were tested and were about 1,900 pounds too \nheavy and blew past original cost estimates for research and \ndevelopment. Testing also revealed significant problems in terms of \nlimited visibility, excessive noise, breakdowns in the loading system \nof the 30-millimeter gun, and concerns about the hull's vulnerability \nto IED attacks.\n  From its start in 1996 to about 2007, the Marine Corps and General \nDynamics said, ``Don't worry.'' But at the end of the day, the \nprogram's cost rose by 55 percent to over $14 billion, and initial \ncapability was pushed back to 2016. At the start of this year, the cost \nof each EFV was expected to be as much as $23 million, and the \nestimated cost to operate and maintain the vehicle went up with the \nincrease in that price.\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps estimated that the EFV would \nconsume over 90 percent of the Marine Corps' total ground combat \nvehicle budget. Against that backdrop, former Secretary Gates and the \nCommandant called for this program to be terminated. Unfortunately, the \ntaxpayers had invested about $3 billion and the Marine Corps had waited \n15 years for an improved amphibious vehicle that simply became too \ncostly to buy.\n  Another example of a legacy acquisition program in trouble is the V-\n22 Osprey. Inspired by the failure to rescue hostages from Iran in \n1980, the V-22 was originally designed to be a revolution in vertical \ntakeoff aircraft. It was intended to improve, beyond anything currently \nin the arsenal, the ability of the Marine Corps' and our Special \nForces' capability to get in, get out, and resupply from long range at \nhigh speeds in hostile landing zones.\n  What we ended up with has been great expectations and enormous costs. \nSince it was first deployed, the Marine Corps' version of the V-22 has \nhad a mission-capable rate in the middle to high 60-percent range as \ncompared to the latest version of the Army's heavy-lift helicopters, \nthe CH-47s, which had readiness rates in the high eighties to low \nnineties. During its recent deployment in Afghanistan, in fact, the V-\n22's engine saw a service life of just above 200 hours, well short of \nthe 500 to 600 hours that the program's managers originally estimated. \nThat has caused the cost-per-flying hour to more than double to over \n$10,000 an hour as compared to about $4,600 per hour for the much older \nCH-46 it was intended to replace or about $2,600 per hour for a new, \nmodern MH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.\n  When it is not being repaired, the V-22 performs its missions \nimpressively, but the sustainment cost of keeping the V-22 flying is \neating up the Marine Corps' budget and causing aircraft maintainers to \nwork much harder than should be required for a brandnew aircraft. While \nthe V-22 program was supposed to cost just over $39 billion, \nindependent estimates are that it will come in at $56 billion, a 43-\npercent increase.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The price per aircraft has risen by 186 percent from \n$42.8 million to $122.5 million. You will notice this hybrid helicopter \nairplane's unit cost is approaching that of the troubled F-35 priced at \nabout $133 million a copy, as I mentioned earlier. But the budget-\nstrapped Marine Corps may have to afford both of them.\n  Recently, the Marine Corps conceded that over the last 3 years, the \nlifetime cost of operating its V-22 aircraft had increased 64 percent \nto $121.5 billion.\n  I want to talk about military space procurement for a minute. They \nare among the most notorious for chronically performing poorly.\n  The Space-Based Infrared System program is a particularly good \nexample. It has been a problem since its inception in 1996. In fact, 5 \nyears into the program--in 2001--an independent review cited the \nprogram as ``too immature to enter the system design and development \nphase'' and observed that the program was based on faulty and overly \noptimistic assumptions with respect to, among other things, \n``management stability and the level of understanding requirements.''\n  That was 2001, when it was determined that total program costs could \nexceed $2 billion--a 70-percent increase in cost. And, here we are \ntoday, 10 years later, and the system has still not achieved its \nobjectives. In fact, it was just launched, for the first time, \nrecently, on May 7, 2011.\n  Originally estimated to cost $2.4 billion, it is now expected to cost \nnearly $16 billion, roughly 7 times the initial estimate.\n  The Defense Department reported to Congress recently that the next \npair of these satellites built by Lockheed Martin could cost $438 \nmillion more than previously estimated and could be delivered a year \nlate. Many of the space programs are facing these same kinds of \noverruns.\n  In the area of military space procurement, the Air Force's Advanced \nExtremely High Frequency satellite is worth mentioning. This system of \nsatellites is supposed to replenish the existing Milstar system with \nmore robust and secure communication capabilities for strategic and \ntactical warfighters. While the first of six of these was launched in \nAugust 2010, glitches with its thruster delayed the satellite from \nreaching its planned orbit by more than a year and significantly \naffected when the other two satellites will launch. In connection with \nhow the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Space Systems, has performed \non this program, the Air Force penalized Lockheed Martin by reducing \nits award fee under the contract by $15 million.\n  One space acquisition program I have focused on is the Evolved \nExpendable Launch Vehicle Program. Largely because of lack of \ncompetition and the Department's reliance on a sole incumbent provider, \nby some estimates EELV's costs may increase by more than 50 percent \nover the next 5 years.\n  I don't want to overlook the Army. Among all services the Army has \nhad the poorest record of pumping billions of dollars into weapons \nsystems that were never deployed. A recent Army study indicated that \nsince 1995, almost 40 percent of research dollars the Army spent did \nnot result in the procurement of any product. The Army spent at least \n$32 billion on development, testing, and evaluation of 22 weapons \nprograms that were later canceled--almost a third of its budget for \ncreating new weapons. Every year since 1995, the Army has spent $1 \nbillion on doomed programs. Since 2004, canceled Army programs have \nconsumed between $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion. This represents an \naverage of 35 to 45 percent of the Army's annual budget for \ndevelopment, testing, and engineering when factoring in the \ncancellation of the hugely expensive Future Combat Systems Program.\n  This brings us right to the FCS Program. To say that this program was \na spectacular, shameful failure would not do it justice. First \nenvisioned in 1999 by then-Army Chief of Staff GEN Eric Shinseki, FCS \nwas intended to be a revolution in capability--the centerpiece in the \nArmy's effort to transform\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\nitself into a lighter, more modular, and more deployable fighting \nforce. Originally and erroneously executed under a type of contract \nmore fitting for smaller programs, the FCS was supposed to develop 18 \nmanned and unmanned ground systems, including sensors, robots, UAVs, \nand vehicles, all connected by a complicated mobile electronic network. \nWhen work began on this program in 2000, the Army estimated that the \nfirst combat units would be equipped by 2011 and that all the Army's \nground combat formations would be equipped by 2032. The Army initially \nestimated the entire effort would cost about $160 billion.\n  By 2006, independent cost estimators at the Pentagon pegged total \nprocurement costs at upwards of $300 billion. And, from there, with the \nassistance of a fundamentally flawed fee structure that was not focused \non objective results, FCS total costs kept growing. To make a long \nstory short, in April 2009, then-Secretary Gates terminated most of the \nprogram and the problem.\n  While the Army has had its problems, the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship \nis another example of a fundamentally flawed acquisition process. \nOriginally conceived by former Chief of Naval Operations Vern Clark as \na revolutionary, new, affordable class of surface combatant--about the \nsize of a light frigate or Coast Guard cutter--the LCS was to be able \nto conduct shallow-water and near-shore operations.\n  The first two LCS contracts set the cost of the sea frame at $188 \nmillion each. After spiking to over $730 million, the cost is now about \n$400 million per hull. In December of 2010, the Pentagon's chief tester \ngave LCS poor performance ratings, saying that ``LCS is not expected to \nbe survivable in terms of maintaining a mission capability in a hostile \ncombat environment.''\n  I continue to be very troubled by the Navy's decision late last year \nto set aside then-pending competition and award contracts to each of \nthe bidders on this program.\n  The F-22 raptor program. The F-22 was supposed to maintain air \nsuperiority in the face of the Soviet threat during the Cold War. The \nF-22 obtained full operational capability 20 years later, well after \nthe Soviet Union dissolved. When it finally emerged from its extended \ntesting and development phase, the F-22 was recognized as a very \ncapable tactical fighter, probably the best in the world for some time \nto come. But plagued with development and technical issues that caused \nthe costs of buying to go through the roof, not only was the F-22 20 \nyears in the making, but the process has proved so costly that the \nPentagon could ultimately afford only 187 of the planes rather than the \n750 it originally planned to buy. To make a long story short, the F-22 \nhas not flown in combat since its inception.\n  The DDG-1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer was supposed to cost $1.1 \nbillion each. It is now expected to cost $3.5 billion each.\n  The Airborne Laser effort is to be canceled. The fantastic story of \nthe VH-71 new Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program was canceled \nonly after it became more expensive than a full-size 747.\n  What can we do?\n  I know it is time for us to get on with the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  We need to have transparency. We need to have accountability. We have \nto use competition to encourage industry to produce desired outcomes \nand better incentivize the acquisition workforce to do more with less. \nWe have to do a lot of things. We have clearly failed to abide by the \nwarning President Eisenhower issued in his speech 50 years ago, but I \ndo find some comfort that times of fiscal restraint and austerity can \ndrive desired change, even in the face of daunting systemic obstacles \nsuch as the military-industrial-congressional complex. We must do \nbetter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank my friend from Michigan for \nhis indulgence.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2011.\n     Hon. Leon Panetta,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Panetta: I was very troubled to read \n     recently in USA Today that the Air Force allowed a retired \n     general officer who was then-serving as an executive in The \n     Boeing Company to participate as a ``mentor'' in a war game \n     involving the aerial refueling tanker that Boeing was at the \n     same time competing to build for the Air Force under a \n     multibillion dollar procurement program. This, in my view, \n     warrants serious inquiry.\n       According to the article, the retired general officer \n     previously served as the chief of U.S. Transportation Command \n     and Air Force Mobility Command, which would have given him \n     keen insight into the Air Force's plans to replace its aerial \n     refueling tanker fleet. It appears that what this mentor did \n     for the Air Force in this case directly related to one of \n     Boeing's largest potential contracts with the Air Force. This \n     makes the story particularly alarming. No less disturbing is \n     that the Air Force apparently withheld publicly disclosing \n     this information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) \n     request for approximately two years.\n       This latest revelation plainly validates my concerns that I \n     conveyed last year about the potential for conflicts-of-\n     interests associated with military mentor programs. It is \n     also another example of the revolving door between the \n     Department and private industry and the prevalence of the \n     military-industrial complex in the Department's planning and \n     procurement processes, which has plagued the Air Force's \n     attempts to replace its aerial refueling tanker fleet from \n     day-one.\n       Although there appears to be general comfort that the \n     contract for the KC-46A was awarded properly and that the \n     contracting strategy for the development of these tankers is \n     viable, whether any misconduct somehow biased the program at \n     its inception towards a particular outcome must be taken very \n     seriously.\n       With this in mind, please answer the following questions.\n       1. After the individual cited in the article, retired \n     Lieutenant General Charles Robertson, retired from the Air \n     Force, during what period of time did he serve as an advisor, \n     consultant or mentor, or in any other similar capacity, to \n     the Air Force?\n       2.

There will be up to 3 hours of debate equally \ndivided between the leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am pleased to bring to the Senate the conference report on \nH.R. 1540, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012. \nThis conference report, which was signed by all 26 Senate conferees, \ncontains many provisions that are of critical importance to our troops. \nThis will be the 50th consecutive year in which a National Defense \nAuthorization Act has been enacted into law.\n  I thank all of the members and staff of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--and especially our subcommittee chairs and our ranking \nmembers--for the hard work they have done to get us to this stage. \nEvery year we take on tough issues and we work through them on a \nbipartisan basis, consistent with the traditions of our committee. This \nyear was a particularly difficult one because of the severely condensed \ntimeline for floor consideration and conference on the bill.\n  I particularly thank my friend Senator McCain, our ranking minority \nmember, for his strong support throughout the process. I know both of \nus thank the chairman and ranking member of the House Armed Services \nCommittee, Buck McKeon and Adam Smith, for their commitment to this \nbill and to the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  The conference report we bring to the floor today authorizes $662 \nbillion for national defense programs. While it authorizes $27 billion \nless than the President's budget request and $43 billion less than the \namount appropriated for fiscal year 2011, I am confident this \nconference report, nonetheless, provides adequate support for the men \nand women of the Armed Forces and their families and provides them with \nthe means they need to accomplish their missions.\n  This conference report contains many important provisions that will \nimprove the quality of life of our men and women in uniform. It will \nprovide needed support and assistance to our troops on the battlefield. \nIt will make the investments we need to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury, and it will provide for needed reforms in the management of \nthe Department of Defense.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of some of the more significant \nprovisions be printed in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Probably the most discussed provision in the conference \nreport is the provision relative to military detention for foreign al-\nQaida terrorists. This provision was written to be doubly sure there is \nno interference with civilian interrogations and other law enforcement \nactivities and to ensure that the President has the flexibility he \nneeds to use the most appropriate tools in each case. The bill as \npassed in the Senate addressed this issue by including language that: \nNo. 1, left it to the President to adopt procedures to determine who is \na foreign al-Qaida terrorist and therefore subject to presumed military \ndetention; No. 2, required that those procedures not interfere with \nongoing intelligence, surveillance, or interrogations by civilian law \nenforcement; No. 3, left it to the executive branch to determine \nwhether a military detainee who will be tried is tried by a civilian \ncourt or a military court; and No. 4, gave the executive branch broad \nwaiver authority.\n  The conference report retains that language and adds additional \nassurances that there will be no interference with civilian \ninterrogations or other law enforcement activities. In particular, the \nconferees added language that says the following:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \n     existing criminal enforcement and national security \n     authorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any \n     other domestic law enforcement agency with respect to a \n     covered person, regardless of whether such covered person is \n     held in military custody.\n\n  It also modifies the waiver language to give the President, rather \nthan the Secretary of Defense, the authority to waive the requirements \nof the provision.\n  Under the provision in the conference report, law enforcement \nagencies are not restrained in apprehending suspects or conducting any \ninvestigations or interrogations. If a suspect is apprehended and is in \nlaw enforcement custody, the suspect can be investigated and \ninterrogated in accordance with existing procedures. If and when a \ndetermination is made that a suspect is a foreign al-Qaida terrorist, \nthat person would be slated for transfer to military custody under \nrules written by the executive branch. Again, however, any ongoing \ninterrogations are not to be interrupted, and the President also has a \nwaiver authority. If the suspect is transferred to military custody, \nall existing law enforcement and national security tools remain \navailable to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, and even if \nthe suspect is held in military custody, it would be up to the Attorney \nGeneral, after consulting with the Secretary of Defense and the \nDirector of National Intelligence, to determine whether the suspect \nwill be tried in Federal court or before a military commission. The \nbill provides the Attorney General with broad discretion to ensure that \nwhatever consultation is conducted does not impede operational \njudgments that may need to be made to pursue investigative leads, \neffect arrests or file charges.\n\n  The language in the Senate bill and in the conference report is \nintended to preserve the operational flexibility of law enforcement and \nnational security professionals in the executive branch. Nothing in the \nlanguage limits the President as to when he can waive the provision or \nfor whom he can waive it.\n  For example, he is not required to wait for a coverage determination \nto be made before deciding to waive the requirements of the provision. \nSimilarly, he is not precluded from waiving the provision with regard \nto more than one individual at a time--for example, with regard to a \ngroup of conspirators or potential codefendants.\n  In short, the waiver language in the conference report is broad \nenough to reflect circumstances in which it is in the national security \ninterests of the United States for a President to waive the \nrequirements of the provision with respect to a category of covered \npersons, if he so determines, in order to preserve the flexibility of \ncounterterrorism professionals and operators to take expeditious \naction.\n  With the exception of those assurances, the detainee provisions in \nthe conference report are largely unchanged from the provisions in the \nbill that was approved by the Senate on a 93-to-7 vote just 2 weeks \nago. Those who say we have written into law a new authority to detain \nAmerican citizens until the end of hostilities are wrong. Neither the \nSenate bill nor the conference report establishes new authority to \ndetain American citizens--or anybody else.\n  The issue of indefinite detention arises from the capture of an enemy \ncombatant at war. According to the law of war, an enemy combatant may \nbe held until the end of hostilities. Can an American citizen be held \nas an enemy combatant? According to the law of war, an enemy combatant \nmay be held until the end of hostilities. But, again, can an American \ncitizen be held as an enemy combatant? I believe that if an American \ncitizen joins a foreign army or a hostile force such as al-Qaida that \nhas declared war and organized a war against us and attacks us, that \nperson can be captured and detained as an enemy combatant under the law \nof war.\n  In 2004, the Supreme Court held in the Hamdi case that ``there is no \nbar to this Nation's holding one of its own citizens as an enemy \ncombatant.''\n  The Court cited with approval its holding in the Quirin case, in \nwhich an earlier court held that ``citizens who associate themselves \nwith the military arm of the enemy government, and with its aid, \nguidance and direction enter this country bent on hostile acts, are \nenemy belligerents within the meaning of . . . the law of war.''\n  But despite that view of mine, which I clearly expressed on the \nSenate floor a couple weeks ago, neither the Senate bill nor the \nconference report takes a position on this issue. Both the Senate bill \nand the conference report include\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\nthe language of the Feinstein amendment, which we drafted together and \npassed 99 to 1. That amendment leaves this issue to the executive \nbranch and the courts by providing the following:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     existing law or authorities relating to the detention of \n     United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United \n     States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in \n     the United States.\n\n  The more difficult issue for me--and I believe it goes to the heart \nof the concern of the detention policy--is the kind of war we are in \nwith al-Qaida, and that issue is when does the detention end? In other \nwords, when are the hostilities over? In this kind of nontraditional \nwar, we are not likely to sign a peace treaty or receive a formal \nsurrender or even reach an agreement on a cease-fire.\n  Under these circumstances, it is appropriate for us to provide \ngreater procedural rights to enemy detainees than we might in a more \ntraditional war. We have done so in this conference report. The \nconference report, for instance, requires periodic reviews of detainee \ncases in accordance with an executive order issued earlier this year to \ndetermine whether detainees pose a continuing threat or safely can be \nreleased. Under the conference report, enemy combatants who will be \nheld in long-term military detention are told, for the first time, they \nwill get a military judge and a military lawyer for their status \ndetermination.\n  The conference report includes many other important provisions.\n  It includes new sanctions against the financial sector of Iran, \nincluding the Central Bank of Iran. These sanctions would, among other \nactions, require foreign financial institutions to choose between \nmaintaining ties with the U.S. financial system or doing business with \nthe Central Bank of Iran.\n  It includes provisions addressing the problem of counterfeit parts \nthat can undermine the performance of military weapons systems and \nendanger our men and women in uniform. This is one of the most \nimportant additional provisions we have in our bill; that is, the \nprovisions relative to these counterfeit parts that are flooding our \ndefense system with electronic parts that are counterfeited and come \nmainly from China. We were able to identify approximately 1,800 cases \nof suspect counterfeit electronic parts, covering more than 1 million \nindividual parts, with most of them, again, coming from China. This \nconference report includes comprehensive reforms to keep counterfeit \nelectronic parts out of the defense supply chain and provides proper \naccountability when suspect parts make it through that chain.\n  In particular, the conference report relative to this subject does \nthe following:\n  It clarifies acquisition rules to ensure that the cost of replacement \nand rework that is required by the use of suspect counterfeit parts is \npaid by the contractor, not by the taxpayer.\n  It requires the Department of Defense and Department of Defense \nsuppliers to purchase electronic parts from manufacturers and their \nauthorized dealers or from trusted, certified suppliers.\n  It requires Department of Defense officials and Department of Defense \ncontractors that become aware of counterfeit parts in the supply chain \nto provide written notification to the government.\n  It requires the Department of Defense and its largest contractors to \nestablish systems and procedures to detect and avoid counterfeit parts.\n\n  It requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult with the \nSecretary of Defense on the sources of counterfeit electronic parts in \nthe military supply chain and establish a risk-based program of \nenhanced inspection of imported electronic parts.\n  It authorizes Customs to share information from electronic parts \ninspected at the border with manufacturers to help determine whether \nthe parts are counterfeit.\n  It strengthens criminal penalties for counterfeiting military goods \nor services.\n  We are very grateful for the support of Members of this body for that \nprovision.\n  Relative to the strengthening of criminal penalties, I wish to add \nour thanks to Senator Whitehouse for his work on this subject, for his \nprovisions relative to additional criminal penalties for counterfeiting \nmilitary goods that are a part of this bill, and they are a very \nimportant part.\n  The conference report requires sound planning--this is another \nprovision of this bill--and justification before we spend more money on \ntroop realignment from Okinawa to Guam and on tour normalization in \nKorea. Those provisions follow detailed oversight that Senators Webb, \nMcCain, and I have conducted.\n  On some other provisions: The conference report requires that the \nnext lot of F-35 aircraft--lot 6--and all subsequent aircraft, be \npurchased under fixed-price contracts, with the contractor assuming \nfull responsibility for any costs above the target cost specified in \nthe contract.\n  Our conference report fences 75 percent of the money available for \nthe Medium Extended Air Defense System--MEADS--until the Secretary of \nDefense submits a detailed plan to use those funds to close out the \nprogram or pay contract termination costs.\n  The conference report includes Senator Landrieu's bill to extend the \nSmall Business Innovative Research--SBIR--Program for an additional 6 \nyears. It has been about 6 years since we reauthorized this vitally \nimportant program, which provides a huge benefit to our small \nbusinesses so they can effectively participate in research programs \nthat are funded by the Federal Government. In the defense arena, SBIR \nhas successfully invested in innovative research and technologies that \nhave contributed significantly to the expansion of the defense \nindustrial base and the development of new military capabilities.\n  As to Pakistan, the conference report limits to 40 percent the amount \nof the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund that can be obligated \nuntil the Secretary of Defense provides Congress with a strategy on the \nuse of the fund and on enhancing Pakistan's efforts to counter the \nthreat of improvised explosive devices, those IEDs which kill so many \nof our troops and so many civilians.\n  Finally, the Department of Defense has informed us it does not need \nan exemption from section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security \nAct of 2007 because that section does not apply to purchases at market \nprices from generally available fuel supplies and does not preclude the \nDepartment from purchasing any fuel it needs or expects to purchase in \nthe foreseeable future.\n  We are in the final stages of withdrawing our combat troops from \nIraq, but we continue to have almost 100,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines on the ground in Afghanistan. While there are \nissues on which we may disagree, we all know we must provide our troops \nthe support they need as long as they remain in harm's way. The \nenactment of this conference report will improve the quality of life \nfor our men and women in uniform. It will give them the tools they need \nto remain the most effective fighting force in the world. Most \nimportant of all, it will send an important message that we as a nation \nstand behind our troops and we deeply appreciate their service.\n  In conclusion, I would, once again, thank Senator McCain, all our \nMembers, and our majority and minority staff, led by Rick DeBobes and \nDave Morriss, for their hard work on this bill. We could not have done \nthis without them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a full list of our majority and minority \nstaff, who gave so much of themselves and their families, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Senate Armed Services Committee Staff\n\n       Richard D.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I fully support the conference report \nand the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2012. This \nis the 50th year the Congress will pass this, and I am now confident \nthis bill will be signed into law by the President of the United \nStates.\n  It is an important piece of legislation. I appreciate the \nparticipation of all Members, as we went through this bill in a \nrelatively short period of time. There certainly was a lot of \nparticipation by almost every Member.\n  I am most appreciative, of course, of Senator Levin, whom I have had \nthe honor of serving with for many years. Quite often we have spirited \ndiscussions on various issues, but my admiration and appreciation for \nhis leadership is very large. He is a man of incredible patience--a \nquality some accuse me of lacking, I think correctly.\n  Senator Levin and his staff and our staff work very closely together \nthroughout the year as we bring forth this Defense authorization bill. \nObviously this bill provides for defense policy guidance and funding \nthat is vital to our national security, provides the clearest \nindication to our men and women in uniform that the Congress cares \nabout them and their families.\n  In testament to the importance of this legislation, as I mentioned, \nwe have passed a defense authorization bill every year since 1961.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the hard work that went into this \nbill. The bill is a product of 11 months of legislative effort in the \nSenate, 71 hearings and meetings on the full range of national security \npriorities. We reported our bill out of the committee with a 26-to-0 \nvote. We debated nearly 40 hours, disposed of 139 amendments, and the \nbill was overwhelmingly passed 93 to 7. After Senate passage on \nDecember 1, our staffs have worked around the clock for 9 days to put \nthis together.\n  As Senator Levin mentioned, it authorizes $662.4 billion for national \ndefense, which is $26.6 billion less than the President's request. It \nauthorizes $530 billion for the base budget for the Department of \nDefense, and it goes on. We authorize a 6-percent increase in funding \nover last year's request for our special operations forces, who play a \nlead role in counterterrorism operations. We authorize over $2.4 \nbillion to counter improvised explosive device activities. The IEDs \nstill plague the men and women who are serving in Afghanistan.\n  Let me also mention some noteworthy provisions in this legislation.\n  The conference report includes strong, unambiguous language that \nrecognizes that the war on terror extends to us at home and that we \nmust address it as such. The language the Senate adopted regarding \ndetainees recognizes both that we must treat enemy combatants who seek \nto do us harm as such and that we must be able to gain as much \ninformation from such individuals as possible regarding their plans to \nwage war against our citizens--I want to emphasize--without violating \nthe rules of war, without violating the Geneva Conventions, without \nengaging in torture or waterboarding or any of the kinds of techniques \nthat have stained America's honor in the 21st century.\n  I strongly believe the detainee provisions in the bill are \nconstitutional and in no way infringe upon the rights of law-abiding \nAmericans. Unfortunately, rarely in my time have I seen legislation so \nconsistently misunderstood and misrepresented as these detainee \nprovisions. The hyperbole used by both the left and the right regarding \nthis language is false and misleading.\n  Let me be clear. The language in this bill will not affect any \nAmericans engaging in the pursuits of their constitutional rights. The \nlanguage does recognize that those people who seek to wage war against \nthe United States will be stopped, and we will use all ethical, moral, \nand legal methods to do so.\n  I am very pleased that the administration has finally recognized that \nthe language we have adopted merits the President's signature and will \nsoon be signed into law. While we have made some technical changes to \nthe detainee provisions, they remain substantially the same as passed \nby the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  The Congress, in strong bipartisan majorities, especially in the \nCommittee on Armed Services, is deeply concerned by the \nadministration's flawed handling of detainees in the fight against \nterrorism.\n  It was Congress that took up this vital national security issue and \ndrafted all the versions of these provisions and led the negotiations \non all of the major compromises. Yes, we listened to the \nadministration's concerns, as we should, and we took many of them into \naccount. Unfortunately, the administration has fought these provisions \nevery step of the way. They tried to have these provisions stripped \nfrom the Senate bill as a condition for bringing it to the floor for \ndebate. When that did not work, they tried to have these provisions \ndropped from the bill through amendments on the floor. When that did \nnot work, they urged the conferees to drop these provisions in \nconference or at least water them down into nothingness. Again and \nagain, the administration failed. So for them now to try to claim \ncredit for these provisions flies in the face of the historical record. \nFacts are stubborn, and when it comes to these detainee provisions, the \nfact is this: Congress has led and defined the debate, and the \nadministration has finally conceded to that reality.\n  Let's establish once again what these detainee provisions do and do \nnot do.\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\n  They would, among other things, reaffirm the military's existing \nauthority to detain individuals captured in the course of hostilities \nconducted pursuant to the authorization of the use of military force.\n  The ``authority to detain provision'' in the conference report \nconfirms that nothing in this section of the bill should be ``construed \nto affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of \nUnited States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or \nany other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.'' \nThere could be nothing clearer than that statement.\n  This confirmation of the intent of the bill was inserted as a result \nof floor debate and negotiations with the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, to make absolutely clear what Chairman Levin and I and \nmembers of the committee who have supported this legislation have said \nthroughout--that this provision does not and is not intended to change \nthe existing state of the law with regard to detention of U.S. \ncitizens. This section simply restates the authority to detain what has \nalready been upheld by the Federal courts. We are not expanding or \nlimiting the authority to detain as established by the 2001 \nauthorization for the use of military force.\n  The conference report also includes a provision requiring military \ndetention for foreign al-Qaida terrorists who attack the United \nStates--something this administration has been not only hesitant but \ncompletely unwilling to even consider until this legislation \nhighlighted the inconsistency between claiming the authority to kill an \nal-Qaida member with drones overseas but not being willing to hold a \ncaptured al-Qaida member in military custody in the United States, even \nin a situation where the al-Qaida terrorist had penetrated our defenses \nand had carried out or attempted an attack inside the United States.\n  The authority to hold al-Qaida members in military custody, while \ncompletely consistent with the law of war that applies to enemy \ncombatants, is not a straitjacket but is as flexible as the President \ndesires to make it.\n  While we in Congress have given the President a statutory authority \nto use military custody for al-Qaida members as a tool to ensure that \nwe are able to obtain timely, actionable intelligence, the President \ncan exercise a broad national security waiver to this requirement--a \nbroad national security waiver. Most important, this provision \nrequiring military detention explicitly excludes U.S. citizens and \nlawful resident aliens.\n  The military custody provision in the final compromise authorizes the \ntransfer of any detainee to civilian custody for trial in civilian \ncourt and leaves it up to the President to establish procedures for \ndetermining how and when persons determined to be subject to military \ncustody would be transferred. The provision adopted in the conference \nreport requires that such determination must not interfere with ongoing \nintelligence, surveillance, or interrogation operations.\n  All of this flexibility was added to the bill even before we began \nnegotiations with the White House to make it clear that the intent of \nthe Senate's provisions was not to tie the administration's hands but \nto give them additional means to defeat the most serious type of threat \nfrom al-Qaida to our country. The result of these Senate modifications \nto the original form of the provisions ensures that the executive \nbranch has complete flexibility in how it first determines and then how \nit applies military custody for al-Qaida members who are captured after \nhaving attacked the United States or while planning or attempting such \nan attack.\n  Moreover, after meeting with FBI Director Robert Mueller, the Senate \nconferees added language in conference in response to his concerns \nabout the impact on FBI operations confirming that nothing in this \nprovision may be ``construed to affect the existing criminal \nenforcement and national security authorities of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, or any other domestic law enforcement agency, with \nregard to a covered person, regardless whether such covered person is \nheld in military custody.''\n  It is the intent of the Senate conferees, in agreement with House \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis, that the FBI continue to execute the \nfull range of its investigative and counterterrorism responsibilities \nand that any shift to military custody will be an administrative \nmeasure that does not limit in any way the FBI's authority.\n  I acknowledge that these issues were very controversial with some \nMembers. These provisions were debated extensively--as thoroughly as \nany matter I have seen in recent memory--but I believe we have \naddressed in a positive way and have been responsive to concerns raised \nby the administration. Indeed, the Senate made changes both on the \nfloor and during conference to ensure that the intent of the provisions \nwas fully understood by the administration and others even before \nnegotiations over the final form of the text began.\n  In many ways, as Chairman Levin has pointed out in many of his public \nstatements and speeches on these detainee provisions, rarely has such \nmisinformation, speculation, and outright misrepresentation been \ngreater over what a bill actually does compared to what some from the \nleft and right claim it does than has been the case with these detainee \nprovisions. Whether 2012 campaign politics played a role in the \ncharacterization of these provisions or whether this was simply a case \nof not fully understanding the intent of the authors of these \nprovisions I will leave to others to decide.\n  I point out again that I think my friend from Michigan Senator Levin \ndisplayed a great deal of courage in formulating what he thought was \nbest for our Nation's security.\n  Regardless of the motivation that may have colored the debate until \nnow, I believe that, by any responsible reading, these provisions will \nnot impair the flexibility of the President or national security \nofficials in protecting the United States and its citizens. The \nmilitary custody provision, which has been the focus of much of this \ndebate, provides flexibility to use either a civilian track or a \nmilitary track for custody and eventual trial and leaves the details of \nimplementation in the hands of the executive branch, as it is \nappropriate to do so. It preserves the current state of the law as it \napplies to the rights of U.S. citizens and lawful resident aliens.\n  In terms of FBI authority to conduct investigations and \ninterrogations, as well as use other instruments of the investigative \nand criminal process, these provisions preserve all of the FBI's role \nand authority under existing law.\n  The conference report also includes, virtually unchanged, the Senate \nprovision requiring a plan to normalize U.S. defense cooperation with \nGeorgia and the sale of defensive weapons. U.S. defense cooperation \nwith the Republic of Georgia has been stalled ever since Russia invaded \nthat country 3 years ago. While there has been slow and minor progress \nto enable Georgia's armed forces to deploy to Afghanistan--which they \nhave done in greater numbers than most of our NATO allies--precious \nlittle has been done to strengthen Georgia's ability to defend its \ngovernment, people, and territory.\n  This provision would require the Secretary of Defense, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to develop a plan for the \nnormalization of our defense cooperation with Georgia, especially the \nreestablishment of U.S. sales of defensive weapons. It puts the \nCongress on record as demanding a more normal U.S. defense relationship \nwith Georgia, particularly on defensive arms sales.\n  The conference report includes a strong and important provision to \nsanction the Central Bank of Iran, to curtail Iran's ability to buy and \nsell petroleum through its Central Bank, and to prevent foreign \nfinancial institutions that deal with the Central Bank of Iran from \ncontinuing their access to the U.S. financial system. This provision, \nwhich was adopted on the Senate floor by a vote of 100 to 0, and the \nattempted assassination of the Saudi Ambassador here in Washington, DC, \nhad a very positive and forceful effect on this bill being enacted by \nthe Senate. This provision would force foreign financial institutions \nto make an important choice: Do they want to deal with the U.S. economy \nor with Iran's Central Bank?\n  The Treasury Department urged the conferees to make a series of \nchanges to this provision, some of which would have narrowed its scope \nand weakened\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\nit. We rejected that course of action. We made some minor technical \nchanges but kept the provision as the authors, Senators Menendez and \nKirk, intended. The conferees did, however, provide the Treasury \nDepartment the ability to more effectively implement this legislation \nby imposing strict conditions on foreign financial institutions that \nmaintain ties to the Central Bank of Iran.\n  The conference report directs the Secretary of Defense to pause \nfurther spending on Guam in support of the relocation of 8,500 U.S. \nmarines from Okinawa until Congress and the administration have had an \nopportunity to review and assess the impact of an estimated $20 billion \nspending initiative on Guam in the context of the full range of our \nnational interests in the Pacific region. This pause will allow \nCongress to ensure that the taxpayer funds invested in overseas \nmilitary force posture and basing will afford us the best opportunity \nto continue our strong alliances in the region, while pursuing new \narrangements with emerging partners that support security and economic \ndevelopment.\n  The final agreed-upon provision includes a requirement for an \nindependent study to offer views and suggestions from a range of \nregional experts on current and emerging U.S. national security \ninterests in the Pacific and options for the realignment of U.S. \nmilitary forces in the region. The conference report would restrict the \nuse of $33 million in operation and maintenance funds for items on Guam \nthat do not directly support military requirements, such as civilian \nschoolbuses, the construction of museums, and mental health facilities.\n  This provision should not be interpreted as a lack of U.S. commitment \nto realignment. The President has stated that we are shifting a lot of \nour attention to the Pacific region, and we understand the importance \nof the Pacific region in the 21st century.\n  Finally, the conference report includes a provision to require that \nthe contract for the sixth slot of ``low-rate initial production'' for \nthe Joint Strike Fighter be executed on a firm fixed-price basis. The \nPentagon has thus far failed to incentivize the prime contractor to \ncontrol costs. So a tougher measure, as embodied in the report, is \nwarranted.\n\n  While I would have preferred the original Senate position that would \nhave made the fixed-price requirement apply to the fifth lot currently \nbeing negotiated, I strongly support this provision. The chairman and I \nare committed to a close monitoring of this weapons system. We \nunderstand its importance. We also understand that the kinds of cost \noverruns that have characterized this system cannot be continued.\n  I am gratified that there are no earmarks in this bill. \nUnfortunately, it still contains over $1.4 billion in spending that was \nnever requested by the President or by our military and civilian \nleaders in the Pentagon. Examples of funding authorized by this \nconference report include $255 million for additional M-1 tank upgrades \nthe Army didn't want in order to keep the M-1 production line hot \ndespite no compelling need to upgrade more tanks at this time; $325 \nmillion for Army National Guard and Reserve equipment not requested by \nthe Army; $8.5 million for an Air Force R program called the Metals \nAffordability Initiative that the Air Force didn't consider a high \nenough priority to fund; $30 million for an industrial base innovation \nfund that the Pentagon didn't ask for; $200 million for the Rapid \nInnovation Program--created by Congress in last year's Defense \nauthorization bill--that the Pentagon never asked for and which has \nabout $439 million in funds left over from last year it hasn't figured \nout how to spend.\n  The bottom line is this: Congress will pump over $1.4 billion into \nthings the Pentagon never requested and didn't think were a priority. \nThe American taxpayers are not fooled by this exercise, and they have \nlong ago lost patience with it. For all the many good things this \nconference report did, we still fell short of providing only the most \nessential needs and priorities of the Department of Defense as \nidentified by our civilian and military leaders. A total of $1.4 \nbillion is real money and could make an enormous difference to many \nAmericans if properly applied to real priorities.\n  Those criticisms aside, as we look forward to the holidays ahead, I \nwant all Senators to think about whom this report is really for--the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces, who have served our Nation so \nbravely and so selflessly during the past 10 years of war. We owe it to \nthem to pass this bill to demonstrate our support for them and the \nburden they carry for all of us and to show in a concrete way that the \nAmerican people and the Congress stand with them and appreciate what \nthey do for us. Passing this bill is really the very least we can do \nfor so many who are willing to give all they have to defend us and our \ngreat country.\n  Finally, I thank Chairman Levin and Chairman McKeon and Ranking \nMember Smith for their dedication and cooperation in getting through \nthe conference in a rapid but comprehensive and collegial manner. It is \nan honor to work with Senator Levin on such an important cause for the \nAmerican people and for our men and women serving around the world in \nthe Department of Defense, who risk their lives for us every day. They \ndeserve positive action and your vote on this conference report.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the conference report of the fiscal \nyear 2012 national defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I spoke at some length before, but I want \nto repeat one sentiment in the statement that has to do with Senator \nMcCain and his staff. The way in which he and our staff work together \nis in the finest tradition of this body. Our committee has had that \nreputation. It is a well-earned, well-deserved reputation that we are \nable to work on a bipartisan basis.\n  Senator McCain continues in a great tradition on the Republican side, \nand I would hope I strive at least to do the same on our side. We have \nhad some great leaders of our committee over the decades, and Senator \nMcCain is one of those leaders in that tradition, and I want to say \nwhat a great pleasure it is to work with him.\n  I know our staffs work beautifully together, and we are grateful for \nthat. The Senator was right in pointing out who we are doing this for--\nit is the men and women in uniform--but we couldn't do that without our \ngreat staffs, and I know he joins me, and has already in his statement, \nin a tribute to our staffs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I say to my friend from Michigan, I \nguess in our many years together we have seen the ups and downs and \nback and forth, but during our more than a quarter of a century of \nservice we have always seen the bill coming to fruition and we have \ncarried on in that tradition.\n  I wish also to point out to my colleagues, in a rather drab and \ndreary landscape of gridlock and acrimony, it is kind of nice to show \nthat every once in a while there is a little ray of sunshine. So I hope \nwe have been able to provide it for our colleagues, and I look forward \nto a unanimous, if not near unanimous, vote on the part of this body.\n  I hope if there are other colleagues who wish to come and speak on \nthe bill--I know we have planned a colloquy on a provision of the bill \nconcerning depots--so, hopefully, our colleagues who are very concerned \nabout that issue might want to arrange to come to the floor so we can \ndispose of that.\n  I don't know of any other except, I think, Senator Udall, who wishes \nto come.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think one on our side.\n  While we are talking about rays of lightness, we thank Senator Hagan, \nour Presiding Officer, who is a member of our committee. She provides a \nray of light--one of the many rays of light on our committee. I see her \npresiding and smiling over this effort, and I wanted to acknowledge \nthat she is an important part of it and to recognize her contribution \nas well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I happen to know for a fact that Senator Hagan is a \nstrong defender of the men and women who serve her State, which has a \nvery large military presence. I know they are very appreciative of her \nadvocacy and service.\n  Before we get too hokey around here, maybe we should suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              SECTION 1022\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, section 1022(d) of the conference report \nstates that ``nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \nexisting criminal enforcement and national security authorities of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation or any other domestic law enforcement \nagency with regard to a covered person, regardless whether such covered \nperson is held in military custody.'' Would the Senator agree with me \nthat this language is intended to ensure that the provision does not \ninterfere with ongoing civilian interrogations and other law \nenforcement activities and that the President has the flexibility he \nneeds to decide on the most appropriate law enforcement and \nintelligence tools for each individual case?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. That was the intention of the provision we wrote in \ncommittee, and it has been clarified by the addition of subsection (d). \nThe statement of managers specifically states that the law enforcement \nand national security tools that are not affected by the provision \ninclude, but are not limited to, grand jury subpoenas, national \nsecurity letters, and actions pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Section 1022 applies only to a person who is ``a member \nof, or part of, al-Qaeda or an associated force that acts in \ncoordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda.'' The \nstatement of managers states that this language intentionally excluded \nthe Taliban. Would the Senator agree with me that the requirements of \nsection 1022--including the transfer restrictions applicable under that \nprovision--do not apply to individuals detained by our forces in \nAfghanistan?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. Our forces in Afghanistan can continue to transfer \ndetainees to the host nation in accordance with existing agreements. \nThis provision does not apply to battlefield transfers in--Afghanistan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, there \nis a bit of interesting news today. When the demonstrations began in \nMoscow, I tweeted--I am a big believer in tweets--and said, ``Dear \nVlad, the Arab Spring is coming to a neighborhood near you.''\n  Apparently, Mr. Putin was not amused, because an Associated Press \nheadline read: ``Putin rejects any redo of fraud-tainted vote.'' The \narticle also mentioned he was apparently on a program where he answered \nsome questions. To quote the article:\n\n       The harsh comments and his insistence that the December 4 \n     election was valid will likely fuel anger and may draw even \n     bigger crowds of protest later this month.\n       Putin also lashed out at U.S. Senator John McCain, who had \n     goaded him with a Twitter post saying ``the Arab Spring is \n     coming to a neighborhood near you.''\n\n  Quoting Putin now, the article continues:\n\n       ``He has the blood of peaceful civilians on his hands, and \n     he can't live without the kind of disgusting, repulsive \n     scenes like the killing of Gadhafi,'' Putin said, referring \n     to McCain's role as a combat pilot and prisoner of war in \n     Vietnam.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       ``Mr. McCain was captured and they kept him not just in \n     prison, but in a pit for several years,'' he said. ``Anyone \n     (in his place) would go nuts.''\n\n  I know my friend from Michigan may think there is some veracity to \nthe last sentence from Putin's comments, but I would mention that, in \nthe context of the National Defense bill, in my view, the reset with \nRussia has not gone as we had hoped and it is an argument for some \nmissile defense provisions in this bill in particular.\n  I think the reason why Mr. Putin reacted in the way he did is that I \nbelieve he has been shaken, as he should have been, by the massive \ndemonstrations that have taken place in Moscow and other cities in \nRussia. It will be very interesting on December 24 to see how large or \nwhether there will be demonstrations concerning a government that in \nmany ways has turned into a cryptocracy, and the abuse of human rights, \nincluding the case of Mr. Magnitsky, who died in prison; and Mr. \nKhodorkovsky, who was again sentenced to more time in prison, and what \nMr. Khodorkovsky and others have described as a death sentence.\n  These are very interesting times in which we live, and the world is a \nvery interesting place. I think it argues for the United States of \nAmerica to maintain its defenses, as we have in the consideration of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I had not seen those remarks of Mr. \nPutin, but referring to his last comment, read by Senator McCain, I \nguess people would go nuts in the setting Senator McCain found himself \nin the Vietnam war. He probably is perhaps, only in that line, accurate \nthat most people, indeed, could not have survived that experience. I \nknow Senator McCain does not raise this matter, but those of us who \nwork with him appreciate all he has done for this country and for this \nbody. I wish we had a chance to straighten out Mr. Putin about Senator \nMcCain. I don't think we will have that opportunity, but maybe his own \npeople will do so in a free election someday.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time in \nthe quorum call be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Depot Provisions\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be recognized for up to 4 minutes each to address \nthe depot provisions in the bill, and at the end of their remarks \nSenator McCain and I be recognized to address the same issue. This was \nthe order we were given. They may want to change it: Senator Sessions, \nSenator Chambliss, Senator Inhofe, Senator Shaheen, Senator Ayotte, and \nSenator Hagan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman of the \ncommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to have this colloquy because \nsomething has happened that shouldn't have happened. It happened over \non the House side, and we had no control over it.\n  While I support and will vote for the fiscal year 2012 Defense \nauthorization bill, this is the third year in a row we have bypassed \nthe formal conference process. I am pleased we finished the bill, but \nthis broken process allows for abuse, and we have certainly had some \nabuse that I will allude to here. If the proper procedure had been \nfollowed, some of these problems would not have happened.\n  On December 3, the House Armed Services Committee staff inserted new \nlanguage into the conference that would impact how DOD maintains its \nships, maintains its aircraft, maintains its ground vehicles--private \nand public--impacting thousands of jobs in a number of States. That was \nDecember 3. It wasn't until the morning of December 7 that I, along \nwith several other Senators, were shown the new language. That was just \n6\\1/2\\ hours before we were to have our first conference. We were going \nto be asked to support the new language without a full vetting from the \nconcerned Members' offices or from the depots and shipyards, arsenals, \nthe Shipbuilders Council of America, the Virginia Ship Repair \nAssociation, and all of the rest of these stakeholders and those who \nwere concerned. That was November 7.\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\n  Then on November 9, 2 days later, I, along with Senators Chambliss, \nSessions, Ayotte, Collins, Hagan, and Shaheen sent a letter to Chairman \nLevin and Chairman McKeon from the House and ranking members McCain and \nSmith opposing the new House Armed Services Committee language and \nasked that it not be included in the conference.\n  That was on December 9. We assumed they dropped the language, but \nthey didn't. The new language was put in the bill at the insistence of \nstaff, apparently, from all we can determine. Several Members of the \nSenate complained that the new language was not in either the House or \nthe Senate bill, so it should not have been able to be dropped in.\n  They took the position that this was just a clarification of language \nthat was already in, when in fact that wasn't the case because the new \nlanguage was a complete and comprehensive rewrite of depot language \ncontained in the original House bill. Stakeholders were not included in \ndrafting the language. Senators were not included. Nobody knew.\n  The problem we had at that point--that was done on December 9. We \nwere all committed to passing out the bill at that time, and many of \nthe House Members had already signed the conference report. Then there \nwas a rollcall vote, so they all disappeared. So our choice was to go \nback and open up everything again and nobody wanted to do that.\n  So we had language contained in the Senate bill, but it was dropped \nout in conference. That language specifically called for DOD to provide \ntheir inputs by March 1, 2012, on a recent study on the capability and \nefficiency of the depots before--and I emphasize this--before any \nchange in legislation because the study alone does not provide Congress \nwith a comprehensive view. This is what we requested.\n  I thank Senators Levin and McCain for their support of this colloquy. \nI wish we had time to take care of this in conference, but I hope that \nby doing this we can slow down the implementation of the new language \ncontained in the bill until the Senate has had time to fully vet these \nchanges.\n  I certainly don't blame Chairman McKeon. His staff told him--because \nhe stated this in the meeting--his staff told him the new language was \nfully vetted, but it was not, and we were not contacted. So the process \nis wrong. I have to say this is the first time in my 8 years in the \nHouse on the House Armed Services Committee and my 17 years in the \nSenate that I have seen anything such as this happen. I hope we can \ndelay implementing these changes until we in the Senate can be heard. \nThat is what this colloquy is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman for his \nwillingness to enter into this colloquy. We had a discussion, as \nSenator Inhofe said, during the conference meeting last week in which \nit now is apparent that the process through which the depot language \nwas inserted was not proper. Senator Levin has been very up front and \nstraight forward with us, and I appreciate his willingness to do this \ntoday. I know the chairman has already acknowledged there are problems, \nand I appreciate his commitment to not only discuss it today but to \nrevisit these issues as soon as the next Senate session convenes and \naddress this issue through a truly inclusive process during which all \nMembers and stakeholders can express their views.\n  Clearly, there was a process problem related to how these provisions \nwound up in the bill, and I think we can all agree that for issues that \nare as central to so many Members as the definitions of ``depot \nmaintenance'' and ``core,'' the process needs to be inclusive and \nextensive and both Houses of Congress need to be equally involved. That \nsimply did not happen in this case.\n  Specifically, related to the substance of the provisions, I am \nextremely concerned the rewrite of the 10 USC 2464 ``core'' statute \nreplaces all references to ``core logistics'' functions in the original \nstatute with ``depot maintenance and repair'' functions. This basically \nredefines ``core'' to be depot maintenance only, to exclude other \nlogistics functions such as supply chain management and product \nsupport. This does constitute a very significant change, and I would \nargue that it is exactly in these areas of logistics functions beyond \nsimple depot maintenance where the government has the greatest interest \nin protecting their own capabilities. Yet the bill defines these \nactivities out of the core definition. This could very easily result in \nthe government's ability to employ and therefore maintain expertise in \nareas such as program management, supply chain management, and product \nsupport management atrophying.\n  I have no doubt that private industry applauds this change because \nthey would be the ones to presumably pick up this work. However, we \nshould not kid ourselves into thinking industry would be cheaper. If \nthe government loses this or any other depot-related capability, they \nwill have an extremely hard time rebuilding that expertise, and this \nwill only incentivize industry to charge more for their efforts. This \nis clearly a problem and one of the issues we need to address next \nyear.\n  Secondly, the waiver in the 2464 rewrite is much broader than \npreviously and allows for a waiver for military equipment that is not \nan enduring element of the national defense strategy. Perhaps this \ncould make sense at some level if we knew what this meant, but we \ndon't. What an ``enduring element of the national defense strategy'' is \nhas never been defined; hence, we will be at the mercy of the \nsubjective interpretation of the Department of Defense. That is not the \nway it should be, and we need to fix that.\n  The current ``core'' waiver in 2464 is much narrower and more \ndefined. The presumption and philosophy in the current waiver is that \nwork, other than work on commercial items, will be considered core, and \nonly considered not core when it is clear it no longer needs to be. The \ncommittee's rewrite changes that presumption based on new standards \nwhich are unclear.\n  In addition to the two specific issues I have raised, there may be \nother unintended consequences to these changes of which we are unaware \nsince we have had limited time, as Senator Inhofe said, to vet them and \nare just now receiving feedback from some of the stakeholders.\n\n  During the chairman's remarks and in response, I would appreciate his \ncommitment to revisit these issues as soon as we can next year. I \nencourage DOD to go slowly in implementing any changes since there is a \ngood chance we will make additional changes next year. I appreciate as \nwell his commitment to include a legislative package in next year's \nnational defense authorization bill that gets it right.\n  Again, I thank both Senator Levin and Senator McCain for allowing us \nto address this issue and for their willingness to cooperate as we move \nforward next year to clear this matter up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman and the \nranking member for allowing this colloquy to take place. I also wish to \nstate that I believe the Senator from Oklahoma laid out a little bit of \nthe groundwork of what we are discussing now.\n  I rise to discuss the depot maintenance issues associated with the \nHouse-adopted language in the conference. We must avoid doing anything \nthat may upset the existing balance between DOD's internal depots, \nlogistic centers, arsenals and specialty facilities, and the industrial \nbase. The House-adopted provision can disrupt that delicate balance and \nhave unintended consequences. We just don't know who may be impacted. \nWe need time to get this right, and we need to ensure a transparent \nprocess in which all stakeholders can make their position known to \nMembers of Congress.\n  The sensitivity associated with maintenance workload is at an all-\ntime high. Disrupting the balance of depot-level maintenance comes at a \ntime when our economy is struggling and when DOD is consolidating depot \nsource-of-repair work for current and emerging weapons systems. \nAdditionally, prematurely disrupting the readiness of our weapons \nsystems fleet is not an option, especially with the operational tempo \nof our military.\n  It is critically important to preserve the capability and \ncompetencies of DOD's internal depot-level maintenance facilities while \nalso sustaining the defense industrial base in order to\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\npreserve our technological advantages and readiness on the battlefield. \nBoth face considerable challenges within a fiscally constrained \nenvironment. Both the depots and the defense industrial base are \nreshaping and restructuring their operations in anticipation of this.\n  As our military said, ``It's one team, one fight.'' The research, \ndevelopment, and manufacturing communities within DOD, as well as in \nour universities, small businesses, and large corporations, are \nessential partners in our national security. That being said, we need \nto acknowledge the fragile nature of DOD's depot-level maintenance \nfacilities and the defense supply chain within a heavily consolidated \ndefense industrial sector. Our country simply cannot lose skilled \nmanufacturing research and development expertise to global competitors.\n  Congress needs to do our due diligence to address the concerns of \nDOD's internal base involving maintenance, repair, and overhaul of the \nmilitary equipment. At the same time, we need to facilitate public-\nprivate partnerships and healthy competition that will be mutually \nbeneficial to the Department and the industrial base.\n  I know my colleagues are concerned about the impact this language may \nhave in their States. I wish to highlight Fleet Readiness Center-East \nin North Carolina. Reducing FRC-East's workload is not an option. It \nwould negatively impact the quality and cost-effective maintenance and \nlogistics support for Navy and Marine Corps aviation. The operational \nreadiness and availability of deployable Navy and Marine Corps aircraft \nwould be undermined without preserving FRC-East's capabilities.\n  I certainly understand the incredible pressure the chairman and the \nranking member were under trying to resolve hundreds of issues in \nconference over a very short period of time, and I certainly do \nappreciate their willingness to engage members of the committee and \nother interested stakeholders in a more comprehensive process next year \nso we can be sure we get this right.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate and share the comments made \nby the distinguished Senator from North Carolina. I believe it is \nimportant. Having come here 15 years ago and having confronted the \nquestion of depots and how they operate, I was surprised to learn the \nintensity of the feelings and the difficulty of the issue.\n  We worked on it for some time, and for the most part, it has been \nquiet under Senator Levin and Senator Warner. We kind of worked out how \nthis thing should be handled. I thought things were rocking along well \nand have been very disappointed that the House Members have taken an \ninitiative at a point where we were told it was too late to make any \nchanges in the process. That alters that understanding, and I am not \ncomfortable with it.\n  I feel I have engaged in these issues. We have a depot in my State, \nand we should have given it better consideration. I do not believe it \nis correct, the language as it is. I do believe we need to make \nchanges. So it is a concern that the delicate balance created by the \ncurrent definition of ``core depot-level maintenance'' between \ngovernment facilities and industry could be altered and at risk.\n  We have all worked on this issue for a number of years. We have a \nmore efficient and productive model today than we had when I first came \nhere because of a lot of hard work and intense effort. So that is a \nproblem for me.\n  Another troubling element of this new definition is the potential \ntreatment of commercial items. The notion that perhaps an engine or \nother major assembly of a major end item such as a tank or aircraft \ncould be considered a commercial item and not part of our depot core \nmission is very problematic and would be contrary to the way we have \nbeen operating for many years.\n  I would like to point out that because of the hasty way this language \ncame into the bill, we do not know the second- and third-level effects \nof this language. That in itself is another reason to make sure we get \nthe policy right in a very deliberative and collaborative process.\n  I hope we have a solution that will work. I say to Chairman Levin and \nSenator McCain, the ranking member, I appreciate your willingness to \nwork to correct the error in the process--and I believe there was a \nprocess error--and to ensure that due diligence is done as we work to \ncodify the definition of ``core depot-level maintenance.''\n  So I look forward to your leadership in conducting subcommittee \nhearings, full committee hearings, working sessions, and whatever it \ntakes to make sure we get the language right before we get to the \nmarkup and consideration of the fiscal year 2013 National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I will conclude by saying we had some very important issues to deal \nwith in the Defense bill. A lot of them were very difficult. Under \nChairman Levin's leadership and Senator McCain, we either reached an \nagreement or reached an agreement not to agree, and moved the bill \nforward. I think it is over 50 years now that this bill has moved \nforward every year. I think it is something to be proud of.\n  The only real controversy that came out of it is this depot matter. \nSo it sort of went against the way we felt we should operate, the way \nthat has resulted in settlements of disputed issues and moving the bill \nforward. For that reason, I think it is appropriate we ask that this \nissue be redealt with next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would like to voice my concerns \nregarding two provisions included in the conference report, sections \n321 and 327. These provisions constitute a major rewrite of depot \npolicies and laws.\n  These sections have not been sufficiently vetted. They could \npotentially hurt competition in acquisition programs, harm our public \ndepots, and cause unintended consequences that could significantly \naffect not only depots, but also the private sector industrial base and \nthe thousands of employees in both sectors.\n  In February, the Logistics Management Institute, LMI, delivered a \nreport to Congress making recommendations to modify the depot statutes. \nBoth Armed Services Committees asked DOD to offer input on the LMI \nstudy, but the Department did not do so.\n  The Senate held DOD to account in the committee report accompanying \nthis very bill, which states:\n\n       The committee is concerned that a lack of Department of \n     Defense input regarding the findings and recommendations of \n     the LMI study does not provide Congress with a comprehensive \n     view prior to enacting legislation that could have unintended \n     consequences.\n\n  But even without DOD input, the House went ahead and included changes \nto depot provisions when it passed its bill in May.\n  The Senate-passed bill also included a provision to prohibit any \nchange to the definition of depot maintenance until after the Defense \nBusiness Board conducted its own study as well.\n  Given the concern identified by the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand the requests for additional fact-based analysis, you can imagine my \nalarm when I learned that such a rewrite was being considered for \ninclusion in the conference report.\n  What surprised me even more was that the proposed rewrite differed \nsignificantly even from the provision in the original House-passed \nbill.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, and I voiced our concerns \nabout this in a meeting of the conferees. After that, six Senators and \nI sent a letter to the leadership of both committees warning of the \nunintended consequences of including these provisions in the conference \nreport. I ask unanimous consent to have our letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain: As conferees \n     to the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act \n     Conference, we write to voice our concerns with the HASC \n     proposal regarding Sections 321 and 322 of the House bill. \n     While we appreciate the attempt to improve the depot and \n     shipyard related statutes, none of our offices were advised \n     or consulted regarding these last minute changes being \n     proposed by the\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\n     HASC or consulted during the last several months as these \n     provisions were apparently being crafted.\n       Only a few conferees received the new proposed language on \n     December 7th, but we are all now being asked to support new \n     language that will have far reaching implications on aviation \n     depots, shipyards, arsenals, and ammunition plants across the \n     United States. It is inappropriate to attempt legislative \n     changes that could affect more than 100,000 jobs, public and \n     private, across the United States without careful vetting and \n     ensuring there will be no unintended consequences.\n       While we support improvements to operations at our depots, \n     shipyards, arsenals, and ammunition plants, the HASC proposed \n     changes to the definitions of depot level maintenance could \n     have profound and enduring negative consequences to the \n     industrial base and ultimately the readiness of our force. \n     Given the lack of transparency and abbreviated conference \n     timeline, we request that you not include Sections 321 and \n     322 of the House bill in the FY12 NDAA Conference Report. We \n     further recommend that we begin to work together as soon as \n     possible regarding the possibility of incorporating a more \n     thoroughly considered version of this language in the Fiscal \n     Year 2013 NDAA.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this matter. A similar \n     letter has been sent to Chairman McKeon and Ranking Member \n     Smith.\n           Respectfully,\n     James M. Inhofe.\n     Jeff Sessions.\n     Susan Collins.\n     Jeanne Shaheen.\n     Kay Hagan.\n     Saxby Chambliss.\n     Kelly Ayotte.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. The two provisions raise a number of unanswered \nquestions, questions that remain unanswered by the advocates of these \nprovisions, and which could lead to significant consequences for public \nand private sector components of the industrial base. Let me share two \nexamples.\n  First, the provision expands the definition of depot maintenance to \ninclude the installation of modifications and upgrades to end-items--a \nmeasure potentially harmful to competition.\n  There is a concern that the Army may be required by this provision to \ndirect work related to the Modernized Expanded Capacity Vehicle, MECV, \nprogram to the public sector without a full and open competition \nallowing experienced private entities to bid.\n  It is my view that the MECV is much more than a modification to a \nweapon system because it is an acquisition program. I understand this \nview is shared by the Army, which has consistently said the source \nselection for the MECV will be full, open, and fair.\n  Those who have invested in this program deserve to know that this \nlanguage does not restrict competition or introduce, in any way, an \nincentive to favor the public or the private sector as it relates to \nacquisition programs, and the MECV program in particular.\n  While depot maintenance work is an important component of both the \npublic and private sector industrial base, Congress has consistently \nsupported a strong core requirement at the depots for national security \nreasons. For example, vital submarine overhauls, refueling, and \nmaintenance work are performed at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in \nKittery, ME.\n  It is unclear if the ramifications of the conference report will lead \nto work flowing away from our public depots, thus jeopardizing the \ngovernment's core repair capability.\n  I would ask the chairman to closely reevaluate these provisions to \nensure that the two concerns I described, as well as the concerns of \nother interested Senators, are fully addressed.\n  This process should allow Members adequate time to reach out to \ninterested parties and a committee hearing to understand the \nramifications of these legislative changes to the defense industrial \nbase.\n  I would also ask the chairman to commit to modifying or repealing \nthese provisions, if necessary, in next year's NDAA.\n  I would also ask the chairman to ensure that any future proposals \npertaining to these sensitive issues be addressed in a more inclusive \nand deliberate manner.\n  Finally, given the uncertainty and confusion surrounding these \ncritical depot issues, I would hope that the Department of Defense \nwould exercise much care and refrain from making dramatic changes in \nits policies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to echo the comments \nand concerns we have heard in the last few minutes from my colleagues \non the Armed Services Committee regarding this House-inserted language \non our Nation's military depots, arsenals, and shipyards.\n  I wish to begin by saying to Chairman Levin how much I appreciate his \nassurances, as well as those of Ranking Member McCain, and Chairman \nMcKeon and Ranking Member Smith in the House, that there are no \nintended changes to the current law under this language. I think that \nis very important for us to say to our constituents so they are \nreassured.\n  I also appreciate Chairman Levin's commitment to examine this issue \nclosely in the coming year to prevent any unintended consequences that \nthis language might have on our Nation's industrial repair facilities, \nincluding the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which my home State of New \nHampshire shares with Maine and which is very important to us in the \nNortheast and I think to our military capabilities.\n  With that said, I have to say I share the concern that has been \nexpressed about the manner in which this language was inserted. While I \nunderstand that the House has been working on this issue for some time, \nincluding holding roundtable discussions at the National Defense \nUniversity, I believe there is much more that should have been done.\n  On Friday, December 9, my staff was made aware that this language \nfrom the House could be included in the final NDAA report--a measure we \nhave all been working on for the past 11 months. So along with six \nother members of the committee, I signed a letter that very day--so 1 \nweek ago tomorrow--indicating our concerns and frustration over \nincluding such language without adequate Senate review or input. \nDespite the concerns expressed in our letter, the language was \nincluded.\n  On such an important issue as this, usually we have had a very \ncollaborative, transparent process in our committee, on the Senate side \nanyway, and I appreciate that. I think that has been one of the reasons \nfor the great success of Senator Levin and Ranking Member McCain in \nbeing able to get a bill out year after year on which there has been \nconsensus agreement.\n  Unfortunately, that did not happen with respect to this language. As \nsuch, we now face a situation where the committee will need to spend a \nsignificant amount of time examining the language and its \nimplementation over the next year to ensure no changes result.\n  The reason we as a nation maintain the 50-50 rule--where all \nmaintenance work is split between the public and private sectors--is to \nensure that in times of conflict, the Federal Government will have the \ncritical capabilities necessary to repair our Nation's combat \nequipment.\n  Advanced technical repair work, such as the work done on nuclear \nsubmarines at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, requires highly skilled \nand specialized technicians. Any changes to the way we structure \nworkload for these facilities has to be closely examined and should \ninclude input from the individual stakeholders who understand this \nissue best.\n  Generations of Americans have invested significant resources in our \nNation's military to ensure our men and women in uniform have the most \nadvanced equipment in the world to keep us safe.\n  I say to the chairman of the committee, I very much appreciate your \nassurance that we will continue to take a close look at this issue, \nincluding holding a hearing next year, if necessary. So I thank the \nSenator very much for his cooperation to work with us.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would like to join in the comments of my \ncolleague from New Hampshire and the concerns she has expressed, along \nwith my other colleagues who serve on the Armed Services Committee.\n  But, first of all, I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain \nagain for their tremendous leadership on the Defense authorization \nbill. We have conducted a tremendous amount of work in a short period \nof time, continuing the long-running, proud tradition of the Senate \nArmed Services\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\nCommittee of professionalism and bipartisanship in support of our \ntroops and our national security.\n  This is a bill of which we can be proud. In a time of war, this bill \nsupports the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families and \nauthorizes the equipment, training, and resources our servicemembers \nneed to complete their missions.\n  While I am very proud of this bill and pleased that many of my \nprovisions to reduce wasteful spending and maintain military readiness \nhave been included in the final conference report, I also share the \nconcerns of my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, and other \ncolleagues who serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee--both \nsubstantive and procedural concerns--regarding the depot provisions, \nsections 321 and 327, that were included by the House in the conference \nreport.\n  When we were informed of this significant language--only last week--I \njoined a bipartisan group of Senators, including my colleague Jeanne \nShaheen, to express our concern and our opposition to including the \ndepot provisions in the final Defense bill.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Readiness \nSubcommittee--which has oversight over depots, shipyards, arsenals, and \nammunition plants--I am troubled that such a significant rewrite of \ndepot statutes was hastily included in the final bill without \nconsulting with key stakeholders and without conducting more complete \nanalysis involving the Senate.\n  In the coming years, as we ask the Department of Defense to do more \nwith less, the role of our depots and shipyards will become even more \nimportant. This is certainly true for our four public shipyards, \nincluding the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where many of my constituents \nwork on a daily basis to sustain the world's best submarine force.\n  I share the pride my colleague from New Hampshire Senator Shaheen and \nmy colleague from Maine Senator Collins feel about the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard. Portsmouth conducts maintenance on the Los Angeles- and \nVirginia-class submarines. In fact, Portsmouth has led the way for the \nentire Navy with the first-in-class maintenance availability on the USS \nVirginia.\n  While I am troubled by the process through which the depot provisions \nwere included in the conference report, I am encouraged that both \nChairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain have expressed similar \nconcerns and have committed to addressing these concerns in the coming \nmonths.\n  This process should include an inclusive and thorough vetting of the \nprovisions to ensure we understand all the ramifications of what was \nincluded by the House.\n  As ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I plan to propose to \nChairman McCaskill that we hold a hearing on these depot provisions at \nthe earliest opportunity next year.\n  The capabilities of our depots and shipyards and their role in \nsustaining military readiness are too important to hastily adopt such \npotentially far-reaching provisions.\n  Let me conclude by again thanking my colleagues on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. Despite the partisanship that often characterizes \nWashington, it is encouraging to see that bipartisanship continues to \nprevail in the Senate Armed Services Committee. That is largely due to \nthe leadership of Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain.\n  I am proud of this bill, and I look forward to it becoming law in the \ncoming days.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join the chairman in the acknowledgment \nthat many Members of the Senate have concerns with both the process and \nsubstance of the changes adopted in the Defense authorization \nconference report regarding statutes for depot activities in the \nDepartment of Defense. The protection of a core logistics capability \nwithin the Department has been a very controversial issue for many \nyears, as the Department's depot enterprise employs over 77,000 \npersonnel with an annual operating budget exceeding $30 billion. As we \ndraw down from two wars which have consumed so much in resources and \nequipment, there will be much concern and debate about the continued \nworkload and jobs at depots, shipyards, and arsenals, particularly in \nlight of declining defense budgets.\n  I agree this debate and deliberation should have included all \ninterested parties. While I support legislation that would have the \nclear intent of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the \nDepartment's industrial activities, I was not and am not in support of \nmoving forward on changes that have not been addressed with all members \nof the committee. The concerns expressed to us by Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Chambliss, Senator Collins, Senator Ayotte, Senator Shaheen, \nand others need to be reviewed in an open and transparent process.\n  As to the substance of the concerns, from what I can tell, there are \nopinions on the impact of these two provisions on both sides of the \nissue--from private industry and from the depots and their government \ncivilian workers and unions.\n  I am aware some are very concerned that the changes in the conference \nreport will upset the balance currently maintained between public and \nprivate performance of these activities, which could affect readiness. \nChanges to the definition of depot-level maintenance and repair have \nthe potential to result in the shift of workload at shipyards. Changes \nto this provision should not be construed to restrict competition or to \ncreate any incentive to favor the public or the private sector as it \nrelates to acquisition programs.\n  The narrowing of the statutes from core logistics to corps depot-\nlevel maintenance could be interpreted as congressional intent to \neliminate the identification of core activities in the defense supply \nchain affecting arsenals and ammunition plants.\n  On the other hand, the inclusion of an expansive waiver provided to \nthe Secretary of Defense to waive core requirements is very unsettling \nfor every depot activity. Such a waiver could move significant amounts \nof depot work to the private sector.\n  Revisions to the definitions of ``commercial items'' to be exempted \nfrom core determinations could have an immediate detrimental impact to \nthose depots that work on commercially available items of equipment, \nsuch as engines and transmissions of ground combat vehicles.\n  So many depots that do this sort of work are concerned about the \nimpact. I agree we need to fully understand the impacts, real and \nunintended, from the implementation of these provisions. We will need \nto work closely with the Department of Defense to ensure that whatever \nchanges or repeals we make are in the best interests of our military \nwith the priority placed on readiness as well as efficiency of \noperations and fiscal responsibility.\n  I support the chairman and commit to giving this issue focused \nattention in the year ahead to ensure the measures taken in this year's \nbill are the right outcome for the Department of Defense and the \ntaxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I appreciate and I understand the Senators' \nconcerns about this issue as they have been expressed here this \nafternoon. I also very much appreciate their understanding relative to \nthe extremely short period for conference this year where we worked \nthrough hundreds of provisions with our House colleagues in about a \nweek, a process that usually takes a month or more.\n  While I am proud of what we were able to accomplish in this bill as a \nwhole, it was probably likely that some language would need more \nconsideration because of the time constraints we were operating under. \nBefore I continue, I want to state my appreciation to the Members who \nspoke here this afternoon and members of the Armed Services Committee. \nThey make major contributions to this committee.\n  I listened carefully to what our colleagues have had to say about the \ndepot maintenance issue. I believe their concerns are substantive and \nmerit careful consideration from the Armed Services Committee. This is \nan issue that was brought to our conference in the House bill.\n  The depot maintenance provisions that were approved by the House last\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\nMay arose out of a congressionally mandated independent review of the \nstatutes, regulations, and policies guiding depot maintenance \nperformance and reporting. The House conferees then proposed \nmodifications to their own provisions based on the results of a series \nof discussions with stakeholders held throughout the summer at the \nNational Defense University. We were told this process was \ncomprehensive, that all stakeholders were invited, and that the \nresulting recommendations were widely accepted by all interested \nparties.\n  In particular, we understood the Department of Defense, private \nindustry, and the House Depot Caucus had reached consensus on the \nrevised House language. While those statements were made in good faith, \nit turns out they were not accurate. A number of key players, including \nstakeholders in government, private industry, and labor, did not \nparticipate in the process at National Defense University and were \napparently unaware of the results.\n  Senators with a strong interest in the issue were not aware of the \nmodified House language that was presented in our conference until it \nwas too late to consider changes. I am aware that the depot maintenance \nissue has long been a sensitive one to our Nation and to many of our \nMembers, and that the precise words in these provisions matter. The \nexisting statutes, regulations, and practices have served to sustain \nboth core logistics capabilities and the defense industrial base over \nthe last decade, so any changes need to be fully understood.\n  I understand there are a number of unanswered questions about the \nprovisions in the conference report that could have significant \neffects. For example, first, the new language substitutes the term \n``core depot level maintenance'' for the existing term ``core \nlogistics.'' Does this change impact National Guard readiness, \nsustainment maintenance sites, and other DOD facilities that are not \ndepots? Does the change impact requirements for supply chain management \nand other logistics functions that are not performed by depots?\n  Second, the new language changes the wording regarding modifications \nin the definition of core depot level maintenance. Does this change \nimpact planned public-private competitions for modifications and \nupgrades programs? Does the change preserve the distinction between \nmodifications and upgrades on the one hand and acquisition programs on \nthe other? Is this an expansion of core functions that will be required \nto be performed in the public sector with an adverse impact on the \ndefense industrial base?\n  Third, the new language changes the wording of the exclusion for \ncommercial items. Is this a change to the existing exclusion or merely \na recodification? Will it impact maintenance requirements for \ncommercial derivative aircraft and other major defense systems that are \nbased on commercial technology?\n  Fourth, the new language includes a waiver rather than an exemption \nfrom core requirements for nuclear aircraft carriers. Will the new \nlanguage result in any change in requirements for the maintenance and \nmodifications of nuclear aircraft carriers?\n  Fifth, the new language includes the authority to waive core \nrequirements for any weapons system that is ``not an enduring element \nof the national defense strategy,'' rather than an exclusion for a \nworkload that is ``no longer required for national defense reasons.'' \nDoes this new language mean something different from the existing \nlanguage? If so, will it change the balance of work between the depots \nand the private sector?\n  I am committed to have the Armed Services Committee revisit the \nmodifications to the depot maintenance laws included in this conference \nreport and to give full consideration to the concerns our Members have \nraised. Over the coming months we will engage with interested Members \nand their staffs to review the language in detail. Together we will \nreach out to interested parties through a process that will include a \nfull committee hearing if we determine one is needed. We will then take \naction to repeal or modify anything that needs to be repealed or \nmodified in these provisions during our consideration of next year's \nNational Defense Authorization Act. Many of my colleagues heard \nChairman Buck McKeon make a similar commitment at our final conference \nmeeting.\n  During the next year, while this review process is underway, I join \nmy colleagues in urging the Department of Defense to proceed with \ncaution in implementing this legislation. In particular, I urge the \nDepartment to make as little change as possible in the status quo with \nregard to these functions during the next year. It would be unfortunate \nif the Department were to change significant functions from one form of \nperformance to another this year only to be required to change the \ndecision again the year later.\n  Our objective has always been and always will be to ensure the \nNation's depot maintenance system is structured and supported in a \nmanner that efficiently and effectively provides for the readiness of \nour Armed Forces and our national security. I know this is a critically \nimportant issue. I look forward to working with Senators over the next \nyear to take the steps we have discussed here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me speak to some of the provisions of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act especially concerning nuclear \nmodernization and the implementation of the New START treaty. This is \nin the context of the omnibus appropriations bills that we will \nconsider later this week, which appear to include funding reductions \nfrom the President's request for nuclear weapons modernization \nactivities for the year 2012.\n  Earlier this year I introduced the New START Implementation Act \nbecause other Senators and I believed it is necessary that the Congress \ncodify the agreement made between the President and Congress regarding \nthe commitment to the modernization of our nuclear deterrent. Indeed, \nit is fair to say the Senate's support for the ratification of New \nSTART was contingent on modernization of the remaining nuclear arsenal.\n  One of the critical features of that legislation was the link between \nfunding of the administration's 10-year nuclear modernization program \nto any U.S. nuclear force reductions in a given year. The language that \nappeared in the House-passed version of the Defense bill was good \npolicy because it limited the reductions in warheads the United States \notherwise would make pursuant to the New START treaty if Congress \nfailed to provide the funding prescribed each year under the so-called \n1251 modernization plan. In other words, warhead reductions were based \non adequate funding.\n  The House language would also prohibit reduction of the nuclear \nstockpile hedge of nondeployed warheads until after we completed \nconstruction of the key nuclear facilities necessary to regain our \nproduction capacity. The reason for that, of course, is we have a hedge \nor a stockpile of these weapons that exists in the event we would need \nthem since we do not have a production capacity right now to replace \nthem. Until that capacity is created, probably in about a decade, we \nwill need to continue to maintain that hedge capability.\n  The language that appears in the conference report now before us \nremoves this explicit linkage, which I think is very unfortunate. The \nNDAA conference report addresses these concerns in some ways, though \nnot as strongly as we originally intended. Here is what the compromise \nin the bill provides: First, in any year in which modernization is not \nfully funded, the President must report to Congress how he intends to \naddress the shortfall and whether as a result of the shortfall it is \nstill in the national interest to remain a party to the New START \ntreaty. For the first time, the President will be compelled to detail \nhis plans for U.S. nuclear force reductions over the next 5 years, \nwhich will provide Congress an opportunity to evaluate whether these \nreductions are in the national interest. This second provision is an \nimportant addition. Third, in any year in which the President seeks \nreductions in the nuclear stockpile, he must first seek from the \nCommander of U.S. Strategic Command a net assessment on the reductions, \nwhich, of course, puts the Commander of STRATCOM in a crucial position, \nand to provide that assessment to Congress unchanged. And, finally, the \nPresident must provide to\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\nCongress any changes to the Nation's nuclear war plan and provide \naccess to certain Members of Congress to these plans.\n  These are all important provisions, but without the House language, \nthe possibility remains that we will draw down our warheads under START \nwithout adequate funding to ensure our remaining stockpile meets our \nrequirements. As I said, this is quite unfortunate.\n  Let's recall why this modernization of our nuclear weapon program was \nnecessary. The modernization program was painstakingly worked out, \nfirst within the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy, \nour national laboratories, and then between the administration and \nSenators at the time of the New START treaty. It resulted in a 10-year \n$200 billion work plan to renovate our national laboratories, to extend \nthe life of our nuclear weapons, to maintain their safety, the security \nand effectiveness of those warheads, and to sustain the modernization \nof the triad of our nuclear delivery systems, the ICBMs, bombers, and \nnuclear submarine force.\n  The plan was updated last November after a very thorough review by \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, bringing the \ntotal 10-year funding figure to about $213 billion. There was little \ndisagreement at the time about the need to modernize our nuclear \nfacilities or about this amount which represented the cost over the 10-\nyear period.\n  Indeed, between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2010, the National \nNuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, had lost about 20 percent of \nits purchasing power due to funding cuts. This, without the changes \nrecommended in the 1251 report, would have been devastating to its \nmodernization plan. Incredibly, funding for stockpile surveillance \nactivities--these are activities which are necessary for the President \nto annually certify the safety and effectiveness of our nuclear \nwarheads and bombs--had declined by 27 percent during this period of \ntime. In other words, our ability to actually even understand what was \ngoing on in these weapons and determine whether changes had to be made \nwas being degraded substantially. The situation was so dire that in \nFebruary 2010, Vice President Biden gave a major address on the subject \nat the National Defense University and penned an op-ed in the Wall \nStreet Journal that stressed:\n\n       The slow but steady decline in support for our nuclear \n     stockpile and infrastructure--\n\n  And then noting that again--\n\n       For almost a decade, our laboratories and facilities have \n     been underfunded and undervalued.\n\n  He concluded by observing that ``Even in a time of tough budget \ndecisions, these are investments we must make for our security.''\n  Secretary of Defense Gates had earlier drawn attention to the neglect \nof our nuclear weapon complex. In 2008 he said, ``To be blunt, there is \nabsolutely no way we can maintain a credible deterrent and reduce the \nnumbers of weapons in our stockpile without either resorting to testing \nour stockpile or pursuing a modernization program.''\n  Of course, we have not resumed testing, which meant our only \nalternative was this modernization program which we then all agreed to. \nWhat is the linkage between modernization and the reductions in \nwarheads called for under the START treaty? Well, it is pretty clear. \nAs the President's National Security Advisor wrote to me in April of \n2010, ``Support for the nuclear complex is fully consistent with and, \nindeed, an enabler of the nuclear reductions we seek to implement--a \ndirect connection, in other words.\n\n  So critical was the need to reverse the decline in our nuclear weapon \nenterprise that the Senate included in its resolution of ratification \nfor the New START treaty a condition No. 9, which stated:\n\n       The United States is committed to proceeding with a robust \n     stockpile stewardship program, and to maintaining and \n     modernizing the nuclear weapon production capabilities and \n     capacities that will ensure the safety, reliability, and \n     performance of the United States nuclear arsenal at the New \n     START Treaty levels and meet requirements for hedging against \n     possible international developments or technical problems.\n\n  The condition also stipulated that if appropriations are enacted that \nfail to meet the requirements set forth in the President's 10-year \nplan, then the President must tell Congress how he proposes to remedy \nthe resource shortfall and whether the United States should remain a \nparty to the treaty in light of such funding shortfalls.\n  That commitment to modernization was made explicit by the chairman \nand ranking members of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee, who wrote to the President \non December 6, 2010, to express support for ``ratification of the New \nSTART treaty and full funding for the modernization of our nuclear \nweapons arsenal, as outlined by your updated report that was mandated \nby section 1251 of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2010.''\n  Despite this commitment, we are now faced with a reduction of some \n$400 million below the President's $7.6 billion request for nuclear \nweapon activity. It depends on the outcome of the appropriations \nprocess, but based upon the bill that was filed in the House last \nnight, this appears to be the amount of reduction.\n  Senior officials from our national labs, the Department of Defense, \nand NNSA have all warned that cuts of this magnitude will delay \nconstruction activities for critical nuclear processing facilities, \npostpone critical life extension programs for our nuclear warheads, and \ncould jeopardize our ability to certify the nuclear stockpile without \ntesting.\n  In the words of Defense Secretary Panetta:\n\n       I think it's tremendously shortsighted if they reduce the \n     funds that are absolutely essential for modernization. . . . \n     If we aren't staying ahead of it, we jeopardize the security \n     of this country. So for that reason, I certainly would oppose \n     any reductions with regards to the funding for \n     [modernization].\n\n  Likewise, General Kehler, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, \ntold Congress that, due to the impending NNSA budget cuts, ``we've got \nsome near-term issues that will impact us in terms of life-extension \nprograms for aging weapons.''\n  What are life extension programs? These are the ways in which we can \ntake the nuclear warheads that need working and extend their life by \nrefurbishing them or replacing some of the components and doing other \nthings that generally the scientists understand are critical to \nmaintain the safety, the surety, and the reliability of those weapons \nover the period of time in which they are needed.\n  We all understand that the appropriations committees were under \nimmense budget pressures, especially after the Budget Control Act of \n2011. Full funding for nuclear modernization, though, was a priority \nbrought about by this Nation's pledge, made in the New START treaty, to \nreduce the levels of U.S.-deployed nuclear weapons. As such, it should \nhave superseded other budgetary considerations. It should have been \nfully funded.\n  Few things are more important than ensuring that our Nation's nuclear \ndeterrent is effective and reliable, especially as those forces are \nreduced to lower levels by the START treaty arms control agreement. \nIndeed, this was the view of the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittees, which fully authorized the President's request for nuclear \nmodernization.\n  Senior DOD officials worked to secure adequate funding for the \nPresident's 10-year commitment to nuclear modernization. Among other \nthings, the President submitted the budget that requested the full \namount of funding called for in the 1251 report, and the Department \ninitially transferred $8.3 billion in budget authority to NNSA for \nweapons activities over a 5-year period, which, unfortunately, is not \nfully reflected in the fiscal year 2012 Energy and Water appropriations \nbills.\n  In this case, the customer, the Department of Defense, was so \nconcerned that the Energy Department could do this work that it \ntransferred its own budget authority to accomplish it. Yet some of that \nmoney was drained away for other purposes.\n  Some of the $400 million shortfall could possibly be mitigated, \nhowever, if the Secretary of Defense exercises the transfer authority \nthat is going to be granted in this fiscal year 2012 Defense \nauthorization bill to transfer up to $125 million to NNSA for weapons \nactivities. This is a very small amount of money for four critical top \npriorities identified by the Department of Defense; therefore, if it \ncan find the\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\nfunds, it can utilize the transfer authority that has been granted in \nthis legislation and get that money to the NNSA to do the work that is \nabsolutely critical next year. I will be working with the Department of \nDefense and my colleagues in Congress to ensure that this happens.\n  I express my appreciation to the chairman and ranking members of the \ncommittees and the conference committee who saw to it that this \nlanguage to allow the Defense Department to transfer these funds was \nincluded.\n  Finally, let me mention what the consequences of the $400 million \nreduction could mean in the future. First, it could send a message to \nOMB that Congress no longer considers itself bound to the 10-year \nmodernization funding plan. This would be a huge mistake; it would be \nwrong. OMB then might direct less funding in the future for nuclear \nweapons in fiscal 2013 and following years than originally prescribed \nin the 1251 plan, which would be very wrong. But the problem is that \nany divergence between what was deemed necessary over the next 10 years \nand what is actually appropriated by Congress will continue to grow--\nmaybe to the point where it becomes difficult to certify on an annual \nbasis that the nuclear stockpile is safe, reliable, and effective.\n  Referring to such reductions, NNSA Administrator Tom D'Agostino \nreported this to Congress on November 2:\n\n       This is the work to make sure these technologies are the \n     ones that allow us to certify the stockpile on an annual \n     basis without underground testing. Reductions in these areas \n     will have a direct impact on the President today in the \n     ability to certify the stockpile without underground \n     testing.\n\n  For those who remain so opposed to underground testing, you cannot \nhave it both ways. You cannot both oppose underground testing and \nprevent the Department from getting the money it needs to modernize the \nstockpile. We have to do one or the other. We are now $400 million \nbelow where we need to be.\n  A second impact: Life extension programs for nuclear warheads, \nalready facing very tight schedules because of the delays over the \nyears, would be further delayed and exacerbated. Warheads that are not \nrefurbished in time are not going to be available for deployment. This \nwould have serious consequences for the readiness of our nuclear \ndeterrent at a future date, which, of course, could have serious \nimplications for the credibility of our nuclear guarantees to our \nallies and partners.\n  Third, the revitalization of nuclear labs--including expensive but \nvery necessary construction projects--will be further delayed, and, of \ncourse, costs will go up even more. Funding for science will be \ncurtailed to support higher priority programs, thus starving the labs \nof important innovation and perhaps hampering recruitment of the \nscientists and engineers necessary to maintain the long-term viability \nof the nuclear weapons complex.\n  Fourth, this funding reduction will trigger the reporting requirement \ncontained in Condition 9 of the New START resolution of ratification, \nrequiring the President to explain the impact of the resource shortfall \non the safety, reliability, and performance of our nuclear forces. We \nknow what that report is going to say. It is serious. The President \nmust also propose how he plans to resource the shortfall and, in light \nof the shortfall, whether and why it remains in the national interest \nof the United States to remain a party to New START. As a result, \nMembers of Congress may seek to ensure, through annual defense \nauthorization legislation, that any future New START-mandated \nreductions in the nuclear stockpile are tied to successful execution of \nthe planned modernization program.\n  Finally, this funding reduction, which could well be a precursor to \nfurther cuts in the future, will dampen the enthusiasm of Senators to \nagree to any future arms control agreement. Senators who voted for New \nSTART on the basis of the 10-year modernization program will not be so \neasily swayed by such promises in the future.\n  I look forward to taking up and voting on the Defense authorization \nconference report. It has a lot of good things in it and some things \nthat aren't as good. This report, as I said, is not as strong as was \nthe House language, but it will contain some important provisions the \nCongress will try to enforce to ensure that the modernization of our \nnuclear weapons continues on schedule for the next 10 years, which is \nsomething that is critical to our future national security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the National \nDefense Authorization Act conference report we will be voting on later \ntoday.\n  First, I wish to acknowledge that Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nMcCain have worked tirelessly to craft the Defense authorization bill \nto provide our Armed Forces with the equipment and services they need \nto keep us safe. I thank them, their staffs, and all my colleagues for \ntheir diligence and dedication to this important work.\n  I also come to the floor because I want to share, as I have over the \nlast few weeks, the concerns that many Americans--and especially the \npeople I represent in Colorado--have expressed over the last few weeks \nabout the detainee provisions that have been included in the Defense \nauthorization bill. I wish to make it clear that I still have very \nstrong concerns about these provisions, especially because they have \nbeen presented as a solution to alleged gaps that exist in our \ncounterterrorism policy.\n  It is my strong belief that our military men and women, law \nenforcement officials, and counterterrorism professionals have done an \noutstanding job since 9/11 to keep our Nation safe. For 10 years we \nhave killed, captured, and prosecuted terrorists, and I believe--in \nfact, I know--our system has been successful.\n  The professionals whom I just mentioned, who are in charge of waging \nthis battle to keep us safe, agree that the detainee provisions are of \nreal concern. That includes the Secretary of Defense, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, and the Directors of both the FBI and CIA.\n  In speaking to these same concerns that I continue to hold, along \nwith the people just mentioned, the administration has stated:\n\n       We have spent 10 years, since September 11, 2001, breaking \n     down the walls between intelligence, military, and law \n     enforcement professionals; Congress should not now rebuild \n     those walls and unnecessarily make the job of preventing \n     terrorist attacks more difficult.\n\n  I know many agree, especially Coloradans, who have contacted me in \nvery impressive and large numbers. They believe, as I do, that these \ndetention provisions could endanger our national security and that we \nought to take a hard look at where we are heading.\n  I strongly objected to these detention provisions back in the summer \nwhen the Armed Services Committee first considered them. In fact, I was \nthe only member of the committee who cast a ``no'' vote during the \ncommittee markup. I felt a little lonely at that point in time, but I \nthink my judgment has been recognized by the outpouring of concern \nabout where we may be headed.\n  Let me talk about what they do. The provisions could authorize the \nindefinite military detention of American citizens who are suspected of \ninvolvement in terrorism, without charge, even those captured in the \nUnited States. The point I have tried to make over and over again is \nthat this concerns each and every one of us. If these provisions deny \nAmerican citizens their due process rights under a nebulous, new set of \ndirectives, it would not only make us less safe, but it would serve as \nan unprecedented threat to our constitutional liberties.\n  Senator Graham, my friend from South Carolina, has stated that if an \nAmerican citizen takes up arms against the United States, he or she \ncould be treated as an enemy combatant. I agree. However, the dangerous \npart of that proposition is as follows: How do we go about determining \nwho those individuals are? No matter how serious the charge may be, the \nConstitution requires us to provide our citizens with due process \nbefore they are incarcerated--especially indefinite incarceration. If \nwe start labeling our citizens as enemies of the United States without \nany due process, I think we will have done real damage to our system of \njustice in our country, which is admired all over the world.\n  My colleagues and I all agree that we have to take every action \nnecessary to keep our Nation safe. But what separates us--what makes \nAmerica exceptional--is that even in our darkest\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\nhours, we ensure that our constitution prevails.\n\n  We do ourselves a grave disservice by allowing for any citizen to be \nlocked up indefinitely without trial, no matter how serious the charges \nagainst them. Doing so may make us feel safer, it may be politically \nexpedient, but we risk losing the principles of justice and liberty \nthat have kept our Republic strong, and it does, frankly, nothing to \nmake us safer. No terrorist, no weapon, no physical threat is powerful \nenough to destroy who we are as a people, and that is why we have to \nremain diligent in ensuring we hold true to the principles that make \nour country great.\n  I took note of this very principle in a powerful piece written by two \nretired four-star Marine Corps generals, General Krulak and General \nHoar.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article written by these two generals.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 12, 2011]\n\n                          Guantanamo Forever?\n\n               (By Charles C. Krulak and Joseph P. Hoar)\n\n       In his inaugural address, President Obama called on us to \n     ``reject as false the choice between our safety and our \n     ideals.'' We agree. Now, to protect both, he must veto the \n     National Defense Authorization Act that Congress is expected \n     to pass this week.\n\n\n                  Hobbling the Fight Against Terrorism\n\n       This budget bill--which can be vetoed without cutting \n     financing for our troops--is both misguided and unnecessary: \n     the president already has the power and flexibility to \n     effectively fight terrorism.\n       One provision would authorize the military to indefinitely \n     detain without charge people suspected of involvement with \n     terrorism, including United States citizens apprehended on \n     American soil. Due process would be a thing of the past. Some \n     claim that this provision would merely codify existing \n     practice. Current law empowers the military to detain people \n     caught on the battlefield, but this provision would expand \n     the battlefield to include the United States--and hand Osama \n     bin Laden an unearned victory long after his well-earned \n     demise.\n       A second provision would mandate military custody for most \n     terrorism suspects. It would force on the military \n     responsibilities it hasn't sought. This would violate not \n     only the spirit of the post-Reconstruction act limiting the \n     use of the armed forces for domestic law enforcement but also \n     our trust with service members, who enlist believing that \n     they will never be asked to turn their weapons on fellow \n     Americans. It would sideline the work of the F.B.I. and local \n     law enforcement agencies in domestic counterterrorism. These \n     agencies have collected invaluable intelligence because the \n     criminal justice system--unlike indefinite military \n     detention--gives suspects incentives to cooperate.\n       Mandatory military custody would reduce, if not eliminate, \n     the role of federal courts in terrorism cases. Since 9/11, \n     the shaky, untested military commissions have convicted only \n     six people on terror-related charges, compared with more than \n     400 in the civilian courts.\n       A third provision would further extend a ban on transfers \n     from Guantanamo, ensuring that this morally, and financially \n     expensive symbol of detainee abuse will remain open well into \n     the future. Not only would this bolster Al Qaeda's recruiting \n     efforts, it also would make it nearly impossible to transfer \n     88 men (of the 171 held there) who have been cleared for \n     release. We should be moving to shut Guantanamo, not extend \n     it.\n       Having served various administrations, we know that \n     politicians of both parties love this country and want to \n     keep it safe. But right now some in Congress are all too \n     willing to undermine our ideals in the name of fighting \n     terrorism. They should remember that American ideals are \n     assets, not liabilities.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, these generals put it right to \nthe point we all need to hear: Our ideals are assets, not liabilities. \nIn that spirit, interestingly enough, we had a very robust debate about \nthese detention provisions, and it bolstered my faith we could continue \nto have great and substantive debates in this body. Because of the \nconcerns that were raised and serious questions that were presented \nabout the provisions, we were able to secure some improvements that may \nreduce some of the grave concerns I have outlined here.\n  I see my good friend from Illinois, who I know is going to speak and \nwho shares some of my concerns, so let me touch on a couple of the \nadjustments that have been made.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment clarified that detainee provisions are \nnot to be interpreted ``to affect existing law or authorities relating \nto the detention of United States citizens.''\n  I was a member of the conference committee on this bill, and during \nthe conference committee negotiations resulted in a clarification that \nwas made to ensure these provisions are not to be interpreted to \n``affect the existing criminal enforcement and national security \nauthorities of the FBI or any other domestic law enforcement agency.'' \nThese were helpful changes and, hopefully, will prevent the undermining \nof our constitutional liberties and the disruption of domestic \ncounterterrorism efforts.\n  However, while I was pleased my colleagues were willing to \nacknowledge the language presented serious problems and left many \nquestions unanswered, I still remain concerned about the detention \nprovisions. Making changes to the law that have serious ramifications \nfor our Constitution and our national security deserve serious thought \nand deliberation. Yet to this day we have not had a single hearing on \nthese matters. Hearings would allow us to understand and mitigate the \nconcerns of national security experts such as FBI Director Mueller. \nDirector Mueller testified yesterday in front of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and said that because of the requirements of this language, \n``the possibility looms that we will lose opportunities to obtain \ncooperation from the persons in the past that we've been fairly \nsuccessful in gaining.''\n  One of our primary goals in these cases is to gain actionable \nintelligence, and the FBI is very good--in fact, they are unbelievably \ngood--at using a variety of techniques to gather the information we \nneed--techniques, by the way, that fit within the Bill of Rights and \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice. Some of my colleagues believe \nthat intelligence will be lost if a suspect receives a Miranda warning, \nbut now we may be jeopardizing entire cases by adding new layers of \nbureaucracy and questionable legal processes.\n  These detention provisions, even as they are amended, will present \nnumerous constitutional questions that the courts will inevitably have \nto resolve, and the provisions will present logistical problems that \nour national security experts will have to wade through. It sure feels \nto me as though these changes are being forced on an already nimble and \neffective counterterrorism community against their warnings, and I \nremain unconvinced of their benefit. I continue to believe the best \ncourse of action would be to separate these detention provisions from \nthe Defense authorization bill so we can take our time, speak to \nexperts in the field, and make sure we are effectively balancing our \ncounterterrorism needs and the constitutional freedoms of American \ncitizens. Most importantly, we need to understand and we need to ensure \nwe are not damaging our national security. That is why I made it clear \nin signing the conference report that I do not support the two flawed \ndetention provisions, sections 1021 and 1022.\n  All of that said, the Senate has a solemn obligation to our men and \nwomen in uniform to pass a Defense Authorization Act. As a proud member \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee, I understand the importance of \nthis bill for our military and for their families, and while I continue \nto have serious reservations about the detention provisions and sought \nto separate them from the Defense authorization bill, we face a single \nvote on the entirety of the Defense bill, which includes the amended \ndetention provisions. That is not how I wanted to proceed, but that is \nthe choice in front of us.\n  For those who joined me in voicing opposition to the detention \nprovisions, I thank you. We fought to ensure that the rights of \nAmerican citizens are not trampled with ease, and we joined the \ncounterterrorism community to demand the full use of existing tools to \nfight the enemy. We showed that such a debate was worth having and \nsecured revisions to the language that will now help us continue the \nimportant work of ensuring that both our Constitution and our national \nsecurity remain protected.\n  Although I intend to vote for final passage of the conference bill, I \nwant to make clear I do not fully support the bill. I sincerely believe \nthis debate is not over and there is much work left to do. Over the \ncoming months and years, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I intend to hold this administration, and any further \nadministration, accountable in\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\nthe implementation of these provisions.\n  I will also push the Congress to conduct the maximum amount of \noversight possible as it relates to these provisions. We must apply a \nheightened level of scrutiny to ensure that what passes the Senate \ntoday does not deny U.S. citizens their due process rights and does not \nimpede our counterterrorism efforts by hamstringing our military, the \nFBI, the CIA, or others who keep us safe. If these provisions stray in \nany way from that standard, I will be the first to demand hearings and \nchanges to the law.\n  In conclusion, I believe we owe it to our men and women in uniform to \npass a Defense authorization bill, but we also owe the American people \na full and honest debate about our national security strategy that \nkeeps us both safe and protects this document--the Constitution--we all \nhave taken an oath to uphold.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nseveral sections of the fiscal year 2012 Department of Defense \nauthorization bill relating to detainees.\n  I have serious concerns regarding the detention provisions included \nin the final conference report. When this legislation was being \ndiscussed in the Senate, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation clearly stated that these provisions would undermine the \nability of the government to bring suspected terrorists to justice. The \nlanguage in the bill also raises significant issues regarding civil \nliberties, including the applicability of the indefinite detention \nprovision to American citizens.\n  Section 1021 of the conference report provides the U.S. military with \nthe authority to indefinitely detain, without trial, an individual \nsuspected of involvement in hostilities against the United States. The \nability to detain the person without charges could last until the ``end \nof hostilities''--a completely undefined period of time considering \nthat we are confronting a long-term conflict with groups, such as al-\nQaida, who will never sign a peace treaty ending the hostilities.\n  The final language does include an amendment offered by Senator \nFeinstein that states that the provision should not be construed as \naffecting existing law with respect to the detention of U.S. citizens, \nbut this language simply restates that the law is what the law is. The \nproblem is that the law is unsettled. If Congress is going to enact \nprovisions authorizing the indefinite detention of a person without a \ntrial, frankly, I believe the sensible approach is to be very clear \nabout whether or not it is the intent of Congress to include American \ncitizens within this category.\n  Another problematic provision is section 1022, which mandates that \nthe military detain suspected members of al-Qaida, including those \ncaptured within the United States. As I previously mentioned, military \nand Federal law enforcement officials have argued that this provision \nwill hamper their ability to bring suspected terrorists to justice by \nlimiting the flexibility of civilian law enforcement and creating a \ncompletely new and untested framework for dealing with suspected \nterrorists.\n  Proponents of this provision have argued that this section will not \ninterfere with the ability of civilian law enforcement to do their job. \nThey point to the fact that the President may waive the requirement and \nthat the President must draft procedures within 60 days to mitigate any \nproblems associated with implementing this section.\n  First, with regard to the waiver, if civilian law enforcement agents \ncapture a suspected terrorist, the need to obtain a Presidential waiver \nfor continued civilian detention could disrupt interrogations and \nintelligence gathering. Second, if there is an acknowledgement that the \nstatute could interfere with Federal law enforcement's ability to \ninterrogate and prosecute a suspected terrorist, it would seem more \nappropriate to just address the underlying problems with the statute \nrather than task the administration with coming up with procedures to \ndeal with these shortfalls.\n  Just yesterday, the Director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, in testimony \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated that the revised language \ndid not fully address his concerns about the negative impact the \nmilitary detention provision would have in interfering with the work of \ninvestigators.\n  The bottom line is that this section muddies the water and is \ncompletely unnecessary. The administration already has the discretion \nto prosecute foreign terrorists in civilian court or in military \ntribunals. We should maintain this flexibility to ensure the government \nis able to aggressively pursue terrorists in the forum that is the most \neffective in each specific case.\n  Lastly, I would like to briefly comment on the various provisions in \nthe conference report aimed at limiting the ability of the \nadministration to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay. It \nhas been about 10 years since the Bush administration established the \nfacility and its closure is long overdue.\n  As a recent article by Scott Shane of the New York Times pointed out, \nthe government spends around $800,000 a year to house each of the 171 \nremaining prisoners at the military facility at Guantanamo. This is \ndespite the fact that our Federal prison system has a strong record of \nsafely holding individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses--\nthere are currently 362 of these individuals within the custody of the \nBureau of Prisons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Congressional Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It is unfortunate that Congress continues to put in \nplace restrictions preventing the transfer of inmates and the closure \nof the facility. I believe our Nation's handling of detainees will not \nbe viewed kindly by history, and I look forward to the day we are able \nto close this regrettable chapter.\n  I supported an amendment offered by Senator Mark Udall to remove all \nof the detainee provisions from the Senate bill. Unfortunately, the \nmeasure was not adopted. It was my hope that these matters would be \ndealt with as the legislative process moved forward, and I am \ndisappointed that efforts to adequately address these concerns were \nunsuccessful. I will continue to support efforts to revise these \nprovisions as Congress discusses detainee matters in the future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 10, 2011]\n\n       Beyond Guantanamo, a Web of Prisons for Terrorism Inmates\n\n                            (By Scott Shane)\n\n       Washington.--It is the other Guantanamo, an archipelago of \n     federal prisons that stretches across the country, hidden \n     away on back roads. Today, it houses far more men convicted \n     in terrorism cases than the shrunken population of the prison \n     in Cuba that has generated so much debate.\n       An aggressive prosecution strategy, aimed at prevention as \n     much as punishment, has sent away scores of people. They \n     serve long sentences, often in restrictive, Muslim-majority \n     units, under intensive monitoring by prison officers. Their \n     world is spare.\n       Among them is Ismail Royer, serving 20 years for helping \n     friends go to an extremist training camp in Pakistan. In a \n     letter from the highest-security prison in the United States, \n     Mr. Royer describes his remarkable neighbors at twice-a-week \n     outdoor exercise sessions, each prisoner alone in his own \n     wire cage under the Colorado sky. ``That's really the only \n     interaction I have with other inmates,'' he wrote from the \n     federal Supermax, 100 miles south of Denver.\n       There is Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, Mr. Royer wrote. \n     Terry Nichols, who conspired to blow up the Oklahoma City \n     federal building. Ahmed Ressam, the would-be ``millennium \n     bomber,'' who plotted to attack Los Angeles International \n     Airport. And Eric Rudolph, who bombed abortion clinics and \n     the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n       In recent weeks, Congress has reignited an old debate, with \n     some arguing that only military justice is appropriate for \n     terrorist suspects. But military tribunals have proved \n     excruciatingly slow and imprisonment at Guantanamo hugely \n     costly--$800,000 per inmate a year, compared with $25,000 in \n     federal prison.\n       The criminal justice system, meanwhile, has absorbed the \n     surge of terrorism cases since 2001 without calamity, and \n     without the international criticism that Guantanamo has \n     attracted for holding prisoners without trial. A decade after \n     the Sept. 11 attacks, an examination of how the prisons have \n     handled the challenge of extremist violence reveals some \n     striking facts:\n       --Big numbers. Today, 171 prisoners remain at Guantanamo. \n     As of Oct. 1, the federal Bureau of Prisons reported that it \n     was holding 362 people convicted in terrorism-related cases, \n     269 with what the bureau calls a\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\n     connection to international terrorism--up from just 50 in \n     2000. An additional 93 inmates have a connection to domestic \n     terrorism.\n       --Lengthy sentences. Terrorists who plotted to massacre \n     Americans are likely to die in prison. Faisal Shahzad, who \n     tried to set off a car bomb in Times Square in 2010, is \n     serving a sentence of life without parole at the Supermax, as \n     are Zacarias Moussaoui, a Qaeda operative arrested in 2001, \n     and Mr. Reid, the shoe bomber, among others. But many inmates \n     whose conduct fell far short of outright terrorism are \n     serving sentences of a decade or more, the result of a \n     calculated prevention strategy to sideline radicals well \n     before they could initiate deadly plots.\n       --Special units. Since 2006, the Bureau of Prisons has \n     moved many of those convicted in terrorism cases to two \n     special units that severely restrict visits and phone calls. \n     But in creating what are Muslim-dominated units, prison \n     officials have inadvertently fostered a sense of solidarity \n     and defiance, and set off a long-running legal dispute over \n     limits on group prayer. Officials have warned in court \n     filings about the danger of radicalization, but the Bureau of \n     Prisons has nothing comparable to the deradicalization \n     programs instituted in many countries.\n       --Quiet releases. More than 300 prisoners have completed \n     their sentences and been freed since 2001. Their convictions \n     involved not outright violence but ``material support'' for a \n     terrorist group; financial or document fraud; weapons \n     violations; and a range of other crimes. About half are \n     foreign citizens and were deported; the Americans have \n     blended into communities around the country, refusing news \n     media interviews and avoiding attention.\n       --Rare recidivism. By contrast with the record at \n     Guantanamo, where the Defense Department says that about 25 \n     percent of those released are known or suspected of \n     subsequently joining militant groups, it appears \n     extraordinarily rare for the federal prison inmates with past \n     terrorist ties to plot violence after their release. The \n     government keeps a close eye on them: prison intelligence \n     officers report regularly to the Justice Department on \n     visitors, letters and phone calls of inmates linked to \n     terrorism. Before the prisoners are freed, F.B.I. agents \n     typically interview them, and probation officers track them \n     for years.\n       Both the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress \n     often cite the threat of homegrown terrorism. But the Bureau \n     of Prisons has proven remarkably resistant to outside \n     scrutiny of the inmates it houses, who might offer a unique \n     window on the problem.\n       In 2009, a group of scholars proposed interviewing people \n     imprisoned in terrorism cases about how they took that path. \n     The Department of Homeland Security approved the proposal and \n     offered financing. But the Bureau of Prisons refused to grant \n     access, saying the project would require too much staff time.\n       ``There's a huge national debate about how dangerous these \n     people are,'' said Gary LaFree, director of a national \n     terrorism study center at the University of Maryland, who was \n     lead author of the proposal. ``I just think, as a citizen, \n     somebody ought to be studying this.''\n       The Bureau of Prisons would not make any officials \n     available for an interview with The New York Times, and \n     wardens at three prisons refused to permit a reporter to \n     visit inmates. But e-mails and letters from inmates give a \n     rare, if narrow, look at their hidden world.\n\n\n                            Paying the Price\n\n       Consider the case of Randall Todd Royer, 38, a Missouri-\n     born Muslim convert who goes by Ismail. Before 9/11, he was a \n     young Islamic activist with the Council on American-Islamic \n     Relations and the Muslim American Society, meeting with \n     members of Congress and visiting the Clinton White House.\n       Today he is nearly eight years into a 20-year prison \n     sentence. He pleaded guilty in 2004 to helping several \n     American friends go to a training camp for Lashkar-e-Taiba, \n     an extremist group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir. The \n     organization was later designated a terrorist group by the \n     United States--and is blamed for the Mumbai massacre in \n     2008--but prosecutors maintained in 2004 that the friends \n     intended to go on to Afghanistan and fight American troops \n     alongside the Taliban.\n       Mr. Royer had fought briefly with the Bosnian Muslims \n     against their Serbian neighbors in the mid-1990s, when NATO, \n     too, backed the Bosnians. He trained at a Lashkar-e-Taiba \n     camp himself. And in 2001, he was stopped by Virginia police \n     with an AK-47 and ammunition in his car.\n       But he adamantly denies that he would ever scheme to kill \n     Americans, and there is no evidence that he did so. Before \n     sentencing, he wrote the judge a 30-page letter admitting, \n     ``I crossed the line and, in my ignorance and phenomenally \n     poor judgment, broke the law.'' In grand jury testimony, he \n     expressed regret about not objecting during a meeting, just \n     after the Sept. 11 attacks, in which his friends discussed \n     joining the Taliban.\n       ``Unfortunately, I didn't come out and clearly say that's \n     not what any of us should be about,'' he said.\n       Prosecutors call Mr. Royer ``an inveterate liar'' in court \n     papers in another case, asserting that he has given \n     contradictory accounts of the meeting after Sept. 11. Mr. \n     Royer says he has been truthful.\n       Whatever the facts, he is paying the price. His 20-year \n     sentence was the statutory minimum under a 2004 plea deal he \n     reluctantly took, fearing that a trial might end in a life \n     term. His wife divorced him and remarried; he has seen his \n     four young children only through glass since 2006, when the \n     Bureau of Prisons moved him to a restrictive new unit in \n     Indiana for inmates with the terrorism label. After an \n     altercation with another inmate who he said was bullying \n     others, he was moved in 2010 to the Supermax in Colorado.\n       He is barred from using e-mail and permitted only three 15-\n     minute phone calls a month--recently increased from two, a \n     move that Mr. Royer hopes may portend his being moved to a \n     prison closer to his children. His letters are reflective, \n     sometimes self-critical, frequently dropping allusions to his \n     omnivorous reading. His flirtation with violent Islam and his \n     incarceration, he says, have not poisoned him against his own \n     country.\n       ``You asked what I think of the U.S.; that is an \n     extraordinarily complex question,'' Mr. Royer wrote in one \n     letter consisting of 27 pages of neat handwriting. ``I can \n     say I was born in Missouri, I love that land and its people, \n     I love the Mississippi, I love my family and my cousins, I \n     love my Germanic ethnic heritage and people, I love the \n     English language, I love the American people--my people.\n       He said he believed some American foreign policy positions \n     had been ``needlessly antagonistic'' but added, ``Nothing the \n     U.S. did justified the 9/11 attacks.''\n       Mr. Royer rejected the notion that the United States was at \n     war with Islam. ``Conflict between the U.S. and Muslims is \n     neither inevitable nor beneficial or in anyone's interest,'' \n     he wrote. ``Actually, I suppose it is in the interest of \n     fanatics on both sides, but their interests run counter to \n     everyone else's.'' He added an erudite footnote: `` `Les \n     extremites se touchent' (the extremes meet)--Blaise Pascal.''\n       He expressed frustration that the Bureau of Prisons appears \n     to view him as an extremist, despite what he describes as his \n     campaign against extremism in discussions with other inmates \n     and prison sermons at Friday Prayer, ``which they surely have \n     recordings of.''\n       ``I have gotten into vehement debates, not to mention civil \n     conversations, with other inmates from the day I was arrested \n     until today, about the dangers and evils of extremism and \n     terrorism,'' Mr. Royer wrote in a yearlong correspondence \n     with a reporter. ``Can they not figure out who I am?''\n\n\n                       A Scorched-Earth Approach\n\n       In 2004, prosecutors believed they knew who Mr. Royer was: \n     one of a group of young Virginians under the influence of a \n     radical cleric, Ali al-Timimi, whose members played paintball \n     to practice for jihad and were on a path toward extremist \n     violence. After Sept. 11, federal prosecutors took a \n     scorched-earth approach to any crime with even a hint of a \n     terrorism connection, and judges and juries went along.\n       In the Virginia jihad case, for instance, prosecutors used \n     the Neutrality Act, a little-used law dating to 1794 that \n     prohibits Americans from fighting against a nation at peace \n     with the United States. Prosecutors combined that law with \n     weapons statutes that impose a mandatory minimum sentence in \n     a strategy to get the longest prison terms, with breaks for \n     some defendants who cooperated, said Paul J. McNulty, then \n     the United States attorney overseeing the case.\n       ``We were doing all we could to prevent the next attack,'' \n     Mr. McNulty said.\n       ``It was a deterrence strategy and a show of strength,'' \n     said Karen J. Greenberg, a law professor at Fordham \n     University who has overseen the most thorough independent \n     analysis of terrorism prosecutions. ``The attitude of the \n     government was: Every step you take toward terrorism, no \n     matter how small, will be punished severely.''\n       About 40 percent of terrorism cases since the Sept. 11 \n     attacks have relied on informants, by the count of the Center \n     on Law and Security at New York University, which Ms. \n     Greenberg headed until earlier this year. In such cases, the \n     F.B.I. has trolled for radicals and then tested whether they \n     were willing to plot mayhem--again, a preemptive strategy \n     intended to ferret out potential terrorists. But in some \n     cases prosecutors have been accused of overreaching.\n       Yassin M. Aref, for instance, was a Kurdish immigrant from \n     Iraq and the imam of an Albany mosque when he agreed to serve \n     as witness to a loan between an acquaintance and another man, \n     actually an informant posing as a supporter of a Pakistani \n     terrorist group, Jaish-e-Muhammad. The ostensible purpose of \n     the loan was to buy a missile to kill the Pakistani \n     ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Aref's involvement was \n     peripheral--but he was convicted of conspiring to aid a \n     terrorist group and got a 15-year sentence.\n       That was a typical punishment, according to the Center on \n     Law and Security, which has studied the issue. Of 204 people \n     charged with what it calls serious jihadist crimes since the \n     Sept. 11 attacks, 87 percent were convicted and got an \n     average sentence of 14 years, according to a September report \n     from the center.\n       Federal officials say the government's zero-tolerance \n     approach to any conduct touching on terrorism is an important \n     reason there has been no repeat of Sept. 11. Lengthy \n     sentences for marginal offenders have been criticized by some \n     rights advocates as deeply unfair--but they have sent an \n     unmistakable message to young men drawn to the rhetoric of \n     violent jihad.\n       The strategy has also sent scores of Muslim men to federal \n     prisons.\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\n                             Special Units\n\n       After news reports in 2006 that three men imprisoned in the \n     1993 World Trade Center bombing had sent letters to a Spanish \n     terrorist cell, the Bureau of Prisons created two special \n     wards, called Communication Management Units, or C.M.U.'s. \n     The units, which opened at federal prisons in Terre Haute, \n     Ind., in 2006 and Marion, Ill., in 2008, have set off \n     litigation and controversy, chiefly because critics say they \n     impose especially restrictive rules on Muslim inmates, who \n     are in the majority.\n       The C.M.U.'s? You mean the Muslim Management Units?'' said \n     Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-\n     Islamic Relations.\n       The units currently hold about 80 inmates. The rules for \n     visitors--who are allowed no physical contact with inmates--\n     and the strict monitoring of mail, e-mail and phone calls are \n     intended both to prevent inmates from radicalizing others and \n     to rule out plotting from behind bars.\n       A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman, Traci L. Billingsley, said \n     in an e-mail that the units were not created for any \n     religious group but were ``necessary to ensure the safety, \n     security and orderly operation of correctional facilities, \n     and protection of the public.''\n       An unintended consequence of creating the C.M.U.'s is a \n     continuing conflict between Muslim inmates and guards, mainly \n     over the inmates' demand for collective prayer beyond the \n     authorized hourlong group prayer on Fridays. The clash is \n     described in hundreds of pages of court filings in a lawsuit. \n     In one affidavit, a prison official in Terre Haute describes \n     ``signs of radicalization'' in the unit, saying one inmate's \n     language showed ``defiance to authority, and a sense of being \n     incarcerated because of Islam.''\n       One 2010 written protest obtained by The New York Times, \n     listing grievances ranging from the no-contact visiting rules \n     to guards ``mocking, disrespecting and disrupting'' Friday \n     Prayer, was signed by 17 Muslim prisoners in the Terre Haute \n     Communication Management Unit. They included members of the \n     so-called Virginia jihad case of which Mr. Royer was part; \n     the Lackawanna Six, Buffalo-area Yemeni Americans who \n     traveled to a Qaeda camp in Afghanistan; Kevin James, who \n     formed a radical Muslim group in prison and plotted to attack \n     military facilities in Los Angeles; and John Walker Lindh, \n     the so-called American Taliban.\n       An affidavit signed by Mr. Lindh, who is serving 20 years \n     after admitting to fighting for the Taliban, complained that \n     a correctional officer greeted male Muslim inmates with \n     ``Good morning, ladies.'' (``No ladies were in the area,'' \n     Mr. Lindh writes.) Prison officials say in court papers that \n     Mr. Lindh has repeatedly challenged guards and violated \n     rules.\n       Unlike those at the Supermax, inmates in the segregated \n     units have access to e-mail, and some were willing to answer \n     questions. Mr. Lindh, whose father, Frank Lindh, said his son \n     believed the news media falsely labeled him a terrorist, was \n     not. In reply to a reporter's letter requesting an interview, \n     he sent only a photocopy of the sole of a tennis shoe. Since \n     shoe bottoms are considered offensive in many cultures, his \n     answer appeared to be an emphatic no.\n       There is some evidence that the Bureau of Prisons has \n     assigned Muslims with no clear terrorist connection to the \n     C.M.U.'s. Avon Twitty, a Muslim who spent 27 years in prison \n     for a 1982 street murder, was sent to the Terre Haute unit in \n     2007. When he challenged the assignment, he was told in \n     writing that he was a ``member of an international terrorist \n     organization,'' though no organization was named and there \n     appears to be no public evidence for the assertion.\n       Mr. Twitty, working for a home improvement company and \n     teaching at a Washington mosque since his release in January, \n     said he believed the real reason was to quash his complaints \n     about what he believed were miscalculations of time off for \n     good behavior for numerous inmates. ``They had to shut me \n     up,'' he said.\n       Another former inmate at the Marion C.M.U., Andy Stepanian, \n     an animal rights activist, said a guard once told him he was \n     ``a balancer''--a non-Muslim placed in the unit to rebut \n     claims of religious bias. Mr. Stepanian said the creation of \n     the predominantly Muslim units could backfire, adding to the \n     feeling that Islam is under attack.\n       ``I think it's a fair assessment that these men will leave \n     with a more intensified belief that the U.S. is at war with \n     Islam,'' said Mr. Stepanian, 33, who now works for a \n     Princeton publisher. ``The place reeked of it,'' he said, \n     describing clashes over restrictions on prayer and some \n     guards' hostility to Islam.\n       Yet Mr. Stepanian also said he found the ``family \n     atmosphere'' and camaraderie of inmates at the unit a welcome \n     change from the threatening tone of his previous medium-\n     security prison, where he said prisoners without a gang to \n     protect them were ``food for the sharks.'' When he arrived at \n     the C.M.U., he said, he found on his bed a pair of shower \n     slippers and a bag of non-animal-based food that Muslim \n     inmates had collected after hearing a vegan was joining the \n     unit.\n       He was wary. ``I thought they were trying to indoctrinate \n     me,'' he said. ``They never tried.'' The consensus of the \n     inmates, he said, ``was that 9/11 was not Islam.'' ``These \n     guys were not lunatics,'' he said. ``They wanted to be back \n     with their families.''\n\n\n                               Reflection\n\n       It may be too early to judge recidivism for those \n     imprisoned in terrorism cases after Sept. 11; those who are \n     already out are mostly defendants whose crimes were less \n     serious or who cooperated with the authorities. Justice \n     Department officials and outside experts could identify only \n     a handful of cases in which released inmates had been \n     rearrested, a rate of relapse far below that for most federal \n     inmates or for Guantanamo releases.\n       For example, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah, a Kuwaiti Canadian \n     who plotted with Al Qaeda to attack American embassies in \n     Singapore and Manila, pleaded guilty in 2002 and began to \n     work as an F.B.I. informant. But F.B.I. agents soon \n     discovered he was secretly plotting to kill them--and he was \n     sentenced to life in prison.\n       Nearly all of these ex-convicts, however, lie low and steer \n     clear of militancy, often under the watchful eye of family, \n     mosque and community, lawyers and advocates say. A dozen \n     former inmates declined to be interviewed, saying that to be \n     associated publicly with a terrorism case could derail new \n     jobs and lives. As for Mr. Royer, he is approaching only the \n     midpoint of his 20-year sentence.\n       Did he get what he deserved? Chris Heffelfinger, a \n     terrorism analyst and author of ``Radical Islam in America,'' \n     did a detailed study of the Virginia jihad case, and \n     concluded that Mr. Royer's sentence was perhaps double what \n     his crime merited. But he said the prosecution was warranted \n     and probably prevented at least some of the men Mr. Royer \n     assisted from joining the Taliban.\n       ``I think a strong law enforcement response to cases like \n     this is appropriate nine times out of 10,'' Mr. Heffelfinger \n     said. Mr. Royer himself, in his long presentencing letter to \n     Judge Leonie M. Brinkema, said he understood why he had been \n     arrested. ``I realize that the government has a legitimate \n     interest in protecting the public from terrorism,'' he wrote, \n     ``and that in this post-9/11 environment, it must take all \n     reasonable precautions.''\n       Today, Mr. Royer's only battle is to serve out his sentence \n     in a less restrictive prison nearer his children. In what he \n     called in a letter ``a heroic sacrifice,'' his parents, Ray \n     and Nancy Royer, moved from Missouri to Virginia to be close \n     to their son's children, now aged 8 to 12.\n       ``I found it necessary to be a surrogate father,'' said Ray \n     Royer, 70, a commercial photographer by trade, in an \n     interview at the retirement community outside Washington \n     where he and his wife now live. When his son, who still goes \n     by Randy in the family, converted to Islam at the age of 18, \n     his parents did not object. Later, when he headed to Bosnia, \n     they chalked it up to his active social conscience. \n     ``Religion is a personal thing,'' the elder Mr. Royer said. \n     ``He'd never been in trouble.''\n       Ray Royer was at his son's Virginia apartment in 2003 when \n     the F.B.I. knocked at 5 a.m., put him in handcuffs and took \n     him away. Now, years later, he alternates between defending \n     his son and expressing dismay at what Randy got himself into.\n       ``He did help his buddies get to L.E.T.,'' or Lashkar-e-\n     Taiba, the Pakistani militant group later designated as a \n     terrorist organization. ``He admitted to it. He should pay \n     the price.'' Still, he added, ``maybe he deserved five years \n     or so. Not 20.''\n       Ray Royer sat at his home computer one recent evening, \n     looking through a folder called ``Randy Pics''--photographs \n     tracing his son's life from childhood, to fatherhood, to \n     prison.\n       ``He loved his family,'' the father said of his son. ``Why \n     would he put this cause ahead of his family? I still don't \n     really know what happened. I'm still trying to figure it \n     out.''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight important \nprovisions of the National Defense Authorization Act conference report \nthat will counter the serious and growing problem of counterfeit goods \nentering the military supply chain.\n  Section 818 of the conference report, which includes these \nprovisions, reflects the leadership of Chairman Levin and Ranking \nMember McCain of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I applaud their \nwork to keep counterfeit parts out of the military supply chain. As I \nhave said before, our Nation asks a lot of our troops. In return, we \nmust give them the best possible equipment to fulfill their vital \nmissions and come home safely. We must ensure the proper performance of \nweapon systems, body armor, aircraft parts, and countless other \nmission-critical products. Section 818 goes a long way toward \nprotecting our troops from the dangers of counterfeit parts and the \ndecreased combat effectiveness they cause.\n  I am particularly glad that section 818 includes a provision I \nintroduced to increase criminal penalties for trafficking in \ncounterfeit military goods. That provision, introduced as the Combating \nMilitary Counterfeits Act of 2011, S. 1228, was reported without \nobjection by the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was cosponsored by \nSenators Graham, Leahy, McCain, Coons, Kyl, Blumenthal, Hatch, \nKlobuchar, and Schumer. I was very grateful that Chairman Levin and \nRanking Member\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nMcCain included it in their anticounterfeiting amendment to the NDAA, \nand I greatly appreciate their leadership in ensuring that the \nprovision remained in the conference report. I would also particularly \nlike to thank Chairman Lamar Smith of the House Judiciary Committee, \nwho introduced comparable language in the House. It was a pleasure \nworking with him on the language included in section 818(h). I am very \ngrateful that he was able to clear the provision on the House side, \nthereby enabling its inclusion in the conference report.\n  Prosecutors will be able to employ section 818(h) to deter criminals \nfrom trafficking in military counterfeits. This will help protect our \nnational security and the safety of our troops. The U.S. Sentencing \nCommission also has a role to play. It should update relevant \nsentencing guidelines to ensure that they reflect the seriousness of \nthese reprehensible crimes. I would particularly note that the Obama \nadministration has called for an increase of the minimum base offense \nlevel for trafficking in counterfeit military goods to 14. I trust that \nthe Sentencing Commission will give this recommendation substantial \nweight when it reconsiders the guidelines in light of the changes \nsection 818(h) makes to the Criminal Code. As the administration has \nexplained, a minimum offense level of 14 for trafficking in counterfeit \nmilitary products would mean that a first-time offender with no \ncriminal history would face at least a 10- to 16-month guideline range \nwithout any other aggravated conduct, after taking into account a \nreduction for acceptance of responsibility. Such penalties should be \nthe bare minimum for offenses that put our troops' safety at risk.\n  I also would like to highlight a second provision within section 818 \nof the conference report. Our colleagues on the Finance and Judiciary \nCommittees have been working diligently to clarify that Customs and \nBorder Protection agents can share sufficient information with \ntrademark holders to ensure that counterfeit products are stopped at \nthe border. Chairman Leahy, for example, amended his PROTECT IP Act to \nthat end. Section 818(g) includes comparable language, and I applaud \nthe conferees for recognizing the importance of this provision. It \nreaffirms the executive branch's authority to share necessary \ninformation with rights holders without fear of violating the Trade \nSecrets Act. It thereby will enable Customs and Border Protection to \nfulfill its responsibility to stop military counterfeits at the border. \nUnder this provision, they will be able to share the same photographs \nand samples they currently share but with the serial numbers and other \nidentifying information shown, not redacted. This simple change in \npractice should be implemented immediately, without the delay of \nunnecessary regulatory processes. Now is the time to protect our troops \nfrom the risk of dangerous counterfeit military parts entering our \nfighter jets, weapons, ships, and countless other mission-critical \nproducts.\n  I am glad to have the opportunity to vote in favor of these important \nprovisions. I look forward to the future reduction in the number of \ndangerous counterfeit military products that are currently putting our \ntroops' safety at risk and reducing combat effectiveness.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am voting to pass the conference report \nfor the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, NDAA.\n  This is not a perfect piece of legislation. But it contains important \nhard-fought provisions that I am unwilling to jeopardize or risk \ndenying to the brave men and women defending our Nation, and their \nfamilies. Specifically, this bill represents the year's last \nopportunity to pass a 1.6 percent across-the-board pay raise for our \nmen and women in the military. The bill also includes a bipartisan \nprovision Senator Collins and I have been working on for over a year to \nget passed: an effort to protect victims of sexual assault in the \nmilitary. As a veteran, I have been deeply troubled by what Senator \nCollins and our colleague in the House, Representative Tsongas, have \nheard about the alarming incidences of sexual assault in the military--\nwhich is why we worked so hard through this bill to strengthen support \nfor sexual assault prevention, legal protection for victims of sexual \nassault, and assistance for victims.\n  There are, however, problems with this bill which still concern me. \nWhen the bill was on the floor, I fought for amendments that would have \nstripped troubling detainee provisions out of the bill entirely. I also \nvoted for other amendments that would have significantly narrowed the \nscope of the detainee provisions. Unfortunately, notwithstanding my \nvotes, those amendments were not adopted by the Senate. The conferees, \nwith our urging, and with the President's veto threat, made some \nprogress in improving that part of the bill. I commend the conferees \nfor working to address concerns of mine and many other Senators, senior \nadministration officials, and the public over the detention-related \nprovisions in the NDAA. While the provisions in the conference report \nare an improvement over their counterparts in the bill that the Senate \npassed last week, we need to continue to examine detention law and \npolicy to ensure that the treatment of detainees is consistent with our \nnational security and with core American values.\n  The progress made in conference on the detention-related provisions \nis significant enough that I am comfortable voting for the bill, and \nthe White House has lifted its veto threat. Specifically, the \nconference report includes several changes to the detainee provisions, \nincluding a new paragraph that clearly states that nothing in the bill \n``shall be construed to affect the existing criminal enforcement and \nnational security authorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or \nany other domestic law enforcement agency,'' provisions that give the \nPresident additional discretion over implementation, and a transfer of \nthe waiver authority from the Secretary of Defense to the President. In \nits totality, these changes led the White House to state that the ``the \nlanguage does not challenge or constrain the President's ability to \ncollect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect \nthe American people, and the President's senior advisors will not \nrecommend a veto.''\n  Given all this, as well as the fact that the detention-related \nprovisions of the bill have been improved from a civil liberties \nperspective, and in light of the other urgent priorities contained in \nthe overall bill, I am voting in favor of the conference report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator, I have no greater \nresponsibility than to work to ensure our Nation's security. In that \nregard, I believe our Armed Forces must have all the tools they need to \nkeep our country safe. That is why I support the vast majority of the \nprovisions in the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  The bill takes some small steps towards reining in runaway defense \nspending, which has nearly doubled in the past decade. This bill \nauthorizes $26.6 billion less than requested at the beginning of the \nyear, providing more than enough to defend our interests, while \nchipping away at the Pentagon's nonstop growth. It also lays the \ngroundwork for reevaluating outdated Cold War-era overseas deployments \nin Europe and the Pacific that are both costly and increasingly \nunnecessary.\n  All of these provisions I support and believe are important. However, \nbecause I believe this bill infringes on critical constitutional \nvalues, I must oppose final passage. I believe we can do a better job \nof protecting our national security without compromising these \nimportant values.\n  This Nation has long been a beacon of liberty and a champion of \nrights throughout the world. Yet, since 9/11, in the name of security, \nwe have repeatedly betrayed our highest principles. The past \nadministration believed it could eavesdrop on Americans without a \nwarrant or court order. It utilized interrogation techniques long \nconsidered immoral, ineffective, and illegal, regardless of laws and \ntreaties. And, it intentionally sought to put detainees beyond the rule \nof law. Thankfully, the current administration has ended the worst \nabuses of these practices, despite the efforts of some of my colleagues \nto stymie these efforts.\n  However, I am deeply concerned that the conference report continues \nus on a dangerous path, which sacrifices long-held and durable \nprinciples at the altar of fear and short-term expediency.\n  To begin, this bill fails to make clear that under no circumstance \ncan an American citizen be detained indefinitely without trial. I \nsimply do not\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\nbelieve that a person should be seized on American soil and \nindefinitely detained without charges and without due process of law.\n  Second, it mandates, for the first time, that non-American terrorist \nsuspects arrested in the United States will be detained by the military \nrather than civilian law enforcement. Throughout our history, there has \nbeen a clear divide between our military--which fights wars abroad--and \nlaw enforcement in the United States, and that divide has worked. For \nexample, since\n9/11, over 400 terrorists have been successfully convicted in article \nIII, not military, courts. For persons in this country, it is a \ndangerous precedent to not only authorize but actually require military \ncustody.\n  Finally, the bill would make it much more difficult to close the \ndetention center at Guantanamo Bay. There simply is no compelling \nreason to keep the facility open and not to bring these detainees to \nmaximum security facilities within the United States. The detention \ncenter is a recruiting tool for those who wish to cause us harm and \nbeen a stain on our Nation's honor. I agree with former Secretary of \nState Colin Powell, who said that ``we have shaken the belief that the \nworld had in America's justice system by keeping [the detention center \nat Guantanamo Bay] open. We don't need it and it's causing us far more \ndamage than any good we get for it.''\n  In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the administration declared a \nbroad and open-ended ``war on terror.'' I have always considered this a \nflawed description of the challenge that confronted us after the 9/11 \nattacks. After all ``terror'' is an endlessly broad and vague term. And \na ``war on terror'' is a war that can never end because terrorism and \nterrorists will always be with us. Because of the never-ending nature \nof this so-called war on terror, it offers a rationale for restricting \ncivil liberties indefinitely. This is not healthy for our democracy or \nfor our ability to inspire other countries to abide by democratic \nprinciples.\n  Mr. President, we will not overcome terrorism with secret prisons, \nwith torture, with degrading treatment, with individuals denied basic \nrights; rather, we shall overcome it by staying true to our highest \nvalues and by insisting on legal safeguards that are the very basis of \nour system of government and freedom. Today is the 220th anniversary of \nthe ratification of the Bill of Rights. The values embodied in that \nremarkable document have bound our Republic together for over 200 years \nand can bind us for 200 more if we hold them close.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate today will pass the National \nDefense Authorization Act for the coming fiscal year. This vote is \nhistoric as Congress has enacted a national defense authorization act \nevery year for the past half century. I commend the Senate for \nmaintaining this steadfast support for our armed services, but this \nlegislation will be remembered for reasons both bad and good. I regret \nthe decision of the House and Senate conferees to include unnecessary \nand potentially harmful provisions related to the detention of \nterrorist suspects. However, I strongly support measures in the \nconference report that will empower the National Guard within the \nDepartment of Defense, enhance protections for military victims of \nsexual violence, increase transparency by limiting unnecessary \nexclusions from the Freedom of Information Act, improve mental health \noutreach to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and make many \nother changes to strengthen our national defense and take care of our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  I continue to strongly oppose the detention related provisions in \nthis conference report, which I believe are unwise and unnecessary. \nThese provisions undermine our Nation's fundamental principles of due \nprocess and civil liberties and inject operational uncertainty into our \ncounterterrorism efforts in a way that I believe harms our national \nsecurity.\n  I strongly oppose section 1021 of this conference report, which \nstatutorily authorizes indefinite detention. I am fundamentally opposed \nto indefinite detention and certainly when the detainee is a U.S. \ncitizen held without charge. Indefinite detention contradicts the most \nbasic principles of law that I subscribed to when I was a prosecutor, \nand it severely weakens our credibility when we criticize other \ngovernments for engaging in similar conduct.\n  Supporters of this measure will argue that this language simply \ncodifies the status quo. That is not good enough. I am not satisfied \nwith the status quo. Under no circumstances should the United States of \nAmerica have a policy of indefinite detention. I fought against Bush \nadministration policies that left us in the situation we face now, with \nindefinite detention being the de facto administration policy. And I \nstrongly opposed President Obama's executive Order on detention when it \nwas announced last March because it contemplated, if not outright \nendorsed, indefinite detention.\n  This is not a partisan issue for me. I have opposed indefinite \ndetention no matter which party holds the keys to the jailhouse. I \nfought to preserve habeas corpus review for those detained at \nGuantanamo Bay because I believe that the United States must uphold the \nprinciples of due process and should only deprive a person of their \nliberty subject to judicial review.\n  Today, I joined Senator Feinstein, Senator Lee, and others to \nintroduce a bill titled the Due Process Guarantee Act. This bill will \nmake clear that neither an authorization to use military force nor a \ndeclaration of war confer unfettered authority to the executive branch \nto hold Americans in indefinite detention. In the 2004 Supreme Court \nopinion in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stated \nunequivocally: ``We have long since made clear that a state of war is \nnot a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the \nNation's citizens.'' It is stunning to me that sponsors of the \nunderlying Senate bill argued for the indefinite detention of U.S. \ncitizens at Guantanamo Bay. We must make clear that our laws do not \nstand for such a proposition. We are a nation of laws, and we must \nadhere vigilantly to the principles of our Constitution. I urge all \nSenators to support this bipartisan effort to protect American values \nand cosponsor the Due Process Guarantee Act.\n  I am also deeply troubled by the mandatory military detention \nrequirements included in section 1022 of this conference report. In the \nfight against al-Qaida and other terrorist threats, we should give our \nintelligence, military, and law enforcement professionals all the tools \nthey need, not limit those tools. But limiting them is exactly what \nthis conference report does. Secretary Panetta has stated unequivocally \nthat ``[t]his provision restrains the Executive Branch's options to \nutilize, in a swift and flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism \ntools that are now legally available.'' Requiring terrorism suspects to \nbe held only in military custody and limiting the available options in \nthe field is unwise and unnecessary.\n  Supporters of the conference report claim that concerns about the \nmandatory military detention section are ``red herrings.'' They claim \nthat they have modified the legislation in ways that give the President \nthe flexibility he needs to apply the provisions without impeding \ninvestigations or undermining operations in the field. The changes are \ntotally inadequate. The Statement of Administration Position, SAP, \ncalls the mandatory military detention section ``unnecessary, untested, \nand legally controversial.'' The SAP goes on to state that ``applying \nthis military custody requirement to individuals inside the United \nStates . . . would raise serious and unsettled legal questions and \nwould be inconsistent with the fundamental American principle that our \nmilitary does not patrol our streets.''\n  Some supporters of the conference report also claim that the national \nsecurity waiver provision is ``a mile wide'' and provides the \nadministration with sufficient flexibility. The intelligence \nprofessionals who work every day to keep our Nation safe disagree. The \nDirector of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, wrote to Senator \nFeinstein that the ``detention provisions, even with the proposed \nwaivers, would introduce unnecessary rigidity at a time when our \nintelligence, military, and law enforcement professionals are working \nmore closely than ever to defend our nation effectively and quickly \nfrom terrorist attacks.''\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am particularly concerned\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\nthat this provision fails to acknowledge or appreciate the vital role \nthat law enforcement and the courts play in our counterterrorism \nefforts. In light of the hundreds of successful prosecutions of \nterrorism defendants in Federal courts, why would we want to remove \nthis option from the table? As Jeh Johnson, the Pentagon's top lawyer, \nsaid recently, the Federal courts are ``well equipped to handle the \nprosecution of dangerous domestic and international terrorists,'' and \n``the military is not the only answer.'' I could not agree more.\n  The implementation procedures required in the legislation are simply \nnot enough to alleviate the potential for problems in the field. As \nSecretary Panetta stated in his recent letter to Senator Levin, this \nprovision may ``needlessly complicate efforts by frontline law \nenforcement professionals to collect critical intelligence concerning \noperations and activities within the United States.'' No one in the \nmilitary, intelligence community, or law enforcement has asked for this \nprovision, and rather than strengthening our national security, it \nmakes us less safe.\n  During floor debate over the Senate bill, FBI Director Mueller wrote \nthat the mandatory military provision would adversely affect the \nBureau's ability to conduct counterterrorism investigations and inject \n``a substantial element of uncertainty'' into its operations. He argued \nthat the provision fails to take into account ``the reality of a \ncounterterrorism investigation.'' The conference report modified the \nmandatory military detention section to preserve the existing law \nenforcement and national security authorities of the FBI, but the \neffect of that new language remains unclear. At our Judiciary Committee \nhearing on December 14, the FBI Director stated that the modified text \n``does not give me a clear path to certainty as to what is going to \nhappen when arrests are made in a particular case.'' The FBI Director \nis particularly concerned with how the legislation will affect the \nBureau's ability to gain the cooperation of suspects. The FBI has a \nlong and successful track record in the cultivation and use of \ncooperating witnesses. But as Director Muller stated, ``The possibility \nlooms that we will lose opportunities to obtain cooperation from the \npersons in the past that we've been fairly successful in gaining.'' I \ncannot understand why the authors of this conference continue to insist \nupon language that will undermine the FBI in its use of this critical \ncounterterrorism authority.\n  The language in the detention subtitle of this conference report is \nthe product of a process that has lacked transparency from the start. \nThese measures directly affect law enforcement, detention, and \nterrorism matters that have traditionally been subject to the \njurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, but neither committee was consulted about \nthese provisions in July when the legislation was first considered by \nthe Armed Services Committee, nor was either committee consulted \nearlier this month when it was modified. I also can see no reason why \nthese provisions were rushed through the committee without the input of \nthe Defense Department and Federal intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies that will be directly affected if this language is enacted. On \nissues of such national significance, the American people deserve an \nopen and transparent process.\n  Supporters of the detention provisions in the conference report \ncontinue to argue that such measures are needed because, they claim, \n``we are a nation at war.'' That does not mean that we should be a \nnation without laws or a nation that does not adhere to the principles \nof our Constitution. We should prosecute those who commit crimes and \nterrorist acts and sentence them to long terms in prison. The \nDepartment of Justice has prosecuted more than 440 terrorists since \nSeptember 11, 2001. We have a very strong record and nothing to fear \nfrom choosing a course that upholds American values and the rule of \nlaw. That is why I also oppose some of onerous funding and \ncertification restrictions that make it virtually impossible to \ntransfer individuals out of Guantanamo or to prosecute individuals \ndetained there in Federal courts.\n  I also strongly oppose section 1029 of the conference report, which \nrequires the Attorney General to consult with the Director of National \nIntelligence and Secretary of Defense before seeking an indictment of \ncertain terrorism suspects. This provision was not considered or \ndebated by the Senate and certainly not by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, which I chair. I oppose this provision because it needlessly \nundermines the authority of the Attorney General and is an \nunprecedented infringement on the prosecutorial independence of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Regrettably, the detention language in this conference report remains \nfundamentally flawed. The detainee provisions will codify a practice of \nindefinite detention that has no place in the justice system of any \ndemocracy. They will cause further damage to our reputation as a nation \nthat respects the fundamental right of due process, harm the efforts of \nintelligence and law enforcement officials in the field, and may limit \ntheir ability to track down terrorists and bring them to justice. My \nsupport for the Defense bill should not be construed as support for its \ndetention provisions, which I oppose in the strongest possible terms.\n  Instead, my support for the bill reflects the inclusion of the \nNational Guard Empowerment Act, a bill I drafted with Senator Lindsey \nGraham, as an amendment to its underlying text. The Guard empowerment \nprovisions have been understandably overshadowed by the debate on \nother, more contentious provisions in the bill, but I nevertheless \nbelieve that these provisions will set the stage for dramatic changes \nto our military force structure in the years to come.\n  Beginning in May, a new national security consensus quietly formed in \nCongress around an issue at the core of our national security. Seventy-\none senators from both parties steadily added their support to S. 1025, \nthe bill that Senator Graham and I called Guard Empowerment II. The \nprovisions of our bill built upon the first Guard empowerment bill that \nI introduced with Senator Kit Bond of Missouri. That measure became law \nin 2008 and elevated the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the rank \nof four-star general. This year's bill had as its headlining provision \nan effort to make the Chief a statutory member of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. Despite the vociferous opposition of Active component generals \nin the Pentagon--including all six sitting Joint Chiefs of Staff--a \nbipartisan congressional consensus formed around S. 1025 and Guard \nempowerment. I was pleased that the Senate included its provisions in \nour version of the National Defense Authorization Act late last month \nand that the conferees retained a majority of those provisions in the \nconference report.\n  The new consensus on the National Guard comes as the budget debates \nof this Congress have fractured the Cold War national security \nconsensus of the last half century. While those fractures were an \ninevitable outcome of the end of the Soviet empire, what will replace \nthe Cold War consensus remains unclear. Some Members of Congress argue \nfor diplomatic and military retrenchment from every corner of the globe \nback to Fortress America. Others believe that we must expand, not \nshrink, our international footprint. Yet nearly everyone agrees that \nbudgetary factors must mean a change in the way the Pentagon does \nbusiness--and that change cannot wait.\n  The seeds of that change were sown a decade ago. In the days and \nweeks following 9/11, the former ``strategic reserve'' became, of \nnecessity, fully operational. The National Guard and Reserve \ncomponents, once a Cold War failsafe, were called into regular rotation \nin the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our country simply could not field \nthe forces we needed without calling on the Guard and Reserve. \nSimultaneously, America experienced domestic disasters on an \nunprecedented scale. In each situation, the President called on the \nNational Guard as the military first responders to help citizens in \nneed. Today, the metamorphosis from a strategic reserve to an \noperational reserve is complete.\n  Yet entrenched bureaucratic interests still resist what most \nAmericans now accept as an accomplished fact. The Joint Chiefs fought \nour efforts to bring the Chief of the Guard Bureau into the ``Tank'' \nnot because they misunderstand the value of the Guard and\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\nReserve, but precisely because they fear that value proposition may \nthreaten the size and budget of their Active components in the years to \ncome.\n  Nevertheless the Active component must shrink, both as a consequence \nof our current budgetary reality and to reflect the constitutional \nvision the Framers had of a small standing Army augmented by a larger \ncadre of citizen soldiers. Simultaneously, the Guard and Reserve must \ngrow so that those cuts to the Active force can be quickly and easily \nreversed if the circumstances demand it. Just a year ago, no one \npredicted our operations to oust Muammar Qadhafi. In a world where \nmilitary needs change day by day, we must not hollow out the force. To \navoid that outcome in a period of austere budgets, we must depend more \nand more on the National Guard and Reserve.\n  To that end, the conferees included section 512 in this Defense bill \nwhich adds the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff. It also reinforces the duties and responsibilities of the \nChief as listed in 10 U.S.C. Sec.  10502 in accordance with the listing \nof responsibilities of the Chief already in that section. This \nprovision is historic and will dramatically improve the advice that the \nPresident and Secretary of Defense receive on matters of national \nsecurity and the defense budget.\n  Section 511, ``Leadership of the National Guard Bureau,'' \nreestablishes the Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau as a \nlieutenant general and excludes the positions of the Chief and the Vice \nChief of the National Guard Bureau from limitations on the number of \ngeneral and flag officers in the Department of Defense. Reinstating the \nDeputy position at the National Guard Bureau will give the Chief \nflexibility at a time when he sorely needs it and providing a third \nstar for the position will give it more institutional clout.\n  Section 515 implements the outcomes of a negotiation between the \nCouncil of Governors and the Department of Defense by authorizing the \nPresident to order the Federal Reserve component to Active Duty to \nprovide assistance in response to a major disaster or emergency. In \naddition to authorizing a Reserve forces callup for domestic disasters \nand emergencies, it codifies the dual-status title 10 and title 32 \ncommander as the usual and customary command relationship for military \noperations inside the United States, a key victory for Federal-State \nintegration of military command and control.\n  Section 518, ``Consideration of Reserve Component Officers for \nAppointment to Certain Command Positions,'' is a modified version of a \nprovision of S. 1025 which would have reserved the positions of \ncommander, Army North, and commander, Air Force North, for National \nGuard officers with an emphasis on the consideration of current and \nformer adjutants general. Instead, the section requires that Guard and \nReserve officers be considered for these positions whenever they are \nvacant.\n  Section 1085, ``Use of State Partnership Program Funds for Certain \nPurposes,'' includes a limited authorization of the State Partnership \nProgram which is the major vehicle for the National Guard of the States \nto participate in international security assistance and capacity \nbuilding missions at the request of the State Department chief of \nmission and geographic combatant commander.\n  Last but certainly not least, section 1080A, ``Report on Costs of \nUnits of the Reserve Components and the Active Components of the Armed \nForces,'' institutes the ``similar unit'' cost report proposed by S. \n1025 with some added detail and while retaining the Comptroller General \nevaluation of the Department's report. That last requirement is \nimportant to keep the Department of Defense honest in its assumptions \nand analysis leading to conclusions about the relative cost of Active \nand Reserve units.\n  The Reserve component cost report will undergird efforts by the \nSenate National Guard Caucus in the years to come. While it has long \nbeen common knowledge that the National Guard and Reserves are cheaper \nto maintain in dwell than Active-Duty Forces, the report will prove \nthat colloquial wisdom and bolster the arguments of the Congress in a \nfuture push to reduce the size of the Active component as we draw down \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan while growing the size of the Reserve \ncomponents.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees included my language to narrow \nthe Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, exemption in the bill for \nDepartment of Defense critical infrastructure security information. \nThis improvement adds a public interest balancing test requiring that \nthe Secretary of Defense consider whether the public interest in the \ndisclosure of this information outweighs the government's need to \nwithhold the information when evaluating FOIA requests. The addition of \nthis measure to the National Defense Authorization Act will help ensure \nthat FOIA remains a viable tool for access to Department of Defense \ninformation that impacts the health and safety of the American public.\n  As I said at the outset, this National Defense Authorization Act will \nbe remembered both for changing our process of detaining and \nprosecuting suspected terrorists and for empowering the National Guard. \nI continue to oppose the changes the act will make to our \ncounterterrorism legal regime. But I nevertheless support how the act \nwill improve the sourcing and fielding of military forces in the years \nto come. I will look to fix the former and further improve the latter \nin future legislation.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today I rise to express my deep concern \nthat the 2012 National Department of Defense Authorization Act \nprovisions pertaining to detainee treatment fail to strike the \nappropriate, important balance between national security, due process, \nand civil liberties. Sections 1021, 1022, and 1023 are the latest in a \nseries of legislative proposals that provide ever-narrowing latitude \nfor dealing with terrorism suspects, whether in the U.S. or abroad.\n  I am concerned, that these provisions take us one small, but \nsignificant, step down the road towards a state in which ordinary \ncitizens live in fear of the military, rather than the free society \nthat has marked this great nation since the Bill of Rights was ratified \n220 years ago, in 1791.\n  The new detention authorities thrust upon our military in this bill \nare an assault on our civil liberties and do not belong on our books. \nThey were not requested by the Pentagon, in fact they have been \nresisted by the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the directors of National Intelligence and the FBI. They \ndo not make us safer and, to the contrary, they will create dangerous \nconfusion within our national security community.\n  Under these sections, a terrorism suspect must be remanded to U.S. \nmilitary custody, even when that suspect presents no imminent threat to \npublic safety and is being held under suspicion of committing a U.S. \ncrime. The suspect may be held indefinitely. Indeed, if the suspect is \ntransferred to Guantanamo, it may be a practical reality that the \nsuspect must be held indefinitely, thanks to the onerous certification \nrequirements contained in Section 1023. If not sent to Guantanamo, the \nsuspect may be rendered to a foreign power, where he may be subject to \ncoercive interrogation, torture, or death. Or, the individual may \nsimply remain in custody of our own military, waiting for the cessation \nof an endless conflict against an idea.\n  As my colleagues from Vermont and Oregon, from Colorado and \nCalifornia, have already said so eloquently, these provisions reflect \nan unfortunate and unwise shift away from the current law, in which the \ncriminal justice system is presumed to be sufficient for those who \ncommit crimes on U.S. soil. No system is perfect, but the federal \ncriminal justice system is considered by many around the world to be \nthe gold standard for fairness, transparency and reliability. Since 9/\n11, the civilian criminal process has been successful in securing \nconvictions and lengthy sentences against hundreds of terrorism \nsuspects.\n  This is compared to just six convictions in military tribunals, and \ntwo of these individuals are walking free today. A third, Ibrahim al \nQosi, was convicted of being a Taliban fighter. Under his sentence of 2 \nyears, he would be due to be released next summer. But when he serves \nhis sentence, he likely will not be released. Instead, he will be \ndetained until our undefined hostilities against Islamic extremism and \nterrorism conclude. In other words, he\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nwill be detained indefinitely. Criminal process like this is little \nbetter than no process at all. It ought to be reserved for the rarest \ncases where the civilian criminal justice system is not suitable. It \nshould not be made the new standard.\n  If we are going to short-circuit the criminal justice system, we \nought to at least have good reason to do so. At a minimum, I would \nexpect the President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, \nor the Director of National Intelligence to make the case that military \ncustody is the only way to appropriately handle terrorists. But that is \nnot what happened here. No one is calling for these new powers. They \nare being thrust upon our military.\n  President Obama has said that these provisions will hinder his \nability to prosecute the campaign against terrorists. The Attorney \nGeneral and the Director of National Intelligence have said that these \nprovisions threaten to undermine the collection of intelligence from \nsuspected terrorists.\n  They don't want these authorities.\n  The military does not want them either. The Secretary of Defense has \nsaid that the provisions will unnecessarily complicate its core mission \nof protecting our nation and projecting military force abroad. These \nprovisions do not make sense as a matter of defense policy, and, \nbecause the meaning of some of the key terms is deliberately unclear, \nwe can not even predict the precise impact that they will have.\n  In the best-case scenario, we will end up in a situation with minor \nchanges to an existing detainee policy that has already proven to \ninspire and sustain this and the next generation of extremists who wish \nto destroy this country. In the worst-case scenario, we make several \nsignificant changes that hinder our ability to find and destroy this \ncurrent generation of extremists.\n  I do not accept the underlying assumption of these unnecessary new \nprovisions that the threat the United States faces is one that can be \ndefended by more guns, taller walls, and deeper holes that we \n``disappear'' people into. In fact, defense from the threats of today \nand tomorrow called ``asymmetric'' because they do not attempt to meet \nus on the battlefield with equal capabilities requires a new paradigm, \nthe concept of defense in depth. To address asymmetric threats, \nincluding networks of extremists determined to carry out acts of \nterrorism, law enforcement and the Defense Department must work \ncooperatively to protect U.S. interests using their respective \nstrengths in authorities and levels of response.\n  Instead of strengthening our ability to confront asymmetric threats, \nthese unwelcome new authorities reinforce the philosophy that the \nmilitary is the only preeminent institution of national security, with \nlaw enforcement relegated to a limited support role. That may have been \nan appropriate philosophy for the world in 1961, but it did not help us \nin 2001, and will not help us in 2021. These new authorities do nothing \nto change that and will not make us any safer. The only effective \ncomprehensive model for national security is one that strengthens both \nour law enforcement and military to fight threats within their \nrespective areas of expertise.\n  Another deeply concerning aspect of the detainee provisions in the \nDefense Authorization bill is what they say about the ability of the \nmilitary to detain U.S. citizens. Section 1021 expands the 2001 \nAuthorization of the Use of Military Force to include the authority to \ndetain and hold indefinitely any person, even a U.S. citizen, if the \nmilitary suspects that such a person has supported any force associated \nwith al-Qaeda.\n  While I believe it acceptable for lethal military actions to be taken \nagainst U.S. citizens abroad who have clearly taken up arms against \nthis Nation, I am concerned about the slow but steady creep of the \nmilitary into areas that traditionally have been reserved for civilian \nlaw enforcement. Testifying yesterday before the Judiciary Committee, \nFBI Director Robert Mueller said he has serious concerns about the \npotential future ramifications of introducing military forces into the \ncriminal justice process.\n  At the local level, it is often difficult to distinguish whether an \nindividual in possession of bomb-making components is a hardened \nterrorist coordinating with al-Qaeda; is a troubled, dangerous, but \naffiliated teenager; or is completely innocent of any crime at all. In \nthe rush to ``repel borders'' at the early stages of investigations, \nmistakes will be made. We need to make sure that these mistakes do not \noverrun the constitutional protections we all enjoy as Americans.\n  It is true, as supporters of these provisions have argued, that \nSection 1021 contains a limitation that the authorization of force does \nnot include the right to hold citizens in violations of their \nconstitutional rights. That is some comfort, but not enough. As I sat \nin the presiding chair during debate over this bill, I heard my \ncolleagues argue that we are in a time of war and that, during times of \nwar, U.S. citizens have no constitutional protections against being \ntreated as a prisoner of war. Even if there was broad agreement about \nthe constitutional protections citizens enjoy against extrajudicial \nkilling or indefinite detention, who will enforce them? Under this \nbill, that task would seem to be left to the President and to the \nmilitary. Were my life or liberty at stake, I would want the benefit of \nan independent judiciary. So, too, I think would the vast majority of \nmy fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, we are in conflict against terrorists. I do not doubt \nor dispute that. But this is not the first time that has been the case. \nDuring the beginning part of the last century, anarchists committed a \nstring of bombings, usually targeting police officers or civilians. In \n1901, an anarchist assassinated President McKinley. In the First Red \nScare during the early part of the century, a plot was uncovered to \nbomb 36 leaders of government and industry. During the 1960s and 70s, \nthe Weather Underground declared as its mission to overthrow the U.S. \ngovernment. Members planted bombs in the Capitol, the Department of \nState and the Pentagon.\n  Each of these threats, and others, has before placed an existential \nfear in the minds of Americans. We have not always acted well. The \nSedition Act of 1918, the internment of Japanese Americans during the \nSecond World War, and the House Un-American Activities Committee and \nHollywood blacklisting following the war are three notable examples of \naction, taken in the face of severe threat, which now the vast majority \nof Americans look back upon with deep regret.\n  As technology has advanced, so has the ability of the government to \nreach into our lives, whether through unseen drones and hidden \nelectronic surveillance, omnipresent cameras and advanced facial \nrecognition programs, or unfettered access to our telephone and \nInternet records.\n  The advance of technology, however, is not justification for the \nretreat of liberty, especially not when we have at our disposal a \ncriminal justice system that is up to the task of keeping us safe.\n  I plan to vote for the Conference Report of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act because I agree with much of what is within it. \nDuring a time of war, we cannot allow our military to go unauthorized. \nWe cannot allow our troops to go unpaid. The NDAA provides oversight of \nand spending limitations for the military. It elevates the head of the \nNational Guard to the Joint Chiefs level, which is necessary to ensure \nthat military leadership adequately considers the unique reserve \ncapacity role now filled by the Guard. The bill will also begin to \naddress the inability of Customs and Border Patrol agents to share \ninformation necessary to identify military and other counterfeits at \nour borders.\n  Though we were not able to remove the dangerous and counterproductive \nprovisions contained in Sections 1021, 1022 and 1023 from the NDAA \ntoday, we are not done trying. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to ensure that we maintain the balance between security and \nliberty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 1540 be extended \nuntil 4 p.m., with all other provisions of the previous order remaining \nin effect; further, that at 4 p.m., the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nadoption of the conference report; that upon the disposition of the \nconference report and H.\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nCon. Res. 92, the Senate resume executive session and the consideration \nof the Christen nomination, as provided under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with this agreement, there will be two \nvotes at 4 p.m. The first will be on the adoption of the Defense \nauthorization conference report and the second vote on the confirmation \nof the nomination of Morgan Christen to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the \nNinth Circuit.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the National Defense \nAuthorization Act conference report now pending before the Senate.\n  I thank my colleague from Colorado, Senator Udall, as well as my \ncolleague from California, Senator Feinstein, for engaging in a \nspirited and important--perhaps historic--debate during the \nconsideration of this authorization bill on the floor of the Senate. I \nespecially thank Senator Feinstein. It was a pleasure to work with her \nto insert language which I think moved us closer to a position she and \nI both share concerning the language in this important bill.\n  I have the highest respect for the chairman and the ranking member of \nthis committee, Senators Levin and McCain, who have worked diligently \nand hard on a bill which has become a hallmark of congressional \nactivity each and every year, particularly in the Senate. It takes a \nspecial effort for them to produce an authorization bill of this \ncomplexity and challenge. They do it without fail and they do it in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  For those critics of Congress--and there are many--who look at this \nbill, you can see the best of the Senate in terms of the effort and the \nprofessionalism these two gentlemen apply, along with the entire \ncommittee, in bringing this bill to the floor.\n  This bill does a number of good things for our troops and for my home \nState of Illinois, and I am thankful to the chairman and the ranking \nmember for those provisions. There is important language about public-\nprivate partnerships regarding the U.S. Army that will have special \nvalue at the Rock Island Arsenal, where some of the most dedicated and \ncompetent civilian individuals continue to serve this country's \nnational security, meeting the highest levels of standards and conduct \nand performance. They will have a chance to continue to do that work, \nand it is important they continue to have that chance in this weak \neconomy when so many people are struggling to find jobs.\n  The legislation provides the Chief of the National Guard with an \nequal seat at the table with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to ensure the \nneeds of our brave Army and Air National Guard personnel are heard at \nthe highest levels. It makes it easier for reserve units to access \nmental health services by providing that access during drill weekends. \nIt also provides our men and women in uniform with a much deserved pay \nincrease, which is imperative in light of their heroic service and the \nstate of our economy today.\n  I must say, though, there are provisions within this bill which still \nconcern me relative to the treatment and detention of terrorism \nsuspects.\n  First, we need to agree on the starting point, and the starting point \nshould be clear on both sides of the aisle. There are those who \nthreaten the United States, those who would use terrorist tactics to \nkill innocent people, as they did on 9/11. We are fortunate, through \nthe good leadership of President George W. Bush and President Obama, \nthat we have been spared another attack since 9/11, but vigilance is \nrequired if we are to continue to keep this country safe. That is a \nbipartisan mission. It is shared by every Member of Congress, \nregardless of their political affiliation.\n  We salute the men and women in uniform, first, for all the work and \nbravery they have put into that effort, but quickly behind them we will \nadd so many others in our law enforcement community; for example, those \nindividuals at every level--Federal, State and local--who are engaged \nin keeping America safe. We salute the executive branch in its \nentirety, including the Department of Homeland Security, the White \nHouse, the National Security Advisors, and all of those who have made \nthis a successful effort.\n  The obvious question we have to ask ourselves is this: If for 10 \nyears we have been safe as a nation, why is this bill changing the way \nwe detain and treat terrorism suspects?\n  I will tell you there has been an ongoing effort by several members \nof this committee and Senate to change the basic approach to dealing \nwith terrorism, to create a presumption that terrorist suspects would \nbe treated first subject to military detention and their cases then \nconsidered before military tribunals.\n  This, in and of itself, is not a bad idea. It could be right, under \ncertain circumstances, but it does raise a question: If to this point \nin time we have been able to keep America safe using the Department of \nJustice, law enforcement, and the courts of our land, together with \nmilitary tribunals, why are we changing?\n  The record is pretty clear. Since 9/11, more than 400 terrorism \nsuspects have been successfully prosecuted in the courts of America. \nThese are individuals who have been subjected to FBI investigation, \nthey have been read their Miranda rights, they have been tried in our \ncourts in the same manner as those accused of crimes are tried every \nsingle day, and they have been found guilty--400 of them--during the \nsame interval that 6--6--have been tried by military tribunals.\n  Overwhelmingly, our criminal court system has been successful in \nkeeping America safe, but that is not good enough for many Members of \nthe Senate. They are still bound and determined to push more of them \ninto the military tribunal system for no good reason. These people who \nhave been tried successfully when accused of terrorism have been safely \nincarcerated in the Federal penitentiaries across America, including in \nmy home State of Illinois at the Marion Federal Prison. Not one \nsuggestion has been made that the communities surrounding these prisons \nnor the prisoners themselves are under any threat. What we have instead \nis this presumption that isn't borne by the facts or by our experience.\n  I voted for the Senate version of this bill with the hope that the \nMembers of the Senate and House who were negotiating the final bill \nwould remove some of the detainee provisions that concern me. I want to \nacknowledge that the conference committee did make some positive \nchanges. But I continue to have serious concerns because provisions in \nthe bill would limit the flexibility of any President in combatting \nterrorism, create uncertainty for law enforcement, intelligence, and \ndefense officials regarding how they handle suspected terrorists, and \nraise serious constitutional concerns.\n  I am especially concerned about section 1022 in the conference \nreport. This provision would, for the first time in American history, \nrequire our military to take custody of certain terrorism suspects in \nthe United States. Our most senior defense and intelligence officials \nhave raised serious concerns about this provision. FBI Director Robert \nMueller strongly objects to the military custody requirement. For those \nwho need reminding, Robert Mueller served as a Federal judge in \nCalifornia and was appointed to this position as head of the FBI by \nRepublican President George W. Bush. He has been retained in that \noffice by Democratic President Barack Obama. I believe he is a \nconsummate professional who has dedicated his life, at least in the \nlast 10 years-plus, to keeping America safe. I trust his judgment. I \nrespect his integrity.\n  In a letter to the Senate, Director Mueller says the bill will \n``inhibit our ability to convince covered arrestees to cooperate \nimmediately, and provide criminal intelligence.''\n  He was asked after the conference report whether the changes absolved \nany of his concerns, and he said he was still concerned. I will go to \nthat in a moment. Director Mueller concluded that the provision I am \nraising ``introduces a substantial element of uncertainty as to what \nprocedures are to be followed in the course of a terrorism \ninvestigation in the United States.''\n  Considering the source of this concern, the Director of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation who has been responsible ultimately for the \nsuccessful prosecution of 400 suspected terrorists, we should take his \nconcerns to heart.\n  The Justice Department, which then prosecutes terrorism suspects, \nshares\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\nDirector Mueller's concerns. Here is what they said:\n\n       Rather than provide new tools and flexibility for FBI \n     operators and our intelligence professionals, this \n     legislation creates new procedures and paperwork for FBI \n     agents, intelligence lawyers and counter-terrorism \n     prosecutors who have conducted hundreds of successful \n     terrorism investigations and prevented numerous attacks \n     inside this country over the past decade.\n\n  The supporters of this legislation have responded to these concerns \nby pointing to the fact that the bill allows the Secretary of Defense \nto waive the military custody requirement. But the Justice Department \nsays the administrative burdens of obtaining a waiver could hinder \nongoing counterterrorism operations. Here is how they explained it:\n\n       While the legislation proposes a waiver in certain \n     circumstances to address these concerns, this proposal \n     inserts confusion and bureaucracy when FBI agents and \n     counter-terrorism prosecutors are making split-second \n     decisions. In a rapidly developing situation--like that \n     involving Najibullah Zazi traveling to New York in September \n     2009 to bomb the subway system--they need to be completely \n     focused on incapacitating the terrorist suspect and gathering \n     critical intelligence about his plans.\n\n  The authors of this legislation say they made changes to the military \ncustody requirement to respond to these concerns raised by Director \nMueller and the Department of Justice. But in my view, these changes \ndon't go nearly far enough. They continue to create uncertainty and \nimpose administrative burdens on our counterterrorism professionals \nwhom we depend on to keep us safe.\n  The changes in the legislation do not change the fundamental premise. \nThey create a presumption that a terrorism suspect arrested in the \nUnited States should be transferred to military custody, despite the \nfact--despite the fact--that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has \nkept America safe since\n9/11.\n  I am not alone in my feelings. This morning, an editorial in the \nWashington Post said:\n\n       [These provisions]--while less extreme--are still \n     unnecessary and unwise. . . . [L]awmakers have . . . \n     introduced confusion in the form of directives that threaten \n     to bollix up law enforcement and military personnel when they \n     most need to be decisive.\n\n  Why in the world would we create uncertainty and bureaucracy when, \nwith every second that ticks away, American lives can be in danger?\n  Just yesterday in the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Robert \nMueller testified he is still deeply concerned about section 1022, \ndespite the changes made in this conference report. Here is what \nDirector Mueller said:\n\n       Given the statute the way it is now, it does not give me a \n     clear path to certainty as to what is going to happen when \n     arrests are made in a particular case. The possibility looms \n     that we will lose opportunities to obtain cooperation from \n     the persons in the past that we've been fairly successful in \n     gaining.\n\n  That, in and of itself, should give pause to every member of the \nSenate. When we consider this objection from the Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the lead official charged with \ncombatting terrorism in the United States, shouldn't we take Director \nMueller's concerns to heart? Do we want the FBI to have uncertainty the \nnext time they stop and detain a suspected terrorist in the United \nStates?\n  I want to address another provision, section 1021. I was very \nconcerned that the original version of the legislation would, for the \nfirst time in history, authorize indefinite detention in the United \nStates. But we have agreed, on a bipartisan basis, to include language \nin the bill offered by Senator Feinstein that makes it clear this bill \ndoes not change existing detention authority in any way. What it means \nis, the Supreme Court will make the decision who can and cannot be \ndetained indefinitely without trial, not the Senate.\n  I believe the Constitution does not authorize indefinite detention in \nthe United States. Some of my colleagues see it differently. They claim \nthe Hamdi decision upheld indefinite detention. It didn't. Hamdi was \ncaptured in Afghanistan, not in the United States. Justice O'Connor, \nthe author of the opinion, carefully stated the Hamdi decision was \nlimited to ``individuals who fought against the United States in \nAfghanistan as part of the Taliban.''\n  Some of my colleagues also cited the Padilla case, claiming it is a \nprecedent for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens captured in the \nUnited States. But look at what happened in the Padilla case. Padilla \nis a U.S. citizen who was placed in U.S. custody. The Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, one of the most conservative in the land, upheld his \nmilitary detention. But then, before the Supreme Court had the chance \nto review the Fourth Circuit's decision, George W. Bush's \nadministration transferred him out of military custody, prosecuting him \nin an article III criminal court. To this day, the Supreme Court has \nnever ruled on the question of whether it is constitutional to \nindefinitely detain a U.S. citizen captured in the United States. That \ndecision must be decided by the Supreme Court, not by the Senate, \nthanks to the Feinstein amendment.\n  I support the inclusion of the Feinstein amendment in this bill. I \ncontinue to believe there is no need for this provision overall and \nthat it should have been removed.\n  I also continue to oppose provisions in the conference report that \nlimit the administration's ability to close the Guantanamo Bay \ndetention facility. Section 1027 of this legislation provides that no \ndetainee held at Guantanamo can be transferred to the United States \neven for the purpose of holding him incarcerated for the rest of his \nlife in a Federal supermaximum security facility.\n  There is absolutely no reason for this prohibition. Section 1026 of \nthis legislation provides clearly that the government may not construct \nor modify any facility in the United States for the purpose of holding \na Guantanamo Bay detainee.\n  Let me bring this closer to home. We have offered for sale in the \nState of Illinois a prison built by our State that has not been used or \nopened in its entirety. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has stated they \nare interested in purchasing it because of the overcrowded conditions \nin many Federal prisons. We would, of course, like to see that done--\nnot just for the revenue that would come to the State of Illinois but \nbecause it would create jobs in my State.\n  In the course of deliberating it, controversy arose as to whether \nGuantanamo detainees would be placed in this prison. Initially, the \nadministration said they would, and I supported them. But ultimately it \nbecame clear that there was opposition to going forward with this \npurchase of the Illinois prison if there was any likelihood Guantanamo \ndetainees would be incarcerated at this prison. We have now made it \nclear--and I wish to make it clear for the record--that despite my \npersonal views on this issue, I believe the law is clear that the \nThomson Prison, once under Federal jurisdiction, will not house \nGuantanamo detainees. That has been a stated policy. It is now going to \nbe a matter of law in this Defense authorization. Regardless of my \npersonal feelings on the subject, it is the governing law, and I will \nnot try to change the situation of Thomson in any way as long as I \nserve in the Senate when it comes to this important issue.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues--whom I disagree with--are \ndetermined to keep Guantanamo open at all costs. I disagree. When we \nconsider the expense of detention at Guantanamo and the reputation of \nthat facility, I believe the President was right, initially, when he \ntalked about the fact that we needed to, at some point, bring detention \nat Guantanamo to a close. My feelings are not only shared by the \nPresident but also by GEN Colin Powell; former Republican Secretaries \nof State James Baker, Henry Kissinger, and Condoleezza Rice; former \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates; ADM Mike Mullen; and, GEN David \nPetraeus.\n  There is great irony here. For 8 long years during the previous \nRepublican administration, Republicans on the floor argued time and \nagain that it was inappropriate--some said even unconstitutional--for \nCongress to ask basic questions about the Bush administration's \npolicies on issues such as Iraq, torture, waterboarding, and \nwarrantless wiretapping. Time and again, we were told Congress should \ndefer to President Bush, our Commander in Chief. Let me give one \nexample.\n  My friend Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, on September 19, \n2007, said:\n\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\n\n       The last thing we need in any war is to have the ability of \n     535 people who are worried about the next election to be able \n     to micromanage how you fight the war. This is not only \n     micromanagement, this is a constitutional shift of power.\n\n  With a Democratic President, obviously some of my colleagues have had \na change of heart. They think it is not only appropriate but urgent for \nCongress to limit this President's authority to combat terrorism, \ndespite the success we have had since 9/11 under President Bush and \nPresident Obama keeping America safe. This is a clear political double \nstandard. It is unnecessary. Look at the track record.\n  Since 9/11, our counterterrorism professionals have prevented another \nattack on the United States, and more than 400 terrorists have \nsuccessfully been prosecuted and convicted in Federal courts. Here are \njust a few of them: Umar Faruk Abdulmutallab, the Underwear Bomber; \nRamzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \nOmar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik; the 20th 9/11 hijacker, \nZacarias Moussaoui; and Richard Reid, the Shoe Bomber--all prosecuted \nin the criminal courts of this land successfully and safely \nincarcerated in our Federal prisons. Something which many on the other \nside refuse to acknowledge, and argue is impossible, has, in fact, \nhappened over and over again over 400 times.\n  Why do we want to change this system when it is working so well to \nkeep America safe?\n  The fact that these detainee provisions have caused so many \ndisagreements and such heated debate demonstrates the danger of \nenacting them into law. We shouldn't impose this kind of uncertainty on \nlaw enforcement, defense, and intelligence who are working to protect \nAmerica. We should not limit the flexibility of the administration to \nrespond to suspected terrorists in the most effective way, and we \nshould not raise serious constitutional questions by requiring the \nmilitary to detain people in the United States.\n  I have a letter from the Agents Association of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, dated December 7, 2011, raising many of the same issues \nwhich I have raised. I will say we contacted the Agents Association \nafter the conference and asked them their reaction, and they said they \nstill stood behind their statements of December 7, 2011. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association,\n                                  Arlington, VA, December 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Howard P. McKeon,\n     Chairman, House Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Adam Smith,\n     Ranking Member, House Armed Services Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: On behalf of the more \n     than 12,000 active duty and retired FBI Agents who are \n     members of the FBI Agents Association (``FBIAA''), I write \n     today to express our concerns about Section 1032 of S. 1867, \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. \n     Section 1032 requires that persons detained in connection \n     with incidents of terrorism be held in military custody and \n     leaves critical operational details unresolved. Like many in \n     the federal law enforcement and intelligence communities, the \n     FBIAA is concerned that this language undermines the ability \n     of our counterterrorism experts to conduct effective \n     investigations, Accordingly, we urge the conferees working to \n     reconcile H.R. 1540 and S. 1867 through the conference \n     process to reject Section 1032.\n       Section 1032 establishes a presumption for military custody \n     for individuals detained in connection with acts of terrorism \n     against the United States. While Section 1032 includes some \n     exceptions and waivers to the military custody requirement, \n     they are limited in scope and could create additional layers \n     of bureaucracy at critical points in our investigations. \n     Injecting this level of uncertainty and delay into terrorism \n     investigations could undermine law enforcement effectiveness. \n     To truly fight terrorism, all of the nation's law enforcement \n     assets should be deployed and enabled to act nimbly. This can \n     only be accomplished if our laws preserve flexibility and \n     prevent unnecessary bureaucracy from hampering law \n     enforcement activities.\n       As part of the nation's counterterrorism strategy, FBI \n     Agents work in the United States and abroad as an integral \n     part of the intelligence-gathering and interrogation process. \n     These interrogations are often instrumental in obtaining \n     information that is essential to efforts to thwart subsequent \n     acts of terror. The interrogation of detained persons, \n     however, must be adapted to each specific individual and \n     circumstance in order to be effective. Obtaining cooperation \n     or information requires a mix of patience, leverage, and \n     relationship-building that is inconsistent with the language \n     in Section 1032, which under a presumption of military \n     custody would require a waiver early in the process. FBI \n     Agents already work closely with the military and prosecutors \n     to conduct effective investigations, and interjecting a \n     requirement to obtain waivers from the Secretary of Defense, \n     while well-intentioned, risks delays and miscommunications \n     that would not serve the goal of conducting effective \n     investigations,\n       The FBIAA shares the goal of enacting and adopting policies \n     that protect Americans from terrorism, and we appreciate the \n     difficult task before the conferees working to reconcile H.R. \n     1540 and S. 1867. To this end, we urge the rejection of any \n     language that risks unnecessarily limiting the flexibility \n     that is essential to adapting our investigations to the \n     circumstances of each investigation. In the interest of \n     national security, please reject Section 1032 in the final \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. If \n     you have any questions or would like to discuss the FBIAA's \n     views on this issue, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Konrad Motyka,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have a press report that was released \ntoday relative to the testimony of Director Robert Mueller of the FBI, \nwhich I referenced in my speech. So that his statement will be reported \nmore fully at this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the press report from Politico.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From www.politico.com, Dec. 14, 2011]\n\n  On National Defense Authorization Act, Robert Mueller Not Satisfied\n\n                           (By Josh Gerstein)\n\n       FBI Director Robert Mueller said Wednesday said he remains \n     concerned that a defense bill containing provisions about \n     military custody for terrorism suspects could interfere with \n     the FBI's ability to investigate terrorist incidents and \n     interrogate those believed responsible.\n       On Monday, a House-Senate conference committee announced a \n     revised version of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     that lawmakers said addressed many of the concerns that led \n     White House officials to threaten a veto. However, at a \n     Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday morning, Mueller \n     said he remains worried about aspects of the bill.\n       ``The drafters of the statute went some distance to \n     resolving the issue related to our authority but the language \n     did not really fully address my concerns. . . .'' Mueller \n     said during questioning by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), \n     who opposes the detainee-related language in the bill. ``I \n     was satisfied with part of it with regard to the authority, I \n     still have concerns and uncertainties that are raised by the \n     statute.''\n       Mueller said he fears that the legislation would muddle the \n     roles of the FBI and the military.\n       The bill ``talks about not interrupting interrogations, \n     which is good but gaining cooperation is something different \n     than continuing an interrogation,'' Mueller said. ``My \n     concern is that . . . you don't want to have FBI and military \n     showing up at the scene at the same time on a covered person \n     (under the law], or with a covered person there may be some \n     uncovered persons there, with some uncertainty as to who has \n     the role and who's going to do what.''\n       Mueller said later that he worries confusion caused by the \n     legislation could affect the FBI's ability to build rapport \n     with suspects.\n       ``Given the statute the way it is now, it does not give me \n     a clear path to certainty as to what is going to happen when \n     arrests are made in a particular case. And the facts are gray \n     as they often are at that point,'' the FBI director said \n     under questioning by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) ``The \n     possibility looms that we will lose opportunities to obtain \n     cooperation from the persons in the past that we've been \n     fairly successful in gaining.''\n       Backers of the defense bill say it will improve \n     intelligence collection by making military custody the \n     default for certain terrorism suspects. President Barack \n     Obama has established civilian custody and courts as the \n     default for terrorism cases, with the option to direct them \n     to military commissions when the Justice and Defense \n     departments deem it appropriate.\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\n       Since the conference bill was unveiled Monday, the White \n     House has been mute about whether the changes to the bill are \n     enough to win Obama's signature or whether he plans to carry \n     through with the veto threat.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nhis very eloquent remarks; also, the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Udall, \nwhom I had the pleasure of hearing from my office. I think they have \nencapsulated the situation we find ourselves in very well.\n  Mr. President, I wish to follow up on the detention authorities in \nthe Defense Authorization bill and announce that today I am introducing \nlegislation to clearly state that citizens apprehended in the United \nStates shall not be indefinitely detained by the military.\n  This new legislation is called the Due Process Guarantee Act of 2011. \nI am joined by Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nto which this bill will go, Senator Lee, a member of that committee, \nSenator Kirk, Senator Mark Udall, Senator Paul, Senator Coons, and \nSenator Gillibrand. I thank them for being original cosponsors of this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  In sum, the Due Process Guarantee Act we are introducing will add to \nanother major law called the Non-Detention Act of 1971, which clearly \nstated:\n\n       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the \n     United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.\n\n  The new legislation we intend to introduce will amend this Non-\nDetention Act to provide clearly that no military authorization \nauthorizes the indefinite detention without charge or trial of U.S. \ncitizens who are apprehended domestically. It also codifies a ``clear \nstatement rule'' that requires Congress to expressly authorize \ndetention authority when it comes to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents for all military authorizations and similar authorities.\n  We cannot limit the actions of future Congresses, but we can provide \nthat if they intend to limit the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens, \nthey must say so clearly and explicitly.\n  I am very pleased to add that Senator Durbin will also cosponsor this \nlegislation.\n  Lawful permanent residents are included in this bill we will \nintroduce because they have the same due process protections as \ncitizens under the Constitution. In this bill, the protections for \ncitizens and lawful permanent residents is limited to those \n``apprehended in the United States,'' excluding citizens who take up \narms against the United States on a foreign battlefield.\n  I strongly believe constitutional due process requires that U.S. \ncitizens apprehended in the United States should never be held in \nindefinite detention. That is what this legislation would accomplish, \nso I look forward to working with my colleagues, especially Chairman \nLeahy on the Judiciary Committee, to move this bill forward.\n  I note the Senator from Illinois, Senator Kirk, is on the floor of \nthe Senate to speak about this bill as well.\n  Our current approach to handling these suspects in Federal criminal \ncourts has produced a strong record of success since the 9/11 attacks. \nWe would be wise to follow the saying, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix \nit.''\n  Our system is not broken. We thwarted attempted terrorist acts. We \nhave captured terrorists, interrogated them, retrieved actionable \nintelligence from them, prosecuted them, and locked them up for lengthy \nsentences--in most cases for the rest of their lives.\n  Both Senator Udall and Senator Durbin pointed out Director Mueller's \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee yesterday. This is relevant \nbecause it had been said that the Director of the FBI was satisfied \nwith the language of the conference report of the Defense authorization \nbill. When Director Mueller was asked the question yesterday, Are you \nsatisfied with the language, in so many words, he said, not quite. To \nquote him, Director Mueller said:\n\n       Given the statute the way it is now, it doesn't give me a \n     clear path to certainty as to what is going to happen when \n     arrests are made in a particular case.\n\n  He warned:\n\n       The possibility looms that we will lose opportunities to \n     obtain cooperation from the persons in the past that we've \n     been fairly successful in gaining.\n\n  I am concerned about how these provisions will be implemented once \nthey are enacted into law, so I will be watching carefully to ensure \nthat they do not jeopardize our national security.\n  Finally, I want to explain, as the sponsor of the Feinstein \ncompromise amendment, No. 1456, that the Defense authorization bill \nshould not be read to authorize indefinite detention of U.S. citizens \ncaptured inside the United States or abroad, lawful resident aliens of \nthe United States captured inside our country or abroad, or any other \npersons who are captured or arrested in the United States.\n  On page 655 of the conference report, the compromise amendment, No. \n1456, that passed the Senate by a vote of 99 to 1, reads this way, and \nthis is in the conference report of the Defense authorization bill:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     existing law or authorities relating to the detention of \n     United States citizens, or lawful resident aliens of the \n     United States, or any other persons who are captured or \n     arrested in the United States.\n\n  What does this mean? This means we have agreed to preserve current \nlaw for the three groups specified, as interpreted by our Federal \ncourts, and to leave to the courts the difficult questions of who may \nbe detained by the military, for how long, and under what \ncircumstances.\n  And the Due Process Guarantee Act will clarify that citizens and \nlawful permanents cannot be detained without charge or trial if they \nare apprehended domestically.\n  I interpret current law to permit the detention of U.S. citizens as \n``enemy combatants,'' consistent with the laws of war, only in the very \nnarrow circumstance of a citizen who has taken an active part in \nhostilities against the United States and is captured outside the \nUnited States in an area of ``active combat operations,'' such as the \nbattlefields of Afghanistan. This was the Supreme Court's narrow \nholding in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld in 2004.\n  I am sorry to say that Hamdi has been mischaracterized in this body. \nWhether Congress should grant the President more expansive powers of \ndetention or act to curtail the powers identified by the Supreme Court \nin Hamdi is a question that Congress will continue to debate in the \nfuture. And we introduced the Due Process Guarantee Act to help clarify \ncurrent law: that citizens and lawful permanents cannot be detained \nwithout charge or trial if they are apprehended domestically.\n  I would like to point out the errors in the legal analysis by those \nwho would interpret current law, or this Defense Authorization Act, to \nauthorize the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens without charge or \ntrial, irrespective of where they are captured or under what \ncircumstances.\n  Let's turn to the Supreme Court's 2004 opinion in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \nwhich has been incorrectly cited by others for the proposition that the \n2001 AUMF permits indefinite detention of American citizens regardless \nof where they are captured.\n  Hamdi involved a U.S. citizen, Yaser Esam Hamdi, who took up arms on \nbehalf of the Taliban and was captured on the battlefield in \nAfghanistan and turned over to U.S. forces. The Supreme Court's opinion \nin that case was a muddled decision by a four-vote plurality that \nrecognized the power of the government to detain U.S. citizens captured \nin such circumstances as ``enemy combatants'' for some period, but \notherwise repudiated the government's broad assertions of executive \nauthority to detain citizens without charge or trial.\n  In particular, the Court limited its holding to citizens captured in \nan area of ``active combat operations'' and concluded that even in \nthose circumstances, the U.S. Constitution and the due process clause \nguarantees U.S. citizens certain rights, including the ability to \nchallenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial judge. The \nplurality's opinion stated:\n\n       It [the Government] has made clear, however, for the \n     purposes of this case, the ``enemy combatant'' that it [the \n     Government] is seeking to detain is an individual who, it \n     alleges, was ``part of or supporting forces hostile to the \n     United States or coalition partners'' in Afghanistan, and \n     who ``engaged in an armed conflict against the\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\n     United States'' there. Brief for Respondents 3.\n\n  That was all a quote from the plurality opinion, and it continues:\n\n       We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: \n     whether the detention of citizens falling within that \n     definition is authorized.\n\n  The opinion goes on to say at page 517:\n\n       We conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional \n     authorization for the detention of individuals--\n\n  And here it is--\n\n     in the narrow category we describe. . . . And the narrow \n     category they describe is one who is part of forces hostile \n     to the U.S. on the battlefield of Afghanistan. Indeed, the \n     plurality later emphasized that it was discussing a citizen \n     captured on the battlefield. In responding to Justice \n     Scalia's dissenting opinion, the plurality opinion says:\n       Justice Scalia largely ignores the context of this case: a \n     United States citizen captured in a foreign combat zone.\n\n  The plurality italicized and emphasized the word ``foreign'' in that \nsentence.\n  Thus, to the extent the Hamdi case permits the government to detain a \nU.S. citizen until the end of hostilities, it does so only under a very \nlimited set of circumstances; namely, citizens taking an active part in \nhostilities who are captured in Afghanistan and who are afforded \ncertain due process protections, at a minimum.\n  It is also worth noting that amid lingering legal uncertainty \nregarding whether the government had the authority to detain Hamdi, the \nGovernment--this was the Bush administration--saw this and released \nHamdi to Saudi Arabia on the condition that he relinquish his U.S. \ncitizenship.\n  As a result, I don't regard the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi as \nproviding any compelling support for broad assertions of legal \nauthority to detain U.S. citizens without trial. Certainly, the case \nprovides no support for the indefinite detention of citizens captured \ninside the United States.\n  Let me go back to something. In 1971, the Congress passed, and \nRichard Nixon signed into law, a Non-Detention Act to preclude this \nvery possibility. That act was intended in large measure to put the \nwrongs of Japanese internment during World War right. It provides \nsimply:\n\n       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the \n     United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.\n\n  I very much agree with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which \nheld in the case of Padilla v. Rumsfeld that:\n\n       [W]e conclude that clear congressional authorization is \n     required for detentions of American citizens on American soil \n     because . . . the Non-Detention Act . . . prohibits such \n     detentions absent specific congressional authorization.\n\n  The Second Circuit went on to say that the 2001 AUMF ``is not such an \nauthorization and no exception to [the Non-Detention Act] otherwise \nexists.''\n  The Fourth Circuit came to a different conclusion when it took up \nPadilla's case, but its analysis turned entirely on disputed claims \nthat ``Padilla associated with forces hostile to the U.S. Government in \nAfghanistan'' and, ``like Hamdi,'' and this is a quote, ``Padilla took \nup arms against United States forces in that country in the same way \nand to the same extent as did Hamdi.''\n  To help resolve this apparent dispute between the circuits, I believe \nwe need to pass the Due Process Guarantee Act that my cosponsors and I \nare introducing today.\n  I would like to add Senator Bill Nelson of Florida as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is important. We spent about half a day on this \nfloor discussing this with Senator Levin, with Senator McCain, in the \ncloakroom with Senators Lee and Paul, as well as with a whole host of \nstaff both from the Armed Services Committee as well as the \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees. Here is the conclusion: I, and \nmany of my colleagues and legal scholars, believe neither the AUMF nor \nthe provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act that we are \nconsidering today constitute such an express authorization to detain \nAmerican citizens.\n  As I previously mentioned, I sponsored compromise amendment No. 1456 \nto the Defense bill when it passed the Senate and that amendment has \nnow become section 1021(e) of the conference report specifically to \nprevent misrepresentations from providing Congressional intent to \nsupport the detention of Americans.\n  Ex parte Quirin is a 1942 Supreme Court case that upheld the \njurisdiction of a U.S. military tribunal that tried several German \nsaboteurs captured inside the United States during World War II and \nbrought to stand trial before the hastily convened military tribunal.\n  One of the saboteurs, Herbert Hans Haupt, was a U.S. citizen. \nHowever, the question at issue in Quirin was not whether a U.S. citizen \ncaptured inside the United States could be held indefinitely under the \nlaws of war without trial, but rather, whether such an individual could \nbe held in detention for a matter of weeks pending trial by military \ncommission.\n  Haupt was, in fact, tried, convicted and sentenced to death within \nweeks after his capture. Moreover, the Quirin opinion predates the \nGeneva Conventions, a milestone of rather substantial significance in \nthe development of the law of war, and the decision also predates the \nNon-Detention Act of 1971.\n  As Justice Scalia said in his dissent in Hamdi: ``[Quirin] was not \n[the Supreme] Court's finest hour.''\n  The only recent case of a U.S. citizen captured inside the United \nStates and held as an enemy combatant under the law of war is that of \nJose Padilla.\n  However, amid considerable legal controversy regarding the legality \nof his detention, Padilla was ultimately transferred out of military \ncustody and tried and convicted in a civilian court.\n  Padilla, a U.S. citizen, was arrested in Chicago on May 8, 2002 on \nsuspicion of plotting a dirty bomb attack in the United States. He was \ninitially detained pursuant to a material witness warrant based on the \n9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  On June 9, 2002, two days before a Federal judge was to rule on the \nvalidity of continuing to hold Padilla under the material witness \nwarrant, President Bush designated him an ``enemy combatant'' and \ntransferred him to a military prison in South Carolina for detention \npursuant to the law of war without charge or trial.\n  Padilla subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in \nFederal court challenging the legality of his continued detention and \nan extended series of appeals ensued.\n  Facing an impending Supreme Court challenge and mounting public \ncriticism for holding a U.S. citizen arrested inside the U.S. as an \nenemy combatant, President Bush ordered Padilla transferred to civilian \ncustody to face criminal conspiracy and material support for terrorism \ncharges in Federal court. The criminal charges against Padilla were \nnot, however, related to Padilla's alleged involvement in a dirty bomb \nplot, which had been the basis for his prior detention as an enemy \ncombatant.\n  Padilla was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 17 years in \nprison. That 17-year sentence has since been vacated and is under \nreconsideration. Thus, the Padilla case is at best inconclusive as to \nthe President's authority to detain a citizen captured inside the \nUnited States as an ``enemy combatant.'' More likely, it evidences the \nfolly of such overreaching assertions of Executive power.\n  Despite my longstanding opposition to the detention provisions in \nthis bill, I will be voting yes on this important legislation. The main \nreason I support the defense authorization bill is because it ensures \nour troops deployed around the world--especially those in Afghanistan--\nhave the equipment, resources, and training they need to defend this \nNation.\n  I wish to sum up by quoting Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for \nthe plurality in Hamdi. Here is what she wrote:\n\n       As critical as the Government's interest may be in \n     detaining those who actually pose an immediate threat to the \n     national security of the United States during ongoing \n     international conflict, history and common sense teach us \n     that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential \n     to become a means for oppression and abuse of others who do \n     not present that sort of threat.\n\n  This is what Senator Kirk, Senator Lee, Senator Paul, and those of us \non the Democratic side who have worked on this truly believe. What \nabout the person captured on the corner who looks a certain way, who \ngets picked up and put into detention? Does that\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\nperson have the right to a charge and to a trial? Our system of due \nprocess and the Constitution of the United States say, simply, yes.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the due process \nguarantee bill.\n  I wish to defer to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator \nKirk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I wish to rise in support of the \nFeinstein-Leahy-Lee legislation. We are taking up the Defense \nauthorization bill with the controversial provisions in it, somewhat \nprotected already by the Feinstein language. But this legislation locks \nin a fundamental truth that I think is important for our country, and \nthat is as a U.S. citizen inside the territory of the United States, \nyou have inalienable rights under our Declaration of Independence. We \nare protected pursuant to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Our Constitution says all crimes, and prosecution thereof, shall be \npursuant to a grand jury indictment. There is no exception in the \nConstitution for that. The Constitution grants a U.S. citizen a trial \nin the State in which the crime was committed, I think clearly \nenvisioning a civilian trial. We, as Americans, have a right to a \nspeedy trial, not indefinite detention.\n  We as Americans have a right to a jury of our peers, which I would \nargue is not enlisted or military personnel sitting in a jury. You \ncannot search our persons or our places of business or homes without \nprobable cause under the Bill of Rights. You cannot be deprived of your \nfreedom or your property without due process of law, and that, I would \nsay, is not indefinite detention. All due process guarantees under law \nare granted to you by the 14th amendment. I would actually argue that \nno statute and no Senate and no House can take these rights away from \nyou.\n\n  It is very important to pass this legislation to prevent needless \nlitigation against constitutional rights, which I regard already as \nyour birthright as an American citizen. It is very important to talk \nabout what the Feinstein legislation does and does not do. I think it \nis very narrowly crafted to defend the rights of American citizens and \nresident aliens inside the United States. We agree that aliens who are \nengaged or captured on foreign battlefields can be subjected to rough \njustice, battlefield outcomes, or detention and prosecution by the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  We even agree that a U.S. citizen such as Anwar al-Awlaki, who took \nup arms against the United States from his terrorist base, Yemen, is \nthen the proper subject of U.S. military action, and he received that \nproper attention. Illegal aliens, even inside the United States--we are \nnot engaging on that subject. If they are part of jihad or other \nwarfare against the United States, they can be subjected to military \njurisdiction. But with regard to U.S. citizens and resident aliens on \nU.S. soil, I would argue that the entire point of the Department of \nDefense is to defend our constitutional rights and to make sure they \nare honored. If you read the Constitution--and I would urge all Members \nin this battle to reread it; it is only 5,000 words long--you will see \nthat the rights provided are without qualification and are part of your \nbirthright.\n  What is the first thing a U.S. Senator, a Member of Congress, or the \nPresident does? They swear an oath to the Constitution of the United \nStates. What is the first act any American or resident alien joining \nthe U.S. military does? They don't swear allegiance to a President or a \nleader or a territory; they swear allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, \nand that is the mission which they are undertaking to protect.\n  We see a number of cases cited--as I noted, Ex parte Quirin, the \nGerman spy, or U.S. nationals who landed in Long Island and were \nsummarily executed under U.S. military justice. I would say at least \nthey were part of a foreign military and trained in that mission and \ntrying to carry out that mission when that rough justice was put in \nplace.\n  With regard to Jose Padilla, he was a U.S. citizen--sometimes when I \nwas at the State Department, people would ask me who our Ambassador to \nPuerto Rico was. Puerto Rico is part of the United States. He was a \nfull member of the country, with U.S. citizenship. He was arrested at \nO'Hare Airport, but pursuant to executive action was immediately taken \ninto military custody and held in a brig. I regard all of his \nconstitutional rights were then violated. In the subsequent litigation, \nI think eventually the Bush administration realized they were about to \nlose this case, which is why they kicked him back into civilian court.\n  In the Hamdi case, which is so often cited, even there we at least \nhad a foreign connection, foreign training as part of another \nbattlefield. What we are talking about here is very narrow, to make \nsure at the very least that you, as a U.S. citizen in U.S. territory, \nare not going to be subjected to indefinite military detention and \nmilitary justice, that all of your constitutional rights are adhered \nto.\n  I would simply ask this--also as a reserve naval officer--what U.S. \nmilitary officer wants the duty to roll in, for example, to Peoria, IL, \nand arrest an American citizen for actions that citizen has only done \nin the United States, not connected to a foreign military or training, \nand then to put that person through military detention and justice? I \nwould say for the long-term interest of the U.S. military and to \nprotect the U.S. military, we do not want to give that mission to our \nArmed Forces. A point of common sense should prevail here as well.\n  We spend billions of dollars on the Department of Homeland Security, \nwhich is fully under the fourth and sixth amendments of our \nconstitutional protection. We have an extraordinarily able FBI, ATF, \nDEA, et cetera, the whole panoply of Federal law enforcement, which, \nquite properly, is not under the administration of the Pentagon but is \ninstead under the administration of the Department of Justice. We have \na vast array of State and local law enforcement all dedicated to \nprotecting the United States but, most importantly, to uphold the very \noaths they also take in their first minute as law enforcement officers \nto protect the U.S. Constitution.\n  So on this day that we pass the NDAA, which has a murky provision \nregarding this--somewhat protected by the Feinstein legislation--it is \nvery important for us then to rally behind the further legislative \nprotections here. I think this is strong, bipartisan legislation. I \ncommend Senator Feinstein, Chairman Leahy, and Senator Lee for bringing \nit forward. No. 1, this will help protect the U.S. military from \nmissions that it should not undertake. No. 2, we will make sure there \nis clear delineation between the Department of Justice, Homeland \nSecurity, and its whole panoply of agencies, and our military, which \nprotects our rights from threat overseas. But, most importantly, No. 3, \nto defend the U.S. Constitution, your birthright as an American citizen \nto have these rights to make sure we do not subject any U.S. citizen \napprehended inside the United States to indefinite detention under U.S. \nmilitary authority, knowing they have inalienable birthrights that were \ngranted to them by the U.S. Constitution.\n  With that, I commend the Chair.\n  Mr. KIRK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, we have two other provisions that are in \nthe National Defense Authorization Act that I want to briefly mention.\n  First, we have a modified Brooks amendment in the conference report \nthat says if there is any plan to deliver classified missile defense \ndata to the Russians, the administration has to have a 60-day clock \nexpire and then certify to the Congress that none of this data could \nend up in the hands of third parties, particularly the Iranians or \nSyrians. I wish to put the administration on notice that that \ncertification probably cannot be made. Dmitry Rogozin, the lead \nnegotiator on the missile defense for their government, has a close and \ncontinuing relationship with Iran. He is going to Iran next month. When \nwe see the intelligence sharing and cooperation on\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\nmissiles and on other weaponry, but especially discussions about a \nsecond nuclear reactor in Iran, I think we should all realize that any \nclassified data on U.S. missile defense going to the Russians would be \ngiven to the Iranians.\n  Remember, in missile combat between enemies of the United States and \nourselves, everything would be over potentially in a matter of hours. \nIf the Russians accomplish by diplomacy what they have failed to do by \nespionage, which is getting critical details of U.S. missile defense, \nand especially missile defenses of Poland and other key allies, we give \nonly a few minutes to a few hours to the U.S. commander to be able to \ndiagnose the problem, understand how he has been penetrated or fooled, \nand to correct that. I think that weakens the defenses of the United \nStates significantly.\n\n  I had a hold on the nominee for the U.S. Ambassador to Moscow, \nMichael McFaul. Because of the passage of the modified Brooks amendment \nand a written letter of assurances given to me by the administration, I \nhave now lifted that hold. I will be supporting his nomination also \nbecause he will be good in working with the opposition and human rights \ncommunities in Russia.\n  But I think everyone is now on notice that we should not move forward \nwith any plan to provide classified missile defense data to Russia \nbecause it will be shared with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that \nis one of the principal threats for which the U.S. and NATO missile \ndefenses are arrayed against.\n  A second provision which is in the National Defense Authorization Act \nconcerns Iran itself. Senator Menendez and I teamed up on an amendment \nthat also says: If you do business with the Central Bank of Iran, you \nmay not do business with the United States. But we provided critical \nflexibility to the administration. The amendment is not imposed for \nweeks, if not months, and two critical waivers are put in the amendment \nwhich say, No. 1, if we find a critical shortage in oil markets because \nof Iran's leading role, sanctions could be delayed if not suspended. \nAlso, there is a general national security waiver put in if something \nunexpected happens. But, in general, the rule goes forward that we are \nmoving forward on a comprehensive plan to collapse the Central Bank of \nIran.\n  Despite Secretary Geithner opposing the Menendez-Kirk amendment, this \nbody voted 100 to 0 to support that amendment because we know of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency's report that they may be getting \nclose to having enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. We know \nof Iran's support for Hezbollah and Hamas. We know of their oppression \nof minorities, especially 330,000 Baha'is, who have been prohibited \nfrom contracting with the Iranian Government. Kids are not allowed to \nbe in university. We even know of one poor Iranian actress who was \nsentenced to 90 lashes, later suspended, for simply appearing in an \nAustralian film without a head dress.\n  The time for action on Iran is now. With the passage of the National \nDefense Authorization Act and the signature that we now expect from the \nPresident, a set of clocks begins, 60- and 180-day clocks. I will be \nteaming with Senator Menendez and others--in fact, with the entire U.S. \nSenate that supported this--to make sure we have the toughest action \npossible to collapse the Central Bank of Iran, which the Treasury \nDepartment noted is the central money launderer for that government to \nsupport terror and nuclear proliferation.\n  With that, I yield the floor. Actually, I yield to my colleague from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I rise today in support of the National \nDefense Authorization Act. In particular, I wish to speak briefly about \nthe detainee provisions contained in the conference report.\n  I have spoken many times over the last few months about this issue, \nbut due to the importance of these issues--and I think because of some \nof the unfortunate mischaracterizations we have heard about the \nbipartisan compromise that passed this body already overwhelmingly and \ncame out of the Armed Services Committee overwhelmingly--I wanted to \ncome to the floor to make some closing points on this.\n  I would like to start with this proposition: No member of al-Qaida, \nno terrorist, should ever hear the words ``you have the right to remain \nsilent.'' That fundamental principle is at the heart of the issue we \nconfronted in the Armed Services Committee in addressing the detainee \nprovisions that are contained within the Defense authorization report. \nThe central issue is, how do we best gather intelligence to protect our \ncountry from future attacks?\n  It is common sense that if we tell a terrorist they have the right to \nremain silent, they may exercise that right. What if they do so and \nthey have additional information about future attacks on our country \nor, as in the case of the so-called Underwear Bomber--which, \nunfortunately, in my view, has been cited by some of my colleagues as a \nsuccess--if that event had been part of a series of events such as the \nevents that occurred on 9/11 where we were attacked on our own soil, \nwhat would we have lost? After 50 minutes, the so-called Christmas \nBomber was told he had the right to remain silent and he exercised that \nright and we did not get to question him again until 5 weeks later, \nafter law enforcement officials tracked down his parents in another \ncountry and convinced him to cooperate. That is not a good policy to \ngather intelligence to protect our country, and that is at the heart of \nwhat we are trying to address on a bipartisan basis in the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  We have to ask ourselves: The events of 9/11, were they acts of war \nor were they a crime against our country? I firmly believe we are at \nwar with members of al-Qaida; that what happened on September 11 was an \nattack against the United States of America. Innocent Americans were \nkilled not because of what they did but because of what we believe in \nand what we stand for as a country.\n  So when I hear some of my colleagues suggest there are problems with \nthe detainee compromise that was achieved on a bipartisan basis in this \nbody--because we have basically said, if a foreign member of al-Qaida \ncomes to the United States of America, seeks to commit another 9/11 \nagainst us, seeks to attack our country or its citizens, that the \npresumption will be military custody. That those provisions are \nmisguided in some way deeply troubles me. If this wasn't an act of war, \nthen I don't know what is. We need to make sure we treat enemies of our \ncountry for who they are and make sure they are not read their Miranda \nrights.\n  So in this bipartisan compromise we said there is a category of \nindividuals--members of al-Qaida or associated groups--who want to come \nto America to attack us or our allies and for whom, yes, there is a \npresumption of military custody. That way they don't have to be read \ntheir Miranda rights or be provided the rights of our civilian system.\n  We also address the administration's concerns by giving them a \nnational security waiver, by allowing our law enforcement officials the \nflexibility to come up with the procedures on how to implement the \nprovisions of this bill.\n  I wish to address what I heard from FBI Director Mueller yesterday, \njust to be clear on the record, because yesterday FBI Director Mueller \nraised concerns about these detention provisions saying there is a \npossibility that looms that we will lose opportunities to obtain \ncooperation from individuals we have been able to obtain cooperation \nfrom in the past.\n  Well, I am concerned because when FBI Director Mueller came to a \ngroup of us, including the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and \nRanking Member McCain, he raised operational concerns about this \nprovision, and we said we want to address those concerns. So in the \nfinal conference report there is language that was given to us by the \nFBI to address their operational concerns. It was included in this bill \nwithout a comma changed.\n  So it makes me concerned when we put their language in to address \ntheir concerns, saying nothing in this section shall be construed to \naffect the existing criminal enforcement and national security \nauthorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any other \ndomestic law enforcement agency with respect to a covered person \nregardless of whether such covered person is held in military custody.\n  So I say to Director Mueller: We put your language in directly, and \nit makes\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nme concerned when I hear, in my view, what are political viewpoints \nrather than what is the reality of what is in this bill, which will \nallow the FBI to continue its work and will allow for us to hold in \nmilitary custody those who are seeking to attack our country and will \nensure that Miranda rights do not have to be given if that is the best \ninvestigative way to go forward to protect our country.\n  I see my colleague, the Senator from South Carolina, on the floor. I \nwish to ask him a question about the bill and the detainee provisions, \nparticularly about the authorization for the use of military force. I \nhave heard some people on the floor of the Senate--including the \nSenator from Colorado, the Senator from Illinois, and the Senator from \nCalifornia--express concerns about the fact that this bill reaffirms \nthe authority of the President of the United States to detain an \nAmerican citizen who has joined with al-Qaida and who has, as a member \nof al-Qaida or an associated force, joined arms against our country and \nsought to kill Americans.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from South Carolina about this provision \nand why it is important for our country.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire who has been a \ngreat leader on this issue.\n  Let me just tell my colleagues what drives my thinking. I think we \nare at war--I don't think it, I believe it. I hope my colleagues \nbelieve it too, and I know America is part of the battlefield because \nthe enemy would like to destroy our country.\n  If we capture an al-Qaida operative overseas, does anybody in this \nbody suggest that we should give them a lawyer or read them their \nrights? In World War II, if we had captured a Nazi soldier overseas and \nstarted saying they had the right to remain silent and we would give \nthem a lawyer, even though Miranda didn't exist at the time, people \nwould have run us out of town.\n  So if we believe we can kill an American citizen who has joined al-\nQaida--the Awlaki case, where the President of the United States made \nan executive decision under the rule of the law, not through a court \ndecision, to target an American citizen who had aligned themselves with \nthe enemy--then if we can kill them, which is pretty indefinite, why \ncan't we capture and hold them?\n  Now, that would be the dumbest thing in the history of the world for \na nation to say: We all acknowledge the executive branch's power to \ntarget an American citizen who has aligned themselves with the enemy. \nWe can kill them overseas, we can capture them overseas, we can \ninterrogate them about what they know about future attacks, but when \nthey get here we have to treat them as a common criminal.\n  I think what we share, I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, is \nthat we think al-Qaida operatives, citizens or not, are not common \ncriminals. We think they are crazy people, warriors, bent on our \ndestruction, who would blow themselves up just as quickly as they would \nblow you up, and they don't care if they blow themselves up. The only \nreason the Christmas Day Bomber didn't kill a bunch of people is \nbecause his shoe didn't go off. The only reason the Times Square Bomber \ndidn't kill a bunch of people is because the bomb didn't go off.\n  If you are an American citizen and you want to help al-Qaida kill \nAmericans and destroy your own country, here is what is coming your \nway. If you happen to be listening to this debate, please understand \nthe law as it is today and as it is going to be after this bill is \npassed: We are at war. The authorization to use military force passed \nby the Congress right after the attacks against this Nation designates \nal-Qaida as a military threat, not a common criminal threat, so we \napply the law of war. There are two legal systems at play: domestic \ncriminal law that well serves us as a nation to deal with crime--even \nthe worst person, the worst child abuser gets a lawyer and is presumed \ninnocent. Believe it or not, war criminals get lawyers and are presumed \ninnocent.\n  I am proud of both systems, but the law enforcement model doesn't \nallow us to hold someone for a period of time to gather intelligence. \nUnder the law enforcement model, once we capture someone, we have to \nstart reading them their rights and providing them with a lawyer. Under \nthe law of war model, we can hold someone who is part of the enemy \nforce and gather intelligence.\n  This is not the first war where American citizens have sided with the \nenemy. In the In re Quirin case, a World War II case where American \ncitizens aided Nazi saboteurs, here is what the Court said: There is no \nbar to the Nation holding one of its own citizens as an enemy \ncombatant. That has been the law for decades.\n  So if it made sense to hold an American citizen who was helping the \nNazis under military authority because they were helping a military \nenemy of the Nation to gather intelligence, why in the world wouldn't \nit make sense to hold somebody who has joined with al-Qaida to gather \nintelligence about the next attack?\n  Let me give an example of what we may face. Homegrown terrorism is on \nthe rise. The Internet is out there. It is a good thing and a bad \nthing. But the idea of people getting radicalized and turning against \ntheir own country is a growing threat.\n\n  So the likelihood in the future of someone getting radicalized--an \nAmerican citizen here at home going to Pakistan, getting educated in \none of these extremist madrassas, coming back home, getting off the \nplane at Dulles Airport, coming down to the Mall and starting to shoot \nAmerican citizens and tourists alike--is very real.\n  What this legislation does is it says from the Congress's point of \nview we recognize the person who is aligned with al-Qaida is not a \ncommon criminal, that we expressly authorize the indefinite detention \nof someone who has joined al-Qaida operations.\n  Why is that important? Don't you think most Americans, I say to the \nSenator, would be offended if after the person who went on a rampage in \nthe Capital to kill American citizens, to kill people in America, was \ncaptured, we could not question them about: Is there somebody else \ncoming? We would have to say: You have the right to remain silent. Here \nis your lawyer.\n  What we should do with that person who went to Pakistan and got \nradicalized and wants to come back and kill us all is hold them in \nmilitary custody, as we have done in every other war, and find out all \nwe can about future attacks and what they know. Because we are not \nfighting a crime; we are fighting a war. That has been the law, \naccording to the Supreme Court, for decades, and all we are doing in \nCongress is saying, statutorily: We recognize the authority of this \nPresident and every other President to hold an enemy combatant for \nintelligence-gathering purposes indefinitely, whether they are captured \nat home or abroad, because that only makes logical sense. The idea of \ncriminalizing the war and not being able to gather intelligence will \nput our country at risk.\n  Let me say this about the system: No one can be held as an enemy \ncombatant under the law we have constructed without having their day in \nFederal court. So do not worry about going to a tea party or a \nmoveon.org rally or an Occupy Wall Street rally and somebody holding \nyou as a political prisoner under this law. The only people who can be \nheld under military custody for an indefinite period are ones who have \nbeen found to have associated with al-Qaida in an overt way, and the \ngovernment has to prove that to a Federal judge. If the Federal judge \ndoes not believe the government has made their case, the person is \nreleased. If the Federal judge says to the U.S. Government: You have \nconvinced me that the person in front of me is cooperating and has \njoined al-Qaida and is overtly engaged in hostilities against the \nUnited States. I hereby authorize to you to hold that person to gather \nintelligence, how long can you hold them? As long as it takes to make \nus safe.\n  Here is what the law does. Every year, the person being held as an \nenemy combatant has an annual review process where the experts in our \ngovernment look at the threat this person possesses, whether we have \nmore intelligence to be attained, and there is a legal process to \nreview ongoing detention.\n  Here is what some of my colleagues would say: Wait a minute. You \ncannot\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\ndo that. We are going to say, as a Member of Congress, that at an \nartificial date you have to let that person go or try them? A lot of \nthese cases will be based on intelligence that may not go to an article \nIII court. We may have to compromise our national security. We can \nprove to a judge they are a member of al-Qaida, but we are not going to \ntake them to the criminal court because that is not in our national \nsecurity interest.\n  The key fact is, no one is held as an enemy combatant without \njudicial review. Once you are determined to be an enemy combatant, then \nwe are going to apply the law of war, as we have for 200 years. The law \nof war says: No nation has to let an enemy prisoner go or prosecute \nthem--because we are not fighting a crime; we are fighting a war.\n  If you are an al-Qaida operative, you could get killed, even if you \nare an American citizen, by assisting the enemy at home or abroad. So \ndo not join al-Qaida because you could lose your life. If you do get \ncaptured, you can be held indefinitely under the law of war because you \nhave committed an act of war.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Would the Senator from South Carolina yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am pleased to.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Isn't it true that included within the Defense \nauthorization language in the detainee provisions is that:\n\n       Nothing in this section is intended to limit or expand the \n     authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force.\n\n  In other words, what is the law today--as you just described it--we \nare reaffirming in this bill. But we are not adding or subtracting from \nthe President's authority that he has, as the Commander-in-Chief of our \ncountry, to protect our country against members of al-Qaida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is correct.\n  But here is what we are doing. Here is what Lindsey Graham is doing, \nand Carl Levin, and an overwhelming number of the Members of this body \nare about to do. We are about to pass a defense authorization bill that \nincreases military pay, that has a lot of great things. But we are \nabout to say as a Congress: We believe we are at war, and we reject the \nidea--the Libertarian idea; who are great Americans--that if you get to \nAmerica somehow, it is no longer a war.\n  I think the Libertarians agree that if you catch an al-Qaida \noperative, including an American citizen, overseas, we do not have to \nread them their rights, and we do not have to give them a lawyer. But \nsomehow, the perverse logic is, if they make it to America to attack \nus, whether they are a citizen or not, somehow they get a special deal.\n  All of us who are voting for this bill say that is crazy; we are at \nwar. For no other war has that been the case. If you would have \nsuggested in 1942 that the American citizen helping the Nazis commit \nsabotage against the United States had a special status and could not \nbe treated in the fashion of a military threat to the country, they \nwould have run you out of town.\n  So we are 10 years out from the attacks of 9/11, and here is what we \nare rejecting: We are rejecting the criminalization of the war, but we \nare doing it in a smart way. We are not telling the executive branch \nthey have to go into a law-of-war detention system. We are just saying \nthat is available to them. We are not telling the executive branch they \nhave to try people in military commissions. We are just saying to them \nthat is available for noncitizens. What we are telling the executive \nbranch is that we believe we are at war, and that narrow group of \npeople--thank God it is a narrow group--who join al-Qaida do not have \nspecial privileges when it comes to destroying our homeland; that if \nthey make it to America, the closer they get to us, the more tools we \nshould have available to protect ourselves.\n\n  So we are on record--at least I am and I think the body as a whole. \nSenator Levin has been terrific. The administration has been great to \nwork with. Finally, after 10 years, the Congress of the United States, \nthrough this legislation, is going to make the simple statement, simple \nproposition that under the law of war, you can be held as an enemy \ncombatant indefinitely to protect this Nation. Because when you join \nal-Qaida--the enemy of us all--we are not worried about whether we are \ngoing to prosecute you right away. We are worried about what you know \nabout the next attack coming.\n  Let me tell you why we need this flexibility. The Christmas Day \nBomber--the bomb did not go off, thank God; it was just luck--was read \nhis Miranda rights within 45 minutes. Five weeks later, his parents \nconvinced him to cooperate. What we are suggesting is there is another \nway that has been used in other wars, that the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity, law enforcement community, and military have an option \navailable to them.\n  We could grab this person who has just tried to blow up an airplane \nover Detroit--American citizen or not--and we can hold them without \ntelling them they have a right to a lawyer and reading them their \nMiranda rights. Because we are trying to find out is another airplane \ncoming and what do they know about the enemy and what were they up to \nand where did they train.\n  If we take that option off the table, we will have diminished our \nnational security. We will have overturned what every other time of war \nhas been about. We would be the first Congress in the history of the \ncountry to reject the idea that we can hold someone who is \ncollaborating with the enemy under the law of war. Let's reverse this. \nThis is the first time in history people have said on the floor of the \nSenate: We reject the Supreme Court holdings that allow the American \nGovernment to hold someone as an enemy combatant when they have joined \nthe enemy forces at home or abroad.\n  So those of us who are voting for this, we are saying we accept the \nproposition that if you join al-Qaida, you can be killed, you can be \ncaptured, you can be interrogated. I am willing to accept the heat for \nmaking that decision. Because if we cannot kill them and we cannot \ncapture them and we cannot interrogate them, we have made a huge \nmistake because these people hate us. They hate who we are. They hate \nwhat we stand for. They would kill us all if they could. They are out \nthere, and some of them are among us who have the title of ``American \ncitizen.''\n  But let me tell you about that title. Not only does it have rights, \nit has responsibilities. Our courts have said there is nothing in our \nlaw or our Constitution that prevents us from holding one of our own \nwhen they join the enemy. Because when they join the enemy, they have \nnot committed a crime; they have turned on the rest of us, and they \nshould accept the consequences of being at war with America. Being at \nwar with America is something they should fear, and if they do not fear \nbeing at war with America, we have made a huge mistake.\n  I believe in due process. No one is going to prison without a Federal \njudge's oversight. No one stays in prison indefinitely without an \nannual review. But, my God, we are not going to arbitrarily say: You \nhave to go. You have to be let go because of the passage of time and we \nare not going to criminalize this war--because it is a war.\n  As sure as I am standing here talking today, we are going to be wrong \nonce. We have to be right every time, I say to the Senator. We have \nbeen lucky, and our men and women in uniform and our intelligence \ncommunity and our FBI agents are doing a wonderful job. They are \nworking night and day to protect us. The threats are growing. They are \nnot lessening. There will come a day, I am sad to say, when we are \ngoing to get hit again. But when that day comes, we are going to make \nsure we have the tools to deal with it in terms of what it is: an act \nof war. We are going to have the tools available to this country to \nrein in the consequences because we are going to have the tools \navailable to find out where is the next attack coming from.\n  We are not going to criminalize the war. We are going to fight it \nwithin our values. We are going to provide robust due process. But we \nare going to acknowledge as a body in Congress that our Chief Executive \nand those men and women in uniform, law enforcement agents, CIA \nagents--that they have our blessing to do their job, and we are going \nto acknowledge that they have the tools available in this war that were \navailable to other like people in other wars.\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen, if there was ever a war where it was important \nto know what the enemy was up to and hit them before they hit us, it is \nthis war. They could care less about losing their lives. The only way \nwe will be safe is to gather intelligence, and we cannot gather \nintelligence, in my view, by locking down America to ``Dragnet'' \nstandards. This is not a TV show. This is a real-world event that \nchanges as I speak.\n  To Senator Levin, to Senator Ayotte, and to all those who have tried \nto create a compromise to enjoy bipartisan support--to the \nadministration--thank you all. To the critics, some of your criticism \nhas been unfounded. But you have the right to be a critic. You live in \nthe State called ``Live Free or Die.''\n  Let me remind everybody, being a critic and being able to speak your \nmind sometimes means people have to die.\n  What I am----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the Senator from New Hampshire \nhas expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, could I ask for 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I, of \ncourse, will not--how much time is left before our vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will do this in 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will save me 30 seconds, I would appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This idea of civil liberties and the American way of \nlife--if we do not fight for it, we are going to lose it. We are under \nsiege and we are under attack. So let's fight back within our values. \nThis bill allows us to fight back, and I am very proud of the product.\n  I thank Senator Levin for being such a good leader for the Nation at \na time when we need good leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me first thank Senators Graham and \nAyotte for their contributions this afternoon and long before this \nafternoon on this subject.\n  The best answer to some of the criticism we have heard this \nafternoon--the FBI has been successful. Why change it?--read the law, \nread the conference report.\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \n     existing criminal enforcement and national security \n     authorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. . . .\n\n  It is flatout explicit in the law.\n  Something else we have heard: We are doing something for the first \ntime--long-term custody for American citizens. Read the conference \nreport:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be con-\n     strued to affect existing law or authorities\n     relating to the detention of United States\n     citizens. . . .\n\n  I urge people to read our conference reports read the Senate bill, \nbefore they accept some of the arguments which have been made against \nthis conference report.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of the \nPress Secretary for the President that was issued yesterday on behalf \nof the President be printed in the Record, including this line:\n\n       [W]e have concluded that the language does not--\n\n  The language in the conference report--\n\nchallenge or constrain the President's ability to collect telling \nintelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect the \nAmerican people--\n\n  And the key words for many people--\n\n       and the President's senior advisors will not recommend a \n     veto.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Statement From the Press Secretary on the NDAA Bill\n\n       We have been clear that ``any bill that challenges or \n     contrains the President's critical authorities to collect \n     intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect \n     the Nation would prompt the President's senior advisers to \n     recommend a veto.'' After intensive engagement by senior \n     administration officials and the President himself, the \n     Administration has succeeded in prompting the authors of the \n     detainee provisions to make several important changes, \n     including the removal of problematic provisions. While we \n     remain concerned about the uncertainty that this law will \n     create for our counterterrorism professionals, the most \n     recent changes give the President additional discretion in \n     determining how the law will be implemented, consistent with \n     our values and the rule of law, which are at the heart of our \n     country's strength. This legislation authorizes critical \n     funding for military personnel overseas, and its passage \n     sends an important signal that Congress supports our efforts \n     as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan lead while \n     ensuring that our military can meet the challenges of the \n     21st century.\n       As a result of these changes, we have concluded that the \n     language does not challenge or constrain the President's \n     ability to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous \n     terrorists, and protect the American people, and the \n     President's senior advisors will not recommend a veto. \n     However, if in the process of implementing this law we \n     determine that it will negatively impact our counterterrorism \n     professionals and undercut our commitment to the rule of law, \n     we expect that the authors of these provisions will work \n     quickly and tirelessly to correct these problems.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, I want to thank all of my colleagues who \nparticipated in this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar.) The question is on agreeing to \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, I come to the floor to first say ``thank \nyou'' to my colleagues for supporting an incredible judge, but I also \ncome to the floor today to mark an anniversary. December 18, 2011, \nmarks the 40th anniversary of a truly historic date for the first \npeople of Alaska--passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. \nTo mark this historic occasion, Senator Murkowski and I have submitted \na Senate resolution to formally celebrate the success and contributions \nof Alaska Native people and their corporations. We will be asking for \nthe unanimous consent of our colleagues to adopt this resolution at a \ncertain point.\n  Over the past 40 years, Alaska has witnessed astonishing economic \ngrowth resulting from ANCSA. This has benefited not just Native people \nbut all Alaskans. This historic piece of legislation allowed a new \ngroup of people who for centuries were economically disadvantaged to \nenter into the business world and to become economic leaders. Under \nANCSA, they have contributed to the State and national economies in \nunprecedented ways. ANCSA has two primary goals: to resolve \nlongstanding issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska and to \nstimulate economic development.\n  Many Alaskans led the charge on creation and passage of the claims \nact. My father, the late Representative Nick Begich, was one of them. \nThere were many new Native leaders involved--Willie Hensley, John \nBorbridge, and other young advocates who very quickly engaged in this \nhistoric Native rights legislation.\n  Today, I would also like to recognize all the wives, daughters, \nsisters, secretaries, and other powerful women who contributed to the \npassage of ANCSA. Many of them may not have received formal recognition \nof their contributions, women such as Marlene Johnson, who played an \ninstrumental role in the creation and passage of ANCSA. She spent \ncountless hours flying to and from southeast Alaska and Washington, DC, \nleaving behind her full-time job and five children, doing her part to \nsee ANCSA move through Congress. To engage in negotiations, Alaskans \nwould fly for days to get from Barrow or Fairbanks or Kotzebue to \nWashington, DC. Many of them camped out on couches and floors in \nWashington for months to get it done.\n  Today, Alaska Native corporations are tremendous economic drivers not \nonly for Alaska but for the entire United States and even \ninternationally. In 2010, 8 of the 10 most profitable businesses in \nAlaska were Alaska Native corporations. Of the five that topped $1 \nbillion, all were Native corporations.\n  Cash dividends paid to corporation shareholders continue to be a very \nimportant source of income for many Alaska Native individuals and \nfamilies. In total, dividends paid by Alaska Native corporations to \ntheir shareholders rose by 39 percent from 2009 to 2010, up to $171 \nmillion.\n  These dividends serve Native families in many ways. In some cases, \nthey help provide basics, such as food and heating fuel or supplies and \nequipment to continue their subsistence way of life. For other \nfamilies, shareholder dividends go into college savings accounts or new \nstartup businesses. Sometimes they simply help offset the costs of \ncaring for their aging loved ones.\n  For the business owners everywhere, Native and non-Native alike, \nshareholder dividends provide a major economic boost. Today, Alaska \nNative corporations and their subsidiaries are providing thousands of \njobs across the United States. These corporations provide job training \nand scholarships and other support to create new opportunities for \nyoung shareholders and their descendents. The corporations also offer \nmeaningful internships to help young Alaska Natives build longstanding \nprofessional careers within the corporate structure. Elders, the most \nrespected people in the Native communities, receive special assistance \nand financial support from their corporations.\n  Clearly, 40 years later, many Alaska Native corporations have matured \nto become business leaders. Unfortunately, many others and the Alaska \nNatives they represent have not all had great success--yet.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was one approach, an \nexperiment to meet America's treaty obligations to the first people of \nthis country. I will continue to support the Alaska Native tribes while \nalso strengthening the capacity of the Alaska Native corporations.\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\n  Now we look forward to the next 40 years of ANCSA. I call on my \ncolleagues in this Chamber to work together to help all American Indian \nand Alaska Native people gain their economic independence. Through \nANCSA, we see this happening in Alaska. Alaska Native groups are proud \nof their culture and heritage but also of their business success. We \nall should be proud of this success.\n  In Alaska, we innovate. We rely on fresh approaches to solve our \nunique challenges. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is such an \nexample. It was a monumental act of Congress--one my father pushed \nforward and I know is profoundly successful and one that today I \nprofoundly defend.\n  With our national economy in its current state, we need more of this \nin America. We need to lift our people to build capacity and to allow \nthe first people of this Nation to succeed. When that happens, we all \nbenefit.\n  Madam President, Senator Murkowski and I ask you and our colleagues \nto support this resolution to recognize and honor the impact and \nimportance of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. More important, \nit honors Alaska's first people and their extraordinary accomplishments \nover the past 40 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8666-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8666]\n                     NOMINATION OF MORGAN CHRISTEN\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

As Senator Begich mentioned, Alaskans are celebrating \nother occasions this week as well.\n  I rise today to speak about a resolution Senator Begich and I have \nsubmitted that recognizes December 18, 2011, as the 40th anniversary of \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Our resolution recognizes and \ncommends the significant achievements Alaska Native people have made \nover the past 40 years through their congressionally created Alaska \nNative corporations.\n  Not only has the Alaska community risen to the challenge of creating \nsustainable businesses, but they have created employment opportunities \nfor our Nation's citizens really across the country--not just located \nin the State of Alaska but really all across our country and through \nthe world. Alaska Native corporations continue to make significant \ncontributions to their communities, our Nation, and the global economy, \nand for this they should be commended and they should be applauded.\n  Our resolution encourages the citizens of the United States to \nacknowledge and support the leadership and continued efforts of Alaska \nNative people in managing their resources through the Alaska Native \ncorporations. The resolution also sends a strong message of support to \nthousands of Alaska Native youth from across the State who are working \nand contributing positively to their families and to their communities, \nfocusing their efforts on earning a college education, participating in \ncultural activities, and realizing a dream that they may one day earn \nplaces of leadership within their own corporations. Their efforts are \nrecognized and appreciated.\n  Over this coming weekend, Alaska Natives and advocates from across \nthe United States will participate in community dialogs and celebratory \nevents to reflect upon what has been accomplished over these past 40 \nyears since passage of ANCSA. Participants will focus on the next steps \nthat are needed to improve upon the continued success and the unity of \nAlaska Native tribes, villages, and our corporations.\n  Through their participation and commitment to management of their \nresources through the vehicle of Alaska Native corporations, many young \nAlaska Native people will embark upon a lifetime journey of service, \ncommunity engagement, and philanthropy. Alaska Native corporations have \nafforded a unique opportunity for Alaska Native people to gain valuable \ninsights into the business world, while maintaining thoughtful focus on \nissues concerning Alaska Native tribes and communities.\n  The next generation of Alaska Native people will continue to make \npositive changes in the world around them through acquired leadership \nskills, cultural advocacy, and community engagement, and through their \ndedication and enthusiasm, the next generation of leaders honors the \nprevious generation of Alaska Native leaders who really worked so very \ndiligently to achieve the passage of the most significant Native lands \nsettlement in our Nation's history.\n  In addition to all of the very remarkable young people who will one \nday be managers and policymakers of their Native corporations, I honor \nthe work of those who contributed to the success of the passage of the \nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act. It was no easy feat negotiating \nthis very complex piece of litigation. It took the drafters years for \nthe settlement to be discussed, to be interpreted, analyzed, debated, \nnegotiated, and finalized. It was truly an accomplishment.\n\n  While no piece of legislation can claim perfection, the original \ndrafters of the ANCSA bill worked tirelessly to achieve a fair and a \njust settlement for the native people of Alaska and the ever-evolving \ndocument has had a number of significant amendments that have \nconsiderably improved the original bill.\n  While a list acknowledging all of the Alaska Native leaders and \nadvocates who worked on the act would prove impossibly long, I wish to \nrecognize a few of the people who have since passed, who played an \ninstrumental and an unforgettable role in its passage.\n  First, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Udall. I had both \nTom and Mark Udall sitting right in front of me before I began my \ncomments here. It is a tribute to him that he did so much in his \nservice as Secretary of the Interior. Also our own Senator Ted Stevens \nand his efforts; U.S. Congressman Nick Begich, who was instrumental in \npassage of ANCSA, and Morris Thompson, who is an Athabascan out of the \nKoyukon area. It was back in 1966 that Stewart Udall, who was Secretary \nof the Interior then, responded to pleas from Alaska Native groups, \nimposed a ``land freeze'' on all land in Alaska under Federal control, \nwhich amounted to about 96 percent of all the land in the State at the \ntime. Secretary Udall helped develop a program for solutions to the \nNative land claims issue throughout the State. Although ANCSA at that \ntime was still in its infancy, the freeze prevented the transfer of all \nremaining Federal lands and would remain in effect until the Native \nland claims were resolved. Without that freeze, the Alaska Native \npeople might have won their claim but they may not have had lands to \nselect.\n  Senator Stevens, in his role, called his work on the unprecedented \nlandmark legislation of ANCSA his Senate baptism of fire. In a 1991 \nnewspaper article, the Senator is quoted as saying that he believed a \nsettlement could be achieved because of his ``faith in the \ndetermination and the unity of purpose of Alaska's Native people.'' \nSenator Stevens was one of the advocates who pushed for the 40-million-\nacre land provision versus the 1 million acres the White House had \ninitially proposed.\n  With threats looming that subcommittee sessions would be called off, \nwhich would effectively end a negotiated settlement, Congressman Nick \nBegich played a key role in keeping the legislative process moving. By \nthe end of the negotiations, the subcommittee package was a tribute to \nthe Congressman's role as architect of the House compromise. One \nveteran lobbyist said:\n\n       It is the best individual achievement I have ever heard of \n     for a freshman Congressman.\n\n  I would be remiss in not mentioning the very unforgettable Morris \nThompson. At 34 years old, Morris was the youngest commissioner of the \nBureau of Indian Affairs. He held a Cabinet position in the Nixon \nadministration and,\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\nwith his Interior Department positions, Morris was very deeply involved \nin passage of the ANCSA at the time. He was a prominent leader in the \nNative, corporate, and political worlds. He was known for a good sense \nof humor, wit, and wisdom, but was also a very savvy businessman who \nled Doyon, which was an Alaska Native regional corporation, to great \nsuccess. His lifelong commitment to the people and progress of Alaska \ntruly lives on in his legacy.\n  I am proud of all these people. I value their idealism, their energy, \ndedication, and unique perspectives they brought to the table in \nworking toward the initial crafting of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act.\n  I thank Senator Begich for standing with me to submit this important \nresolution that acknowledges the hard work of the Alaska Native people \nin the success of their Alaska Native corporations on this 40th \nanniversary of passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. I \nknow Congressman Young joins with us in celebrating this anniversary as \nwell.\n\n\n                           Honoring Ray Mala\n\n  Since, as I mentioned, we are working a little bit on Alaska Day, I \nwish also to take a couple of moments here to recognize yet another \nAlaskan leader, truly an Alaskan legend. Two days after Christmas of \nthis year would have marked the 105th birthday of an Alaska legend, Ray \nMala. Despite insurmountable odds, Ray Mala dared to dream and he went \non to become our Nation's first Native American international film \nstar. He would have been 105, or he will have been, 2 days after \nChristmas, but he was our Nation's first Native American international \nfilm star. He was born in the remote village of Candle, to an immigrant \nfather of Russian Jewish descent. He was fluent in both English and his \nmother's native language of Inupiat. He was a skilled hunter. He \nlearned the Inupiat ways from his maternal grandmother, Nancy \nArmstrong, and while the family lived a traditional lifestyle, Mala \nlearned to walk in both the traditional and modern worlds. Facing \npoverty, Mala was a very accomplished hunter, using a bow and arrow to \ncatch whatever food he would bring home. Wearing a handmade fur parka, \nhe and his grandmother would traverse through harsh arctic storms in \npursuit of subsistence land animals. When they would return home, Mala \nwould pour himself into academic studies at the local school, always \nstriving to improve himself.\n  At age 16 he made his acting debut in the film ``Primitive Love.'' \nMala was initially hired as a laborer on the remote film set there in \nthe State, but film makers discovered his natural talent behind the \ncamera and, as I say, the rest is history. He was bitten by the acting \nbug. Mala set out for Hollywood. He worked his way up from sweeping the \nstage floors to being an assistant cameraman at Fox Studios.\n  Initially he was turned down for any leading roles because of the his \nmixed Eskimo-Jewish heritage, but Mala landed his first role in the \nsilent film ``Igloo,'' which was shot in Barrow, AK. The film's success \nearned him the title of the Eskimo Clark Gable.\n  In 1932, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, MGM Studios, sent a film crew from \nHollywood to Nome. My mother was born in Nome in 1932. Nome was a \npretty interesting community back there, still very rough around the \nedges, but they sent a film crew to Nome to begin shooting the film \nthat would thrust Mala into stardom. MGM struck gold with the film \n``Eskimo,'' a film also called ``Mala the Magnificent,'' the first \nfull-length feature film ever shot in Alaska. Mala became Alaska's \nfirst Hollywood film star and also the first nonwhite actor cast in a \nleading role. Over the span of his career, Mala would appear in over 25 \nfilms, all the while winning devoted fans across generations, across \ncultures--they loved him. His widely acclaimed role in ``Eskimo'' would \nearn Mala his place in Hollywood history.\n\n  He was more than an actor. He also excelled in cinematography and \nscreenwriting. Keep in mind, this is a young Eskimo boy, raised in the \ntraditional ways back in the early 1900s. Not only is he picked up by \nHollywood and is a phenomenal actor, but he also excels in \ncinematography and screenwriting. He worked on films with many \nlegendary filmmakers, including Alfred Hitchcock and Cecil B. DeMille. \nBut his blossoming career was cut short by his death at age 45 due to \nheart complications. Mala faced many challenging personal \ncircumstances, such as racial discrimination, at a very early age. But \nthat did not prevent him from achieving both personal and professional \nexcellence. I am sure he would be very proud to see that his grandson \nwas following in his acting footsteps.\n  This year, in her newly released book ``Eskimo Star,'' author Lael \nMorgan chronicled the inspirational life story of Ray Mala, and the \nState of Alaska hosted a Ray Mala film festival celebrating Mala's \nfilms in community theaters from Juneau all the way up to Point Hope.\n  It is a great honor for me to reflect on the life of this \ninspirational Alaska Native icon, and to offer a tribute to his \nspirited and very triumphant journey from small-town village boy to \nsilver screen leading man. Alaskans look forward to the day when Ray \nMala's magnificent star might be posthumously added to the Hollywood \nWalk of Fame, a tribute to the Nation's first ever Native American film \nstar.\n  It is a good way to end our Alaska day series. I appreciate the \nindulgence of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8667-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8667-S8669]\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it seems the President of the United \nStates has finally acknowledged that the economy is in a terrible state \nand there is nothing he can do about it. So, rather than offer new \nideas to grow the economy, the President has now shifted into blame \nmode. I recognize that the slow economic growth and high levels of \nunemployment are having a significant impact on the middle class. But \nrather than listen to political rhetoric and witness finger pointing by \nPresident Obama, the unemployed would likely prefer ideas, ideas on how \nto turn this economy around.\n  I presume President Obama aspired to lead the country because he \nbelieved he had the vision and the ability to lead to a more prosperous \nnation. But beyond the vision, a President also needs a plan and the \nleadership to put that vision into place. Where is that leadership? \nDuring the past 3 years, we witnessed President Obama's theory on \neconomic stimulus. We saw a massive expansion of government and deficit \nspending. More than $800 billion was spent on a failed economic \nstimulus bill that was supposed to keep unemployment below 8 percent. \nBut it did not. Government spending in the process has reached an \nunprecedented level. Today, the size of government, if you combine \nlocal, State, and Federal, is 40 percent of our gross national product. \nOne hundred years ago when Teddy Roosevelt delivered his speech in \nKansas, it was 8 percent. I refer to Teddy Roosevelt and the speech in \nKansas because the President of the United States now tried to \nduplicate that speech 100 years later.\n  Today, government consumes 40 percent of the entire economy. \nAccording to economic policies of President Obama, government needs to \ngrow even bigger to help our economy, and in the process there is a \ngoal to use government to redistribute wealth. If government gets a \nlittle bit bigger, the argument goes, and if it gets a little more \ninvolved, and particularly if it gets involved in every facet of our \neconomy and our lives, that will surely increase economic prosperity of \nall Americans. Right?\n  Of course not. All of this has led to taxes and deficit spending that \ncrowd out private investment that could grow the economy and, in the \nprocess, create jobs. Government doesn't create self-sustaining jobs; \ngovernment only creates government jobs. The private sector creates \njobs. It is the responsibility of the government to create an \nenvironment that leads to job growth. It does this by instituting the \nrule of law, property rights, the patent system, among others--and \nthere are a lot of others I ought to add to it. Government sets the \ntone.\n  Remember, government consumes well, it does not create well. Through \neconomic freedom, entrepreneurs are free to innovate and prosper. This \neconomic success leads to higher standards of living and a better \nquality of\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\nlife. Importantly, these gains do not come then at the expense of \nothers. Contrary to what some would have you believe, business growth \ndoes not have to come at the cost of others. In other words, it is not \na zero sum game. In fact, business success and economic growth lifts \nall boats through employment gains, higher wages, and value to \nconsumers, among a lot of other things that could be mentioned.\n\n  There are some who believe that individual success cannot be achieved \nwithout government involvement or intervention. What is more, they \nbelieve an individual's success must mean that someone else has been \ndeprived or they believe if someone else is successful, the success was \nachieved collectively only with the help of government or others in \nsociety. This line of thinking concludes that government and society \nis, therefore, entitled to some of those achievements.\n  President Obama's recent speech in Kansas provides great insight into \nhis economic theory. He clearly believes government should be involved \nat every level of individual and business activity. The President says \nthat hard-working Americans should be rewarded for their achievements. \nHowever, his economic vision demonstrates his belief that individual \nsuccess is due to society, not because of hard work or individual \neffort. This line of thinking is in stark contradiction to our \ncountry's founding principles that government exists to allow for the \nindividual to achieve success and the pursuit of happiness.\n  The idea of government intervention runs contrary to our founding \nprinciples of individual and economic freedom. Government exists to \nserve the needs of people rather than people serving the needs of their \ngovernment. There are some who believe government is the only creator \nof economic prosperity, but if others have achieved success, they must \nbe, by default, the cause of other people's hardships. This type of \nclass warfare demagoguery is harmful to our country and our country's \nfuture and our people's future, and it has the end result of dividing \nAmerica. It creates envy, hatred, and resentment toward those who have \nworked hard, played by the rules, and achieved success. This divisive \nrhetoric seeks to put blame on the successful for the hardships of \nthose who have been hurt during this recession.\n  Most Americans don't support President Obama's divisive vision and \nrhetoric. The American people still believe if you work hard and play \nby the rules, you can be successful and you can flourish. I doubt the \nmajority of Americans believe it is the goal of government to intervene \nin this process. In fact, most Americans would be happy to have the \ngovernment get out of the way. Most Americans believe in individual \nresponsibility and liberty, including freedom to succeed and freedom to \nfail.\n  It appears President Obama's commitment to these fundamental freedoms \nis less sure. Based on his recent speech in Kansas, it seems the \nFederal Government is the answer to all of America's problems. \nAccording to the President, if we tax the wealthy, ensure they pay \ntheir fair share, we can get our economy back on the right track. \nPresident Obama wants the American people to believe higher taxes on \njob creators will lead to economic prosperity and create jobs. This is \ncontrary to what Republicans know to be true. It is also contrary to \nthe vision President John F. Kennedy knew to be true when in the 1963 \ntax bill he reduced the marginal tax rates very dramatically. President \nJohn F. Kennedy recognized the economic benefits of lowering taxes, so \nin his State of the Union Address on January 14, 1963, President \nKennedy spoke of the need to increase economic growth and job creation. \nHe stated:\n\n       To achieve these greater gains, one step, above all, is \n     essential--the enactment this year of a substantial reduction \n     and revision in the Federal income taxes . . . A net \n     reduction in tax liabilities . . . will increase the \n     purchasing power of American families and business enterprise \n     in every tax bracket.\n\n  He further stated:\n\n       It will, in addition, encourage the addition and risk-\n     taking on which our free enterprise system depends--induce \n     more investment, production, and capacity use . . . and \n     reinforce the American principle of additional reward for \n     additional effort.\n\n  It is worth repeating. President Kennedy pushed for lowering Federal \nincome taxes to encourage initiative and risk-taking to induce \ninvestment, production, and economic growth. President Kennedy \nrecognized and believed in the American principle of additional reward \nfor additional effort.\n  It seems to me, from the speeches that have been made recently, that \nour President--meaning President Obama--disagrees. It seems to me that \nhe argues innovators and job creators should be subjected to punitive \ntax increases for being successful. He seems to believe economic growth \nwill come by confiscating the wealth of job creators and sending that \nmoney to Washington, and I could not disagree more.\n  For Americans to prosper, we must first reduce the size of \ngovernment. This year the Federal Government will spend about 24 \npercent of our gross domestic product. This type of spending has led to \nannual deficits above $1 trillion for the past 3 years. The total debt \nstands at over $15 trillion. This is 100 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. The size of government, the size of deficits, the size of \ndebt, and the size of interest payments are unsustainable over the long \nhaul. We must reverse course.\n  Second, we must work to reform the Tax Code to provide certainty and \npredictability. Nearly every day our President is on the campaign trail \ntalking about tax increases. It is no wonder our job creators, \nparticularly small businesses, are reluctant to make business decisions \nor investments in this climate, which decisions we would hope if they \nwould make them would obviously lead to a great deal of job creation in \nthe private sector. This country doesn't need more taxes, we need more \ntaxpayers, and the way to get more taxpayers is to have more people \nworking.\n  The President's threat of higher taxes is directly inhibiting job \ngrowth and economic expansion. It is time for President Obama to \nrecognize that with 13 million Americans unemployed and anemic economic \ngrowth, tax increases will harm, not help, economic recovery.\n  Finally, we had a recent Gallup poll finding that compliance with \ngovernment regulations is the single biggest issue facing small \nbusiness owners today. You might think we would emphasize the Fortune \n500 big corporations when it comes to creating jobs, but we know that \n70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small business, so \nwe ought to be concentrating on what small business people are telling \nus about the economy not turning around.\n  Small business owners, when it comes from the standpoint of \nregulations, need to spend less time and money making sure they comply \nwith burdensome and needless Washington regulations. Those valuable \nresources should be spent growing their business, hiring more workers, \nand as a result growing our economy. We must halt the Federal \nGovernment regulations binge. For many of these new regulations, the \ncost of compliance outweighs the public benefit. They are acting like a \nwet blanket on our economy. There should be a moratorium on new \nregulations.\n\n  I want to give you a perfect example that is now an issue before the \nCongress, the Keystone XL Pipeline. At a time of high unemployment and \nenergy costs, the Federal Government should not be standing in the way \nof private investment that will create jobs and increase our energy \nsupply. It is unconscionable that the largest private shovel-ready \nconstruction project is being delayed by President Obama's decision to \noverride two different studies by the State Department and that there \nwas no negative environmental impact. It seems the only jobs President \nObama is interested in creating are government jobs or government-\nsubsidized jobs. The unfounded delay should be ended and the pipeline \nproject should move ahead.\n  This situation typifies the Obama philosophy that the free market and \nintelligent Americans are incapable of making informed decisions. The \nargument we hear is that Americans are not smart enough to know we need \nsolar energy rather than fossil fuels. So our big government caretaker \nuses \\1/2\\ billion in taxpayer dollars to support a solar company while \nsimultaneously blocking an entirely private enterprise from developing \nan oil pipeline that will make us much more energy independent. We have \nseen how the decision by the government elite to support\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\nSolyndra has worked out. It was a complete failure.\n  It is time we got out of the way of the Keystone Pipeline. I hope the \nAmerican people will dismiss the economic theories and visions of our \nPresident as he seeks to divide our country. I believe we can achieve a \nprosperous future by empowering individuals rather than our Federal \nGovernment. Americans are smart enough to put their trust in themselves \nand their neighbors, not in bigger government. It is time to end the \npolitical blame game and divisive rhetoric and, instead, work on \ngenuine and real policies that will create economic jobs and, more \nimportantly, economic growth that is going to help all Americans; in \nother words, expanding the economy because this does not have to be a \nzero sum gain. We can have more for more people, and if we don't have \nmore for more people, we are going to have less for more people and \neverybody is going to lose out.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we are in the midst of an important \ndebate over whether we will allow all working Americans to be hit with \na big tax increase next year.\n  This is a critical measure of relief for our working families in \nthese tough times. During the aftermath of the most severe recession \nsince the Great Depression, many middle-class Americans cannot afford \nto lose the $1,000 the average family receives from this tax cut. \nFurthermore, economists across the spectrum believe that extending the \npayroll tax cut is a critical step in building momentum toward a \nstronger recovery and minimizing the chances that our economy could \nslip back into recession.\n  While keeping working Americans from being hit with this tax increase \nis our first and most important priority, we must also look to what is \nbest for our economy when deciding on offsets for the cost. The offset \nin the bill that we voted on 2 weeks ago made good sense: asking \nmillionaires and billionaires to fund a fairer share of our national \nbudget. I am concerned, however, about a new offset provision in S. \n1944 that increases the guarantee fee on mortgages backed by Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac. I am very wary of placing additional costs on new \nmortgages given the ongoing crisis in the housing and mortgage markets. \nMoreover, if there is such a fee increase, it should be used to \nstrengthen our battered housing market.\n  I look forward to discussing other offsets with my colleagues as we \ncontinue this debate. This much is clear: Keeping this tax cut in place \nis a huge factor in the success of our working families and a huge \nfactor in the recovery of our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8669-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8669-S8670]\n                            FEDERAL WORKERS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is time for Republicans to end their \nwar on dedicated, hard-working middle-class Federal employees. Who are \nthese Federal workers? They are the Veterans' Administration's nursing \nassistants who care for our wounded warriors; the Department of Defense \ncivilian employees who support our military troops at home and abroad; \nSocial Security Administration claims representatives who process \nbenefits to our Nation's senior citizens and people who qualify for \ndisability payments. They also include Nobel prize-winning scientists \nwho are conducting groundbreaking research at the National Institutes \nof Health and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on \neverything from fighting cancer to understanding the origins of the \nuniverse; the Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug \nAdministration staff who keep our air and water clean and our food and \ndrugs safe; the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic \ncontrollers who keep the skies safe; also, the Department of Justice, \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and United States Marshal Service \nattorneys and law enforcement officers who track down and arrest and \nconvict terrorists and drug cartel and gang members.\n  The list of those who are on the front line of public service goes on \nand on. Federal employees are dedicated and hard-working, and like many \nother Americans, many of them are struggling to deal with their family \nbudgets. And yet Federal employees are already contributing $60 billion \nto the deficit reduction through a 2-year pay freeze.\n  They have already contributed to deficit reduction. They were the \nfirst in line to try to help balance our budget.\n  Like their private sector counterparts, Federal employees haven't \nbeen immune to the country's economic woes. They are confronting \nsimilar hardships: disabled or unemployed spouses, declining home \nvalues, rising gasoline and living expenses. Many Federal employees \nhead single-parent families. As do other Americans, many Federal \nemployees struggle to pay their mortgages and find ways to send their \nchildren to college.\n  H.R. 3630, the House Republicans' payroll tax cut bill, would require \n2 million Federal employees to shoulder nearly one-half of the cost of \na tax reduction that benefits 160 million Americans. So what the \nRepublican bill is doing is extending the payroll tax reductions for \nworking families, but saying to the middle-class Federal worker: You \nare going to pay most of the burden. That is not going to help our \neconomy. That is not the right way to extend the payroll tax reduction.\n  The current Republican assault on our Federal employees is piled on \ntop of the current 2-year pay freeze, which is piled on top of a \nworkforce already lagging behind the private sector when it comes to \npay. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, \naverage wages among all workers in our economy have risen over 600 \npercent since 1969, while salaries for civilian Federal employees have \ngrown by a little over 400 percent since 1969. There is a widening gap \nbetween public sector employees and the private sector.\n  What these proposals would do is widen that gap even further.\n  Republicans want to extend the current pay freeze for another year. \nThat would cost a Federal employee who makes $50,000 annually about \n$800 a year. A 3-year pay freeze would cost GS-5 employees almost \n$4,000 in cumulative lost salaries; for GS-7 employees, almost $5,000 \nin cumulative lost salaries; and for GS-9 employees, almost $6,000 in \ncumulative lost salaries.\n  The Republican bill would require massive increases in the \ncontributions current and future Federal employees make to their \nretirement system--a system that is currently fully funded--while \nslashing benefits. That is rubbing salt in the wound of the additional \npay freeze. So the Republican bill takes a 2-year pay freeze and adds a \nthird year pay freeze and tells our employees to triple their \ncontributions to their retirement system, which is another pay cut. It \nis not only a freeze, Republicans are proposing. It's a pay cut for our \nFederal workers.\n  In addition to these assaults, we are already asking the federal \nworkforce to do more with less. As my colleagues have noticed, when it \ncomes to job growth numbers, the public sector numbers aren't going up; \nthey're going down. But the workload isn't going down. We are asking \nour Federal workers to do more with less, to have a 2-year pay freeze, \nand now to take a pay cut. That is not fair.\n  The Republicans save their most severe punishment for future Federal \nemployees, making it clear that their intention is to provide as many \ndisincentives for people to consider a career in public service as \npossible. Increasing pension contributions for future hires by 3.2 \npercent would force an employee making $30,000 a year to pay $1,200 \nrather than $400. We should be embracing people who are willing to \nengage in public service. The Republicans are doing just the opposite.\n  It is time for the Republicans to stop their war on hard-working \nFederal employees. Increasingly, the Federal workforce is being asked \nto do more with less. Increasingly, the Federal workforce is being \nasked to shoulder a disproportionate share of deficit reduction. It is \ntime to stop that assault. I think it is time we all properly recognize \nthe dedication, hard work, valor, sacrifice, and professionalism of our \nFederal workers.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8670-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8670-S8671]\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the past 3 weeks I think I have come \nto the floor three times to discuss the case on the President's health \ncare reform bill: one time to discuss the constitutionality of the \nindividual mandate and another time to deal with the severability \nclause. I come now to speak about the unconstitutionality of the \nmassive expansion of Medicaid. Those are three of four issues that the \nCourt is going to deal with. My colleagues probably remember the Court \nhas extended the period of time they normally deal with arguments \nbefore them from 1 hour to 5\\1/2\\ hours because this is such a very \nimportant case.\n  Today I wish to talk about the far-reaching implications of this \nmandate, but also about the constitutionality of the Medicaid \nexpansion. If the Supreme Court rules the individual mandate \nunconstitutional, it will have the effect of striking down this new law \nthat has not been fully implemented. If the Supreme Court rules that \nthe Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, \nit has the potential to cause significant changes in a program that has \nbeen in operation for the last 46 years.\n  Just to remind everybody about Medicaid, it was created in 1965 at \nexactly the same time Medicare was created. Where Medicare was created \nto provide health care coverage for our senior citizens, Medicaid was \ncreated as a safety net for low-income individuals. Medicare is run \nexclusively by the Federal Government. Medicaid is a Federal-State \npartnership. The Federal Government sets the parameters of the Medicaid \nProgram. It pays at least half of the program in every State but then \nturns the functional operation of the Medicaid Program over to the \nStates.\n  In the 46 years since both programs were created, eligibility for the \nMedicare Program has been essentially unchanged. On the other hand, \neligibility for the Medicaid Program has expanded significantly through \nthe years and, with that, the program has grown dramatically as well.\n  Medicaid, when it was created, covered fewer than 5 million. Today, \nthe Medicaid Program currently covers nearly 57 million. The program \nspends more than $300 billion each year.\n  Medicaid has expanded so dramatically for two reasons. First, at \nvarious points in the last 46 years Congress has mandated that the \nStates increase eligibility and services for the program. Second, \nCongress has also given the States the option to expand their \neligibility. When Congress gives States the option of expanding their \neligibility, States can expand and the Federal Government will still \nprovide its proportionate share of Federal dollars.\n  For instance, one of the programs I helped get passed with Senator \nKennedy from Massachusetts when he was a Member of the Senate was a \nprogram that allowed some help for families who had particularly high \nhealth care costs for kids--something that was just catastrophically \nhigh. That is just one example.\n  The decision to expand is up to the States. When Congress mandates \nthe States expand eligibility, States can either expand their programs \nor forfeit all Federal funds for the program.\n  Now, this is what we call an all-or-nothing requirement. It has been \nused in every expansion of the program. The all-or-nothing requirement \non States has not only been used to expand eligibility within the \nMedicaid Program, but it has been used to expand services and require \nchanges in the administration of the program.\n\n  If the Federal Government wants States to cover podiatrists in \nMedicaid, the Federal Government can mandate States to do so. If a \nState doesn't do it? Withhold all Federal dollars to that State. If the \nFederal Government wants States to implement a secondary payer program \nto ensure that services are being properly paid by private dollars, the \nFederal Government can mandate States to do so and withhold every \nFederal dollar if that State refuses to go along.\n  It has been a staple of the program for 46 years that the Federal \nGovernment can require States to do certain things in Medicaid. Now \ncomes along the Affordable Care Act. That act requires States to expand \ntheir Medicaid Program to cover all individuals up to 133 percent of \nthe poverty level. It is the first expansion of Medicaid's mandatory \neligibility groups since the all-or-nothing expansion in the bills of \n1989 and 1990. Those were both reconciliation acts.\n  It is this all-or-nothing requirement that States are challenging and \nthat the Supreme Court will consider next year and has given a certain \nportion of the 5\\1/2\\ hours just to debate this issue. So I think that \nmeans the Supreme Court thinks this is a very significant issue they \nare being asked to consider.\n  So I would like to describe the arguments being made by the States \nthat this is an unconstitutional use of congressional power. The States \nargue that the 10th amendment limits the power of Congress to coerce \nStates to accept Federal funds as opposed to providing inducements. The \nStates argue that a restriction on Federal funds compels rather than \ninduces if its burdens and losses as they affect vital ordinary State \nfunctions are too burdensome and costly. So I quote from their \nposition:\n\n       By conditioning all of the States Federal Medicaid \n     funding--for most States, more than a billion dollars each \n     year--upon agreement to substantially expand their Medicaid \n     programs, the Affordable Care Act passes the point at which \n     pressure turns into compulsion and achieves forbidden direct \n     regulation of the States.\n\n  The part of the quote which says it is at the point where pressure \nturns into compulsion makes the act unconstitutional because it has \nalways been a principle that the Federal Government can put certain \nconditions on States, but if it reaches a point where the State has to \ndo it, in this case the States say: You have really gone too far.\n  The Affordable Care Act withholds all Federal dollars, then, from \nStates that refuse to submit to the policy dictates of the Congress. \nMedicaid accounts for more than 40 percent of all Federal funds that \nStates receive. States spend on average 20 percent of their State \nbudget on Medicaid. Federal funds cover, on average, 57 cents of each \ndollar spent on the program because previously I said the Federal \nGovernment gives every State at least 50 percent, but the average of \nall 50 States is 57 percent of the Medicaid dollars coming from Federal \ndollars.\n  In my State of Iowa, for instance, I think it is 63 percent from the \nFederal Government and 37 percent of State funds. So the loss of all \nFederal Medicaid funding would obviously be devastating to the States.\n  The States maintain that the law's expansion of Medicaid was \ndeliberately designed to force the States to agree to expand the \nprogram because of the threat that a State's entire Federal funding \nstream would be cut off if they decided not to go along with decisions \nmade in Congress. In the harshest terms, they were made an offer they \ncould not refuse. Further quoting from the States' argument:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act essentially holds the States \n     hostage based on their earlier decision to establish a \n     Medicaid infrastructure and accept federal funds subject to \n     different conditions.\n       The Affordable Care Act uses the States' decision to accept \n     earlier federal inducements against them, and, in doing so, \n     presents states with no real choice: they must abandon \n     completely the existing Medicaid system and funding or accept \n     the radical new conditions. This amounts to a massive bait-\n     and-switch.\n\n  The States are arguing to the Supreme Court that there is no way the \nStates can turn down a Federal inducement as massive as all Medicaid \nfunding.\n  This is especially true because the effect of declining is that the \nState's own taxpayers have to pay the full cost of providing health \ncare for the neediest citizens of the State and, at the same time, \nprovide the Federal Government taxes for Medicaid funds that would be \ndistributed to pay for the program, including expansion in the other 49 \nStates.\n  Since no State could make taxpayers fund the State and Federal \nportions of Medicaid, while also taxing their citizens to pay for \nMedicaid in the other 49 States, it is a phony choice, not a real \nchoice, for the States to turn down the money to expand their Medicaid \nPrograms. In other words, the States are being compelled to do so.\n  The States argue that giving notice of the coercion they face does \nnot make the choice any less coercive, and they argue that when States \noriginally accepted Medicaid, they were not\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\nwarned that their participation would put them at the mercy of any \nfuture unpredictable congressional demands.\n  The States are arguing Congress can change Medicaid, and Congress can \ncondition the funding for those changes on State agreement to them.\n  But it cannot force changes on the States by threatening them with \nthe loss of the entirety of Federal funds.\n  Although the Federal Government will pay the vast majority of the \ncost of expansion, the States also point out that coercion turns on the \nfinancial inducement that Congress offers, not the amount a State is \ncoerced to spend.\n  The critical issue is what is referred to as the ``coercion \ndoctrine.'' The coercion doctrine protects the States' decision whether \nthe inducement is worth the cost.\n  Among the controlling cases is South Dakota v. Dole in 1987. The \nSupreme Court there upheld a Federal law that threatened States with \nthe loss of 5 percent of Federal highway funds if they did not raise \ntheir drinking age to 21.\n  Remember, that was only 5 percent of their road funds, not 100 \npercent of their road funds, as in the case of the all-or-nothing in \nthe case of Medicaid, where if you do not go along, you are going to \nlose everything.\n  So in that Dole case, writing for the majority, Chief Justice \nRehnquist noted:\n\n       Our decisions have recognized that, in some circumstances, \n     the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so \n     coercive as to pass the point at which ``pressure turns into \n     compulsion.''\n\n  In the years since the Dole decision, Federal courts have yet to \nestablish a clear test for coercion. I assume that is what could happen \nif they would overturn Congress's decision; that there would be a \nclearer test of coercion in this Affordable Care Act.\n  The Supreme Court will be challenged in this affordable care act case \nto determine where the limits of Federal coercion, if any, lie.\n  It is difficult to overstate the potential implications of this \nparticular aspect of the affordable care act in the case that is being \nappealed.\n  There are three specific ways this decision could have a profound \nimpact on Federal policy if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the \nStates.\n  A ruling for the States could affect future Medicaid policy, current \nMedicaid policy, and broader Federal-State partnerships.\n  The expansion of Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act was written to \nminimize the cost to the States. The Federal Government pays for 100 \npercent of the cost of the Medicaid expansion in the first few years, \nbefore transitioning to an approximately 92-percent share of the cost \nof the expansion.\n  If the Federal Government cannot require expansion of the Medicaid \nProgram and pick up 92 percent of the tab, what can the Federal \nGovernment require? Would a mandatory expansion be constitutional if \nthe Federal Government permanently paid for 100 percent of the cost? \nCould the Federal Government mandate future expansions if they were \nmuch smaller in scope, such as in the 1989 and 1990 mandatory \nexpansions under those reconciliation bills?\n  If the Federal Government wanted to require States to cover \npodiatrists or implement a secondary payer program, could it do so \nusing Federal funds as leverage to require it?\n  A ruling in favor of the States would raise those questions.\n  Further, if the current mandatory expansion of Medicaid is \nunconstitutional, what does that imply for previous expansions and \npolicies?\n  In the 1989 and 1990 acts, when Congress required States to expand \neligibility for women and children, Congress did so without providing \nany additional funding to the States beyond their normal share, which \nin the case of Iowa today would be 63 percent Federal, 37 percent \nState.\n  If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the States, will previous \nmandatory expansions to Medicaid be subject to challenge? Will a State \nbe able to challenge the existing enforcement mechanism of withholding \nFederal dollars if a State wants to ignore a service requirement or an \nantifraud provision? These questions will then have to be answered.\n  Finally, a Supreme Court ruling on a coercion test necessarily has \nbroader implications for all Federal-State partnerships. The original \nDole case was about transportation funding.\n  A Supreme Court ruling in favor of the States will necessarily bring \ninto question every agreement between the Federal Government and the \nStates where the Federal Government conditions 100 percent of the \nFederal funds on States meeting requirements that are determined in \nWashington, DC.\n  It is certainly possible that such a Supreme Court ruling could \nrequire future Congresses to carefully consider a coercion test in \ndesigning legislation.\n  A Supreme Court ruling in favor of the States in this case could not \nonly jeopardize the mandated Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care \nAct but could challenge the fundamental structure of Medicaid and have \nbroader implications outside health care.\n  One may ask: Does the Supreme Court have this case before it--and why \ndoes it have it before it?--a case with such broad and far-reaching \nimplications? It is because of a massive restructuring of our health \ncare system in a partisan fashion, using nearly every procedural tool \nat the majority party's disposal in accomplishing the goal of passage.\n  The constitutionality of this law has been challenged in numerous \ncourts throughout the country. These challenges will soon be heard \nbefore the Supreme Court. While most people want to focus on the \nindividual mandate, it is important we do not forget the potential \nconsequence of the Medicaid question before the Court.\n  It could, obviously, strike the expansion in the Affordable Care Act. \nIt could hamstring future Congresses as they consider potential \npolicies for the Medicaid Program in the future. It could threaten the \nfundamental structure of the Medicaid Program by bringing into question \nall the requirements on the States in the program today. It could \nrequire future Congresses to consider the structure of every Federal-\nState partnership.\n  We are here discussing this because the White House and the \nDemocratic majority put their partisan goals ahead of collaboration \nwith Republicans and States to build legitimate public policy--contrary \nto how most social policy in this country has been devised: Social \nSecurity, bipartisan; Medicare, Medicaid, bipartisan; civil rights \nlaws, bipartisan--but not this Affordable Care Act, a partisan \ndocument.\n  Now we see that far more than this one specific policy is threatened. \nIf the Supreme Court accepts the States' argument, a host of \nconstitutional questions will surround the operation of many Federal \nfunding streams to the States. It would be difficult to overstate the \nsignificance of such a ruling. I have outlined it was not necessary for \nthe Congress to have taken action that might produce that result.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is a lot of conversation in the \nbuilding today about one of the provisions that is holding up the \nomnibus; they are saying this is Cuba travel, families traveling back \nto Cuba. I have strong opinions about that as well. Suffice it to say \nthat it is important to let my colleagues know what is being asked for \nin the omnibus, and what will be coming over here if it is kept in, \nwill not prohibit families from traveling to Cuba. It will limit the \namount that they can. That is a wise policy, one that I support, \nbecause it limits access to hard currency to a tyrannical regime.\n  I am here to talk about a different part of the Cuba policy, however, \nCuban travel, which does not get a lot of notice these days, but it is \npart of conversations that are ongoing with the administration and the \nState Department with regard to some of the appointments they have in \nthe Western Hemisphere, and that is the so-called people-to-people \ntravel.\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\n  I have here in my hand an immediate release from January 14, 2011, \ntitled ``Reaching Out to the Cuban People.'' It came from the \nPresident, where he announced a series of steps to continue efforts to \nreach out to the Cuban people in support of their desire to freely \ndetermine their country's future.\n  One of the changes they made is to something they call purposeful \ntravel. It says here:\n\n       The President believes these actions--\n\n  Which I am about to describe--\n\n       combined with the continuation of the embargo, are \n     important steps in reaching the widely shared goal of a Cuba \n     that respects the basic rights of all its citizens.\n\n  Right here in this release--and I am glad he wrote it--the President \nis stating that in combination with the embargo, the steps that he \nwanted to take, the goal of these steps was reaching the widely shared \ngoal of a Cuba that respects the basic rights of all of its citizens. \nThat is the reason why he made these policy changes. So far so good.\n  Let me tell you one of the policy changes. It is called ``restore \nspecific licensing of educational exchanges not involving academic \nstudy pursuant to a degree program under the auspices of an \norganization that sponsors and organizes people-to-people programs.''\n  What that means in plain English is this is not colleges or \nuniversities; these are organizations not for degree credits--\neducational in purpose, but not for degree credits. What we want to do \nis encourage them or allow them the opportunity to take Americans to \nCuba under their auspices.\n  Again, remember, the goal here is to bring about, as the President \nstated, ``the widely shared goal of a Cuba that respects the basic \nrights of all of its citizens.'' That is the purpose of these trips.\n  I decided to look up some of these trips, and let's look at some of \nthe itineraries. They are very interesting. Let me read you one. This \none is from an organization called Insight Cuba. It is located in New \nYork. I am not going to advertise their Web site. Let them pay for it. \nBut I will tell you this. There is an itinerary for something called \nthe Cuban Music & Art Experience. Sounds interesting, the Cuban Music & \nArt Experience. Let's go to some of the highlights.\n  Day 2 in Havana. You are going to get to meet with the Castro \nMinistry of Culture to learn how Cuba promotes the arts on this diverse \nisland. You are also going to get to spend the evening--and this will \nbecome a familiar theme here--dusting off your dancing shoes, because \ntonight you are going to head off to Casa de la Musica. Here you will \nenjoy performances by local Cuban artists and, of course, dance. They \nput an exclamation mark after it. This is an important part of this \ntrip. This is day 2 of this trip designed to promote, as the President \nwrote, ``the widely shared goal of a Cuba that respects the basic \nrights of its citizens.''\n  Day 3 is interesting too. You get to go to this place Casa de la \nAmistad, which basically means Friendship House. There you will meet \nwith your Cuban ``host'' which I would bet you right now is members of \nthe Castro government and perhaps enjoy another exciting musical \nperformance. Then you spend the evening of day 3 back at Casa de la \nMusica for some incredible salsa music and dancing.\n  Day 4 is the real highlight of this trip. This is not to be missed. \nYou get to fly to Santiago de Cuba. Guess where you get to visit. You \nget to visit a place called Quartel Moncada, which is basically an old \narmy barracks where, on July 26 of 1952, Fidel Castro launched the \nCuban revolution. You get to visit this place where Fidel Castro's \nrevolution actually began. Imagine. I can see where that begins to \nfurther ``the widely shared goal of a Cuba that respects the basic \nrights of all of its citizens.''\n  Guess what you get to do at night. You guessed it. You get to spend \nthe night at a music and local dance club to hear performances by \nCuba's most popular artists and you get to dance. It goes on and on.\n  Day 5 has dancing.\n  Day 6, you get to visit the historic Granma Province, which is known \nas the birthplace of Cuban nationality. You get to meet with the Cuban \nInstitute for Friendship Between the People, which is a very catchy \ntitle. That night, you get to spend the evening at Casa de la Trova to \ndance and take in a performance of Cuban artists. It goes on and on.\n  Day 7.\n  Day 8.\n  This is quite an adventure and in pursuit of the government of Cuba \nthat respects the basic rights of all of its citizens.\n  Let me share another one. Before I get to one, I think this is \nanother Insight Cuba one. This one takes you, on day 1--this is called \nthe Havana Jazz Experience, and on day 1, it takes you to explore the \nfamous Cathedral Square, the City Museum, and the Havana Club Rum \nMuseum. This is part of this effort to bring about freedom and \ndemocracy in Cuba. You get to go there. At night, you go to the jazz \nclub La Zorra y el Cuervo. There you get to do some of the best dancing \nyou can ever imagine, in a very intimate setting.\n  Day 3 brings you to Cojimar, which is a village which is the setting \nfor ``The Old Man and the Sea'' which won the Nobel prize for \nliterature in 1954, Ernest Hemingway, very interesting. You get to sit \nthere at night and then you do get to go up to the hills where you get \nto learn about the religion of Santeria, which is an Afro-Cuban \nreligion. You get to learn all about that.\n\n  Then at night you get to go back to Havana--you guessed it--for \ndancing at a local jazz club.\n  Day 4, you get to go to the infamous now--I have already mentioned it \nbefore--Casa de la Amistad, a historic mansion, where you will have the \nopportunity to observe a forum regarding United States-Cuba relations \nput together by the Cuban government, very interesting, in pursuit of \nthe goal of a Cuba that respects the basic rights of all of its \ncitizens. You spend the night at a jazz cafe, where the seaside view is \nalmost as impressive as the musicians who play there nightly. I am \nguessing now, I am not sure, but there might be some dancing involved \non night 4 in Cuba.\n  Night 5 is quite interesting too, because there you get to learn from \nthe actual Cuban musicians about the sensual and passionate rhythms of \ntheir music, and you round out the day with a 2-hour salsa class, in \nfurtherance of freedom and democracy. That is trip No. 2.\n  There are a lot of these. There is one more. This one is good. This \none is called ``Cuba for Educators: Ethics & The Revolution.'' So you \ngo to Cuba to learn about ethics from the Castro regime.\n  On day 2 you get to visit the Museum of the Revolution where you will \nlearn about the ethical foundations of the Cuban revolution. This is \nnot to be missed. Clearly we want to learn about ethics from the Castro \nregime. Then you get to go to the Literacy Museum, where you get to \nlearn about Cuba's war on illiteracy, which was one of Fidel Castro's \ngoals in his 1960 speech to the United Nations.\n  Day No. 3, you get to meet the Ministry of Public Health, which I \nassure you is a government employee, because it sounds like it, \nMinistry of Public Health, and you get to discuss why revolutionary \nethics demand free public health care, while our own society will not \neven consider it. Very interesting. It goes on and on. And, by the way, \nthere is a bunch of dancing in this one too. But I think you get the \npoint. This is run by a group called the Center for Cuban Studies.\n  Why do I say all of this? It is pretty simple. There is this sports \nshow, I think it is on ESPN on Sunday nights where they review NFL \nhighlights. Michael Irvin, who was a great player, has a segment called \n``Come On, Man,'' where they put on some ridiculous things that \nhappened during the day. He is like, ``Come on, man.'' When I look at \nthis stuff, you know what I want to say? Come on, man.\n  This is about promoting democracy and freedom in Cuba? This is not \nabout promoting freedom and democracy in Cuba. This is nothing more \nthan tourism. This is tourism for Americans who at best are curious \nabout Cuba and, at worst, sympathize with the Cuban regime.\n  You may ask: We are a free society. Why would we restrict that? Here \nis why. Because this is not just a source of irritation; this is a \nsource of hard currency, of millions of dollars in the hands of the \nCastro government that they use to oppress the Cuban people,\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\nand to jail and hold hostage an American citizen, who today is being \nheld hostage in Cuba, Alan Gross. By the way, after they took him \nhostage, we implemented this policy.\n  So this policy is a reward for what? Here is my challenge to the \nadministration and the State Department. I know you are not going to \nchange your mind. I know you people in this people-to-people stuff. I \nknow someone has sold you a bill of goods that this people-to-people \ntravel is a good idea, it will further democracy and freedom in Cuba. I \nget that. You are not going to change your mind. But at least examine \nhow this is being implemented, because this is a charade. This is an \nembarrassment. These people are getting licenses to conduct this \noutrageous tourism, which, quite frankly, borders on indoctrination of \nAmericans by Castro government officials.\n  I hope we will continue to look at this, and that this \nadministration, as part of its Western Hemispheric approach, will look \nat these trips for what they are. They are an outrage. They are \ngrotesque. They are providing hard currency to a regime that oppresses \nits people, that jails people because they disagree with the \ngovernment. It is wrong. This is not what we are about as a country. \nThis cannot be what we defend. Even if you agree with this people-to-\npeople theory and concept, you cannot justify how this program is being \nimplemented, or these people who are getting licenses to conduct these \nkinds of trips.\n  I hope in our conversations with the State Department about their \nappointments in the Western Hemisphere, and specifically the nomination \nof Roberta Jacobsen, we will use that as an opportunity to examine how \nthese programs are being implemented. Because, quite frankly, they are \nan outrage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2867, the United \nStates Commission on International Religious Freedom Reform and \nReauthorization Act of 2011.\n  Many of our Nation's Founders fled religious persecution, and they \nplaced great importance on religious freedom. George Washington summed \nup the prevailing view when he said, ``In this land of equal liberty, \nit is our boast, that a man's religious tenets will not forfeit the \nprotection of the laws.''\n  In 1791, the first amendment of the Constitution was ratified, \nenshrining freedom of religion as the ``First Freedom'' of all \nAmericans. The first amendment became an inspiration to people all over \nthe world who struggle to throw off the yoke of religious persecution.\n  Throughout our history, the United States has sought to protect and \npromote the fundamental human right of religious freedom at home and \naround the world. Just last week, on December 10, we celebrated Human \nRights Day, the 63rd anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. After World War II, under Eleanor Roosevelt's leadership, the \nUnited States spearheaded the ratification of the Universal \nDeclaration, which recognized freedom of religion as a fundamental \nright of all people.\n  As the founding chairman of the first-ever Senate subcommittee \nfocused on human rights, I am deeply committed to protecting religious \nfreedom, and I strongly support the mission of the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom. However, as I will outline below, I am \nconcerned that USCIRF has gone astray in recent years. Therefore, I \noffered an amendment to H.R. 2867, the USCIRF Reauthorization Act, \nincluding good-government reforms like term limits for Commissioners, a \nprohibition on employee discrimination, and a requirement that \nCommissioners follow Federal travel regulations. My amendment also \nincluded changes to H.R. 2867 that will make USCIRF stronger, extending \nits reauthorization from 2 to 3 years and increasing the number of \nCommissioners from five to nine. The Durbin amendment will allow the \nUSCIRF to more effectively pursue its mission.\n  On Monday, the Senate adopted my amendment and passed the USCIRF \nreauthorization bill on a unanimous vote. The bill is now awaiting \nconsideration in the House of Representatives. USCIRF's current \nauthorization is scheduled to expire tomorrow, December 16, so I urge \nmy colleagues in the House to quickly take up and pass H.R. 2867.\n  I would like to take a moment to outline the provisions of the \namendment that I offered to H.R. 2867.\n  Although the plain language of USCIRF's authorizing statute limits \nCommissioners to two, 2-year terms, for a total of 4 years of service, \nthis term limit has never been observed. In fact, several Commissioners \nhave served more than 10 years. The members of many governmental boards \nand commissions are term limited, and USCIRF would be well served by \nthe new ideas and fresh perspective that new Commissioners would bring.\n  The House-passed version of H.R. 2867 includes a provision that \nlimits Commissioners to serving two consecutive terms. However, the \nbill creates two new exceptions to the term limit provision in USCIRF's \nexisting authorization. First, the bill would allow a Commissioner to \nserve an unlimited number of nonconsecutive terms. Second, the bill \nwould allow each current Commissioner to complete his or her current \nterm and then serve one additional term, regardless of how long the \nCommissioner has served. As a result, Commissioners who have already \nserved more than 10 years would be permitted to serve an additional \nfull term and unlimited nonconsecutive terms.\n  These loopholes are a step backwards from existing law and undercut \nthe purpose of a term limit, which is to make sure that new voices from \na range of viewpoints and faiths are rotated into the Commission \nperiodically to collaborate in strengthening and shaping the \nCommission's mandate. In keeping with this spirit, my amendment \nincludes in H.R. 2867 a firm term limit of two, 2-year terms--4 years \ntotal--with no grandfathering of current Commissioners.\n  USCIRF has taken the position that its employees do not enjoy the \nsame antidiscrimination protections as all\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\nother Federal employees. It is simply unacceptable for a Federal agency \ncharged with promoting human rights to argue that it has the legal \nright to discriminate against its employees. The Durbin amendment \nincludes in H.R. 2867 a provision which allows pending civil rights \nclaims against USCIRF to proceed under the Congressional Accountability \nAct.\n  The House-passed version of H.R. 2867 provided antidiscrimination \nprotections to USCIRF employees for future incidents of discrimination \nthrough the Congressional Accountability Act. However, I was concerned \nthat this provision did not apply to former employees or past \ndiscrimination. As a result, there would have been no legal remedy for \nany incidents of discrimination that may have taken place prior to \nenactment of H.R. 2867.\n  Specifically, last year a former USCIRF employee filed a \ndiscrimination claim based on her allegation that her permanent \nemployment offer was rescinded after the Commissioners learned of her \nprior job with a Muslim civil rights organization. Though she \nsubsequently received a temporary contract with USCIRF, she claims she \nwas terminated when she filed her discrimination claim. The Commission \nargued that it is not subject to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. The case is now on appeal.\n  There must be some avenue for resolving--on the merits--past \nallegations that USCIRF discriminated against its employees. \nAccordingly, my amendment to H.R. 2867 provides that pending civil \nrights claims against USCIRF may proceed under the Congressional \nAccountability Act.\n  The House-passed version of H.R. 2867 reduced the number of \nCommissioners from nine to five, which would make it more difficult for \nUSCIRF to carry out its mission. Moreover, the bill accomplished this \nreduction in a disproportionate fashion by reducing the number of \nCommissioners appointed by the President from three to one. The Durbin \namendment strikes the provision from H.R. 2867 which reduces the number \nof Commissioners from nine to five.\n  Religious freedom advocates allege that some USCIRF Commissioners \nhave traveled first class and stayed in five-star hotels, in violation \nof Federal travel regulations. This is deeply troubling, particularly \nduring a time when all Federal agencies are being asked to do more with \nless. The Durbin amendment simply clarifies that USCIRF Commissioners \nare subject to Federal travel regulations, like other Federal \nemployees.\n  H.R. 2867 reauthorizes USCIRF until September 30, 2013. With the \ngood-government reforms in the Durbin amendment, it would be more \nappropriate to reauthorize USCIRF until September 30, 2014, so that \nUSCIRF Commissioners and staff have more certainty about the future of \nthe Commission.\n  I strongly support the mission of the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom, but I have been deeply troubled by \nallegations of misconduct, misuse of funds, and discrimination at the \nCommission. For example, according to the Washington Post:\n\n       Some past commissioners, staff and former staff of the U.S. \n     Commission on International Religious Freedom say the agency \n     charged with advising the president and Congress is rife, \n     behind-the-scenes, with ideology and tribalism, with \n     commissioners focusing on pet projects that are often based \n     on their own religious background. In particular, they say an \n     anti-Muslim bias runs through the commission's work. . . . \n     Rumors about infighting and ineffectiveness have swirled for \n     years around the commission.\n\n  My amendment will make good-government reforms to USCIRF that should \nhelp to address the concerns that have been raised about USCIRF. \nMoreover, my amendment will make USCIRF stronger by increasing the \nnumber of Commissioners in the reauthorization bill from five to nine \nand by extending the reauthorization from 2 to 3 years. As chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee's Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights \nSubcommittee and a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the \nDepartment of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, I will \nclosely monitor the work of the USCIRF in the coming months and years \nto ensure that it is functioning in a transparent fashion and \neffectively performing its mission of promoting and protecting \ninternational religious freedom.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to quickly take \nup and pass H.R. 2867 so that the U.S. Commission on International \nReligious Freedom can be reauthorized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8674-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8674-S8675]\n                TRIBUTE TO SPECIALIST JOHN O.

Berry, Jr. SPC Berry is a \nveteran of the Vietnam war who has received numerous awards and \ncommendations for his heroism and bravery in serving his country.\n  John O. Berry, Jr., of Wayne County, KY, grew up a typical kid--he \nspent his time hanging out with friends, listening to music, and \nenjoying time spent with his brothers and sisters. On September 18, \n1968, however, John answered a call to duty, and his life was forever \nchanged when he joined the U.S. Army.\n  John received his introduction to the Army and basic training at Fort \nKnox, KY, before being sent to Fort Leonard Wood, MO, to complete his \nadvanced training. Four short months later, John had achieved the honor \nof combat demolition specialist with Company A, 299th Engineer \nBattalion, and was sent to a fire base in North Vietnam.\n  John's job was especially dangerous. He was responsible for ensuring \nthe roads were free of the many deadly land mines that were \nstrategically placed by the Viet Cong. Although scores of Americans \nwere killed by these mines, John and other courageous demolition \nengineers were responsible for saving thousands of additional lives by \ndismantling the mines throughout the war.\n  Over the years John has received many distinguished awards and honors \nfor his bravery and service to our country. Included in these honors \nare two Purple Hearts, two Army Commendation Medals for heroism and \nexceptionally meritorious achievement in the Republic of Vietnam, two \nNational Defense medals, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross \nwith Palm, which was awarded by the Republic of Vietnam to those who \ndisplay valor and heroic conduct in combat.\n  These awards only represent a small portion of the gratitude we owe \nJohn for his selflessness and courage. According to the Department of \nthe Army's account of a rescue mission in which John's unit was sent to \naid an ambushed team, ``John distinguished himself by exceptionally \nvalorous action. . . . He demonstrated admirable courage and devotion \nto duty as he unflinchingly performed his task without regard to \npersonal safety. His actions were in keeping with the highest \ntraditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon \nhimself, his unit and the United States Army.''\n  Mr. President, I would ask that my Senate colleagues join me in \nthanking SPC John O. Berry, Jr. for his sacrifice and service. John's \nheroism is truly inspiring, and the people of our great Commonwealth \nare grateful for his selflessness and service. The Wayne County Outlook \nrecently published an article thanking Specialist Berry and \nhighlighting his accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n             [From the Wayne County Outlook, Nov. 9, 2011]\n\n            Berry Received Medals for Service to His Country\n\n                            (By Harlan Ogle)\n\n       Here's the way the Department of the Army tells the story: \n     He ``distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous action . \n     . . while serving as a member of a reactionary force sent to \n     aid the mine sweep team which had been ambushed. . . . When \n     he and other members of the reaction force dismounted their \n     vehicle they immediately came under heavy enemy fire. With \n     complete disregard for his own safety, [he] formed one line \n     with the other members of the force and moved towards the \n     front. He and the others laid down a base of fire which \n     enabled the trapped mine sweep to break contact. The reaction \n     force then advanced still further into the kill zone to \n     continue firing while Delta Company's casualties were carried \n     out. [He] demonstrated admirable courage and devotion to duty \n     as he unflinchingly performed his tasks without regard to his \n     personal safety. His cool-headedness in the face of \n     conditions which would unnerve a weaker man served to inspire \n     his comrades to follow suit. [His] actions were in keeping \n     with the highest traditions of the military service and \n     reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United \n     States Army.''\n\n[[Page S8675]]\n\n       Could these words be a description of the bravery \n     demonstrated by such heroes as Sergeant Alvin York, who is \n     probably the most recognized veteran of World War I? Maybe \n     these words describe Audie Murphy, the most decorated \n     American of World War II?\n       No!\n       These words describe the man who could be Wayne County's \n     most decorated soldier of the Vietnam War.\n       These are words that depict the extreme bravery of a \n     veteran who still lives in our midst. These words describe \n     one of our country's real heroes.\n       These are words contained in General Order 847 that \n     officially awarded the Army Commendation Medal for Heroism to \n     John O. Berry, Jr., who presently lives in the Gap of the \n     Ridge community of Wayne County. John is the son of Willie \n     Lee (Sloan) Berry and Johnny Berry.\n       He spent his childhood as most any other boy would--going \n     to school, hanging out with his friends, listening to music, \n     growing up with his brothers and sisters: Ted, Fred, George, \n     Stella, Mae, Maggie, and Alene, and just generally enjoying \n     life.\n       Until.\n       Until September 18, 1968. That's when John became a soldier \n     in Uncle Sam's Army.\n       He took his basic training at Fort Knox and advanced \n     training at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Just four short \n     months after entering the Army, he was sent to a fire base in \n     North Vietnam.\n       He had become a combat demolition specialist with Company \n     A, 299th Engineer Battalion.\n       His was a dangerous job because he had the responsibility \n     of clearing the roads of the deadly mines placed by the Viet \n     Cong.\n       Thousands of American service men were killed by these \n     mines. However, because of the sacrifice and courage of \n     soldiers like John O. Berry, Jr., thousands of lives were \n     saved as these demolition engineers dismantled the mines.\n       Specialist Four John O. Berry, Jr., served his country with \n     dedication and commitment. That service was continually \n     recognized as he received numerous awards and commendations. \n     Some of those distinguished awards include:\n       --Two Purple Hearts (a combat decoration awarded to members \n     of the Armed Forces who are wounded by an instrument of war \n     in the hands of the enemy).\n       --An Army Commendation Medal with first oak leaf cluster \n     ``for exceptionally meritorious achievement in support of the \n     United States's objectives in the counterinsurgency effort in \n     the Republic of Vietnam . . . . Through his outstanding \n     professional competence and devotion to duty he consistently \n     obtained superior results. Working long and arduous hours, he \n     set an example that inspired his associates to strive for \n     maximum achievement. The loyalty, initiative and will to \n     succeed that he demonstrated at all times materially \n     contributed to the successful accomplishment of the mission \n     of this command.''\n       --A second Army Commendation Medal with ``V'' device ``for \n     heroism in the Republic of Vietnam'' distinguishing himself \n     by meritorious achievement and service.\n       --Two National Defense medals.\n       --Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross w/Palm awarded by the \n     Vietnam Government to military personnel who have \n     accomplished deeds of valor and displayed heroic conduct \n     while fighting the enemy.\n       Eventually John was discharged from the Army, and when he \n     returned to Monticello, he continued serving his country by \n     joining the local National Guard.\n       Today, John lives in the Gap of the Ridge community and \n     walks among us as one of our nation's heroes. More \n     especially, John is one of Wayne County's heroes!\n       He shares that role with two of his brothers who also \n     served in the military during the Vietnam War: Ted in the \n     Navy and Fred in the Army.\n       A grateful community proudly recognizes John O.

Mr. President, I stand today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional Kentuckian, Helen Hieronymus of Somerset, KY. Helen, who \nrecently celebrated her 85th birthday, has lived a full and successful \nlife and still exhibits youthfulness far beyond her years.\n  On October 20, 2011, her birthday, Helen decided to celebrate in a \nrather unconventional way--she went skydiving. For those who know her, \nhowever, her great leap wasn't all that surprising. Over the years, \nHelen has been a vibrant member of the local community--she has served \nas director of the local United Way, Cub Scout den mother, and \npresident of the Junior Women's Club, all while always entertaining her \nadventurous appetite. Her travels have taken her fishing in Alaska, to \nthe Great Wall of China, and to 80 different countries around the \nworld.\n  Going skydiving has been an unfulfilled desire of Helen's for many \nyears. As a child, Helen dreamed of being able to fly. Then, about 9 \nyears ago, Helen was further inspired after witnessing a collection of \nparatroopers make their way to the ground while on a trip to Paris. ``I \nthought it would be fun,'' she says. And so it was.\n  After ascending to 12,000 feet, Helen successfully completed a tandem \njump followed by a safe landing. ``No problem at all,'' she explained. \n``When you come out of the plane, you do a free fall. You see the earth \nbelow you, and it's amazing down there. I would do it again.''\n  Mr. President, Ms. Helen Hieronymus is a courageous woman who has \nexperienced a lifetime of excitement and fulfillment. Helen's community \ninvolvement and adventurous spirit serve as an inspiration to \nKentuckians everywhere, and it is my hope that she have many more \nadventures to come. The Commonwealth Journal, a Somerset-area \npublication, recently published an article highlighting Helen's life of \njourneys and daring parachute jump. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfull article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Oct. 30, 2011]\n\n  Somerset Woman Celebrates 85th Birthday by Taking Plunge Out of an \n                                Airplane\n\n                           (By Chris Harris)\n\n       How does a woman who has traveled the world, ripped the \n     roadway on a Harley, and hunted big game celebrate her 85th \n     birthday?\n       By jumping out of an airplane, naturally.\n       Helen Hieronymus has lived a big life, no question about \n     it. Her name is familiar to many in Pulaski County, having \n     touched the community in many different ways--director of the \n     local United Way, Cub Scout den mother, president of the \n     Junior Women's Club, and so much more.\n       You could say she's lived a full life . . . yet she's \n     always looking for ways to make it even more full.\n       ``Of course,'' said Hieronymus. ``Why waste it?''\n       Hieronymus turned 85 on October 20. She had a yen to try \n     her hand at skydiving.\n       Why?\n       ``God only knows,'' quipped her daughter, Janie Hail, known \n     to many Somerset High School alumni as their former English \n     teacher, now retired. ``Mine was the voice in the background \n     saying, Mother, are you sure you want to do this?'''\n       In actuality, Hieronymus was inspired by a trip to Paris, \n     France, about nine years ago, where she witnessed a \n     collection of paratroopers descend to the earth from three \n     different heights, landing in a circle.\n       Hieronymus's reaction? ``I thought that would be fun.''\n       In fairness, Hieronymus had dreamed of being able to fly \n     since she was only a child. Of course, she was smart enough \n     not to try it herself without a little experimentation first.\n       ``I tried to teach my brother to fly by tying a sheet to \n     his ankles and wrists and having him jump off the porch \n     railing,'' she recalled. ``I was just testing it in that one \n     (case).''\n       By the time she reached her 85th birthday, she'd done \n     nearly everything else. Hieronymus reported having done a \n     ``bit of traveling.'' That's only if you consider visiting 80 \n     different countries to be ``a bit.'' She's fished in Alaska, \n     hunted wild beasts in the field, and walked on the Great Wall \n     of China. Even recently, friend Tommy Cate took her for a \n     ride on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.\n       Hieronymus kept her adventurous spirit her whole life, but \n     wasn't able to fully explore it until years down the road.\n       ``I had responsibilities to take care of, like three \n     children and a husband and things like that,'' she said. \n     ``Now they're big enough to take care of themselves.''\n       Flying like a bird in the air, however, continued to elude \n     her. Hieronymus had mentioned to her granddaughter that she \n     would like to do a parachute jump. As a result, all of her \n     grandchildren decided to chip in and buy ``Granny'' an \n     opportunity to ``jump out of a perfectly good airplane,'' as \n     Hail put it.\n       Hail wasn't a fan of the idea. She constantly tried to talk \n     her mother out of the idea, given the danger that falling to \n     earth from 12,000 feet in the air could present.\n       ``I'd think I had her talked out of it, but then it would \n     come up again,'' said Hail, who\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\n     characterized herself whimsically as the coolly pragmatic \n     complement to her mother's free-spirited daredeviling.\n       ``I suggested doing a zipline instead. She said that \n     sounded like fun, that she hadn't thought of that before,'' \n     added Hail, ``and she calls up the next day and says she's \n     going to jump the next day.''\n       Hail decided that if she couldn't beat 'em, as the saying \n     goes, that she would join 'em--on the ground as moral \n     support, at any rate. So earlier this month, she accompanied \n     her mother to the site of the Start Skydiving organization's \n     site in Middletown, Ohio, where the big jump would take \n     place.\n       What Hail saw when she got there didn't exactly bolster her \n     confidence. She and Hieronymus watched as a group of \n     skydivers went earlier in the day.\n       ``The wind caught the chute of the last one coming in and \n     rolled her over; it looked like a disaster waiting to \n     happen,'' said Hail. ``I point that out to my mother, and \n     said, `Did you see that?' and she responded, `Well, she got \n     up.' ''\n       ``I said, `Mom, she's 20!' ''\n       The winds picked up throughout the day; as the hours rolled \n     along, it looked more and more like Hieronymus wouldn't be \n     able to make the jump, but she refused to leave. After all, \n     if she wanted to use the coupon her grandchildren had given \n     her as a gift, it would have to be by Thanksgiving; that time \n     in mid-October might have been her last opportunity to do so.\n       So Hieronymus held on to be in the last group to go up into \n     the sky that day. The plane climbed to 12,000 feet before she \n     was able to make the tandem jump with her instructor (they \n     were connected to each other, but he was wearing the \n     parachute).\n       ``They put a jumpsuit on you and zip you up,'' Hieronymus \n     explained. ``Then they put the harness on you. Janie was \n     there coaching.''\n       Hieronymus took no apprehension with her into the airplane \n     and left no regrets floating in the air. She made a \n     successful jump and landed on the earthen floor no worse for \n     the wear.\n       ``No problems at all,'' she said. ``I would do it again.''\n       For Hieronymus, this was a ``bucket list'' item: Something \n     she wanted to make sure and experience before she passed \n     away, as referenced in the film called ``The Bucket List.'' \n     It certainly lived up to the expectations.\n       ``When you come out of the plane, you do a free fall,'' \n     said Hieronymus. ``You see the earth below you, and it's \n     amazing down there.''\n       Her thoughts upon landing? ``Oh shucks, I'm back on land.''\n       Hieronymus laughed as she noted that she had a video of the \n     event that she would show at her place of worship, First \n     United Methodist Church, to entertain her friends there.\n       And despite Hail's skeptical nature, her mother's exploits \n     have managed to serve as an inspiration.\n       ``Oh my gosh, I felt younger,'' said Hail. ``If an 85-year-\n     old can do that, surely I'm not that old.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8676-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8676]\n                        TRIBUTE TO EARL DEVANEY\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to give tribute to Mr. Earl \nDevaney, who will be retiring from 42 years of public service at the \nend of this year.\n  In an era when the American people have a record-level of distrust in \ngovernment, Mr. Devaney has risen above partisanship as a staunch \ndefender of taxpayers and champion of government transparency.\n  Devaney started his career as a cop on the beat in Massachusetts. \nThen, Devaney went to work for the U.S. Secret Service until 1991, \nwhere he was the Special Agent-in-Charge of the agency's fraud \ndivision. In 1999, President Clinton appointed Devaney the inspector \ngeneral of the Interior Department. There, he gained wide renown for \noverseeing the public corruption investigations that helped lead to the \nconvictions of Jack Abramoff, a Washington superlobbyist and major \nbeneficiary of the congressional earmark favor factory that polluted \nour politics for several decades. He also presided over the landmark \ninvestigation of the royalties program in the Minerals Management \nService, finding a ``culture of ethical failure'' among public \nofficials there, involving illegal gifts, illegal drug abuse, sexual \nmisbehavior and more.\n  In his role as the chief watchdog of the Department of Interior, I \ngot to know Earl and spent significant time visiting with him. What I \nhave learned to appreciate about him was his honesty, integrity and \nforthrightness.\n  In February 2009, President Obama named Devaney to head the Recovery \nBoard, which is charged with overseeing the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act, ARRA. In this position, he was integral to making \nsure that the spending in the stimulus was as transparent as possible.\n  At the end of the year, Mr. Devaney will be resigning from three \nposts: the Chair of the Recovery Board, inspector general for the \nDepartment of the Interior, and Chairman of the Government \nAccountability and Transparency Board, the position that Vice President \nBiden appointed him to for managing the administration's efforts to \nreduce government waste and to provide ``concrete methods'' for \nimproving oversight and transparency of Federal funds.\n  I can't think of a tougher defender of the interests of citizens and \ntaxpayers in the Federal Government than Mr. Devaney. As one of the \nbest inspectors general, his dogged pursuits of corruption and waste in \ngovernment will be missed.\n  In his resignation letter to President Obama, Mr. Devaney thanked the \nPresident for the ``opportunities you have given me to serve my \ncountry, and I will always look fondly on my decades as a public \nservant.''\n  Mr. Devaney, the American people will also look fondly on years of \npublic service. Thank you for all you have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8676-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8676-S8677]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    RECOGNIZING ORONO MIDDLE SCHOOL\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to offer my heartfelt \nand warm congratulations to Orono Middle School in my State of Maine on \nbeing named a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of \nEducation earlier this year on September 14, especially as the school \ncommunity gathers to celebrate this milestone next week.\n  Since the inception of the National Blue Ribbon School Program in \n1982, the U.S. Department of Education has undergone a rigorous, \nselective process of identifying those exceptional schools nationwide \nwhere students attain and maintain high academic goals. Needless to \nsay, the bestowal of this well-earned, prestigious award speaks volumes \nabout Orono Middle School's exemplary student accomplishments--and is \nan accolade in which all RSU 26 school board members, administrators, \nfaculty, staff, and students--not to mention our entire State--can \ncertainly take enormous pride.\n  This distinguished recognition also affords Orono Middle School with \nan ideal platform to share its outstanding teaching models and \napproaches under the vision of Principal Robert Lucy with other \nschools--an opportunity which aligns with the larger effort of the \nDepartment of Education to facilitate the robust exchange of the best \nschool leadership and teaching practices.\n  Just as the Bangor region, where Orono is located, is the gateway to \nthe natural wonders of the North Maine Woods and Acadia National Park, \nit is also a gateway to excellence in education. That is certainly the \ncase at the university level at the University of Maine, my alma mater, \nas well as at the primary school level at Orono Middle School, where \nchallenging and cultivating young minds is paramount; curiosity is \nprized; character is rewarded; enthusiasm is contagious; values are \nimparted; and an exuberant love of learning is palpable, even at times \naudible, and always ever-present.\n  Principal Lucy aptly characterized this spirit and energy when he \nwrote that ``a visitor walking the halls hears parents conversing with \nteachers and students, actors exchanging lines, artists collaborating \non projects, mathematicians solving team challenges, and coaches \nencouraging athletes. The sounds of our community make it clear that \nOrono Middle School thrives, largely because our students are connected \nto our school.'' And, thrive, it has, as Orono Middle School is \nexemplifying Maine's motto, ``Dirigo'' or ``I Lead'' and in doing so, \nensuring that the seeds of hope for the next generation are firmly \nplanted and taking root.\n  Orono Middle School is proof positive that our State's hallmark work \nethic and can-do spirit are alive and well. Orono Middle School is a \ntop-performing institution on State-required assessments, which \nteachers use to customize and improve instruction. Eighty percent of \nOrono Middle School's faculty have advanced degrees\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\nand its award-winning roster of teachers place a premium on \nprofessional development.

A bill to amend the copyright law to secure the rights of \nartists of works of visual art to provide for royalties, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equity for \nVisual Artists Act of 2011. This bill would enable visual artists to \nbenefit from their copyrights in a meaningful way similar to other \ncreators of literary and artistic works such as authors, playwrights \nand composers. It provides for the payment of a copyright royalty long \nrecognized in international law to be paid at the time a work of visual \nart is sold at auction in the United States. Half of this royalty \npayment will go directly to the artists or their estate and the other \nhalf will be made available to nonprofit American art museums as an \nendowment to be used by them to purchase the works of living American \nartists so that these works may be freely enjoyed by everyone.\n  Like all authors, the primary legal right of an artist in his or her \nwork is the copyright. Yet, visual artists stand alone within America's \ncreative community in their inability to gain any significant income \nunder existing copyright law. As an example, creators of music will \ncollect nearly $2 billion in copyright royalty payments this year. By \ncontrast, America's visual artists receive only a tiny amount of \ncopyright income, primarily when their works are reproduced in \npublications such as museum catalogues. Visual art often generates \nmoney only when the original work itself is first sold. The vast \nmajority of money-making sales are not by artists themselves but by \ncollectors, dealers and auction houses who trade in their works after \ntheir first sale. Under current law artists receive no income from \nthese sales.\n  For nearly 100 years international copyright law under the Berne \nConvention on Literary and Artistic Works, of which the United States \nis a party, has given artists a right to royalties each time their \nworks are resold. However, unlike other rights protected under the \nConvention, individual countries are not required to recognize the \nartists' resale right. While over 40 other countries, including all \nmembers of the European Union, provide their artists with income from \nresale of their works, the United States does not. Under the \nConvention's reciprocity rule, these countries will only pay royalties \nto artists from countries that also recognize the resale right. As a \nresult, American artists receive no money from these sales.\n  In 1990, Congress enacted the Visual Artists Rights Act that asked \nthe Copyright Office to study the issue of resale royalties and report \nback with recommendations. The Copyright Office reported back to \nCongress that creation of new artworks would be encouraged by adoption \nof the Berne Convention provisions on resale rights, but it recommended \nthat we wait to see whether the European Union would first require all \nof its member countries to join those like France and Germany who had \nlong provided their artists with such a right. In 2001, the European \nUnion decided to make resale royalties mandatory throughout its \nterritory, underpinning the Copyright Office's initial conclusions \nabout the positive effects of introducing resale rights. In 2006, the \nUnited Kingdom was the last EU country to implement its law.\n  In order to make the administration of a resale right as simple as \npossible, the bill would take 7 percent of any sale $10,000 or more \nfrom only the most public and easily accountable transactions, auction \nsales, and divide the amount by artists or their beneficiaries and non-\nprofit museums to purchase American art. The legislation would apply \nonly to sales by entities that have $25 million per year of cumulative \nsales of visual art. It also excludes entities that solely conduct \nbusiness in online auctions over the Internet. The bill gives primary \nresponsibility for collecting and distributing royalties to non-\ngovernmental collecting societies with oversight by the Copyright \nOffice and reporting requirements to Congress.\n  This legislation is a long overdue step in fulfilling our obligation \nunder the Berne Convention to award visual artists the benefits derived \nfrom the resale of their works, a right that literary and musical \nartists have enjoyed for decades. Under current law, visual artists are \ndenied royalties for lucrative sales of their art, and this bill is a \nmeaningful start for providing them with just compensation. It is only \nfair that, as stipulated by international law, visual artists profit \nfrom the appreciation in value of their work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2000\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the Wild Rogue Wilderness Area in the State \nof Oregon, to make additional wild and scenic river designations in the \nRogue River area, to provide additional protections for Rogue River \ntributaries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation \nto expand the Wild Rogue Wilderness Area and expand protections to \nOregon's iconic Rogue River and its tributaries. I am pleased that \nSenator Merkley is joining me in this effort, and that Congressman \nDeFazio has introduced similar legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The Wild Rogue Wilderness and the Rogue River that runs through it \nembody one of the Nation's premier recreation destinations, famous for \nthe free flowing waters which provide numerous rafting and fishing \nopportunities. The headwaters of the Rogue River start in one of \nOregon's other great gems Crater Lake National Park, and the river \nultimately empties into the Pacific Ocean, near Gold Beach on Oregon's \nsouthwest coast. Along that stretch, the Rogue River flows through one \nof the most spectacular canyons and diverse natural areas in the United \nStates. The Rogue River is a world class rafting river, offering \neverything from one day trips to week long trips through deep forested \ncanyons. On the land, the Rogue River trail is also one of Oregon's \nmost renowned backpacking routes.\n  The legislation I introduce today, the Rogue Wilderness Area \nExpansion Act of 2011, would add 60,000 acres of new wilderness to the \nexisting Wild Rogue Wilderness. The Wild Rogue Wilderness expansion \nwould protect habitat for bald eagles, osprey, spotted owls, bear, elk, \ncougar, wild coho, wild Chinook, wild steelhead and many others. It \nwould also ensure these treasured lands are protected for generations \nto come.\n  My legislation would also protect an additional 143 miles of \ntributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold clean water; 93 miles \nwould be designated Wild and Scenic Rivers and an additional 50 miles \nwould be protected from mining. The areas receiving protection include \nGalice Creek, Little Windy Creek, Jenny Creek, Long Gulch, and 36 other \ntributaries of the Rogue. The Rogue River is one of Oregon's most \niconic and beloved rivers. It is a river that teems with salmon leaping \nup rapids to spawn, and finds rafters down those very same rapids at \nother times of the year. The Rogue River is home to runs of coho, \nspring and fall Chinook, winter and summer steelhead, and it has the \nspecial distinction of being one of only a handful of rivers in the \ncountry with runs of green sturgeon. In 2008, American Rivers named the \nRogue and its tributaries as the second most endangered river in the \nU.S. I am hoping to change that today by introducing legislation to \nprotect this river and its tributaries.\n  I previously introduced legislation to protect the Rogue River \ntributaries in the last two Congresses. Since that time, I have worked \nwith the timber industry and conservationists to find a compromise that \nprotects one of America's treasures with additional wilderness \ndesignations and more targeted protections for the Rogue's tributaries. \nI am pleased that nearly 60 local businesses, and over 100 \norganizations and business in total, support protecting the Wild Rogue, \nand that support grows every day. Many of those businesses directly \nbenefit from the Wild Rogue and the Rogue River. As I often say, \nprotecting these gems is not just good for the environment, but also \ngood for the economy. These protected landscapes are powerhouses of the \nrecreation economy that draws visitors from around the world to this \nregion and the Rogue River is one of Oregon's most important sport and \ncommercial fisheries. The Wild Rogue is the second largest salmon \nfishery in Oregon behind the Columbia. The Wild Rogue provides the \nquality of life and recreational opportunities that create an economic \nengine that attracts businesses and brings in tourists from around the \nworld. The Rogue River supports 450 local jobs in nearby communities \nlike Grants Pass.\n  By protecting the Wild Rogue landscape and the tributaries that feed \nthe mighty Rogue River, Congress will ensure that future generations \ncan raft, fish, hike and enjoy the Wild Rogue as\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\nit is enjoyed today and that the recreational economy of this region \nremains strong.\n  I want to express my thanks to the conservation and business \ncommunities of southern Oregon, who have worked diligently to protect \nthese lands and waters and enable the outdoor recreationists to use and \nenjoy these rivers. I look forward to working with my House colleagues \nand the bill's supporters to advance our legislation to the President's \ndesk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nimprove the safety of Internet pharmacies; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help stop criminals from exploiting the Internet to illegally \nsell prescription drugs. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Sessions, Senator Schumer, and Senator Cornyn.\n  I first became concerned about the issue of illegitimate online \npharmacies in 2001, when one of my constituents, high school student \nRyan Haight, died from an overdose of the controlled substance Vicodin. \nHe had purchased the Vicodin from a rogue online pharmacy after simply \nfilling out an online questionnaire in which he described himself as a \n25-year-old male suffering from chronic back pain. The doctor \nprescribing the drug never met or personally examined Ryan.\n  Ryan's death was a terrible tragedy. He was a remarkable young man, \nan honors student and an athlete. He looked forward to going to \ncollege. Instead, his life was cut short.\n  In response, I introduced legislation, beginning in 2004, to better \nregulate\n\n[[Page S8685]]\n\nthe online sale of prescription drugs that are controlled substances.\n  In 2008, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act, \nRyan Haight Act, was enacted into law, and it became effective in April \n2009. Senator Sessions was the lead cosponsor on that legislation.\n  The Ryan Haight Act makes it a violation of the Controlled Substances \nAct to dispense a prescription for a controlled substance by means of \nthe Internet without a practitioner having conducted at least one in-\nperson medical evaluation of the purchaser. The act also requires \nonline pharmacies to register with the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nDEA, and comply with DEA regulations.\n  The Ryan Haight Act has helped to prevent illegitimate online sales \nof prescribed controlled substances. However, illegitimate online \nsellers continue to sell other types of prescription drugs, and \nstronger laws are needed to stop them.\n  The sale of prescription drugs online by web sites acting unlawfully \nis a dangerous and widespread problem. The National Association of \nBoards of Pharmacy and other non-profit organizations that monitor the \nInternet have consistently found that about 96 percent of all Internet \npharmacies don't require a prescription, aren't appropriately licensed, \nand sell unregulated drugs.\n  Theses illegitimate online pharmacies continue to cause serious harm. \nThe National Association of Boards of Pharmacy reports that from the \nstart of its Internet Drug Outlet Identification Program in April 2008, \nit has received 509 customer inquiries about online prescription drug \nsellers, and 21 of those customers have reported injuries. Some of \nthese injuries were very serious leading to hospitalization, with \ncustomers suffering worsening symptoms caused by the ailment the \nmedications were intended to treat, as well as severe side effects.\n  The easy accessibility of prescription drugs through illegitimate \nonline drug sellers also contributes to a growing prescription drug \nabuse problem. A study published in the May 2011 edition of the Journal \nof Health Affairs suggests that the growth in high-speed Internet \naccess has fueled prescription drug abuse. Conducted by investigators \nfrom Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Southern \nCalifornia, the study found that, over a 7-year period, States with the \ngreatest expansion in high-speed Internet access also had the largest \nincrease in admissions for treatment of prescription drug abuse.\n  We should be particularly concerned about this problem when it comes \nto young people, who are frequently online unsupervised and vulnerable \nto rogue drug sellers on the Internet.\n  Not surprisingly, there is also a significant amount of fraud \nassociated with illegitimate online drug sellers. Some of these \nwebsites simply take money without providing anything in return.\n  Web sites that dispense counterfeit drugs are an even more dangerous \nproblem. These counterfeit drugs are frequently manufactured in \nunsanitary conditions and may contain contaminated ingredients, or the \nwrong ingredients. A recent CBS News story found that counterfeit drugs \ncan contain paint, floor wax, and boric acid. So, instead of the \nappropriate medicine needed for their health problem, online consumers \nare receiving substances that may harm or even kill them.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will address these problems, \nand help stop illegitimate online drug sellers.\n  There are two main components to the legislation. First, it amends \nthe Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to add a definition of ``valid \nprescription,'' requiring at least one in-person medical evaluation of \nthe patient. This is the same approach taken in the Ryan Haight Act \nwith prescription drugs that are controlled substances. It will prevent \nillegitimate online pharmacies from selling drugs over the Internet \nwith sham prescriptions.\n  The second critical element is the establishment, by the Food and \nDrug Administration, of a registry of legitimate online pharmacy \nwebsites. This will protect consumers who will know that they are \ndealing with lawful online pharmacies and help law enforcement crack \ndown on the illegitimate websites.\n  The exploitation of the Internet by rogue online drug sellers \ncontinues to be a dangerous and deadly problem and we should not wait \nfor more lives to be lost or ruined before we act.\n  Consumers deserve access to safe and legitimate online pharmacies and \nprotection from illegitimate websites that sell counterfeit or \notherwise illegitimate medication, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2002\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Online Pharmacy Safety \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) consumers in the United States are targeted by \n     organized international crime networks that use Internet \n     websites to sell illegal and often dangerous drugs under the \n     guise of being legitimate online pharmacies;\n       (2) illegal online drug sellers offer products that do not \n     meet the safety standards established by United States laws, \n     and recent reports from the National Association of Boards of \n     Pharmacy show that 92 to 95 percent of Internet websites \n     offering to sell prescription medications online are \n     illegitimate and operate in clear violation of United States \n     laws enacted to protect patients;\n       (3) criminals are attracted to the high profit margin of \n     business through illegitimate online drug sales, as \n     counterfeit drug sales alone are estimated to have generated \n     $75,000,000,000 in 2010, an increase of 92 percent from 2005;\n       (4) the World Health Organization estimates that 50 percent \n     of the prescription medicines sold online by Internet \n     websites that hide their physical address are counterfeit;\n       (5) research by The Partnership at Drugfree.org found that \n     1 in 6 consumers in the United States, a total of about \n     36,000,000 Americans, has bought or currently buys \n     prescription medication online without a valid prescription;\n       (6) the prevalence of illegal online drug sellers, and \n     their sale of counterfeit or otherwise illegitimate \n     medicines, is a growing public health threat;\n       (7) people have been seriously injured or killed by \n     products sold by illegal online drug sellers;\n       (8) the accessibility of controlled substances and other \n     drugs without a valid prescription by illegal online drug \n     sellers contributes to a growing prescription drug abuse \n     problem in the United States that is endangering teenagers \n     and public health;\n       (9) the anonymous and unregulated nature of the Internet \n     contributes to the counterfeit drug trade and enables \n     counterfeit medicines to reach United States consumers \n     through illegitimate online drug sellers posing as legitimate \n     pharmacies;\n       (10) counterfeit drugs that are sold through illegal online \n     drug sellers are manufactured by criminals who deliberately \n     and fraudulently misrepresent the product in order to trick \n     consumers into thinking they are purchasing a legitimate and \n     safe medicine;\n       (11) these counterfeit drugs are frequently manufactured in \n     unsanitary conditions and may contain the wrong ingredients, \n     lack active ingredients, have insufficient or contaminated \n     active ingredients, or contain too many active ingredients;\n       (12) counterfeit drugs obtained from illegal online drug \n     sellers have been found to contain harmful ingredients \n     including arsenic, boric acid, brick dust, cement powder, \n     chalk dust, floor polish, leaded road paint, nickel, shoe \n     polish, and talcum powder;\n       (13) United States citizens deserve access to safe and \n     legitimate online pharmacies and protection from illegal \n     Internet websites that sell counterfeit or otherwise \n     illegitimate medication;\n       (14) while the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer \n     Protection Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-425) has helped to \n     prevent illegitimate online sales of prescribed controlled \n     substances, illegal online sellers continue to sell other \n     types of prescription drugs and stronger laws are needed to \n     stop them; and\n       (15) greater education and awareness regarding illegal \n     online drug sellers will help to protect the United States \n     drug supply chain from infiltration by unregulated and \n     counterfeit products.\n\n     SEC. 3. VALID PRESCRIPTIONS.\n\n       Section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 353(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), in the matter following subparagraph \n     (B), by striking ``shall be dispensed'' and all that follows \n     through ``the pharmacist.'' and inserting the following: \n     ``shall be dispensed only pursuant to a valid prescription \n     that is (i) a written prescription of a practitioner licensed \n     by law to administer such drug; (ii) an oral prescription of \n     such practitioner which is reduced promptly to writing by the \n     pharmacist; (iii) an electronic prescription issued by a \n     practitioner licensed by law to administer such\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\n     drug; or (iv) the refill of any such written, oral, or \n     electronic prescription if such refilling is authorized by \n     the prescriber either in the original prescription, \n     electronic prescription, or by oral order which is reduced \n     promptly to writing by the pharmacist.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) In this paragraph:\n       ``(A) The term `valid prescription' means a prescription \n     that is issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual \n     course of professional practice by--\n       ``(i) a licensed practitioner who has conducted at least 1 \n     in-person medical evaluation of the patient, subject to \n     paragraph (7);\n       ``(ii) a covering practitioner; or\n       ``(iii) a practitioner engaged in the practice of \n     telemedicine.\n       ``(B)(i) The term `in-person medical evaluation' means a \n     medical evaluation that is conducted with the patient in the \n     physical presence of the practitioner, without regard to \n     whether portions of the evaluation are conducted by other \n     health professionals.\n       ``(ii) Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to imply \n     that 1 in-person medical evaluation demonstrates that a \n     prescription has been issued for a legitimate medical purpose \n     within the usual course of professional practice.\n       ``(C) The term `covering practitioner' means, with respect \n     to a patient, a licensed practitioner who conducts a medical \n     evaluation (other than an in-person medical evaluation) at \n     the request of a licensed practitioner who--\n       ``(i) has conducted at least 1 in-person medical evaluation \n     of the patient or an evaluation of the patient through the \n     practice of telemedicine, within the previous 24 months; and\n       ``(ii) is temporarily unavailable to conduct the evaluation \n     of the patient.\n       ``(D) The term `practice of telemedicine' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 102 of the Controlled Substances \n     Act.\n       ``(7) For purposes of paragraph (6), an in-person medical \n     evaluation of the patient is not required if--\n       ``(A) the prescribing practitioner is issuing a \n     prescription or dispensing a legend drug in accordance with \n     the Expedited Partner Therapy in the Management of Sexually \n     Transmitted Diseases guidance document issued by the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention; or\n       ``(B) the prescription, administration, or dispensing is \n     through a public health clinic or other distribution \n     mechanism approved by the State health authority in order to \n     prevent, mitigate, or treat a pandemic illness, infectious \n     disease outbreak, or intentional or accidental release of a \n     biological, chemical, or radiological agent.\n       ``(8) The Secretary may by regulation establish exceptions \n     to the requirements described in paragraph (6) with respect \n     to a drug, based on criteria established by the Secretary.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to grant the Congressional Gold Medal to the troops \nwho defended Bataan during World War II; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, last week we marked the 70th \nanniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, an event that led to the \nU.S. into the Second World War. But that wasn't the only important 70th \nanniversary commemorated last week. Seventy years ago, on December 8, \n1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, halfway across the \nworld the long battle for control of the strategically important \ncountry of the Philippines began.\n  This is a battle that began in the air and on the sea, but would \nultimately see the surrendered American and Filipino troops forced on a \nbrutal death\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\nmarch, languishing in substandard POW camps, and in many cases, \nsuccumbing to malnourishment, mistreatment, and disease.\n  It is on behalf of all of these soldiers that I introduce legislation \nto honor the Defenders of Bataan, a peninsula on the island of Luzon \nwhere the battle ended, but the hellish journey began, with a \nCongressional Gold Medal. They are most deserving and this honor is, I \nbelieve, long overdue.\n  Soon after the air and naval battle for the Philippines began, the \nJapanese would land a sizable force to take control of Luzon. Ten days \nlater the Japanese began their main offensive into the island.\n  On Christmas Eve, 1941, General MacArthur put War Plan Orange 3 into \neffect. This plan called for some troops to delay the Japanese advance \nas the greater force withdrew into Bataan. According to historical \ndocuments, the purpose of the plan was to keep Manila Bay from Japanese \ncontrol until the U.S. Navy could reopen the supply lines that had been \ncut off after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  With the supply lines cut off, troops also had no hope of \nreinforcements. Despite this logistical nightmare, they valiantly \nfought to defend the Philippines. For months, against all odds, they \nheld back the enemy advance. The Japanese, hoping for a swift victory, \nwere forced to slow the pace of their Pacific strategy. The delay \nenabled U.S. and allied forces the chance to regroup in the Pacific and \nprepare for the eventual liberation of occupied Pacific islands and the \nPhilippines.\n  But by April of 1942, the defenders of Bataan were malnourished and \nexhausted. With no hope of overcoming the overwhelming conditions, they \nwere ordered to surrender. While many followed the order to lay down \ntheir arms, others still fought to disrupt the Japanese by forming \nguerrilla units to maintain the opposition.\n  One such guerrilla leader was Oklahoma native and Choctaw Warrior Lt. \nColonel Edward McClish, who, according to the U.S. Navy's historical \nwebsite, ``had an organization of more than 300 soldiers, with four \nmachine guns, 150 rifles, and six boxes of ammunition.''\n  Following capture, the defenders of Bataan suffered three years of \nintense hardship. Many would not survive. They would be forced to \nendure what became known as the horrendous 65-mile Bataan Death March. \nThey would languish in substandard POW camps, where their \nmalnourishment worsened and disease was rampant. Many others would be \nshipped to Japan on the dreaded hell ships. One such ship, the Arisan \nMaru, claimed nearly 1,800 American lives.\n  For us New Mexicans, the events of Bataan strike home particularly \nhard. Eighteen hundred men from New Mexico's 200th and 515th regiments \nleft their homes to fight. Approximately half returned. These soldiers, \nlargely of Hispanic origin, earned the honor of being the first to fire \nand defend the Philippines on December 8. A special group, they were \nsuccessors to the New Mexico National Guardsmen who made up part of \nTeddy Roosevelt's famed ``Rough Riders'' from the Spanish-American war.\n  One of these men, Eliseo Lopez, a Bataan defender who was born in \nSpringer, NM, endured all the horrors Bataan had to offer. A member of \nthe 200th Coast Artillery Regiment he trained at Ft. Bliss and was \ndeployed to Manila before war broke out. He fought the Japanese on \nBataan. He survived the Death March to Camp O'Donnell and was moved to \nCabanatuan prison camp. He was taken on a hell ship to Japan, and was \nforced to labor in a copper mine until he was rescued in September of \n1945. Mr. Lopez died this past November at the age of 92. His obituary \nalone is a record of the tremendous service to the United States given \nby the Bataan defenders.\n  In New Mexico, we continue to honor and respect our Bataan Defenders. \nWe remember their suffering. We take pride in their heroism. Every year \nwe commemorate their sacrifice with a march at White Sands Missile \nRange. Other States, such as Missouri, have similar marches. In April, \nMissouri will honor their Bataan veterans with a march on the Katy \nTrail State Park.\n  The people of the United States and Philippines are forever indebted \nto Eliseo Lopez and the other men who served with him and endured the \nsimilar horrors. They represented the best of America. They hailed from \ndiverse locales, but were united in their valor and in their devotion \nto their country. Their courage and tenacity during the first four \nmonths of World War II, and their perseverance during 3 years of \nimprisonment truly deserves the recognition of a Congressional Gold \nMedal. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8688-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8688-S8689]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 348--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n     SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY SHOULD TAKE ACTIONS TO INCREASE THE \n  TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS LENDING FUND \n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. SNOWE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship:\n\n                              S.

Res. 347\n\n       Whereas 40 years ago, with the passage of the National \n     Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-218; 85 Stat. 778), the \n     leaders of the United States came together to set the country \n     on a concerted course to conquer cancer through research;\n       Whereas the passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971 led \n     to the establishment of the National Cancer Program, which \n     significantly expanded the authorities and responsibilities \n     of the National Cancer Institute, a component of the National \n     Institutes of Health;\n       Whereas the term ``cancer'' refers to more than 200 \n     diseases that collectively represent the leading cause of \n     death for people in the United States under the age of 85, \n     and the second leading cause of death for people in the \n     United States overall;\n       Whereas cancer touches everyone, either through a direct, \n     personal diagnosis or indirectly through the diagnosis of a \n     family member or friend;\n       Whereas, in 2011, cancer remains one of the most pressing \n     public health concerns in the United States, with more than \n     1,500,000 people in the United States expected to be \n     diagnosed with cancer each year;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health estimated the \n     overall cost of cancer to be greater than $260,000,000,000 in \n     2010 alone;\n       Whereas approximately 1 out of every 3 women and 1 out of \n     every 2 men will develop cancer in their lifetimes, and more \n     than 570,000 people in the United States will die from cancer \n     this year, which is more than 1 person every minute and \n     nearly 1 out of every 4 deaths;\n       Whereas the commitment of the United States to cancer \n     research and biomedical science has enabled more than \n     12,000,000 people in the United States to survive cancer, 15 \n     percent of whom were diagnosed 20 or more years ago, and has \n     resulted in extraordinary progress being made against cancer, \n     including--\n       (1) an increase in the average 5-year survival rate for all \n     cancers combined to 68 percent for adults and 80 percent for \n     children and adolescents, up from 50 percent and 52 percent, \n     respectively, in 1971;\n       (2) average 5-year survival rates for breast and prostate \n     cancers exceeding 90 percent;\n       (3) a decline in mortality due to colorectal cancer and \n     prostate cancer; and\n       (4) from 1990 to 2007, a decline in the death rate from all \n     cancers combined of 22 percent for men and 14 percent for \n     women, resulting in nearly 900,000 fewer deaths during that \n     period;\n\n       Whereas the driving force behind this progress has been \n     support for the National Cancer Institute and its parent \n     agency, the National Institutes of Health, which funds the \n     work of more than 325,000 researchers and research personnel \n     at more than 3,000 universities, medical schools, medical \n     centers, teaching hospitals, small businesses, and research \n     institutions in every State;\n       Whereas the commitment of the United States to cancer \n     research has yielded substantial returns in both research \n     advances and lives saved, and it is estimated that every 1 \n     percent decline in cancer mortality saves the economy of the \n     United States $500,000,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas advancements in understanding the causes and \n     mechanisms of cancer and improvements in the detection, \n     diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer have led to \n     cures for many types of cancers and have converted other \n     types of cancers into manageable chronic conditions;\n       Whereas continued support for clinical trials to evaluate \n     the efficacy and therapeutic benefit of promising treatments \n     for cancer is essential for translating new knowledge and \n     discoveries into tangible benefits for patients, especially \n     because all standard cancer therapies began as clinical \n     trials;\n       Whereas, despite the significant progress that has been \n     made in treating many cancers, there remain those cancers for \n     which the mortality rate is extraordinarily high, including \n     pancreatic, liver, lung, multiple myeloma, ovarian, \n     esophageal, stomach, and brain cancers, which have a 5-year \n     survival rate of less than 50 percent;\n       Whereas research advances concerning uncommon cancers, \n     which pose unique treatment challenges, provide an \n     opportunity for understanding the general properties of human \n     cancers and curing uncommon cancers as well as more common \n     cancers;\n       Whereas crucial developments have been achieved in cancer \n     research that could provide breakthroughs necessary to \n     address the increasing incidence of, and reduce deaths caused \n     by, many forms of cancer;\n       Whereas research into the effect of certain forms of cancer \n     on different population groups offers a significant \n     opportunity to lessen the burden of the disease, because many \n     population groups across the country suffer \n     disproportionately from certain forms of cancer; and\n       Whereas a sustained commitment to the research of the \n     National Institutes of Health\n\n[[Page S8691]]\n\n     and the National Cancer Institute is necessary to improve the \n     entire spectrum of patient care, from cancer prevention, \n     early detection, and diagnosis, to treatment and long-term \n     survivorship, and to prevent research advances from being \n     stalled or delayed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 40th anniversary of the National Cancer \n     Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-218; 85 Stat. 778); and\n       (2) celebrates and reaffirms the commitment embodied in the \n     National Cancer Act of 1971, specifically, that support for \n     cancer research continues to be a national priority to \n     address the scope of this pressing public health concern.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/15/senate-section/article/S8691-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8691]\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 3094\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
