Mr. President, today the Senate begins another very busy \nwork period. I am confident this work period will be productive.\n  Tonight, the Senate will vote to begin debate on legislation to curb \nChina's unfair currency manipulation. I expect strong bipartisan \nsupport to move this legislation forward. There have been conversations \nbetween the bipartisan supporters of this legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives and the administration. My colleagues--both Democrats \nand Republicans--agree that China's deliberate actions to devalue its \ncurrency give its goods an unfair competitive advantage in the \nmarketplace. Their goods do not deserve that. That is not fair. It \nhurts our economy and it costs American jobs. In the last decade alone, \nwe have lost more than 1 million American jobs to China because of this \ntrade deficit fueled by currency manipulation. A massive trade deficit \nis one of the reasons for our unsustainable unemployment rate. This \nlegislation we are going to move to will even the playing field and \nhelp American goods compete in a global market and help keep American \njobs here at home.\n  Democrats believe there is no problem facing this Nation that \ndeserves our attention more than the jobs crisis. This bill is part of \nthe effort to get our economy back on track and put Americans back to \nwork. If China stops the practices that artificially tip the scales in \nits favor, it would create 1.6 million American jobs fairly quickly. I \nhope this legislation will motivate China to stop devaluing the yuan on \nits own. I also know it will send a strong message to the Chinese that \nAmericans will no longer ignore their blatant, unfair trade practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6013-8", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6013-S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A BUSY WORK SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we expect to quickly wrap up work on the \nChina currency legislation this week. We have a lot to get done this \nmonth, so the Senate must move fast.\n  One out of every nine Federal judgeships remains vacant, which puts \nat risk the right of every American to a fair and speedy hearing. While \nI have been frustrated at the slow pace in confirming judicial nominees \nthis Congress, I am pleased we have been able to reach an agreement to \nconfirm 10 judges this week and next. These nominations are \nnoncontroversial, and they\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\nhave the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee. Five of the six \njudges we will confirm today come from States with Republican Senators, \nand all five have the support of that Republican Senator.\n  This month, the Senate will also take up three appropriations bills. \nLast month, we passed a continuing resolution to fund the government \nthrough November 18. Now we must finish our work on the annual \nappropriations bills.\n  We will also take up three trade bills this work period. Last month, \nthe Senate passed trade adjustment assistance legislation which helps \nU.S. workers who lose their jobs because of international trade learn \nnew skills and reenter a changing workforce. A global economy means \nglobal competition, and a flexible, well-trained workforce is what will \nallow us to keep pace with our rivals. That is why Democrats insisted \non passing trade adjustment assistance before we would take up those \nthree trade bills we will soon consider--Panama, Korea, and Colombia.\n  Republicans have said these trade agreements are important to them. \nYet for months they have prevented them from moving forward by stalling \ntrade adjustment assistance. I hope the House will not delay any longer \non their taking up trade adjustment assistance. I am told they will \nnot.\n  The Senate will also take up President Obama's American Jobs Act this \nmonth. Members of both parties should rally behind the commonsense, \nbipartisan approach of this legislation. It will cut taxes for working \nfamilies and small businesses to spur job creation and put Americans to \nwork restoring this Nation's decaying roads, bridges, dams, and \nschools. I am happy to work with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to improve this bill, but I hope the obstructionism Republicans \nhave employed for the last 9 months will not continue.\n  This year, Democrats have introduced jobs bill after jobs bill. \nMeanwhile, our Republican colleagues have put their own political \nagenda ahead of the Nation's jobs agenda. They claim they are willing \nto work in a bipartisan fashion to get our economy back on track, and \nthis month they will get another chance to prove this. So I urge my \nRepublican friends to remember that actions speak much louder than \nwords. I hope they will take time out from rooting for our very \ndifficult economy to fail for the sake of politics and help Democrats \nput this Nation back to work.\n  Would the Chair announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6014-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I paid attention to the remarks made by \nthe majority leader concerning the upcoming schedule for the next week \nor 2 or 3 and the fact that we are now considering the motion to \nproceed to a bill pertaining to Chinese currency.\n  I understand very well that it is the prerogative of the majority \nleader to set the legislative agenda of the Senate, and I respect that \nprerogative. But I have to express some amazement that the issue of the \nChinese currency is taking precedence over the myriad of other \nimportant issues we should be acting on.\n  One of the articles in today's CQ Today says:\n\n       Last year, it looked like the time was right for Congress \n     to confront China.\n\n  ``[A] similar bill'' was passed by the House.\n\n       This year, the expected bulwark against the measure is the \n     GOP-controlled House, where top Republicans are echoing \n     concerns from the business community that enacting the \n     measure could spark a trade war.\n       Republican leaders uniformly voted against the China \n     measure last year, bucking the majority of their party, while \n     Democrats voted . . . for the bill.\n       Schumer--\n\n  Speaking of the Senator from New York--\n\n     argues that a strong Senate vote this time around would make \n     it ``hard for the House to block it.''\n       But an aide to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of \n     Virginia says there are no plans to vote on China currency \n     legislation.\n\n  So with over 9 percent unemployment, with the debt and deficit \ncontinuing to run out of control, with the 12 or 13 appropriations \nbills not acted on, with the Defense authorization bill, perhaps for \nthe first time in 41 years, not being taken up by the Senate, now, in \nits wisdom, under the leadership of the majority leader, we will be \ntaking up the China currency bill.\n  China currency is an important issue. I think it is worthy of debate \nand discussion in happier times. But if one has any curiosity about the \nlow esteem with which Congress is being held, then no better example of \nthat is the way we have addressed the issues, including not passing a \nbudget, which is against our own law, for the second consecutive year; \nincluding going through a continuing resolution rather than authorizing \nand appropriating the functions of government, as is the responsibility \nof the Congress of the United States.\n  Here we are, as I said, unemployment is 9.1 percent, with an \nestimated 14 million Americans out of work; 228,098 homes are in \nforeclosure nationwide, a jump of 7 percent from July to August of this \nyear. In my home State of Arizona, 1 in every 248 homes is in \nforeclosure, the third worst in the Nation. In the majority leader's \nhome State--No. 1 in the Nation--1 in every 118 homes is in \nforeclosure.\n  Mr. President, 22.5 percent of the homes in America are \n``underwater,'' meaning their mortgage is more than their home is \nworth. In Arizona, that number is 49 percent. In Nevada, 60 percent of \nthe homes are underwater.\n  We have a $1.3 trillion deficit. We have a debt of nearly $14.8 \ntrillion. It represents $43,357 for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica.\n  So we will take up before the Senate the China currency bill--the \nChina currency bill. Then someone in this body may wonder why the \napproval rating of Congress is--one I saw was 12 percent, one 13 \npercent. I think proceeding in this fashion we may be able, with some \nsuccess, to drive that down into single digits.\n  I hold townhall meetings, as most of my colleagues in Congress do as \nwell, and people are very angry at Congress. We, understandably, look \nat the President's approval ratings. I would urge my colleagues to look \nat those approval ratings of Congress. As I have often said, and have \nprobably worn out the line, we now have such high rates of disapproval \nthat we are down to blood relatives and paid staffers.\n  So here we are, with the fiscal year having begun on the first of \nOctober, for the first time in 41 years, apparently, we are not going \nto schedule or pass a Defense authorization bill. The Defense \nauthorization bill, in my view--and it is a biased view because of my \nmembership on that committee for so many years; but not totally \nbiased--authorizes pay and personnel. It budgets training and equipping \nthe Afghan security forces. It fully supports the budget request of \n$1.75 billion in coalition support. It fully supports the budget \nrequest to support the activities of the Office of Security Cooperation \nin Iraq. It increases the funding for cybersecurity initiatives. It \nprovides a provision that would require DOD to acquire and incorporate \ncapabilities for discovering previously unknown cyber attacks on its \nnetworks. It covers missile defense, strategic capabilities, nuclear \nsafety, and nuclear proliferation. It supports crucial defense \nmodernization programs.\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\n  My friends, there is no more compelling requirement than that of the \ndefense of this Nation. The Armed Services Committee, of which I am a \nproud member, and work in a bipartisan fashion with the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Levin from Michigan--puts in long hours, and we \nscrutinize and we study and we have hearings and we try to do the \npeople's work in the vital and important mission of defending this \nNation.\n  So now the fiscal year has expired. We are operating on a \n``continuing resolution,'' and what is the issue before the body, the \naugust body, the world's greatest deliberating body, according to some? \nThe China currency bill--the China currency bill--which we expect to \ntake up for the entire week, which according to any reliable report \nwill never see the light of day in the other body.\n  Now, there have been controversies surrounding the Defense \nauthorization bill not only this year but in previous years. I \nstrenuously objected last year to the repeal of the don't ask, don't \ntell being included in the Defense authorization bill until we had a \nchance to assess the effect on morale, readiness, recruitment, and \nbattle effectiveness, which was the view of the majority of the chiefs \nof the services.\n  The year before, we took up a hate crimes bill and put it on the \nDefense authorization bill. My objection was that it had nothing to do \nwith our Nation's defense. But there are many issues that need to be \naddressed, many issues concerning detainee treatment, concerning other \nissues, which are controversial.\n\n  But the job of the Senate is to debate and to amend and to pass \nlegislation. What is more important--what is more important--than the \nsecurity of this Nation and the care for the men and women who are \nserving in the military?\n  I note the presence of the majority leader on the Senate floor. I \nhave urged him privately on several occasions to bring up the Defense \nauthorization bill. He responded to me--and I am sure he may respond--\nthat there are issues concerning detainees, about trials in the United \nStates, about Guantanamo Bay. My response to the majority leader has \nbeen, those are issues the Senate should debate; those are issues the \nSenate should make its judgment on; and I assured him--and I assure him \nagain--that I will consider the objections and reservations that the \nPresident and the executive branch have to some provisions in the bill, \nparticularly concerning detainee treatment. I give great deference to \nthe view of the executive branch and the President of the United \nStates. But that does not mean we should not take up the bill. It does \nnot mean we should not take up the Defense authorization bill and the \nappropriations bills following.\n  First, we authorize. Then we are supposed to appropriate. The Senator \nfrom Nevada, the distinguished majority leader, and I came to the \nSenate together more years ago than we would like to remind some of our \ncolleagues. But 20-some years ago, when we came to this body, we \nregularly took up authorization and appropriations bills. We took them \nup one by one, we had debate, and we had amendments.\n  By the way, the practice of filling up the tree, which both sides of \nthe aisle in this body are guilty of, was not heard of in those days.\n  I know the majority leader's time is valuable. I would just remind my \nfriends that the legislative calendar, which is here, is waiting \nconsideration.\n  Here are just a few of the authorizing bills waiting consideration. \nThe Senate Armed Services Committee has approved the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2012. The Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs has approved the Department of \nHomeland Security Authorization Act. The Senate Finance Committee has \napproved the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Reauthorization Act. The \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee has approved the Surface \nTransportation Extension Act.\n  Today is October 3--the third day of fiscal year 2012--and guess how \nmany of the 12 annual appropriations bills have passed this body? The \nanswer is one. It is not as if the bills are not ready for floor \nconsideration. They have been cleared and placed on the legislative \ncalendar. So why not bring them to the floor for debate and \namendments--the Agriculture appropriations bill, the Commerce, State, \nand Justice appropriations bill. All of these, by the way, should have \nbeen preceded by authorizing legislation.\n  What has happened around here, unfortunately, for the majority of the \nMembers of the Senate is that by virtue of the fact that we do not take \nup authorization bills for the functions of various branches of \ngovernment, it renders the appropriations process transcendent in the \ndeliberations and conclusions this body has made, thereby making \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee have an unwarranted, in my \nview, but certainly far more impactful role in the Senate than the \nmembers of the authorizing committees.\n  I intend to continue to work in this body and with some of the newer \nMembers to change that process, to require appropriations bills to \nreflect the authorizing committees' legislation, that the \nAppropriations Committee not be permitted to authorize, which is not \ntheir role, which over the years has become more and more prevalent and \nroutine.\n  My office resides in the Russell Senate Office Building, which is \nnamed after a distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee--a \ncommittee of which I am the ranking member. He was a distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, a distinguished Member of \nthis body. I am sure if he were on this floor today, that former \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee would be making \nthe same remarks I am today.\n  The responsibilities--not the privileges but the responsibilities--of \nthose of us on the authorizing committees, including the Armed Services \nCommittee this year, have been abrogated and overcome by a process \nwhich is clearly gridlocked.\n  I recognize the presence of the majority leader on the floor. I yield \nto the majority leader and then will return to my remarks following \nhis.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the speech given by my friend, the senior \nSenator from Arizona, is a speech I could give, because he is \nabsolutely right. We have so much we have to do. But we have had a \nproblem because of the Republicans in the Senate. We have spent \nbasically 100 percent of our time these last 9 months on 2 issues that \nshould have taken a matter of a few hours but have taken months and \nmonths, the continuing resolutions.\n  We voted on the continuing resolution--for 1 week, 2 weeks, on and on \nfor months, trying to fund government--2 or 3 days ago, the 1st of \nOctober. It took months to get that done. Then as soon as we finished \nthat, that little exercise is only preparation for the longstanding \ntime that we had to spend on raising the debt ceiling, something we had \ndone with ease scores of other times. During the 8 years of President \nReagan, for example, we raised the debt ceiling for him 18 times. But \nwe spent months--months--on this continuing resolution and on this debt \nceiling, and it prevented us from doing our work. So the words my \nfriend from Arizona has given about all of the work that needs to be \ndone do not include all of the work we have to do.\n  I do not think there could be a more important piece of legislation \nright now, with the jobs being the way they are, than China currency. \nEveryone knows how they have manipulated their currency, which has been \nvery difficult for our country. We have lost in the last 10 years, \nbecause of that, 2 million jobs; jobs that should be our jobs if the \ncurrency were fair. But it is not. It is manipulated.\n  This is a jobs bill we are on today. It is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that has been supported by large numbers of Democrats and \nRepublicans. We have put this off for a long time. Now is the time to \ndo this. We must send a message to the Chinese that we are serious.\n  We have for 50 years every year passed a Defense authorization bill. \nWe need to do it this year. It is extremely important for a number of \nreasons. One is these programs are important. We need to take care of \nour soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen. It sets funding levels for \nweapons and ammunition programs and authorizes activities of the Armed \nForces around the world. It\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\ncontains authorizations--new authorizations--for programs that are \nextremely important to this country, including counternarcotics efforts \nthat are critical to our efforts around the world.\n  This Defense authorization bill is also a bill that has some of the \nbest oversight of any of the work that we do. The Armed Services \nCommittee does good work in looking at the oversight of the military. \nThis is a civilian oversight responsibility we have and we need to \ncomplete that.\n  I agree with my friend from Arizona, it is vital that we get to this \nbill and pass it. But I also say that in its present form, I am going \nto have some difficulty bringing this bill to the floor. It contains \nprovisions relating to the detention of terrorism suspects, which in \nthe words of National Security Advisor John Brennan:\n\n     would be disastrous. It would tie the hands of \n     counterterrorism professionals by eliminating tools and \n     authorities that have been absolutely essential to their \n     success.\n\n  To show you how extremely important it is that we do something about \nthese provisions in this bill that are just wrong, both the Judiciary \nCommittee in the Senate and the Intelligence Committee in the Senate \nhave asked for hearings on this provision in this bill.\n  Going back to my original subject on China trade, the House of \nRepresentatives is going to pass China trade. Everybody knows that now. \nA couple of months ago that may not have been the case, but they will \npass that as soon as we do.\n  I would hope my friend from Arizona, who we all have such admiration \nand respect for--we know how much he cares about our country and \nparticularly about the Armed Forces of our country. I wish he would \nconsider doing what we did last year. We had another problem with the \nDefense authorization bill, not from our perspective, as it is today, \nbut it was from his perspective, because he felt very strongly that \ndon't ask, don't tell should not be in the Defense authorization bill. \nI disagreed with him vehemently. But we agreed to take that out of the \nbill and have a separate vote on don't ask, don't tell. It worked out \nfine. I moved that during the lameduck session. People criticized me \nfor bringing it up. But it is something I felt I had to do because that \nwas an agreement I had with people who cared a great deal about that. I \nreceived lots of criticism because I took it out of the Defense bill or \nhad it taken out of the Defense authorization bill.\n  I would say to my friend, the Senator from Arizona--and he is my \nfriend--that we take this provision out of this bill and bring it up, \nhave an up-or-down vote on however you want to handle that. Let the \nJudiciary Committee and Intelligence Committee do their work on this \nprovision. It is not a good provision.\n  Since it was put in that bill, we have had some significant changes \naround the world, and it would be such a detriment to what we need to \ndo to get these bad guys, to keep this provision in the bill. So I \nwould hope my friend would treat this provision as I treated don't ask, \ndon't tell. He complained about that. I did not think he was right, but \nI thought it was so important that we move to this Defense \nauthorization bill that it was taken out.\n  We need to do that with this. It would be better for our country, it \nwould be better for the Senate, and it would be better for the \nbipartisanship work we have to do around here. I do not in any way \ncriticize my friend for bringing this up. I have talked to him \nprivately. I have talked to Senator Levin, the chairman of that \ncommittee, on a number of occasions. I have expressed in the recent \nweeks that we have a problem with this provision. And, in fact, I did \nnot know the Senator from Arizona was going to be here today. I have a \nletter in my office I have been looking over. I was going to have it \nhand-delivered to Senator McCain and Senator Levin today, and I will \ncontinue doing that. The whole subject of my letter was to explain to \nthem the problem with this.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader for his comments. First of \nall, on the issue of China currency, I believe it is correct that the \nadministration itself objects to this legislation, much less the other \nbody taking it up. I say with great respect to the majority leader and \nhis knowledge of the economy and the jobs that have been lost to China, \nChina currency may be part of the problem, but it is certainly not the \nreason for the 2 million jobs lost. Certainly the majority of the \nreason for that is for other reasons which have been well ventilated.\n  I say to the majority leader, I would be glad and will continue to \nsit down with the administration and with the majority leader and with \nSenator Levin on this issue of detainee treatment. The fact is that the \nPresident of the United States began his tenure as President of the \nUnited States with the commitment to close Guantanamo Bay. I want to \nclose Guantanamo Bay. I have made that very clear. But Guantanamo Bay \ncannot, for all practical purposes, be closed at this time. That brings \nin other issues such as treatment of people who are apprehended and \nattempting to inflict damage and mayhem on the people of the United \nStates.\n  I think it is something we can work out. I would hope we would be \nable to debate and amend, which is the usual way we address issues in \nthis body, rather than refusing to bring legislation to the floor \nbecause there is a particular objection to it.\n  Last year, as the majority leader pointed out, I was opposed to the \nrepeal of don't ask, don't tell on the grounds that the same view I had \nwas that of the service chiefs, that we needed to assess the impact of \nrepeal on retention readiness and battle effectiveness. But that should \nnot, in my view, be the reason for us not to take up the legislation \nthis year.\n  I am sure the majority leader is aware, this would be the first time \nin 41 years we are in two wars. We have to address the issues that only \nthe authorizing committee is capable and chartered to do. So I hope the \nmajority leader would observe that we could take up this legislation, \ndebate it, amend it. The President always has veto authority if he \nwishes to veto it. We also have the other body on the other side of the \nCapitol that would play a role in this. We would go through the normal \nprocess of passing the Defense authorization bill, which has been a \ntradition for some 41 years here in the Senate.\n  I do appreciate the majority leader taking the time from his busy \nschedule to come to the floor and express his reasoning behind the \nschedule that he has set for the Senate, which is well within his \nauthority.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I was saying, we have only 1 of the 12 \nauthorization bills that has been considered by the Senate to date, \nwhich was the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs appropriations \nbill. The Senate passed that bill on July 20. Congress did not enact a \nsingle one of the annual appropriations bills through regular order \nlast year or a budget last year or this year. What kind of message do \nwe send the American people when they are suffering under unprecedented \nand unacceptable economically difficult times? We are sending the \nmessage that either we are unable or unwilling to address the issues \nthat are affecting their very lives.\n  When I go home and find people without jobs and with half of the \nhomes underwater, when I find people out of work, when I pass by the \nshuttered and closed strip malls throughout my State of Arizona, and \nthen hold a townhall meeting, obviously my constituents are angry and \nfrustrated. I do not know of a single townhall meeting that I have had, \nnot a single one, where someone stood up and said: Pass the China \ncurrency bill and then our lives will be improved.\n  I am sure that with some the China currency bill is one of some \nimportance and priority.\n  Certainly, I don't think it is in the top 10 priorities of the people \nI represent in the State of Arizona, but our Nation's security is \nimportant to my constituents. We have a sizable military presence in \nArizona. The national\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\ndefense authorization bill that has passed through the Armed Services \nCommittee is very important to the people of this country and our \nsecurity in these very uncertain times.\n  I hope the majority leader will agree to change his priorities and \nbring the bill to the floor. I will continue to work to resolve \nconcerns he or the administration has expressed concerning the \nlegislation itself. But because the executive branch has concerns about \nlegislation and objections to legislation, that should not prevent it \nfrom coming to the floor of the Senate. That should not be a reason why \nthe Senate should not exercise its responsibilities to debate, to \namend, and to authorize all these much needed priorities for the men \nand women who are serving our country with courage and efficiency. It \nis our job to provide them with whatever they need to do their job in \nthe most efficient fashion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6017-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6017-S6018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE OVERSIGHT REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Currency Exchange \nRate Oversight Reform Act, S. 1619, on which I believe we will be \nvoting. I support it, as I expect my colleague from Arizona does with \nhis principal commitment to trade and vibrant competitive commerce in \nthe world.\n  I acknowledge that our commitment to commerce and trade is \nfundamental to our Nation. America has always been a country with open \nports and open markets. When trade is conducted properly, I am \nconvinced it creates a rising tide of prosperity in America and around \nthe world. I am not against trade. More than that, I think the \nvoluntary exchange of goods does promote the free exchange of ideas. \nTrade helped us to export our values of a free democratic society, but, \nlike democracy itself, trade must operate under a set of rules and \nvalues.\n  Jobs have been lost as a result of unfair trade practices. Perhaps \nthe most dramatic unfair trade practice existing in the world today is \nChina's very substantial manipulation of its currency--a 30-percent, \n40-percent, 25-percent alteration in the value of its currency--and it \nhas created an extraordinary deficit that has cost jobs in this \ncountry. Whether it is 2 million or fewer, it has cost jobs of decent, \nhard-working Americans. It has occurred because of manipulation of the \ncurrency. It is a very real matter.\n  We need to fight for and aggressively defend every single job this \ncountry has, and we need to say no to unfair trade practices. We are \ngoing to insist that the trade rules apply both ways, that we don't \nunilaterally accept virtually anything while some of our trading \npartners--particularly China--can systematically violate them. I think \nfairness is the right thing, and we must refuse to acquiesce and accept \nthis existing trade practice.\n  Look, nations whose economies have historically struggled are those \nthat have failed to uphold the rule of law. In my view, that is a \nfundamental part of America's greatness--our commitment to law--and it \nhas made us economically powerful, as well as free.\n  Many nations that have been unable to ensure contracts are honored \nand protect the integrity of financial agreements can't be successful \nin a commercially competitive world. When companies form a business \npartnership, they sign a contract to ensure that each party meets its \nobligations. The principle is the same with free trade. A trading \npartnership with China or other countries must be founded on principles \nupon which both parties can agree, principles and agreements which are \nto the mutual benefit of both parties. It is the job of our leaders to \nnegotiate these agreements on behalf of the American workers, not to \nstand against them.\n  This is even more crucial with a nation such as China, which \nrelentlessly, through its political apparatus, seeks to advance its own \nnational interests. China's currency manipulation clearly puts American \nworkers and U.S.-based businesses at a huge disadvantage, particularly \nin this time of economic hardship. This unfairness has to be \nconfronted. We have talked about it but have not confronted it.\n  Almost all economists agree that China intentionally undervalues its \ncurrency--RMB--by as much as 30 percent.\n  The Employment Policy Institute argues this:\n\n       This intervention makes the RMB artificially cheap relative \n     to the dollar, effectively subsidizing Chinese exports.\n\n  Where? Mostly to the United States. So I believe the devaluation of \nthe currency clearly subsidizes exports of Chinese goods to the United \nStates.\n  They go on to say this:\n\n       Currency intervention also artificially raises the cost of \n     U.S. exports to China. . . .\n\n  So our goods that go there are higher in China than they would be, \nmaking the Chinese less able to buy them than otherwise would be the \ncase. The goods they ship to the United States come in cheaper than \nthey otherwise would be, making them more attractive to American \nconsumers. This is a big factor in the surging and huge trade deficit \nbetween our countries. I think it is indisputable that is so. In other \nwords, the Chinese give their products a 30-percent discount in the \nUnited States and make our exports cost 30 percent more in China. I \nthink few economists would argue with that.\n  China's currency manipulation has been a major factor in the erosion \nof our Nation's manufacturing base and left millions of U.S. workers \nwithout jobs. It is a factor in job loss in America. In Alabama, the \nEPI estimates--and I don't know whether this is an accurate number. I \nam sure we have lost jobs as a result of this currency manipulation, \nbut this is the estimate the EPI had: It has put more than 44,000 \npeople out of work in Alabama since 2001--44,000. We just celebrated a \nnumber of economic developments in my State. We have been having some \nsuccess over the years. We have 3 automobile plants, with investment \nfrom abroad, and each one has added about 4,000 jobs. According to this \nstudy, we have lost 44,000 jobs to China as a result of this currency. \nAgain, there are disputes about how much and how large the impact is. I \ndon't think there is any doubt it is substantial. We have been feeling \nit for years.\n  Another recent study reached a similar conclusion. It was written up \nin the Wall Street Journal. It found that regions exposed to trade \nwithin the United States from China lose more manufacturing jobs and \nsee an overall decline in unemployment than other areas. They also \nfound that exposure to Chinese imports led to larger increases--and \nthis is common sense--in unemployment; it cost jobs in certain areas in \nthe United States; it led to larger increases in unemployment \ninsurance, government payments, food stamps, disability payments, and \nother government benefits.\n  Based on data in the study, the $300 billion increase in Chinese \nimports since 1992 has cost the Federal Government more than $20 \nbillion in such expenditures. They calculated $20 billion simply based \non the increases in food stamps, unemployment insurance, and the like. \nThe irony behind this is that we borrow much of the money we use to pay \nthese Federal benefits from the Chinese, which they then use to \ncontinue manipulating their currency. So we are being outmaneuvered and \noutnegotiated in the process.\n\n  Last year, Dan DiMicco, chairman, president, and CEO of Nucor \nCorporation, which has five steel mills in Alabama, my State--smaller \nsteel mills--testified about modern steel mills. Mr. DiMicco is a \nnational leader in American competitiveness and ideas. He testified \nbefore the House Ways and Means Committee, and this is what he said:\n\n       Passing this legislation will help because this is a jobs \n     bill, pure and simple. It will do more to stimulate the \n     economy and create jobs than just about anything else \n     Congress can do. And it will not add to our national debt--\n     just the opposite. Ending China's currency manipulation will \n     reinvigorate our manufacturing sector and our economy, \n     reducing our budget deficit. By failing to take the lead and \n     combat China's mercantilist trade practices, we are serving \n     up our jobs, future economic well-being, and national \n     security on a platter.\n\n  That is a serious charge. This is a man who is dealing in the real \nworld of\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\nsteel production around the United States, with plants all over the \nUnited States. I think he knows a lot about what goes on in the world \nand how this system works.\n  I believe the bill on which I have joined my colleagues is a \nthoughtful, commonsense approach. It doesn't place an immediate tariff \non all Chinese goods that enter the United States. It does, however, \nexplicitly direct the Commerce Department and International Trade \nCommission to take currency manipulation into account when estimating \ncountervailing and dumping duties. Under current law, the Commerce \nDepartment can take currency manipulation into account when calculating \ncountervailing duties, but it does not take currency manipulation into \naccount. It could, but it does not. The Obama administration has not \ninstructed them to do so, and neither did his predecessor. Moreover, \nneither agency currently has the authority to include currency \nmanipulation in its calculation of antidumping duties.\n  The practical effect of this legislation would be to charge a duty on \nsome imported products only after the International Trade Commission \nand Commerce Department conduct an investigation that determines \ndumping is taking place or a subsidy is being provided and that a U.S. \ncompany has been injured. So a duty would only be applied if it can be \nproved that the exporting country violated WTO rules. In other words, \nthis measure upholds the rule of law.\n  This has nothing to do with protectionism; rather, it is about \nprotecting the principles that make free trade work. You can't have a \nfree-trade relationship if your trading partners aren't complying with \nthe fundamental expectations of fair trading partners.\n  We don't live in a perfect world. Other nations, such as China, are \nmore than willing to exploit our good will to gain political, \nstrategic, and economic advantage. The time has come to defend our core \neconomic interests. American workers are the best in the world. They \nare not asking us for a handout or a subsidy. What they are asking for \nare leaders who will defend their legitimate interests on the world \nstage. So far, this has not been done.\n\n  I salute Senators Schumer, Brown, Graham, Burr, Snowe, Stabenow, and \nothers who have supported the legislation. I think it is time for us to \nact, and I ask my colleagues to support the legislation as we move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6018-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6018-S6019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DEBIT CARD FEES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to take those who are following \nthis debate on a little trip through the world of plastic. I am talking \nabout the world of credit cards--in this case, specifically about debit \ncards--because something happened over the weekend which has changed \nthat world dramatically, and it is important for consumers, retailers, \nand voters across America to understand what happened.\n  On October 1--on Saturday--the rules on how much a credit card \ncompany and a bank that issues a debit card can collect every time we \nuse the debit card changed. They call it the swipe fee. It makes sense: \nWe hand them the credit card or we do it ourselves, swipe it through \nthe machine, and we pay for a transaction. Back in the old days, which \nI can recall, some people would write out a check. This is the new form \nof a check. It is a debit card. When we swipe it through the machine \nand the machine accepts it, the money comes right out of our checking \naccount to the retailer where we did the business. It is very \nconvenient. People are using it more and more. In fact, over half the \ntransactions at most retailers now are done with either credit or debit \ncards. What the consumer doesn't know is there is a charge each time \nthat card is swiped. It is called the swipe fee or the interchange fee. \nWhat is it? It is established by the two, basically, duopoly credit \ncard companies--Visa and MasterCard. They run the whole show. They have \nbeen under antitrust investigation in the past, and I am sure they will \nbe in the future. They set the rules, and here are what the rules are.\n  If someone runs a restaurant or, let's say, a grocery store in Near \nNorth Side Chicago, such as Art Potash's, who is a close friend of \nmine--a family-owned grocery store--they say: I have to take plastic to \ndo business, then Visa and MasterCard say they have to pay each time a \ncustomer swipes that card. How much do they pay? It is a secret. \nBasically, consumers don't know, but individual retailers do, and the \nindividual retailers have little or no bargaining power with Visa, \nMasterCard, and the big banks, as one can imagine.\n  So we passed a law over 1 year ago--an amendment that I offered to \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act--which said to the Federal \nReserve Board: Investigate this. Find out how much it actually costs \nthe bank and credit card companies to process a transaction with a \ndebit card. They came back, after a long study, and they said: If it \nuses a PIN number, which some do, it is about 4 cents. If we sign it, \nit is about 7 to 12 cents. Then they said: Incidentally, the average \ncharge by the credit card company and bank for each swipe fee is 44 \ncents--dramatically larger than the cost of the transaction to the bank \nor the credit card company.\n  Remember, in the old days, when we processed checks? It cost pennies \nto process a check no matter what the face amount was. But now, \nretailers face the 44-cent average swipe fee every time somebody uses a \ndebit card. So we can understand some retailers don't like this much. \nThere is no competition. These banks and credit card companies tell \nthem this is it, take it or leave it; if they don't like it, don't use \nplastic. It is secret. Nobody knows it except the retailer, the bank, \nand the credit card company. It is a hidden fee, and it is a killer for \na lot of small businesses.\n  I was in Rock Island, IL, and Carl, who is the manager of the Rock \nIsland Country Market, said: We have a special deal here, Senator. \nPeople can come in from the neighborhood in Rock Island, IL, in the \nmorning, and I give them a cup of coffee and a doughnut for 99 cents. \nIt is a pretty good deal in this day and age. It sure is, isn't it, \ncompared to what we pay. He said: I want to get them in the store. But, \nhe said, you know what. They turn around and use plastic at the cash \nregister. I wasn't even breaking even at 99 cents, and now I am paying \n44 cents to some bank and credit card company because people have used \nplastic.\n  That world changed October 1--last Saturday. The new law went into \neffect where the Federal Reserve established the ceiling--the maximum--\nthat can be charged for a debit card swipe fee that is issued by the \nlargest banks in America. The maximum now comes down to about 24 cents. \nIs this a big deal? It certainly is, because each year in the economy, \nswipe fees accounted for about $10 billion or $12 billion--$10 billion \nor $12 billion--in additional charges to consumers and loss of \nprofitability by businesses. One can imagine, $10 billion or $12 \nbillion, even after it has been discounted by the Federal Reserve to \nabout half that amount--$5 billion or $6 billion--has the banks in an \nuproar.\n  I guess it is a great honor that the Wall Street Journal on Friday \nhad one of their people they invited in to comment who said this new \nbank fee that is being charged by Bank of America on debit cards is the \nDurbin fee--the Durbin fee. The same thing was said by the Chicago \nTribune on Saturday.\n  Let me say at the outset I am honored to be associated with an effort \nto reduce costs to retailers and consumers across America. What we are \ndoing is fair--trying to strike some balance in an industry that has \nshown little or no balance. One of the worst offenders in this is Bank \nof America--the largest bank in the United States.\n  Did you see what they did last week? They announced that anybody who \nhad a debit card at Bank of America was now going to be subject to a $5 \nmonthly fee because of this reform. What I have said in the media, and \nI will say here, is: Bank of America customers, vote with your feet. \nGet the heck out of that bank. Find yourself a bank or credit union \nthat will not gouge you $5 a month and still will give you a debit card \nyou can use every single day.\n  What Bank of America has done is an outrage. Last week, when they \nannounced they were charging their own customers a $5 monthly fee for \nthe use of the debit card, they went overboard. They are overcharging \ntheir customers even for this new debit card reform,\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nbut it is nothing new in the history of Bank of America. Consumers \nacross America and the customers of Bank of America are rightfully \noutraged. It is hard to believe a bank would impose such a fee on loyal \ncustomers who simply are trying to access their own money on deposit at \nBank of America, especially when Bank of America, for years, has been \nencouraging their customers to use debit cards as much as possible.\n\n  It is particularly hard to believe this fee would come from a bank \nwith a track record such as Bank of America's. After helping to drive \nour economy off the cliff's edge in 2008, Bank of America was happy to \naccept a $45 billion Federal bailout for their stupidity, their greed, \nand their mistakes. It was just as happy to take that money and hand \nout $3.3 billion in employee bonuses in the same year--2008. Don't \nforget the track record of Bank of America when it comes to handling \nmortgages. They picked up this company--Countrywide--which had issued \nmortgages all across America that were going bad. The record of Bank of \nAmerica, when it comes to processing these same mortgages, is equally \ndisappointing. When it is not losing paperwork or refusing to answer \nthe phone, Bank of America is foreclosing on American families right \nand left.\n  But at least this time Bank of America is being open about the new \ncharge to its loyal customers. In contrast to the overdraft fees, \nresearch fees, swipe fees, and other hidden fees they have charged, \nthis time Bank of America is being up front about sticking it to its \nown customers. Transparency is a good thing. It allows customers, as I \nsaid, to vote with their feet. Not every bank treats its customers like \nBank of America, and consumers can decide whether Bank of America's \nvalues reflect their own.\n  Bank of America is the largest bank in terms of assets in the United \nStates. Now it is crying poverty, saying it is forced to hit their \ndebit cardholders with this new monthly fee because Congress passed \nswipe fee reform. I don't buy it. Here is the reality: Bank of America \nand banks in general are still making billions of dollars with this new \nreform in the law of credit and debit card swipe fees. Swipe fees are \nan estimated $50 billion per year money maker for the banking \nindustry--$50 billion. Bank of America alone makes billions from swipe \nfees each year. But Bank of America didn't earn those fees by \ncompetition. Instead, Bank of America receives these billions because \nVisa and MasterCard, this duopoly that runs the credit card business in \nAmerica, basically fixed these prices and retailers and consumers have \nno voice in the process. This price-fixing has immunized the swipe fee \nrevenue stream from competition. Now that Bank of America is out in the \nopen with this overcharge of their own customers, it is time for real \ncompetition to step in. The Federal Reserve found it cost the bank, on \naverage, 7 cents to conduct a debit transaction--a signature \ntransaction. It costs a lot less, I am sure, for Bank of America, with \nits economies of scale. But the Fed also found Bank of America was \ngetting an average of 44 cents, instead of 7 cents. They simply can't \nmake that type of enormous profit margin--nearly 600 percent--in a \ntransparent and competitive market. In a free and fair market, these \nprofits would be competed down to a reasonable level. Without \ncompetition, credit card companies--these banks such as Bank of \nAmerica--will continue to win, and consumers and retailers--and, of \ncourse, now the Bank of America's own customers--will lose.\n  Today, I have written a letter to the CEO of Bank of America. His \nname is Brian Moynihan. I told him it wasn't just me alone but others \nhave done a little calculation on his $5 monthly fee. Do you know what \nwe found out? When they thought the swipe fee was going to be limited \nto 12 cents, Bank of America said: That will cost us $2 billion a year. \nTurns out the Federal Reserve said: No, it will be 24 cents. So by our \nestimates, this new reform of the swipe fee may cost--may cost--Bank of \nAmerica $1 billion a year in revenue. Guess what. If we do the \ncalculation of $5 a month on the number of reported debit cardholders \nat Bank of America, they will bring back twice as much as their \nprojected loss on this new law. They are overcharging their own \ncustomers, once again, twice as much as they should if they just want \nto cover the hidden fees they had in the past.\n  That is unfair to consumers, it is unfair to the customers, and it is \nunfair to do it in this tough economy, when a lot of Bank of America's \ncustomers across America are struggling to get by. What I am basically \ncalling on Mr. Moynihan to do is to justify this $5 monthly fee based \non their projected debit card transaction losses and the number of \npeople they have holding debit cards by their company.\n  I didn't come up with this alone. A gentleman by the name of Lazarus, \nwho is a business reporter in California, was the first one who called \nit to my attention on the ``Lehrer Report'' on Friday night. We have \nlooked into it further, and it is clear, again--again--that Bank of \nAmerica is overcharging its own customers. I can tell you it isn't the \nfirst time. Most people are aware of the fact Bank of America was sued \nfor overcharging for various fees, such as overdraft fees, in the past. \nBecause of that suit and the possibility of losing it, they entered \ninto a settlement to pay over $400 million for overcharging their own \ncustomers. They are doing it again. Bank of America, with this monthly \nfee, is overcharging its customers again by any reasonable standard for \na loss of revenue based on this new law.\n  The last point I wish to make is this--because I see some on the \nfloor, including a Senator or two who may have a different point of \nview. When I was back in Illinois, I stood with the retailers, and I \nhope the retailers of Tennessee and Utah will be in touch with my \ncolleagues and let us hear their side of the story. They have been \nvictimized by these banks and credit card companies for too long. What \nwe do with this law is establish a reasonable standard of compensation \nand now some disclosure about what is being charged for transactions.\n  I wish to help small businesses--and large retailers too, for that \nmatter--across America. Their profitability, the success of their \nbusiness, means more Americans go to work. If a Senator wishes to stand \non the floor of the Senate and defend the Wall Street banks, such as \nBank of America, and the credit card companies, be my guest. I would \nrather stand with the consumers and retailers that have been taken to \nthe cleaners for years and years by these swipe fees.\n  The latest outrage by the Bank of America is a reminder that when it \ncomes to valuing customers, those banks that don't gouge those \ncustomers, that don't overcharge for debt fees, are the ones that \ndeserve America's business.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I actually am here to speak on another \ntopic, but I was glad to hear the comments of the Senator from \nIllinois. I will say in general that I think consumers across our \ncountry are beginning to see the first of many consequences of Dodd-\nFrank. Sometimes I think my friends on the other side of the aisle \nbelieve money comes from air. But the fact is when you price fix \nsomething such as the Senate did through Dodd-Frank, when you price fix \nsomething like this, obviously it is going to have the consequences \nthat have been laid out and, unfortunately, consumers across our \ncountry are going to be paying the price. It is interesting that most \nof the major retailers my friend was alluding to are all talking about \nthe profits, the benefits they are going to have from this. At the end \nof the day it is the consumers who are going to be paying the price, \nand we are already seeing that play out. While Bank of America--I am \nnot here to defend them. This is just the first of many charges and \nlack of credit that is going to be part of our American society as a \nresult of Dodd-Frank.\n  But let me say, I came down today to talk about a bill we are getting \nready to debate I understand this afternoon at 5:30. It is the Currency \nExchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011. I probably won't recite \nthat again, but that is the bill we are going to be having a cloture \nvote on tonight at 5:30.\n  I understand how people across this country are very frustrated about \nour\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\neconomic situation. I am very frustrated. I am frustrated for the \npeople of Tennessee and the fact that our economy is not showing the \nkind of growth we would all wish to see. I understand how politicians \nlike to respond to things back home by making it look as if they are \ndoing something to benefit the folks back home during this tough \neconomy. I plan to speak at length on this throughout the week that \nthis bill is being debated.\n  The bill that is going to be on the floor tonight is not the answer. \nI think most of you know that tonight we are going to begin debating a \nbill that would call China, in essence, a currency manipulator. And, by \nthe way, they are a currency manipulator and I will agree to that. But \nthe response that this bill wants to put in place is to put tariffs on \nChinese imports, and what I believe will happen is it will begin a \ntrade war.\n  What I wish to say is this is the U.S. Senate. I understand that \nsometimes a hot bill will make it out of the House for lots of reasons, \ndue to its makeup. I understand that a lot of times a bill such as this \ncomes forth for messaging. What I would say is we are actually playing \nwith fire here. This is something that is originating in the Senate. It \nis a place where typically things are to cool and we are to think \nthrough things.\n  I am hopeful we will have a vigorous debate on this, and many \namendments, because my concern is that at a time in our country when we \nhave had a financial crisis which has led to the type of economy we \nhave here where we wish to see many people in our country have greater \nand more full employment, at a time when we come off high energy prices \na few years ago that sucked a lot of life out of this economy, at a \ntime when the global economy is slowing much due to the financial \ncrisis that is occurring right now in Europe, I think the response we \nwant to put forth is not to create a trade war with China.\n  I think most of us know China has been a currency manipulator. They \nhave a managed float for their currency. We wish to see that rise much \nmore quickly than it has. It has risen about 30 percent in the last \nseveral years.\n  So the point is they are making changes. China has an antiquated \nfinancial system that has to be changed; it has to be liberated; it has \nto become more like what we have in this country. And those steps are \nhappening. There is no doubt that importers--there is no doubt that the \ngoods that come here from China come here at a lesser price than they \notherwise would because of the currency float they put in place in \nChina. I understand that. But that is changing. And the fact is that \nwith a country of 1.3 billion and as their standard of living continues \nto grow, we have an opportunity to have even more trade with this \ncountry. Our exports to China have grown sixfold over the most recent \ntime.\n  So here we have an opportunity in this Chamber very soon to take up \nthe three free-trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia, \ntrade agreements we have wanted to have in place for a long time. Here \nwe are, the Senate, a body that is supposed to act with cooler heads. \nAnd I understand the pressures back home. I have them too. Our State \nhas tremendously high unemployment, much higher unemployment than I \nwish to see happen. I know when I go to townhall meetings, people talk \nabout China, and I understand that. But I think people may be \nmisreading what is in this bill. I think a lot of people think this \nbill is sort of a plaything because it actually gives the President a \nchance to waive tariffs on goods that happen to come here cheaper \nbecause of currency manipulation. But that is not the case. That is not \nwhat this bill says. A lot of people have misunderstood what this bill \nsays. They think it is sort of a plaything and the President can make \nit all right. The President, if you will, can be the adult and not \ncreate a trade war. But that is not what the bill says. The bill says \nthis country has to put in place tariffs on goods coming into this \ncountry, as long as they are not being dumped into this country. If \nthey come in at a competitive advantage, we have to put in place \ntariffs.\n  Is this what the Senate wants to do today? We have had a tremendous \nfinancial crisis. We have high unemployment in this country. We are \ntremendously overregulated. We are not doing the things within our own \ncountry we should be doing, that many of us have been arguing, to cause \nour economy to grow. We have a financial crisis that is taking hold and \ntaking root and actually moving in parts to this country and hurting \nus. The markets are down.\n  So the Senate, a body of 100 people who are elected for 6-year terms, \nwants to put in place tariffs on a major growing country that we have \ngrowing exports to, and create a trade war--a trade war between the two \nlargest economies in the world? That is our response, instead of \nunderstanding the best thing we can do for this country right now is to \ndeal with those long-term solutions in our own country and ask this \ndeficit reduction committee to go big, to get $3 trillion, to do tax \nreform, to do entitlement reform. These are the kinds of things we \nought to be doing in this country: passing a 6-year highway bill; \nproducing American energy; reducing regulations that are impeding our \neconomy and not helping the country. Those are the kinds of things we \nought to do. That is the response from the Senate, from people with 6-\nyear terms who were elected to be the cooling of legislation, not to \noriginate bills out of this body that we know, if passed, will likely \ncreate a trade war.\n\n  It is as though this country has lost its ability to see the fact \nthat we are an exceptional country. It is as though we are cowering \ndown now. It is as though we know what to do but we won't do it, and, \ninstead, now we have got to find a bogeyman.\n  Do I like what China is doing with their currency? No. But is it \nchanging? Yes. Is our country putting pressure on China to change? Yes. \nIs it occurring? Yes. It is going to have to. The middle class in China \nis going to want access to the kinds of goods our country produces. It \nis naturally happening. So why would we as a country tamper at this \ntime of a global slowdown with creating a trade war?\n  I understand and I know many of the Senators in this room hear the \nsame things back home I hear back home. But the last thing we need to \ndo at this point in world history, at this point with the global \neconomy as it is today, is repeat the same mistakes that happened back \nin the 1930s with Smoot-Hawley. That is exactly the path we are going \ndown. It is as if we don't learn from history. I urge all Senators to \nthink about this.\n  I understand we are probably going to move to this bill tonight. I do \nhope we have a vigorous debate. I hope we change this bill \ndramatically, if not kill it. But I think Senators need to understand, \nin my opinion, we are playing with fire. This is not the right thing \nfor us to do. We need to be focusing on how we make this great Nation, \nthe greatest Nation of all times, grow. We can do that by dealing with \nour own issues here internally. We know how to do it, and we can do \nthis by courageously dealing with the long-term issues that confront \nthis country. That will be the short-term stimulus this economy needs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 4:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n1619, the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act. First, I want to \nsay this bill is the culmination of years of hard work and \ncollaboration between Democrats and Republicans. I thank Senator \nLindsey Graham of South Carolina. He and I have been partners in this \nendeavor for over 5 years. We have traveled to China together. We have \nworked long and hard to try to gain some fairness in the way China \ntreats American industry, particularly in regards to currency.\n  I thank Senator Sherrod Brown and Senator Debbie Stabenow. Both made \nvery valuable additions to the proposal on the Senate floor today. In \nfact, Senator Brown is the lead sponsor of this legislation because of \nthe strong and good work he has done. They both have worked long and \nhard, realizing the industries in their States are at such a \ncompetitive disadvantage.\n  I thank my colleague, Jeff Sessions, as well, who has been one of our \npartners and leaders on this legislation over the last several months, \nand lead sponsors in addition: Bob Casey, Olympia Snowe, Jeff Sessions, \nKay Hagan, and Richard Burr, as well as dozens of other cosponsors on \nthis bill for their work on this issue for many years.\n  I also want to particularly express my appreciation to Chairman Max \nBaucus and former ranking member of the Finance Committee Chuck \nGrassley for their leadership and work on currency manipulation. We \nbelieve our bill is WTO compliant, and it is in part because Senators \nBaucus and Grassley looked at our original bill and worked with us on \nsuggestions as to how to change it to make it just as effective but \nwithin the rules of WTO.\n  Today we have an opportunity to help put middle-class Americans back \nto work and, amazingly enough, in a bipartisan way. Today we stand \ntogether to defend American jobs against market-distorting, job-killing \nexchange rate policies that subsidize foreign manufacturers at the \nexpense of American manufacturers. These currency policies artificially \nraise the price of U.S. exports and suppress the price of Chinese \nimports into the United States, undermining the economic health of \nAmerican manufacturers and their ability to compete at home and around \nthe globe.\n  China is by far the biggest exploiter of predatory currency \npractices, but our bill does not target China or any one country. Our \nbill, rather, says there will be consequences for any country that \nengages in currency manipulation to gain an unfair advantage over \nAmerican businesses.\n  It has been 10 years since China joined the WTO. In those 10 years \nthe Economic Policy Institute estimates that 2.8 million American jobs \nwere lost or displaced in manufacturing or other trade-related \nindustries as a result of increased trade with China and the Chinese \nGovernment's manipulation of its currency. My State of New York has \nsuffered some of the biggest losses, with over 161,000 jobs lost or \nworkers displaced since 2001. Accession to the WTO was supposed to \nbring China's policies in line with global trade rules meant to ensure \nfree but fair trade. Instead, China has single-mindedly flouted those \nrules to spur its own economy and export-oriented growth at the expense \nof its trading partners, most of all the United States.\n  Our economic relationship with China needs a fundamental change. It \nis not just in currency, although that is the No. 1 issue. On issue \nafter issue, whether it is poaching intellectual property, unfairly and \nillegally subsidizing Chinese businesses, monopolizing rare earths, not \nallowing American companies to compete in China--on issue after issue \nChina is mercantilist, plain and simple. They use the rules of free \ntrade when it benefits them and spurn the rules of free trade when it \nbenefits them. For years Americans have grimaced, shrugged their \nshoulders, but never done anything effective to in large measure stop \nthe Chinese pursuit of unfair mercantilism.\n  Six years ago I was in upstate New York and a steel manufacturer told \nme they could compete against Chinese steel just fine, even with labor \ncosts being lower in China, except for the fact that China manipulated \nits currency and gave Chinese steel imports a 30- to 40-percent \nadvantage. The owner of the company, providing 300 good-paying jobs, \npleaded with me to do something. I happened to speak with Senator \nGraham, and he was finding the same situation with industries in his \nState of South Carolina.\n  We began our crusade to get China to behave fairly. At first, people \ndid not even accept the fact that currency manipulation was wrong and \nharmful to America. I remember at one point, within a short period of \ntime, both the New York Times editorial page--a decidedly liberal \neditorial page--and the Wall Street Journal editorial page--a decidedly \nconservative editorial page--said China should not have to let its \ncurrency float, even though it is a tenet of free trade since Bretton \nWoods that said the way to correct large imbalances in trade is to let \na currency readjust by floating.\n  We spent years convincing America, convincing our colleagues that \nthis manipulation of currency dramatically hurt America and was unfair \nand against all tenets of free trade. We have achieved that goal. Now \nthe editorials may pick reasons they do not like our particular bill, \nbut they say: Oh, yes, we have to deal with Chinese currency \nmanipulation.\n  But when we ask people who say: Don't do your bill, deal with it a \ndifferent way, we say how? No one has another answer. It was true that \nour initial bill introduced 5 years ago was a blunt instrument to bring \nattention to the issue. It was our hope then not to pass the \nlegislation--in fact, we allowed cooling off period after cooling off \nperiod in the legislation--but, rather, simply to get the Chinese to \nact. But about after 3 or 4 years, Senator Graham and I became \nconvinced that China would not act. When there was real pressure they \nmight move the currency a little bit, but then they would back off.\n  The same proved true in other areas where China unfairly treats \nAmerican industry, so we came to the conclusion that legislation was \nthe only answer, no one having a preferred or even seemingly possibly \neffective alternative. So we worked, as I said, with Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley and came up with a proposal we believe meets WTO \nrules.\n  Then, because Senator Stabenow had worked long and hard on this issue \nalong with Senator Collins, we combined her proposal and our proposal. \nHers was mainly focused on the Banking Committee, Commerce Department, \nours on Treasury. Then a year or two ago, Senator Brown and Senator \nSnowe had an additional proposal, and we have combined all of these \nproposals into one workable bill that will finally get fairness for \nAmerican companies.\n  Over the past 6 years we have been sending a message to the Chinese \nGovernment about their exchange rate policies. Every Treasury Secretary \nsince we began this crusade said: You know what. Let me just talk to \nthe Chinese. I can bring reason to them.\n  They did it with the best of intentions and the best of hopes, every \nTreasury Secretary--casting no aspersions on any of them because the \nfault was China's, not ours--and could not get progress at all.\n  So it is down to this. If we want American companies to have a fair \nchance of competing, this is the solution. Not everyone will agree with \nevery jot and tittle in this bill, but I think the vast majority of my \ncolleagues will agree with its thrust and the need to do more than we \nhave been doing. For that reason I am hopeful that large numbers on \nboth sides of the aisle will vote for this motion to proceed so we can \nbegin debating this measure and listen to some amendments if people \nhave ideas as to how to change it.\n  Let me go over our bill. Our bill is intended to give the \nadministration additional tools--this administration or any--to use if \ncountries fail to take steps to eliminate currency misalignment. The \nbill would prohibit Federal procurement of products or services\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\nfrom a country that fails to adopt appropriate policies or to take \nidentifiable action to eliminate currency misalignment.\n  Our bill also uses U.S. trade law to counter the economic harm to \nU.S. manufacturers caused by currency manipulation. The artificially \nlow value of the yuan--economists estimate it is anywhere from 20 to 40 \npercent less than what it should be--amounts, as is well known now, to \na subsidy on Chinese exports and a tariff on imports from the United \nStates and other countries to China.\n  Under existing trade laws, if the Commerce Department and the \nInternational Trade Commission find that subsidized imports are causing \neconomic harm to American manufacturers and workers, the administration \nmust impose duties on those imports to offset or countervail the \nbenefit conferred on foreign producers and exporters by government \nsubsidies. Commerce already has the authority under U.S. law to \ninvestigate whether currency undervaluation by a government provides a \ncountervailable subsidy, although it has failed to do so despite \nrepeated requests by industry after industry to investigate.\n  Our bill specifies the applicable investigation initiation standard \nso Commerce can't just turn its back on these companies, and it will \nrequire Commerce to investigate whether currency undervaluation by a \ngovernment provides a countervailable subsidy if the U.S. industry \nrequests the investigation and provides the proper documentation.\n  Our bill also clarifies that Commerce may not refuse to investigate a \nsubsidy allegation based on the single fact that a subsidy is available \nin circumstances in addition to export.\n  Our bill also uses the term ``currency misalignment,'' but it is not \njust a term. Administrations, both the Bush administration and the \nObama administration, have, to the amazement of many Americans, refused \nto label China a currency manipulator. But manipulation is a subjective \nstandard involving intent. What we do is refine that concept and go for \nmisalignment. We believe misalignment is the appropriate standard. That \nis not subjective. It is not saying why the currency is misaligned or \nhow or who did it. It is simply saying that it is. It is a narrower \nstandard. It is a standard that is harder to wriggle out from under if \nanybody, any government official is intent on not enforcing the rules \nwe think necessary to get the Chinese to act. So the bill is carefully \nthought out. The decimation of our middle class, our manufacturing \nsector, and the American economy as a whole is due in part to \ndeveloping countries such as China employing currency manipulation and \nother aggressive mercantilist tactics to tilt the field in their favor. \nIn the absence of action by the administration, we have a \nresponsibility to protect the interests of American workers and \ncompanies.\n\n  One of the questions that is raised is, Is our bill WTO compliant? We \nbelieve it is. We have worked hard to ensure this. The bill provides \nthe President with flexibility to waive any consequences that might \nhave an adverse impact on the U.S. economy. The bill also continues to \nallow the U.S. Government trade officials to do their job and make the \ndecisions on the basis of facts argued before them. We have talked to \nmany experts in the field. They too believe our bill is WTO compliant.\n  What do the critics say? No one criticizes the idea that China has \nmanipulated its currency. No one criticizes the thought, the actuality \nthat China manipulates its currency. Almost everybody thinks not enough \nis being done. The main argument against our bill is not the bill \nitself, but critics of the bill worry that maybe this could start a \ntrade war with China. Well, I have news for them: We are already in a \ntrade war with China, and we are losing. China, by its mercantilist \npolicies on currency above all but on rare earth and intellectual \nproperty, unsubsidization of homegrown industry, on exclusion of \nAmerican exports where we might have advantage, is already engaged in a \ntrade war, and the result is that millions of Americans do not have \njobs who should. The result is that hundreds of billions of dollars \nflow out of America and into China. If we do not do anything about \nthis, our country will be hurt badly, perhaps irreparably.\n  Some argue, as did the Washington Post today, that it will not have \nmuch of an effect because the industry of China has to revalue its \ncurrency; these industries will go to places such as Bangladesh. They \nare making an argument that is 5 and 10 years old and stale. We are not \narguing about labor-intensive industries such as clothing or shoes or \ntoys. Those are going to Bangladesh already, with the cost of Chinese \nlabor going up. China uses its currency manipulation against our top-\nnotch manufacturers. The large companies say nothing because most of \nthem have plants in China, so they can get around it, but middle- and \nsmall-sized manufacturers are up against this wall and are desperate \nfor our help.\n  One manufacturer in upstate New York makes a very advanced product \nthat deals with cleaning pollutants as they go through a power system. \nIt is a top-notch product. This manufacturer, who employs a couple \nhundred people in upstate New York, said to me: China's stealing my \nstuff even though I have patents and other things on it. They are \nstealing the method by which we do this. He said: I could live with \nthat if they just sold the stuff in China. We are not big enough to \nexport all around the world. Instead, what they do is steal our \nintellectual property on this, and then they come back and sell it in \nAmerica at a 30-percent discount because of currency manipulation. How \nam I going to compete with that?\n  There is story after story just like that. When American companies \nare fighting for their survival and battling subsidized Chinese \nexports, including high-end exports, this is no longer an argument \nabout labor-intensive industries alone.\n  I, for one, am not prepared to raise the white flag on American \nmanufacturing and on American jobs, and neither should anybody else. I \nknow American manufacturing can compete successfully against Chinese \ncompetition at home, in China, and around the world but only if the \nplaying field is level, and our bill helps to level that playing field.\n  Critics of our bill say that while currency manipulation is an \nimportant issue, legislation to address it would ignore the many and \ngrowing challenges we face in China. The critics are wrong. We have no \nintention of ignoring the range of China's market-distorting practices, \nthe ones I mentioned before. In fact, because China was emboldened on \ncurrency, which the whole world--Brazil, just a week or two ago, asked \nChina to stop manipulating its currency. The European Union feels the \nsame way we do. Nobody does anything, so China is emboldened to pursue \nmercantilist policies in other areas. Just recently, they have become \ninvolved in rare earths. They tell American manufacturers: If you want \nrare earths, you would be a lot better off sending your plant to China. \nIt is just unheard of.\n  Critics of our bill say it is unlikely to create any incentive for \nChina to modify its exchange policies. The experience Senator Graham \nand I have had is that when China thinks something might be done, they \nbegin to let their currency rise. Because nothing permanent is done, \nthey go right back to their old habits as soon as the pressure is off. \nThis idea that if we pressure the Chinese, they won't do it makes no \nsense. If we pressure them, they do nothing, and if we don't pressure \nthem, they do nothing. The only answer is concrete legislation.\n  What would those who oppose this bill have us do? What is their \nsuggestion? They do not really have one. Should we continue to sit back \nand watch while American jobs and American manufacturers and even large \nchunks of American wealth just drift away? Should we continue to, as \none of my constituents put it, be not Uncle Sam but Uncle Sap? Well, \nthere are too many of us in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle who \nwill not sit back and continue to let mercantilist trade practices \ncontinue to decimate American manufacturing and American jobs--middle, \nlow, and high--nor will my colleagues here in the Senate. Democrats and \nRepublicans are united on this issue. We must take decisive action \nagainst China's currency manipulation and other economically injurious \nbehavior. The fact that they manipulate their currency imbalances the \nwhole world trading system. Many\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\neconomists list it as one of the reasons we had the decline in global \ntrade in the worldwide recession. We simply have no choice but to right \nthe wrong China is committing.\n  Any retaliation by China would be further evidence of their \nunwillingness to meet their obligations under the WTO and the global \ntrade community. By the way, China has a lot more to lose with \nretaliation than we do. If there is one country that gains the most by \nexporting to the United States by international trade, it is China. \nThey are very smart, and they are not going to cut their nose to spite \ntheir face.\n  I wholeheartedly support the President's goal of doubling U.S. \nexports over the next 5 years, but that cannot be done if we do not \ntake concrete action to address the protectionist practices of foreign \ngovernments that concede tariff reductions only to replace tariffs with \nmassive currency manipulation, border taxes, and a variety of state \nsubsidies. We will not do it unless we get to the root cause.\n\n  China's currency manipulation would be unacceptable even in good \neconomic times. At times of high unemployment, we can no longer stand \nfor it. There is no bigger step to create American jobs that we can \ntake than to confront China's currency manipulation. It is not a \nDemocratic or Republican issue. Every one of us has manufacturers, \ncompanies that are struggling to compete at home and abroad with \nChinese exports with a built-in price advantage. It is not China \nbashing. It is about fairness and defending American jobs.\n  Many of us and most Americans are worried about how things will be in \n10, 20 years from now. Will America stay the leading economic power of \nthe world? Will our children have a better life than we do? The No. 1 \nthing we have to do is change things at home to make that better, there \nis no question about it. Very high on the list as well is making sure \nChina no longer unfairly sucks millions of jobs and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of American wealth to its shores. What China does \nwill make our job of keeping America strong, of having the next \ngeneration live a better life than this generation far more difficult \nunless we force them to change. They will not change on their own.\n  Passage of this legislation will lead to real consequences for \ncountries that unfairly manipulate their currency. We have waited a \nlong time. We have declined to move the legislation at the request of \ntwo administrations. Patience--not of us but of the American people--\nhas worn out. I ask my colleagues to stand with us on S. 1619. Stand up \nfor American manufacturing, for American jobs, for American wealth. \nStand up so our children can have an even brighter future than we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have enjoyed the remarks of my distinguished friend from \nNew York.\n  As we begin the debate today on the important issue of exchange rate \nmisalignment, although it is an important debate, I seriously question \nits timing.\n  Let's step back for a moment. At the end of last month, the Senate \napproved legislation renewing and expanding trade adjustment \nassistance. We need to be clear about what this program is--a big \ngovernment spending program of dubious value but one that is important \nto President Obama's union allies. Not surprisingly, given the heft \nlabor unions wield in the liberal political coalition, this spending \nprogram is President Obama's top trade priority, so much so that he was \neven willing to abandon our allies in Colombia, Panama, and South Korea \nunless he secured this additional spending. To get more government \nspending for big labor, the President was willing to hold up the three \nfree-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea that \neveryone knows will grow this economy and create jobs.\n  I was happy to chat with the Trade Representative a few minutes ago, \nand he told me he was going to send those three trade agreements up \ntoday, and they should be here between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. I am really \nhappy about that because it is way beyond time to get them here.\n  Americans need to remember this episode when they hear the President \ntalk about his commitment to job creation. Put aside all the talk, and \nit is clear where the rubber hits the road. The President will \nprioritize government spending over private sector job growth.\n  Still, because of the President's insistence on this spending \nprogram, the TAA bill is likely to pass the House and become law. So \nhere is my question: Given that we just debated a trade bill that we \nknew would likely become law, why was this currency bill not considered \nin that context? I can only conclude either that the administration \nopposes the currency bill and therefore asked that it not become part \nof TAA or that the consideration of this bill is merely a political \nexercise with little expectation that it ever will become law. With \nmillions of Americans out of work and the economy stagnant, the people \nof Utah and all American citizens deserve more than political \ngrandstanding.\n  Regarding the substance of the issue, the manipulation of currency \nvalues by major trading partners in order to gain unfair trade \nadvantage represents a genuine threat to U.S. jobs and to rebalancing \nof the global financial and economic system. For many years and \ncontinuing into the present, that threat is a reality. There is \nvirtually unanimous agreement among international analysts that there \nexists large-scale, prolonged, one-way intervention in exchange markets \nby some of our important trading partners in order to limit or preclude \ncurrency appreciation, primarily in China but also in some of the other \neconomies as well. There also seems to be little question that China \nmanipulates its currency in order to subsidize its exports.\n  The bill before us seeks to address exchange rate misalignment \nspecifically and global imbalances generally by sharpening the tools \navailable to counter currency manipulation by a trading partner. Of \ncourse, any additional tools we can construct must be carefully crafted \nto align with all of our international trade agreements and global \nrules of trade.\n  The issue of China's currency has been with us for far too many \nyears.\n  The issue of China's currency has been with us for far too many \nyears. We have repeated discussions about how to address lack of \nappreciation of China's currency, followed by diplomatic bilateral \ndiscussions assurances of moves from China to allow appreciation some \nmodest subsequent appreciation while the political heat is on, and \nlittle change thereafter once the heat subsides.\n  This approach does not seem to be working. We have had large and \npersistent bilateral trade deficits with China, and those deficits \ncontinue. We have relied on China's massive excess savings to finance \nour growing debt, and we have worsened that reliance given the debt-\nfueled spending spree of the current President. China's dollar-\ndenominated reserve holdings, which have grown for many years, have \nballooned from around $1.9 trillion when President Obama took office to \nover $3 trillion, according to some recent estimates--a 50-percent \nincrease.\n  But currency misalignment by China is not the only source of global \nfinancial and economic imbalances. If the President looked in the \nmirror, he would see his own responsibility for global economic \nuncertainty. Our budget deficits have far exceeded $1 trillion for the \npast 3 fiscal years. For 2011, the deficit is expected to be around \n$1.3 trillion, which is an unsustainable 8.5 percent of GDP and the \nthird-largest deficit in the past 65 years, exceeded only by the \ndeficits in 2009 and 2010. Deficits of this magnitude have not been \nseen since the years surrounding World War II, when virtually the \nentire economy was being directed by the Federal government. Given our \nbudget deficits and the China currency issue, the important question \nis: What is being done?\n\n  Let's look at what is being done with a bit of recent history for \ncontext. Back in 2008, then-candidate Obama wrote the following to \ntextile organizations:\n\n       The massive current account surpluses accumulated by China \n     are directly related to its manipulation of its currency's \n     value. The result is not good for the United States, not good \n     for the global economy, and likely to create problems in \n     China itself.\n\n  He went went on to promise that, if elected, he would use all \ndiplomatic\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\nmeans at his disposal to induce China to change its foreign exchange \npolicies. He promised to beef up U.S. enforcement efforts against \nunfair trade practices.\n  Also, back in 2009, during the Treasury Secretary's confirmation \nhearing before the Senate Finance Committee, now-Secretary Geithner \nstated that:\n\n       President Obama--backed by the conclusions of a broad range \n     of economists--believes that China is manipulating its \n     currency.\n\n  Those are strong words. Yet once in office, the President and \nSecretary Geithner failed to follow up on those words with action. The \nAdministration promised to usher in an era of change but failed to \nchange the way the U.S. deals with the China currency issue.\n  The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 requires that the \nTreasury Secretary report on exchange rate policies of major U.S. \ntrading partners. Under the act, Treasury must consider \nwhether countries manipulate exchange rates for purposes of preventing \nbalance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair trade advantage.\n\n  The evidence clearly seems to show that China's currency policies \namount to manipulation leading to an unfair advantage in international \ntrade.\n  Candidate Obama agreed during his campaign.\n  Treasury Secretary Geithner agreed during his confirmation testimony.\n  Yet, as Treasury Secretary and as President, the two have refused to \nact.\n  Secretary Geithner has issued five foreign exchange reports, but has \nrefused to label China as a country that manipulates its exchange rate \nfor the purpose of gaining unfair competitive advantage in \ninternational trade. Let me repeat that, despite many bold claims about \nusing all the tools at their disposal to counteract China's trade \npolicies, the administration refuses to designate China's policies as \nbeing consistent with currency manipulation for trade advantage. The \nquestion that I and most of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nhave is: Why?\n  Clearly, the administration must recognize the consequences of \nChina's manipulation for American workers and manufacturers and for the \nstability of the global financial and economic system. Why, then, is \nthe administration protecting China by refusing to designate it as a \ncurrency manipulator?\n  Under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, once a country is so \ndesignated, there are no draconian actions required. The immediate \nrepercussions are merely stepped-up monitoring and greater vigilance in \ndialogue. Those don't seem to be things that would lead to currency or \ntrade wars.\n\n  So, why doesn't the administration act?\n  After all, American jobs are at stake. American workers can compete \nwith any workers in the world, but our workers should not have to \ncompete against foreign firms that receive massive subsidies. If the \nPresident is as intent on focusing on job creation in America as his \ncampaigning suggests, then why has he refused to take such a simple \nstep as designating known, existing currency manipulation?\n  There is a severe mismatch here between political rhetoric and \naction.\n  My fear is that the administration's overreliance on overseas \nfunding--in particular from China--to finance their exploding deficits \nis preventing the President and his officers from acting on behalf of \nthe competitive, but struggling, American workforce.\n  It is well past time for the administration to recognize the negative \nconsequences of China's manipulation for American workers and \nmanufacturers, and for global stability.\n  Even though there has been only tepid support, even on the Democratic \nside of the aisle, for the President's much touted jobs plan, there is \nbipartisan agreement that Congress needs to take significant actions to \naddress the massive jobs deficit this Nation is facing. We face a \nnational crisis in having unemployment persisting at over 9 percent, \nwith elevated numbers of the unemployed suffering from long-term bouts \nof joblessness and with many American workers having become so \ndiscouraged that they have simply dropped out of the labor force.\n  According to statements by the majority leader of the Senate, a \nfocus on jobs is precisely why we are considering the bill before us. \nAccording to one of those statements, the majority leader is reported \nas having said that ``I don't think there's anything more important for \na jobs measure than China trade.''\n\n  I am starting to think my friends on the other side of the aisle are \nlike the gang that couldn't shoot straight. The majority leader thinks \nthat addressing China trade is essential to job creation. But based on \nits failure to use existing tools available to designate China as a \ncurrency manipulator, the administration apparently disagrees or it \nwould have long ago used its authority to make such a designation under \nthe Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act and then acted on the \nproblem.\n  The President's focus seems to be elsewhere. He seems to think that \nat least as important for jobs as the issue of China trade identified \nby the majority leader is his so-called American Jobs Act. \nAdvertisements by the Democratic National Committee and campaign \nspeeches by the President since he announced it in a joint session of \nCongress early last month tell us quite clearly that we should ``meet \nour responsibilities'' and consider that Act ``right away.''\n  Yet my friends on the other side of the aisle apparently believe that \na political debate over China and its currency policies are more \nimportant for job creation than the President's American Jobs Act.\n  If the President's act is, as advertised, so crucial for job creation \nin the face of our national unemployment crisis, why is Senate \nDemocratic leadership delaying its consideration? Why not consider the \nlegislation right away, as demanded by the President in his \ncampaign speeches and Democratic National Committee advertisements?\n\n  We are told by the President that Americans who are out of work \ncannot wait until the next election for us to act boldly for job \ncreation. So why are we not considering his American Jobs Act, unless \nmy Democrat friends disagree with the President that the act would be \nthe most important job creator available to us today?\n  I suspect they know that the $447 billion in new stimulus spending \nincluded in the President's jobs bill, and the accompanying proposals \nto impose $1.5 trillion in new taxes on a sluggish economy, is \neconomically counterproductive and a sure-fire political loser.\n  I must say that the President's Jobs Act looks like more of the same \ndebt-fueled stimulus spending, cloaked under the guise of \n``investment,'' along with higher taxes, cloaked under the label ``tax \nreform.''\n  While I may disagree on the particulars of the President's proposal, \nI do not disagree with his premise that we face a national crisis in \nour labor markets and that we should be debating measures that will \npromote American job creation now, without delay.\n  We are also told by the President that we must pass our pending trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Jobs are at stake, \nhe says. As with the political campaign rhetoric exhorting Congress to \npass the President's American Jobs Act, which the majority leader has \nopted to shelve until some unspecified future date, the President \ndelayed the action required to get these agreements passed for much too \nlong.\n  Pass the American Jobs Act, the President scolds.\n  But we can't because the Democrat's majority leader has not brought \nthe Act to the Senate floor. The currency bill, which is unlikely to \nlead to much, if any, job creation before the next election, has come \nfirst, perhaps to allow more time for campaign speeches and ads by the \nDemocratic National Committee.\n  Pass the free trade agreements, the President lectures. But they were \ndelayed, as they sit idle on his desk.\n  I am pleased, since the trade leader in the administration called me \na few minutes ago to tell me they are on their way up here today.\n  This currency bill is coming first. But what needs to come first is \njob creation, not electioneering and politics.\n  Our jobs deficit is a full-blown national crisis. The unemployment \nrate has been persistently above 9 percent since April of this year. It \nhas averaged 9.4 percent since the President took office. It has been \nabove 9 percent in 26\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\nout of the 31 months since the President took office, despite promises \nby administration economists that the massive debt-fueled stimulus, \nwhich will cost over $1 trillion when all costs are included, would \nkeep unemployment contained below 8 percent. And the unemployment rate \nis even higher, at over 16 percent, once we include, for example, \npeople who want to work but have become so discouraged that they no \nlonger look for work.\n  Nearly 14 million workers are unemployed, and the number grows when \nwe include discouraged workers. The number of long-term unemployed \nworkers has been at record highs. According to Census data released \nlast month, those in their twenties and thirties are suffering from the \nhighest unemployment rate since World War II. The enthusiasm of young \ncitizens in 2008 long ago gave way to disappointment and disaffection.\n  Our joblessness crisis is nothing short of a crisis for liberty. When \nAmerican men and women do not have jobs and opportunity, their freedom \nto make lives for themselves is eroded. Yet we are to understand that \nin the face of this historic crisis, there is no more important issue \nregarding jobs than our bilateral trade with China.\n\n  Again, I agree we need to address the issue of currency manipulation \nand our sustained and large trade deficits with China. However, let us \nbe clear that dealing with issues related to China involves only one \nbilateral trade relationship. The trade and current account problems \nfacing the United States, and the global financial, trade, and economic \nimbalances that everyone faces are not solved by addressing this one \ntrading relationship. That is one reason I will be offering an \namendment to this bill calling for multilateral and plurilateral \nnegotiations to address currency misalignment. If we are going to \nsucceed, we need to look at the big picture and work with our allies to \ncounter China's current practices. I will discuss my amendment in more \ndetail soon, but hope it will receive strong bipartisan support.\n  Our trade imbalances are not with China alone. Rather, as part of the \nproblem of saving too little, the United States has multilateral trades \nimbalances which require more action than focusing solely on one \nbilateral relationship.\n  According to recent data from the U.S. International Trade \nCommission, the United States has trade deficits with nearly 100 \ncountries. The United States saves too little, and that problem will \nnot be solved solely by passing the bill before us.\n  Make no mistake, the legislation we are considering can provide \nuseful tools for addressing concerns about China, if the administration \nactually uses the tools. But those tools alone are not sufficient. If \nwe try to address our multilateral problems by putting pressure on \nChina alone, without also attending to our lack of saving and our own \nrole in generating trade deficits with nearly 100 other countries, the \nChinese piece of the U.S. imbalance will migrate somewhere else. This \nbill is not a magic bullet to solve our problems or the problems \narising from global imbalances. And it almost surely is not the highest \npriority piece of legislation if job creation is truly our focus.\n  The United States, for its part, contributes to global imbalances by \npersistently saving too little. Following the financial crisis, which \nwas precipitated partly by large runups in household indebtedness, \nAmerican families have tightened their belts to save more and repair \ntheir own balance sheets. It is the U.S. Federal Government that has \nbeen missing in action to restore national savings, reduce our Federal \ndebt, and promote global balance.\n  Rather than repair the Federal balance sheet, the administration has \nchosen to run trillions of dollars of debt-fueled deficits and borrow \never-increasing sums from abroad, including China. And rather than \nfacing the fact that the Federal Government has a spending problem, the \nPresident is advertising and campaigning on a new American Jobs Act \nstimulus and tax hike platform containing even more spending and short-\nterm debt accumulation.\n  We are told that it will be in the interest of the American people to \nborrow more today in order to spend more on infrastructure, for \nexample. The stimulus proponents say: Interest rates are low, so let's \nramp up borrowing right now. That is the same approach the Senate took \nwhen it voted to extend and expand trade adjustment assistance. They \nignore, however, that piling trillions more onto our national credit \ncard issued by China and our other creditors moves us that much faster \ninto the company of the eurozone countries who now face default and \nelevated interest costs.\n  While Federal borrowing rates are low today, what happens when global \nmarkets tire of our profligacy and debt-financed spending and begin to \ndemand higher interest compensation? As Spain and Italy have seen \nrecently, low interest rates are not guaranteed and the interest rate \nenvironment that you face can pivot on a dime and escalate rapidly. \nBorrowing at low rates today sounds great, until you wake up tomorrow \nand are forced to refinance at more punitive rates. More debt-fueled \ngovernment spending beyond our means is sure to drive us rapidly down \nthe road to the stagnation and debt crisis we are seeing today in \nEurope.\n  Of course, the President claims his new stimulus and tax hike \nproposals are all paid for, but the payments are largely promises of \nfuture austerity. Anyone who has paid attention knows that when the \nFederal Government promises to go on a spending diet later it never \nleads to fiscal weight loss because future Congresses are not bound by \ntoday's promises.\n  It is interesting to hear the President's persistent calls for more \ndebt-fueled infrastructure spending. Presumably, given his interest in \njob creation ``right now,'' the projects he has in mind will be more \nshovel-ready than the readiness of the previous stimulus projects, \nwhich turned into something the President found so funny that he joked \nabout it. Of course, it is no joke to jobless Americans who are stuck \nwith the stimulus debt bill.\n  We heard in early September from the chairman of the President's \nCouncil on Jobs and Competitiveness that the council identified ``ten \nhigh-priority infrastructure projects based on their potential to put \nAmericans to work right away--projects that have already been funded, \nbut are being held up by regulations.''\n  The jobs council says it will work with the administration to try to \nget the projects moving. Let me repeat that: the projects ``are being \nheld up by regulations.'' This comes from the chairman of the \nPresident's own jobs council.\n  Yet when some on the other side of the aisle are reminded that \nregulations are holding back job creation, they recoil in disbelief. If \nthere are 10 large-scale infrastructure spending projects ready to go \nand already fully funded and are only being held up by regulatory \nreview lag, I urge the President to act ``right now'' to get those \nprojects underway in the interest of job creation. Make one fewer \ncampaign appearance and use that time to expedite regulatory review and \nget those projects going if, as should be the case, he believes job \ncreation is more important than politics and wishes to act on that \nbelief.\n  We have also heard the President remarking on how, from a global \ncompetitiveness perspective, the United States should borrow more today \nand spend on what he generically calls ``infrastructure,'' which, as it \nturns out, can be anything from paving a road to doling out money to \nsolar panel makers.\n\n  The President cited in his infrastructure advocacy a set of global \nrankings on infrastructure from the World Economic Forum's Global \nCompetitiveness Report. The President seemed to read the report and its \nranking of the United States as 23rd out of 139 countries for \ntransportation infrastructure competitiveness as a call for more \nspending on whatever it is he thinks of as infrastructure.\n  It appears, however, that he did not read the report in its entirety. \nIf he did, he would have noticed that the ranking is for only one of \nnine factors in the report's overall infrastructure assessment. More \nimportantly, if he had read the report, he would have noticed the \noverriding area identified as the weakest one for the United States in \nterms of eroding our global competitiveness. To quote the report \ndirectly:\n\n       A lack of macroeconomic stability continues to be the \n     United States' greatest area of weakness (ranked 87th). Prior \n     to the crisis, the United States had been building up\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\n     large macroeconomic imbalances, with repeated fiscal deficits \n     leading to burgeoning levels of public indebtedness; this has \n     been exacerbated by significant stimulus spending. In this \n     context, it is clear that mapping out a clear exit strategy \n     will be an important step in reinforcing the country's \n     competitiveness going into the future.\n\n  There you have it. The report the President data-mined to find a \nnumber to use to support more stimulus quite clearly says that \ndeclining U.S. global competitiveness has come from fiscal deficits, \nexacerbated by stimulus spending. It clearly says the solution is to \nexit from our unsustainable fiscal path. That means reining in the \nrunaway debt-fueled spending, not more spending.\n  Before turning to the legislative process on the bill before us, let \nme post a trail marker for our deliberations. The currency bill we are \nconsidering includes reliance on exchange rate models used by the \nInternational Monetary Fund. Those models allow for the macroeconomic \neffects on currency valuations of fundamental changes in policies of \ntrade partner countries. For example, if the United States engages in \nfundamental tax reform that would lead to improved growth and reduced \ndeficits and debt, the models considered in the legislation before us \nhave the ability to capture those effects.\n  The marker I wish to set here is a reminder that we should be \nsimilarly so inclined to use economic models that allow for \nmacroeconomic effects of policy changes when we choose to make \nfundamental changes to tax and spending policies. We should be as \nwilling to have our budget score keepers use economic models that allow \nfor long-run growth and macroeconomic effects of fundamental tax and \nspending reform policies as we seem to be here in this legislation to \nuse models that incorporate such effects when evaluating currency \nalignments. If it is good to use economic models that allow for an \naccounting of growth effects here, then it should be good elsewhere.\n  I also need to address the process we will follow in our \nconsideration of the currency bill before us. The bill has garnered \nbipartisan support. In the interest of promoting a truly bipartisan \neffort, which the American people would love to see, it is my hope \nthere will be balance in amendments that are allowed to be considered. \nThis bill has sound objectives, but it is not perfect. I believe \namendments from both sides of the aisle can improve the final product. \nAnd, as I mentioned earlier, I have an amendment that I believe will \nimprove this bill significantly and help us devise a long-term approach \nto dealing with currency misalignment. I hope there will be an \nopportunity for it, and others, to be considered. I hope they are not \ngoing to lock up the tree again, which is the standard practice around \nhere by the majority. This bill is an important bill, and we ought to \nbe able to amend it with important amendments.\n  The overriding objective of the legislation--job creation--is shared \nby Republicans and Democrats alike. Therefore, it is my hope that \namendments from my side of the aisle, designed to promote job growth \ntoday and in the future, will be duly considered, allowed, and duly \ndebated.\n  I look forward to consideration of the currency bill before us and a \nrobust, bipartisan process, which includes consideration of amendments \nfrom both sides to promote job creation.\n  As I have said, our Nation faces a crisis of unemployment and \njoblessness that is filled with pain today and threatens erosion of \nhuman capital and skills, which will negatively impact families and the \noverall economy for years and years to follow. Let us not have politics \nand special interests dictate what we consider to promote job creation \nand economic growth. American workers and families, many of them \nstruggling and in pain, cannot wait until the next Presidential \nelection is resolved for the Federal Government to act to promote job \ncreation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know our time expires shortly. Senator \nHatch has concluded his remarks, so I wish to speak on two other \nsubjects until Senator Leahy arrives.\n\n\n                             SSI Extension\n\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of a bill to be introduced along \nwith Senators Leahy, Gillibrand, Menendez, Franken, and Klobuchar, \ncalled the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act of 2011.\n  This bill, which the Senate is considering passing today by unanimous \nconsent, is truly unique because it accomplishes three incredibly \nimportant objectives at the same time.\n  First, it ensures that approximately 5,600 disabled refugees will not \nlose critical life-sustaining benefits that are their only safety net, \nprotecting them from homelessness, illness, and other effects of \nextreme poverty.\n  Some of the disabled refugees this bill helps are people who have \naided American troops overseas in Iraq or Afghanistan--and risked their \nlives for America's cause. Others are victims of torture or human \ntrafficking, whose injuries are so severe that they are now unable to \nsustain themselves without these benefits. The bill continues the Bush \nadministration policy of making sure this vulnerable group does not \nlose its benefits.\n  But, unlike past bills, the second key fact about this bill is that \nit is fully paid for. It is paid for by imposing a $30 fee on \nindividuals applying to enter the country through the diversity visa \nlottery program. Each year, hundreds of thousands of people apply to be \none of the 50,000 individuals allowed to emigrate to the United States. \nThe program has had great success. I have been very supportive of it. \nIt has also enriched the American fabric with immigrants from countries \nthat are not traditionally represented in the immigrant pool.\n  But, unfortunately, because applying for a ``lottery ticket'' has \nbeen traditionally free, the program has recently been compromised by \nthird parties filing applications on behalf of unknowing foreign \nnationals, who then turn around and try to extort money from these \nforeign nationals if the ticket turns out to be a ``winning ticket.'' \nThat is wrong and unfair. The State Department has told us that by \ncharging this $30 fee, we can eliminate this misconduct. So it is a \nwin-win. We get some money to pay for these refugees who we all agree \nshould be admitted here. As I said, many helped us in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and, at the same time, it does not cost us a nickel and \neliminates a scam that involves a very worthy program, the diversity \nvisas.\n\n  Finally, the third great thing about this bill is, by setting the fee \nat $30, the CBO projects we will actually reduce our deficit by $24 \nmillion. So it will help, in a small way, reduce the deficit. So the \nbill hits the trifecta: It helps a very small, targeted group of the \nmost vulnerable and needy disabled individuals whom we traditionally \nhave not abandoned, it virtually eliminates misconduct in the diversity \nvisa program, and it reduces the Federal deficit. Because it is a win-\nwin-win for all sides, I ask that my colleagues in the House take up \nand pass this bill immediately.\n  The benefits for these folks already expired on October 1. If we do \nnot act soon, we will not be able to repair the irreparable harm that \nwill be done to those most vulnerable individuals. I wish to thank my \ncosponsors and chairmen and ranking members of the relevant committees \ngoverning this bill: Senators Leahy, Grassley, Baucus, Hatch, Conrad, \nSessions, and Cornyn. I would also like to thank Senator Coburn for \nworking with me to have this bill pass and address his concerns to make \nthe bill better.\n  We have done something very good. I thank all my colleagues who have \njoined in the work on this bill.\n\n\n                   Nomination of William F. Kuntz, II\n\n  Mr. President, William F. Kuntz, II, is the nominee to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York. I wish to describe \nto my colleagues the extraordinary qualifications of Dr. Kuntz, the \nnominee to the bench of the Eastern District, whom hopefully we will \nconfirm later today.\n  Dr. Kuntz has exactly the skills, temperament, and experience to be a \nperfect addition to one of the busiest U.S. district courts in the \ncountry. Dr. Kuntz, currently a partner in the New\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\nYork office of Baker Hostetler, is a native of Harlem. He grew up in \nwhat was then called the Polo Grounds projects and went to high school \nat Fordham Prep in the South Bronx.\n  He earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard University, followed \nby a master's degree in history, a law degree, and a Ph.D. in American \nlegal history, all from Harvard--I hope no one will hold that against \nhim--and all within 11 years of arriving in Cambridge, from Harlem.\n  What an amazing man. What an American dream story. I would venture \nthat throughout this country, Dr. Kuntz has few peers, in terms of \neducation and training. But he did not use his degrees to go on to \nteach and write, a valuable career path, to be sure, but possibly not \none that would have put his skills as an advocate and his commitment to \nthe people of New York to their highest and best use.\n  Instead, Dr. Kuntz went on to log 33 years of litigation experience \nin some of New York City's finest law firms. Most impressive to me, he \nserved for 23 years as commissioner on the City Civilian Complaint \nReview Board. This independent agency oversees the investigation of \ncitizens' claims of misconduct by New York City police officers. By all \naccounts, Dr. Kuntz staked out an admirable middle ground, informed by \nhard investigative work and careful consideration of all the 5,000 \ncases that came before the board every year.\n  When my legal committee looked into his work there, he was praised by \nboth the police side and those who brought cases before the board. In \nthat kind of tempestuous situation, that is rare indeed. Dr. Kuntz's \ncommitment to public service is long and impressive. He served in \nleadership positions on the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under \nLaw, the Legal Aid Society, the New York Bar, and PLI, among others.\n  I will note that Dr. Kuntz will be filling a judicial emergency \nvacancy in the Eastern District of New York, a court that adjudicates a \nlarge share of critical cases, such as terrorism and terrorism \nfinancing, organized crime and mortgage fraud.\n  Dr. Kuntz is sorely needed and more than up for the task.

Mr. President, that would bring us to 20 minutes of 6. I \nthink there was probably an attempt to vote at 5:30. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be still divided in the regular way but the votes \nbegin at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today's consideration of six qualified \nconsensus judicial nominations is welcome. It is all too rare. I \ncommend Majority Leader Reid for pressing for Senate votes on all 27 of \nthe judicial nominees fully considered by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and awaiting final action by the Senate.\n  We have a judicial vacancy rate that stands at 11 percent. We have 95 \nvacancies on Federal courts around the country. We have to build on \ntoday's efforts, the regular consideration of nominations without \nneedless delay.\n  I was talking the other day with Bruce Cohen, who is the chief of \nstaff of the Senate Judiciary Committee--chief counsel--and somebody \nwho has had a great deal of experience working with different Senators. \nWe were talking about the fact that there has never been anything such \nas this. We usually, whether it is a Republican President, Democratic \nPresident, Republican-controlled Senate, Democratic-controlled Senate, \nwhen nominees go through the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, \nsupported by the Senators from their home State, they usually, within a \nfew days during wrap-up, are voice voted through.\n  Once in a while whoever is leader may need a vote on a Monday \nafternoon. So the next Monday afternoon one will be voted on. It is \nalways 100 to nothing.\n  Then we have people go through unanimously, supported by Republican \nand Democratic Senators, and they wait month after month after month. I \nhope we can get away from that. I hope, for the integrity of our \njudicial system, we can get away from that. But also just think of the \npersonal account that it means to the people who have been nominated. \nIf a person is a lawyer, a distinguished lawyer, they are nominated for \nthe Federal bench, everybody is going to congratulate them, saying that \nis wonderful. Then the rest of their law firm is kind of looking at \nthem, saying: Are you going to leave now? When are you going to leave? \nBecause their life is put on hold. They are probably going to take a \nsignificant cut in salary anyway. But they cannot take on new clients.\n  I hope this is probably an indication we will finally get moving.\n  The Senate will need to vote on four to six nominations judicial \nnominees a week, not just this week or next week, but throughout the \nfall if we are to make a real difference and make real progress. With a \njudicial vacancy rate that stands at 11 percent and with 95 vacancies \non Federal courts around the country, we need to build on today's \neffort with the regular consideration of nominations without needless \ndelays.\n  Among the nominees selected for Senate action today from the 27 \nawaiting final consideration is the nomination of Magistrate Judge \nJennifer Guerin Zipps of Arizona. She will fill a vacancy in Tucson \ncreated by the tragic murder of Chief Judge Roll earlier\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\nthis year. This confirmation sets the benchmark for how judicial \nnominations should be being treated. It has been little more than 70 \ndays since her nomination was sent to the Senate, and Judge Zipps has \nparticipated in a hearing, was considered by the committee and is now \nbeing confirmed by the Senate. If, on the other hand, Senate \nRepublicans had adhered to the timeframe that they have utilized during \nthe last 2 years for delaying consideration of consensus nominees, \nJudge Zipps would not be considered or confirmed until next year. I \nknow this nomination is important to Senator Kyl and I am glad to be \nable to support it and work with him to have it considered by the \nSenate. I hope that the Arizona Senators will now give consent for the \ncommittee to move forward with the nomination of Rosemary Marquez to \nfill another emergency vacancy in Arizona so that we can do more to \nhelp meet the critical needs on the Federal court in their State.\n  The judicial emergency vacancy Judge Zipps will fill is important, \njust as the action to fill the judicial emergencies in New York, Texas \nand on the Fourth Circuit that we will fill today is much needed. There \nare other nominees ready for final Senate action to fill judicial \nemergency vacancies on the Second, Fifth and Ninth Circuits and in New \nYork, Pennsylvania, Florida and Texas. Given the extensive delays in \nfilling vacancies, and the historically high level of vacancies that \ninaction on confirming President Obama's nominees has perpetuated, it \nis no surprise that so many pending nominees will fill judicial \nemergency vacancies. Of the 17 judicial nominations Republicans have \nnot consented to consider, that are stuck before the Senate, seven of \nthem would fill judicial emergency vacancies, as well.\n  I have repeatedly thanked Senator Grassley for his cooperation in \nmaking sure that the Senate Judiciary Committee regularly considers \nnominations. Regrettably, our work has not been matched on the Senate \nfloor, where the refusal by the Republican leadership to promptly \nconsider consensus nominations has contributed to the longest period of \nhistorically high vacancy rates in the last 35 years. The six nominees \nwe consider today are double the number allowed to be considered since \nthe August recess. Such unnecessary and unexplained delays are wrong, \nand are harmful to the Federal judiciary and to the American people who \ndepend on it.\n  Only one of the nominations which the Republican leadership has \nagreed to consider will fill a vacancy on our courts of appeals. This \nis in spite of the fact that four circuit court nominees, all for \njudicial emergency vacancies and all unanimously voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee, are awaiting final Senate action. The nomination \nof Judge Henry Floyd of South Carolina to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy the Fourth Circuit is finally being considered after a wait of \nnearly 5 months. This is only the fifth circuit court nomination the \nSenate has been allowed to consider this entire Congress. This stands \nin sharp contrast to the 17 circuit court nominations in 17 months that \nwe confirmed when I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002 \nand President Bush was in the White House.\n  The nomination of Judge Floyd is another example of how President \nObama is working with home State Republican Senators to select a \nqualified, consensus nominee. Judge Floyd received the highest possible \nrating from the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary and has the support, as do all the nominees awaiting \nfinal Senate action, of both of his home State Senators, in this case \ntwo Republican Senators. A Federal District Court Judge for the \nDistrict of South Carolina since 2003, Judge Floyd previously served as \na State court judge for 11 years, and before that he spent 19 years in \nprivate practice. It is no surprise that his nomination was reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee. What is disappointing is that \nit has taken almost 5 months for Republicans to consent to Senate \nconsideration of this nomination. The people of South Carolina and the \nother states of the Fourth Circuit--Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, \nand North Carolina--should have had a circuit court judge and not a \njudicial emergency vacancy for the last several months.\n  They are not alone. There are qualified, consensus nominees who were \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee now on the Senate \ncalendar to fill judicial emergency vacancies on the Second, Fifth and \nNinth Circuits. Those judicial emergency vacancies affect the people of \nVermont, Connecticut and New York; Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas; \nand Washington, Oregon, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona and \nCalifornia. These are not controversial nominees. The Senate should be \nable to take up and confirm nominees like Stephen Higginson of \nLouisiana, nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy on the Fifth \nCircuit with the support of his home State Senators, one a Democrat, \nand the other a Republican. His nomination was reported unanimously \nnearly 3 months ago. The Senate should be able to take up and confirm \nthe nomination of Christopher Droney of Connecticut, nominated to a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the Second Circuit, who has the support \nof both of his home State Senators, Senator Blumenthal, a Democrat, and \nSenator Lieberman, an Independent. The Senate should be able to take up \nand confirm the nomination of Morgan Christen of Alaska, nominated to a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit, who has the support of \nboth of her home State Senators, Senator Murkowski, a Republican, and \nSenator Begich, a Democrat. Each of these circuit nominees received the \nunanimous support of all Democrats and all Republicans serving on the \nJudiciary Committee. Each is being delayed from filling a judicial \nemergency vacancy and serving the people of their State and their \ncircuit.\n\n  Republicans who will not consent to votes on these nominations should \nexplain to the people of the many States that comprise the Second \nCircuit--Vermont's circuit--and the Fifth and Ninth Circuits why those \nimportant Federal appeals courts are short on badly needed judges who \ncould be confirmed today.\n  The Senate's Republican leadership continues to delay votes on \nqualified, consensus district court nominations, as well, leading to \nthe backlog we have today of over two dozen judicial nominations \npending on the Senate's Executive Calendar--nearly half of them to fill \njudicial emergency vacancies. They continue to refuse to consent to \nvotes on 17 of the 27 nominations and have unnecessarily delayed votes \non all of them for months.\n  Millions and millions of Americans are directly affected by this \nobstruction. More than half of all Americans--nearly 170 million--live \nin districts or circuits that have a vacancy that would be filled today \nif the Senate would act. More than half of all States--26--are served \nby courts that have nominations currently pending on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar. The Republican leadership should explain to the \nmillions of Americans in these States why they will not vote. They \nshould explain to the people of New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, \nWyoming, Alaska, California, and Delaware why they will not consent to \nvotes today on qualified, consensus nominees to fill vacancies on the \nFederal trial courts in their States.\n  These 170 million Americans should not have to wait additional weeks \nand months for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and ensure \nthe ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans \naround the country. They should not have to bear the brunt of having \ntoo few judges available to do the work of the Federal courts. At a \ntime when judicial vacancies have remained at historically high levels \nfor over 2 years, these needless delays perpetuate the judicial \nvacancies crisis that Chief Justice Roberts wrote of last December and \nthat the President, the Attorney General, bar associations and chief \njudges around the country have urged us to join together to end. The \nSenate can and should be doing a better job working to ensure the \nability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans across \nthe country.\n  We could easily act today to improve this situation dramatically and \nalleviate the crisis. Of the 17 nominations the Republicans continue to \nobstruct, 15 were reported by the committee unanimously. All of these \nconsensus nominees have been favorably reported after a fair but \nthorough process, including extensive background material\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\non each nominee and the opportunity for all Senators on the committee, \nDemocratic and Republican, to meet with and question the nominees. They \nhave a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated \nfaithfulness to the Constitution. These are the kinds of consensus \nnominees that in past years would have been considered and confirmed \nwithin days or weeks of being reported, not delayed for weeks and \nmonths.\n  During the first years of the Bush and Clinton administrations, we \nwere able to reduce vacancies significantly by confirming judges. The \nvacancies that had numbered over 100 early in those administrations \nwere dramatically reduced by this juncture. By early October in the \nthird year of the Bush administration judicial vacancies had been \nreduced to 46. By early October in the third year of the Clinton \nadministration they had been reduced to 57. In contrast, the judicial \nvacancies now in October of the third year of the Obama administration \nstand at 95, with a vacancy rate of 11 percent. That is a vacancy rate \nthat is more than double where it stood at this point in President \nBush's third year.\n  Rather than coming down as they have in the past with Republican and \nDemocratic presidents, Federal judicial vacancies have remained near or \nabove 90 for more than 2 years. As the Congressional Research Service \nconfirmed in a recent report, this is a historically high level of \nvacancies, and this is now the longest period of historically high \nvacancy rates on the Federal judiciary in the last 35 years.\n  I hope that we can come together to return to regular order in the \nconsideration of nominations as we have on the Judiciary Committee. The \nrefusal by Republican leadership to come to regular time agreements for \nthe Senate to vote on nominations continues to put our progress--our \npositive action--at risk. It does no good for the Judiciary Committee \nto vote on judicial nominees if the Senate does not act to confirm \nthem. The hard work of the Judiciary Committee is being squandered. \nWhen the Senate is prevented from acting, as it has been with respect \nto 17 of the 27 judicial nominations left pending before it, the \nvacancies persist and the American people are not being served.\n  Last month, a Republican Senator was in error when he told the Senate \nand the American people that the Senate had already confirmed 67 \narticle III judges this year. Had we, the Federal judicial vacancies \nwould not remain at crisis levels. I wish he had been correct, but \nsadly he was not. At the time, only 38 nominees had been confirmed. \nEven if Senate Republicans were to abandon their obstructionist tactics \nand allow votes on all 27 of the judicial nominations currently \nawaiting final Senate action, we would still fall short of his \nproclamation.\n  In fact, even after an additional six confirmations today, the Senate \nwill have confirmed only 44 judicial nominations, less even than last \nyear. The first year of the Obama administration, Republicans would \nonly allow 12 judicial nominees to be confirmed. That was the lowest \ntotal in more than 50 years. After last year, the total number of \njudicial nominees allowed to be confirmed was the lowest total for the \nfirst 2 years of an administration in 35 years. Last year, the Senate \nadjourned and left 19 judicial nominees without final action. Most had \nto be renominated again this year. The last of those nominees was not \nconfirmed until June 21 of this year. Last year's stalling took us an \nextra 6 months to remedy. Accordingly, the Senate's confirmation of \njudicial nominees who had their hearings and were considered by the \ncommittee this year will total only 27 after the confirmations today.\n  Some seek to justify their continuing failure to take serious action \nto address the vacancies crisis by recalling selected instances where \nDemocrats opposed some of President Bush's most controversial nominees. \nThat is no justification for the across-the-board stalling on consensus \njudicial nominees. And this ignores the fact that we were able to make \nreal progess in those years to confirm judicial nominees and fill \nvacancies. We confirmed 100 judges in the 17 months I chaired the \nJudiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002. The Senate will not confirm the \n100th of President Obama's circuit and district court judges until \ntoday, during the 33rd month of the Obama administration, nearly twice \nas long.\n  At the end of President Bush's first 4 years in office, the Senate \nhad confirmed 205 of his judicial nominees. We have a long way to go to \nreach that total before the end of next year. At this point in the \npresidency of George W. Bush, 162 Federal circuit and district court \njudges had been confirmed. On October 3 of the third year of President \nClinton's administration, 163 Federal circuit and district court judges \nhad been confirmed. By comparison, after today we will have confirmed \nonly 104 of President Obama's circuit and district court nominees. To \nmatch the total at end of President Bush's first term the Senate will \nneed to confirm more than 100 Federal circuit and district court judges \nduring the next year. That means doubling to tripling the pace at which \nthe Senate has been acting.\n  We can and must do better to address the serious judicial vacancies \ncrisis on Federal courts around the country that has persisted for over \n2 years. We can and must do better for the nearly 170 million Americans \nbeing made to suffer by these unnecessary delays.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am happy to support Nannette Jolivette-\nBrown's nomination to the Eastern District of Louisiana. She is an \nexperienced, real world practitioner with strong ties to the Louisiana \nlegal community. I was very pleased when the president nominated my \nformer classmate at Tulane Law School to the Federal bench. She \npossesses a wonderful, warm, calm personality that is perfectly suited \nto the right demeanor a judge should have.\n  Nannette is currently serving as the city attorney for New Orleans, a \nchallenging position that is tasked with providing legal advice to all \ncity officials and departments in addition to representing New Orleans \nin all legal matters. She has handled this responsibility well and her \nexperience as a public servant will be an asset to her new position as \na Federal judge.\n  Throughout her career in private practice, Ms. Brown established \nherself as an expert in environmental law. Additionally, she has taught \nlaw at Loyola University New Orleans, the Southern University Law \nCenter, and as a teaching fellow at Tulane Law School.\n  Nannette Brown will bring a wealth of both public and private sector \nexperience to the Federal bench, as she has practiced, taught, and \nadministered the law throughout her career. She is exceptionally \nqualified to serve as a Federal judge.\n  I believe that the Constitution is clear that judges must interpret \nthe law and not legislate from the bench. Accordingly, we have a \nresponsibility to confirm judges who respect the rule of law and will \npractice judicial restraint. I am confident that Nannette Brown will be \njust such a judge. I urge my fellow Senators to unanimously support her \nconfirmation today.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am honored to support the nomination of \nNancy Torresen to be a U.S. District Judge for Maine. She is eminently \nwell qualified to be confirmed. She has led an exemplary career of \npublic service, culminating in her current position as an assistant \nU.S. attorney.\n  Ms. Torresen graduated from Hope College cum laude in 1981 and \nreceived her law degree cum laude in 1987 from the University of \nMichigan Law School where she was executive editor of the Law Review. \nAfter graduation, she came to Maine to serve as a law clerk to the \nextraordinarily well-respected Maine Judge Conrad Cyr. From 1988 to \n1990, she worked at the law firm Williams and Connolly here in \nWashington.\n  In 1990, she had the good judgment to return to Maine when she became \nan assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Maine and initially \nhandled civil matters involving Federal agencies.\n  In 1994, she was assigned to the appellate section of the criminal \ndivision of the Maine attorney general's office where she was \nresponsible for representing the State in appeals of serious violent \ncrime convictions.\n  In 2001, Ms. Torresen returned to the U.S. attorney's office where \nshe has been responsible for investigating and prosecuting Federal \ncrimes in the northern half of Maine.\n  I am impressed by her dedication and passion for the law. I also \nappreciate her 21-year long commitment to public\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\nservice. She has remarked that she is proudest of her criminal \nprosecution efforts because of the urgent need to protect the public \nfrom violent criminals and her desire not to let down the victims.\n  One of her more significant cases was the recent prosecution of a \nmultistate bank robber dubbed the ``Burly Bandit.'' From April through \nJuly, Robert Ferguson robbed more than 10 banks and credit unions \nthroughout New England. The spree ended with a robbery of Bangor \nSavings Bank in July, and on October 1 of last year Mr. Ferguson \npleaded guilty in U.S. district court in Bangor to 11 counts of bank \nrobbery. Maine's U.S. attorney recognized Ms. Torresen for her \noutstanding work in coordinating the prosecution in the six States.\n  Except for a brief stint in private practice, Ms. Torresen's entire \ncareer has been that of a dedicated public servant. She is well \nrespected in the legal community and was rated ``unanimously well-\nqualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n  Let me share one of my many conversations with her colleagues in the \nMaine legal community. Tim Woodcock is a well-known attorney in Bangor, \nwhose comments are very typical of what I heard when I called and asked \npeople what they thought of Ms. Torresen. Tim said that he regards her \nas ``highly professional, extremely capable, tough, but fair and is a \nstrong advocate for the adherence by law enforcement to all legal \nrequirements.''\n  These are all qualities that we should look for in our judicial \nnominees. Ms. Torresen's work as a prosecutor in both the Federal and \nState judicial systems, her integrity, her temperament, and her respect \nfor precedent make her well qualified to serve as Maine's next Federal \njudge.\n  Maine has a long, proud history of superb federal judges, and I \nbelieve that Ms. Torresen will continue that tradition if confirmed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nMagistrate Judge Jennifer Guerin Zipps to the Federal district court.\n  At the outset, I would like to point out that Judge Zipps has been \nnominated to fill the seat once occupied by Chief Judge John Roll, who \nwas, of course, murdered earlier this year during the same attack that \nleft Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords gravely wounded. On every level, \nthis was a tragic loss for Arizona and the judiciary. John Roll was \nknown for his fairness to those who appeared before him, plaintiffs and \ndefendants alike. As chief judge, he was a tireless advocate for all \nArizonans, working to ensure that the federal courts in our state were \nable to handle growing caseloads while simultaneously seeking swift and \nfair justice for all.\n  The day we lost Chief Judge Roll, we lost an outstanding jurist, a \ndedicated public servant, and a great Arizonan. Judge Zipps has big \nshoes to fill, but I am confident she is up to the challenge, and that \nshe will serve with honor and distinction.\n  I would like to say a few words about the background of Judge Zipps. \nHer qualifications are quite strong. Judge Zipps graduated from the \nUniversity of Arizona and from Georgetown University Law Center. After \nlaw school, she clerked on the Ninth Circuit for Judge Canby and then \nworked for 4 years at the law firm of Molloy, Jones & Donahue. She \nspent the next decade as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of Arizona. She rose to be chief of \nthe Civil Division and for the last three years was the Chief Assistant \nin the office. She earned numerous awards, including one for leadership \nand one for her performance as the civil chief. It is easy to see why \nJudge Zipps was awarded the ABA's highest rating: Unanimous ``Well \nQualified.''\n  Judge Zipps has served as a magistrate on the Federal district court \nin Arizona since 2005. She has a distinguished record that has earned \nthe respect of the legal community in Arizona. With her judicial \nexperience, Judge Zipps will be able to hit the ground running and help \ntackle one of the heaviest caseloads in the Federal judiciary.\n  Perhaps most telling is the high regard in which Judge Zipps is held \nby her colleagues on the district court. They come from different \nbackgrounds and were appointed by Presidents of both parties, but they \nall speak highly of her.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Henry \nFloyd to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit \ndespite my strong disagreement with his ruling in an important case \nthat involved our national security. As a Federal district court judge \nin 2005, Judge Floyd ruled that the President of the United States did \nnot have the authority to detain as an enemy combatant Jose Padilla, \nthe so-called Dirty Bomber, because Mr. Padilla was an American citizen \nwho was apprehended in the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit reversed Judge Floyd in that case. The Fourth \nCircuit noted, correctly in my view, that under the plain language of \nthe Authorization for Use of Military Force and the plurality opinion \nof the Supreme Court in Hamdi versus Rumsfeld, the place of Mr. \nPadilla's eventual capture was immaterial to the authority of the \nCommander-in-Chief to detain him as an enemy combatant. Mr. Padilla had \nassociated himself with al-Qaida in Afghanistan during hostilities \nagainst U.S. forces. Mr. Padilla then fled to Pakistan, whereupon he \nmet with Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who directed him to travel to the \nUnited States to blow up apartment buildings. Mr. Padilla was in the \nUnited States at the time of his capture in order to carry out this \nmission. As a result, the Fourth Circuit correctly held that the \nPresident could properly designate and detain Mr. Padilla as an enemy \ncombatant. Judge Floyd erred in adopting a rule that would, in essence, \nallow enemy combatants to escape military jurisdiction if they simply \nsucceed in entering--or re-entering--the United States--and in Mr. \nPadilla's case, for the purpose of conducting additional and lethal \noperations against the United States and its citizens.\n  Judge Floyd has had an accomplished legal career, and has served with \ndistinction as a state and federal judge for nearly two decades. \nBecause of this lengthy and distinguished judicial record, I supported \nhis nomination to the Fourth Circuit, despite my serious disagreement \nwith his ruling in the Padilla case.\n\n\n                          Vermont Devastation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the devastating \nflooding in Vermont but also our recovery. Last week, my wife Marcelle \nand I probably drove 400 miles around the State of Vermont--inside the \nState. We are a small State. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows \nhow in small States one can go from one end to the other fairly \nquickly. But we crisscrossed the State over a period of a little over 1 \nweek, a lot of the time just the two of us in the car. We would drive \naround and say thank you to volunteers.\n  Some of the things we saw were so touching. People who had lost \neverything were helping others and vice versa. The spirit is wonderful. \nThe reality is, our little State, the State where both my wife and I \nwere born, has been hurt in a way we have not seen in our lifetime.\n  I have talked about these inspiring actions of Vermonters. One of the \nthings we saw is some of the worst damage caused by the storm has been \nto the houses and mobile homes and apartments, where Vermonters had \nbuilt their lives. They had made their homes, had become part of the \ncommunity. Their kids go to school. They are the fabric of the \ncommunity.\n  We have seen entire mobile home developments washed away. Where homes \nonce stood, now lies a path of damage and destruction and heartbreak. \nLook at the horrific flooding we have right here--suddenly no roads \nwhere there were roads. Look at the forefront of this picture--a house \ncollapsed in on itself, children's toys on what might have been a \nplayground at one time that is now devastated. I had people tell me: We \nlost everything. Then, in tears: We lost our wedding album. We lost the \npictures of our children when they graduated from high school. We lost \npictures of their baptism or their bar mitzvah.\n  I mean, it tears one apart because they have lost not only their \nhomes, they have lost part of their memories.\n  I commend my staff both in Washington and in Vermont, because they\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\nhave worked sometimes literally around the clock--weekends, evenings, \ndays--to help. They have seen firsthand the ruin and pain delivered by \nthis disaster. They have seen it with their eyes and in the tearful \neyes of the families around the State. Over the sounds of generators \npowering sump pumps and heavy equipment removing debris, we have had \ncountless conversations with people as they stared at foundations--\nempty foundations--that once held their homes; as they dug toxic muck \nout of their basements and shops; and as volunteers helped with pulling \ndown wet drywall, in a race against the onset of mold.\n  Most of these conversations begin with memories of fast-rising water \nand death-defying rescues. In Northfield--a town a few miles from where \nI live--dozens of homes along the peaceful Dog River were flooded with \nas much as 6 feet of water. One homeowner who escaped the rising waters \nby canoe fears the insurance and FEMA assistance will not be enough to \nhelp him restore his home, which is part of his life. Like many of the \nresidents of his Water Street neighborhood, he is left wondering \nwhether rebuilding is possible or even worth the effort.\n  In Brattleboro, which is down in the southeast corner of our State \nalong the Connecticut River, and which is a boundary between Vermont \nand New Hampshire, the Brattleboro Housing Authority lost 60 units of \nhousing. They put families in hotels, on their friends' couches, and \nspread throughout the region, as the housing authority tries \ndesperately to fix what is lost. I saw a lot of that damage. I went \nthere with the Governor and with the head of our Vermont National \nGuard. I saw it.\n  In Roxsbury--a beautiful town--one family along a peaceful brook that \nis normally about 1 foot wide was forced to their roof as floodwaters \nrose, and the brook became a raging rapid more than 20 feet across and \n6 feet deep.\n  In Duxbury--the next town over from mine--in Quechee, in Berlin, and \nin nearly a dozen other towns, mobile home parks quickly became \nsubmerged. These homes are especially vulnerable to flood damage and \nare easily destroyed by a few feet of water. These are areas where they \nhave never seen a few feet of water, and suddenly it was there.\n  Last week, in Woodstock, I visited a mobile home park where, on the \nnight of the flood, the entire community crowded onto a small mound in \nthe middle of the park awaiting rescue, watching as their homes were \nbeing destroyed. Marcelle and I stood on that mound. It was a beautiful \nfall day. We looked down and you could see everything that had been \ntorn up. You could see the gouges and all the damage. I wondered, how \ncould somebody stay in there? Honestly, as the houses were destroyed \nand they watched that water come up, they probably thought if it comes \nup any farther, we are going to die.\n  Just 1 week after the flooding, FEMA estimated that more than 900 \nhomes in Vermont had suffered damage. Today, that number continues to \ngrow, and families who found safety and comfort in their homes before \nIrene now find themselves living in temporary homes, in shelters and \nhotels, while winter is quickly, quietly approaching.\n  Our small State's ability to build new homes depends greatly on \nsupport from Federal safety net programs, such as the emergency \ncommunity development block grant funding that I was proud to support \nincluded in the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill. While this \nemergency funding is a first step in addressing the urgent housing \nneeds of States such as Vermont that have been struck by natural \ndisasters, we know that much more will be needed to help our decimated \ntowns and communities and their citizens get back on their feet.\n  Housing authorities need section 8 choice vouchers to provide relief \nto low-income renters permanently displaced, and they need the \nflexibility to make use of the few available units of government-\nsubsidized housing without the burden of stringent income-eligibility \nrequirements. To some, this sounds like numbers, but it is very \nimportant to the people who depend upon them.\n  I am proud that in the Senate, on the Appropriations Committee over \nthe past several weeks, we have been working so hard and we have been \nable to make prompt, significant, and bipartisan strides toward \naddressing the emerging disaster recovery needs in States such as \nVermont, New Jersey, and North Carolina. Actually, 48 States face \nemergency disaster needs this year.\n  I remember the stories my parents and grandparents told me of \nflooding long before I was born in Vermont. I am 71 years old, but I \nhave not seen damage and destruction of this magnitude in Vermont in my \nlifetime. Other States were also hit by Irene and are stretched to the \nlimit. Just as victims of past disasters throughout the country were \nable to rely on fellow Americans in their times of need--including \nVermont--so should Vermonters be able to count on a helping hand when \nthey need it most. It is regrettable and disappointing--actually \nincomprehensible--that some in Congress continue to insist that \nassistance can only come at the cost of other Federal programs that are \nrelied upon by the American people. Do we take it out of education or \nmedical research or job creation? Do we rob Peter to pay Paul? Some of \nthese same voices have had no problem with spending hundreds of \nbillions of borrowed dollars on wars waged overseas and on rebuilding \ncommunities in Iraq and Afghanistan. They will borrow the money to \nrebuild roads and villages and homes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but they \nare going to apply a different standard to recovery efforts that are \ndesperately needed for Americans here at home in America. It is Alice \nin Wonderland. An old Vermonter said to me: You know, Pat, we give them \nmoney in Iraq and Afghanistan to build homes and bridges and roads, and \nthen they blow them up. If we build them here in America, we will take \ncare of them and we will use them. I could give a 10-hour speech on the \nfloor on those two sentences, summing up what I have heard from \neverybody. I don't care what their political background is.\n  Now is not the time to ask Americans to choose between helping \nvictims of a disaster and funding for cancer research, equipment for \nfirst responders, or job-creating programs. We need to come together as \na country, as we always have in the past, to pass an emergency disaster \nrelief bill for our States in their time of need.\n  The Senate has answered the call by passing critical disaster relief \nlegislation. It is time for the House to do the same and let the \nvictims of Hurricane Irene start rebuilding their homes. As they \nrebuild their homes, they will rebuild their lives. They will rebuild \ntheir lives and they will rebuild our communities. When they rebuild \nour communities, they rebuild our State. We are part of the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, with the time equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will confirm six more \nof President Obama's judicial nominees. Four of these vacancies have \nbeen deemed to be judicial emergencies. With these votes, we will have \nconfirmed over 44 percent of the judicial nominees submitted by \nPresident Obama during this Congress, and 66 percent of all his \njudicial nominees.\n  As I have stated, the confirmation of executive and judicial \nappointments is one of the highest responsibilities of the Senate. It \nis a duty I take seriously. It is not, as some have suggested--a pro \nforma process. We are not here to merely rubberstamp the President's \nnominees. Sometimes that process takes a little time. It is the \nSenate's right and duty to review thoroughly the record, \nqualifications, and temperament of nominees. Above all, the process is \nto be treated with respect and with dignity. This is important for the \nnominees, for the Senate, and for public confidence in our \nconstitutional process.\n  So I was disturbed to read recent news reports regarding what was \ndescribed as an induction ceremony in the Northern District of \nCalifornia for\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\nJudge Edward Chen. I believe, at this event, Judge Chen showed \ndisrespect to the Senate and to the confirmation process. I regret that \nI would have to spend any time on this, and take away from the \nconfirmation of the pending nominees. But there are important points \nthat need to be addressed to protect our process and our members.\n  The Senate confirmed Judge Chen last May by a 52-46 vote. Needless to \nsay, he was not a consensus nominee. Among the concerns about this \nnomination was Judge Chen's judicial philosophy, his willingness to \nadopt the ``empathy standard,'' and concern that he would not set aside \nhis personal views--largely shaped by his long association with the \nACLU. Remarks reportedly made at this recent event indicate our \nconcerns were valid.\n  I have not seen a transcript of the event, but an article entitled \n``Chen Toasted, Republicans Roasted'' makes this look more like a \npolitical rally rather than a judicial event. Chief Judge Ware, in \ncommenting on Judge Chen's confirmation quipped, ``It made me wonder if \nJudge Chen should be running for political office.'' That is what many \nof us thought was more appropriate for Judge Chen, rather than \nappointment as a Federal judge.\n  The news article describes remarks made by Judge Chen, which I can \nonly describe as mocking one of our members, Senator Sessions. This is \ndistasteful, if not ironic. It was only after a personal appeal by \nSenator Feinstein to Senator Sessions that the vote on Judge Chen went \nforward. Senator Sessions agreed to that vote and pressed other Members \nto let the vote proceed. If the press accounts are accurate, I believe \nJudge Chen owes an apology to Senator Sessions.\n  Judge Chen went on to again embrace his ACLU background, stating, \n``Having the ACLU in your DNA is not a disease, it's an honor.'' As I \nhave said before, Judge Chen's advocacy on behalf of the ACLU is not \ndisqualifying, by itself. But I have to wonder about the impartiality \nof Judge Chen. More importantly, what are potential litigants appearing \nbefore Judge Chen to think. If the ACLU is an opposing litigant, is \nthere any way to think Judge Chen can be fair and impartial. I would \nthink mandatory recusal would be required in any ACLU case coming \nbefore him.\n  Federal Judges must abide by the code of conduct for United States \nJudges. I will withhold judgment on whether or not Judge Chen violated \nthose canons, but in my opinion he clearly went too far--particularly \nwith regard to the requirement to uphold the integrity of the \njudiciary, to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in \nall activities, and to refrain from political activity. I hope Judge \nChen realizes the important responsibility he has and acts accordingly \nin the future. I also hope this is a lesson to other nominees--that \nthey treat this process with respect, even after confirmation and \nappointment.\n  I have been working throughout this Congress to confirm consensus \nnominees. I continue to remind my colleagues of the progress we have \nmade. With a hearing in the Judiciary Committee scheduled for tomorrow, \n85 percent of President Obama's judicial nominees will have received a \nhearing. At this point in President Bush's presidency, only 77 percent \nhad been afforded a hearing.\n  Not only have we processed a higher percentage of nominees, but we \nhave done it in shorter times. President Obama's circuit court nominees \nhave only had to wait, on average, 66 days for a hearing. President \nBush's circuit court nominees were forced to wait 247 days. In fact, we \nwill be hearing from a Fourth Circuit nominee tomorrow after only 26 \ndays in committee. None of President Bush's circuit court nominees were \nafforded a hearing that quickly. President Bush's Fourth Circuit \nnominees were particularly treated in a harsh manner. My friends on the \nother side of the aisle allowed four qualified and consensus nominees \nto languish at a time when the Fourth Circuit was one-quarter vacant.\n  President Obama's district court nominees have also received better \ntreatment. On average, they have only waited 79 days for a hearing. \nPresident Bush's district court nominees waited 247 days. These \nnominees are also being reported out of committee at a quicker pace as \nwell. On average, President Obama's circuit and district court nominees \nhave been reported more than 66 days faster than President Bush's.\n  All in all, we have taken positive action on 85 percent of President \nObama's judicial nominees this Congress. Even though I am proud of this \nprogress, I must note, I will continue to focus on quality confirmed \nover quantity confirmed.\n  Shortly, we will be voting on Henry Floyd, who is nominated to the \nappeals court for the Fourth Circuit. This is President Obama's fifth \nnominee to be confirmed to the Fourth Circuit alone. President Bush's \nnominee to the Fourth Circuit from South Carolina, Steve Matthews, did \nnot receive the same treatment. In fact, he went 484 days without so \nmuch as a hearing, let alone an up-or-down vote. Not only that, he was \nblocked from being considered. I would note the seat to which he was \nnominated was subsequently filled by a nominee from North Carolina, \nrather than South Carolina where the vacancy arose.\n  Another vacancy we will be voting on tonight is the District of \nArizona seat held by the late Judge Roll before his tragic and untimely \ndeath on January 8, 2011. The entire judicial community felt this great \nloss. After Judge Roll's murder, I repeatedly implored the \nadministration to focus on filling this seat as quickly as possible. It \nwas deemed to be a judicial emergency instantly. However, it took over \n5 months for the administration to nominate Judge Jennifer Guerin Zipps \nto the seat, even though she was a sitting magistrate judge. Since the \nPresident took his time in submitting a nomination, I felt it \nappropriate to work with the chairman to move this nomination through \nin an expeditious manner. Nominated in late June of this year, Judge \nZipps received her hearing a mere 34 days later. Judge Zipps was \nreported to the floor shortly after we returned from the August recess \nand I am happy we have continued this fast pace and are confirming her \nto a lifetime position today.\n\n  In addition to Judge Floyd and Judge Zipps, we will confirm Nannette \nJolivette Brown to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana; Nancy Torresen to be United States District \nJudge for the District of Maine; William Francis Kuntz to be United \nStates District Judge for the Eastern District of New York; and Marina \nGarcia Marmolejo to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas.\n  I am pleased to support each of these nominees. I thank them for \ntheir public service and congratulate them on their prior \naccomplishments and confirmation today.\n  I would like to say a few words about each of the nominees.\n  Henry F. Floyd, is nominated to be a circuit judge for the Fourth \nCircuit. This seat has been deemed to be a judicial emergency. Mr. \nFloyd is currently a U.S. district court judge for the District of \nSouth Carolina. He was nominated to the bench by President George W. \nBush in 2003, and has sat by designation on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fourth Circuit several times.\n  Prior to joining the bench, Judge Floyd was elected by the South \nCarolina General Assembly to serve as a circuit court judge for the \nThirteenth Judicial Circuit in 1992.\n  He began his legal career in private practice, first as a solo \npractitioner and eventually forming the law firm of Floyd & Welmaker, \nwhich then merged with Acker & Acker. He focused on civil, criminal and \ndomestic litigation as well as trust and commercial law. He also served \nas an attorney for Pickens County while maintaining his full-time law \npartnership. Judge Floyd is a graduate from Wofford College and \nreceived a Juris Doctorate from the University of South Carolina. It \nwas during his second year of law school when Judge Floyd was elected \nto the South Carolina House of Representative, serving three terms \nuntil 1978.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated Judge \nFloyd with a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating.\n  Nannette Jolivette Brown is nominated to the Eastern District of \nLouisiana. Ms. Brown currently serves as city attorney for the city of \nNew Orleans, where she represents the city as its chief legal officer. \nPrior to that, Ms. Brown was in private practice, working on real \nestate, environmental, personal\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\ninjury, insurance, commercial and business law. She taught a number of \ncourses at Southern University Law Center, and was a clinical professor \nat Loyola University.\n  From 1994 to 1996, Ms. Brown served as the Director of Sanitation for \nNew Orleans. She was also a teaching fellow at Tulane Law School. Ms. \nBrown is a graduate from the University of Southwestern Louisiana and \nreceived her J.D. and L.L.M from Tulane Law School.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated Ms. \nBrown with a unanimous ``Qualified'' rating.\n  Nancy Torresen is nominated to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of Maine. Since 2001, Ms. Torresen has served in the \ncriminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of \nMaine. She has investigated and prosecuted Federal crimes in the \nnorthern half of the district.\n  From 1994 to 2001, the Department of Justice detailed Ms. Torresen to \nthe Maine Department of the Attorney General Criminal Division in the \nAppellate Section. In this position, Ms. Torresen represented the state \nof Maine in appeals of serious violent crime convictions.\n  From 1990 to 1994, Ms. Torresen served as an Assistant United States \nAttorney for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maine. She represented a \nvariety of federal agencies in litigation involving medical \nmalpractice, employment and discrimination cases.\n  She began her legal career as a law clerk with the Honorable Conrad \nK. Cyr, of the United States District Court for the District of Maine. \nIn 1988, she joined Williams and Connolly as an associate, working on \nmedical malpractice, libel, and contract disputes. Ms. Torresen is a \ngraduate from Hope College with a B.A. and from the University of \nMichigan School Of Law with a juris doctorate.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously \nrated Ms. Torresen as ``Well Qualified.''\n  William Francis Kuntz, II, is nominated to the Eastern District of \nNew York. This seat also has been deemed to be a judicial emergency. \nSince 1986, he has been a partner with a number of private law firms. \nWhile he has focused his practice on commercial litigation, he has \nrepresented financial services institutions, and large industrial \nentities.\n  From 1987 through 2010, Mr. Kuntz was appointed by Mayors Koch, \nDinkins, Giuliani and Bloomberg, and confirmed by the New York City \nCouncil, to serve on the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board, \nCCRB. As a commissioner, he has reviewed thousands of complaints filed \nby citizens against New York City police officers. Mr. Kuntz has taught \ncourses in American Legal History at Brooklyn Law School.\n  Mr. Kuntz received his bachelor of arts, a master of arts, a juris \ndoctorate, and a Ph.D from Harvard University.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously \nrated Mr. Kuntz as ``Well Qualified.''\n  Marina Garcia Marmolejo, is nominated to the Southern District of \nTexas. This is another judicial emergency seat. Ms. Marmolejo is \ncurrently a partner with Reid Davis LLP., where she has been focusing \non complex commercial cases. Prior to this, she served as Of Counsel \nfor two firms, working on complex Federal and State criminal defense \nmatters, public corruption matters, criminal tax fraud, health care \nfraud, and mortgage fraud.\n  In 1999, Ms. Marmolejo worked briefly for the law offices of Jesus M. \nDominguez before becoming an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas.

As I mentioned, this seat has been deemed \nto be a judicial emergency. Judge Zipps has served as a U.S. magistrate \njudge since 2005. Prior to her serving on the bench, Judge Zipps served \nas an assistant U.S. attorney. While in that role, Judge Zipps was \npromoted to chief of the civil division.

The ABA Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary has rated Judge Zipps unanimously ``Well \nQualified.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak on two topics, briefly, \nthe nomination of Judge Henry Floyd for the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, and the motion to proceed on China's currency.\n  First, Judge Henry Floyd has been nominated by President Obama to \nserve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, VA. He has a \nlot of bipartisan support from South Carolina. He was nominated by \nPresident Bush to be a district court judge. He served as a State court \njudge before that, and he has a distinguished record as a State and \nFederal jurist. He is an outstanding choice by the President to serve \non the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I have known Henry Floyd for many years. I have practiced law with \nhim. I have appeared before him as a State judge and have followed his \ncareer. He is unanimously rated as well qualified to proceed to the \nFourth Circuit. He has an outstanding legal background, great \ntemperament, and is one of the most qualified district court judges in \nSouth Carolina. He will serve the people of the Fourth Judicial Circuit \nwell on the court of appeals. He has the kind of intellect and common \nsense I think most people in this part of the country will appreciate \nhaving on the court.\n  I want to thank the Obama administration, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote for this well-qualified, fine man to go to the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. He has a lot of bipartisan support at home. Everybody \nwho knows Judge Floyd is a big fan--right, left, and center.\n\n\n                  China's Currency Exchange Practices\n\n  The issue after this vote is whether the Senate should proceed to \ndebate legislation I have authored with Senator Schumer and others \ndealing with the currency exchange practices of the Communist \ndictatorship of China. I have been involved in this for almost 7 years. \nWe did a sense-of-the-Senate resolution back in 2004, I believe it was, \nurging the Chinese to change their currency policy.\n  But what does this mean to the average American? The exchange rate \ntoday is 6.38 yuan to the dollar. When you look at the dollar to the \neuro, I don't know what it is trading today, but it goes up and down \nevery day. China's economy is growing at 9 and 10 percent. They are the \nsecond largest economy in the world. They are moving like gangbusters. \nDoes it really matter for them to suppress the value of the currency? \nYes, it does.\n  Any objective observer, looking at the history of the way the Chinese \nGovernment deals with its monetary policy, concludes they keep the yuan \nbelow its true value to create a discount on products made in China. \nLook at it this way. If you are competing with China in the world \nmarketplace, not only do you have cheap labor to compete against, but \nyou have the Government of China directly supporting their industries \nin a way we don't here, and then add to that intellectual property \ntheft. When you do\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\nbusiness in China, the next thing you know, a Chinese company across \nthe street is producing the very product you went to China to produce.\n  So the Chinese Government needs to follow the rule of law and live \nwith the norms of international business practices. And when it comes \nto currency manipulation, it is impossible to believe that the dollar-\nto-yuan ratio exists without the government manipulating the value of \nthe yuan. People estimate that it is 25 to 40 percent below its true \nvalue. What does that mean? It means if you are competing with China, \nselling the same product made in China, there is a discount on the \nChinese product based on the value of their money.\n  The trade deficit with China has exploded. Last year, it was $273 \nbillion. We were at $160.4 billion in July of this year. Cheap exports \ncoming out of China are the source of cash for the Chinese Government \nand Chinese industry.\n  We can't convert the currency in China. In the United States, we can \ntake your money and convert it to any currency we would like. But if a \nChinese manufacturer sells a product in the United States and gets paid \nin dollars, they have to convert it to the yuan. They have very \nrestrictive monetary policies, and the ban of trading on the yuan is \n0.5 percent day. The dollar can fluctuate based on all kinds of \neconomic forces--our debt, our trade deficit, and what is going on here \nat home. But the Chinese Government restricts the fluctuation of the \ncurrency in a way that costs us jobs.\n  It is estimated that over 2 million jobs have been lost over the last \ndecade because of currency manipulation alone. It is one way to get an \nunfair advantage in the marketplace. Over 41,000 jobs have been lost in \nSouth Carolina alone because companies can't compete with China.\n  So this legislation would allow the Treasury Department to create new \ncriteria to monitor the currency practices of the Chinese Government. \nIf it is found to be misaligned or manipulated, the Treasury Department \ncan bring countervailing duty proposals, counterveiling duty action \nagainst China. We have done this before when the Chinese dumped steel \ninto our market.\n  If a country is violating the international trading standards or \nbusiness norms, under the WTO we have the ability to fight back. This \nlegislation would elevate currency manipulation. It is one thing to \ndump a product such as steel or tires into the American economy, \ncreating an unfair advantage for the Chinese manufacturing community; \nwe have tools to deal with that. But we haven't embraced pushing back \nagainst currency.\n  China should be a great place to do business, but it is not. It \nshould be more balanced than it is. I want to do business with China. I \njust don't want trade deficits of $273 billion that are artificially \ncreated. If they do something better than us, they should win in the \nmarketplace. That is just the way business works. But if the government \nintervenes and creates an advantage for a Chinese company, that is not \nwinning in the marketplace. This would not matter if it were a small \ncountry such as the Dominican Republic or some small country where they \nhave to keep the currency in check because they don't want wild swings \nof their currency. But major economic powers--China, the United States, \nEuropean countries--can't play that game.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote to allow this debate to go forward \nbecause this is about American jobs at the end of the day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, all pending nominations other than the \nnomination of Henry Floyd are confirmed.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Henry F. Floyd, of South Carolina,to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Fourth Circuit?\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Crisis in Sudan\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise this evening to call attention to \nthe disturbing developments in Sudan and the newly created nation of \nSouth Sudan. I fear the ongoing violence there risks undermining the \nprogress that has been made for lasting peace after decades of civil \nwar and bloodshed.\n  It has been indeed a historic year for the people of South Sudan. \nAlmost 3 months ago, on July 9, South Sudan was formally recognized as \na sovereign nation, becoming Africa's 54th state. An overwhelming 98.8 \npercent of South Sudanese voters chose independence from the central \ngovernment of Sudan in the referendum held this January. For the \nmillions of people whose lifetimes have known only war, the hope of a \nbetter future was finally on the horizon.\n  Like many, I was cautiously encouraged by the news that the South \nSudanese decided to take a path toward democracy and toward justice. \nLike many, I realized this path would be a difficult one as conflict \npersists in Darfur and other areas around the border, such as Abyei, \nBlue Nile, and Southern Kordofan.\n  Unfortunately, recent reports of violence confirm the tenuous \nrelationship between north and south that exists in the wake of \nindependence. Escalating unrest points to the abandonment of peaceful \nnegotiations by the north and a return to military intimidation and \nfighting. Tragically, civilians have been caught in the crossfire.\n  According to a post from CNN in late July, hospitals in the Nuba \nMountains are overflowing with civilians who have been hurt in attacks \nby the northern army. This is how the report describes the scene:\n\n       In one hospital room a nurse tried to clean the blown apart \n     face of a young boy. In another, a 12-year-old girl suffered \n     from advanced tetanus after her arm was cut off by shrapnel. \n     Doctors said she had little chance of surviving.\n\n  This violence, affecting innocent children, is unacceptable. Attacks \nagainst civilians are among a number of violations that have been cited \nby the United Nations against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's \ngovernment, which denies the allegations and insists it is only \nfighting rebels loyal to South Sudan.\n  In a report this summer, the United Nations suggests the attacks by \nSudanese Armed Forces in the border state of Southern Kordofan have \namounted to human rights violations and war crimes. Most of the \nviolence there is affecting the Nuba people, a mostly Christian \nminority aligned with South Sudan but left on the opposite side of the \nborder. Thousands have been forced to flee to caves for refuge in the \nNuba Mountains. Even more worrisome is that the violence is spreading. \nIn May, the Sudanese Armed Forces invaded the disputed area of Abyei \nand displaced an estimated 100,000, among them nearly 4,000 children. \nJust last month, the Sudanese Parliament authorized military action in \nnearby Blue Nile.\n  We should not forget the legacy of President Bashir's dictatorial \nregime as these atrocities continue to mount. Mr. Bashir has already \nbeen indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against \nhumanity and war crimes over the conflict in Darfur, and the United \nStates continues to impose sanctions on the northern government.\n  The full extent of the violence in the border areas between Sudan and \nSouth Sudan is hard to determine because U.N. agencies and humanitarian \ngroups have been denied access. But this is no excuse for ignoring the \nwarning signs of a dangerous predicament. All too often, we recognize \ncrises after far too many lives have been lost.\n  What we do know about the current situation is ominous. The African \nCenter For Justice and Peace Studies says supporters of the Sudan \nPeople's Liberation Army-North are being arbitrarily arrested on the \nbasis of their perceived political affiliation and subject to \nextrajudicial killings. Refugees have described execution-style \nmurders. International calls for the northern government to cease its \naerial bombings have been blatantly ignored. The U.N. Office for the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, reports that more than \n100,000 people are thought to be displaced by fighting in Blue Nile \nalone. The U.N. estimates for South Kordofan top 200,000 displaced \npersons. Just last month, an article in the New York Times reported \nthat a satellite imagery project monitoring parts of Sudan had captured \nimages of mass graves.\n  We have always known South Sudan would face serious challenges this \nyear and in the coming years as a free independent nation. What we \ncannot allow is its democratic future to hang in the balance as old \nscores are reignited and innocent lives are lost. Let's not forget the \nhorrors of the civil war that ensued for 22 years before President \nGeorge W. Bush engineered the comprehensive peace agreement in 2005. \nDuring that civil war, more than 2 million died, more than 4 million \nwere displaced, and 600,000 fled the country as refugees.\n  I urge my colleagues not to lose focus on the hundreds of thousands \nof people who have been unfairly hurt by this violence. They have \nalready endured far too much suffering. I join the U.S. State \nDepartment in its call for the hostilities to stop and for responsible \ndialog to resume. The longer the violence continues, the harder it will \nbe to move forward toward lasting peace.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbipartisan legislation we will be considering this week regarding the \nCurrency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011. I am very pleased \nit received overwhelming support for us to proceed to consideration of \nthis most critical legislation.\n  This day has been a long time in the making, if you ask those of us \nwho have been calling on our government, under the leadership of both \nDemocrats and Republicans, to hold our foreign competitors accountable \nwhen they violate our trade laws. In that respect I want to express my \ngratitude to my colleague from Ohio, Senator Sherrod Brown, with whom I \nhave partnered in repeatedly calling for a vote on this crucial \nlegislation, as well as the Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, and \nthe Senator from South Carolina, Senator Graham, for also being with us\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\nand working on this legislation to address all of the facets of this \nissue that have been long overdue in consideration by the Congress.\n  This day has been far too long in coming for the millions of American \nworkers who are out of work and whose wages have been decimated as a \nresult of our inability to compete with unfairly subsidized Chinese \nimports. Since Congress first began requiring the Treasury to analyze \nthe exchange rate policies of foreign countries in 1988, China has been \ncited as a currency manipulator five times, all occurring between 1992 \nand 1994.\n  Since then, despite China's continued and in many ways \nintensification of these practices, our government, under both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations, has failed to cite China \neven once for its policy of fixing its currency to the dollar. This is \nalso despite Congress's repeated efforts to make currency manipulation \na top priority in our Nation's trade agenda.\n  In fact, in April 2005 I joined my Senate colleagues in decisively \nsupporting an amendment calling on China to reform its currency \npractices. This action is largely viewed as helping to prompt China to \nallow its currency to gradually appreciate between 2005 and 2008. In \nJuly 2007 I joined a majority of colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee in favor of reporting the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight \nReform Act of 2007 by a vote of 20 to 1. That was 4 years ago. We \nstarted 6 years ago, and yet we still had not had any concrete, \nsubstantive action on this fundamental issue. None of these bills were \nbrought up for a vote by the full Senate.\n  From 2008 to mid-2010, China again froze its exchange rate constant \nin an effort to maintain its production edge during the financial \ncrisis. It was only last June that China showed signs that it might \nallow the RMB to gradually appreciate. But according to the \nCongressional Research Service, it gained only 6 or 7 percent on the \ndollar over the last year.\n  Faced with these blatantly inequitable trade distortions, I have \nwitnessed Maine's manufacturers and their employees going to great \nlengths to improve their competitiveness. According to the \nManufacturers Association of Maine, workers in our State have increased \noutput per employee by 6 percent over a period of 8 years--from 60,000 \nin 2001 to 89,000 in 2009. Yet the dramatic job losses we have \nwitnessed in the American manufacturing sector over the last decade \ntell a very different story.\n  According to recent reports, between 2001, when China joined the WTO \nand 2010, 4.1 million manufacturing jobs were lost in this country, and \n1.9 million of those jobs or 47 percent can be directly linked to our \ngrowing trade deficit with China.\n  In Maine, this withering of our manufacturing base has contributed to \nwage and salary employment levels falling precipitously through \nDecember 2010, with job losses of 26,900, a 4.4-percent drop. Overall, \nemployment numbers in my State have returned to 1999 levels--1999 \nlevels--erasing any economic gains of the previous 10 years.\n\n  U.S. manufacturing employees, including thousands who live in small \ntowns throughout my State, are recognized as the most productive \nworkers in the world. These are the types of jobs that should be \nthriving in a global economy, but they cannot if foreign producers, \nsuch as those in China, are playing with a proverbial stacked deck.\n  For this reason I rise today to urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act, legislation \nthat I have authored with the Senator from Ohio to enforce the rules \nand address a paramount contributing factor in the decimation of our \nNation's once unparalleled manufacturing base--currency exchange rate \nmanipulation.\n  For over a decade China has manipulated its exchange rate by pegging \nthe Chinese renminbi to the dollar. As a result, China's currency is \nestimated to be undervalued by anywhere from 12 to 50 percent according \nto the Congressional Research Service. In fact, despite the Chinese \nGovernment's announcement last year that it would begin allowing its \ncurrency to gradually appreciate, the Treasury Department's exchange \nrate report, released May 27, noted that ``the real exchange rate of \nthe renminbi remains substantially undervalued.''\n  Some of my colleagues will no doubt argue that mill closings and \nlayoffs in States such as Maine have little to do with the value of the \nChinese currency, and that legislation to hold countries such as China \naccountable when they intervene in currency markets will not create \njobs or grow our economy.\n  For that matter, proponents of China's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization 10 years ago also claimed that liberalizing trade with \nChina would improve our trade deficit. At the time of its entry into \nthe WTO in December 2001, China agreed to provide greater transparency \nwhen it comes to trade policies, to enforce intellectual property \nrights, and to end discriminatory and unpredictable rules impeding \nmarket access for American products.\n  In fact, as the agreement to allow China into the WTO was being \nnegotiated in 2000, President Clinton argued it would create, in his \nwords, ``a win-win result for both countries.''\n  However, as President John Adams once said, ``facts are stubborn \nthings.'' Let's examine some of the evidence.\n  For one, in January, I met with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer a few \nhours before he attended a private meeting at the White House. Mr. \nBallmer told me that in fiscal year 2010 over 30 million PCs were sold \nin China that ran illegal copies of Windows. Rather telling, he noted \nthat while China is their second largest personal computer market in \nthe world, it is 70th in terms of Microsoft revenue per personal \ncomputer.\n  If one of the largest and most integrated companies in the world is \nbeing hamstrung by China's piracy and blatant infringement of \nintellectual property rights, how can we expect smaller U.S. companies \nto stand a chance when it comes to entering the Chinese market? On top \nof its failure to police intellectual property rights infringement, \nunlike most other countries where exchange rates are determined by \nmarket forces, the Chinese Government does not allow the renminbi to \nfluctuate freely and instead pegs it tightly to the U.S. dollar at a \nrate that makes it significantly undervalued vis-a-vis the dollar.\n\n  As a result, Chinese exports to the United States are artificially \nmade less expensive, as we well know, and the cost of U.S. exports to \nChina and the rest of the world are made more expensive by a similar or \nequivalent amount.\n  According to a new report featured last week in the Wall Street \nJournal, one significant consequence of China's trade practices is that \nover the last two decades it has surged as an exporter at a ``break-\nneck pace,'' while the growth of U.S. spending on imports from China \nhas climbed steadily. As indicated by this chart to my right, according \nto the report, imports from China as a share of U.S. spending climbed \nfrom below 1 percent throughout much of the 1990s, to over 5 percent \ntoday. There is no question that this trajectory reflects it in this \nchart, seeing China as a total of U.S. spending, and what has occurred \nis a dramatic rise--without abatement, without any intervention \nwhatsoever--and we have seen a steady major rise in terms of the amount \nof imports and spending by Americans on Chinese imports.\n  Due in large part to China's currency manipulation and other trade-\ndistorting practices, manufacturers in Maine and places like Maine have \nnot been able to compete against this surge in artificially cheap \nChinese imports. As Americans spend increasingly more on Chinese \nproducts, as illustrated in the chart, these imports displace goods \nmade in the USA.\n  Consequently, China's currency undervaluation has contributed \ndirectly to our soaring trade deficit with China, which has ballooned \nfrom $83 billion, when China joined the WTO in 2001, to $273 billion in \n2010. Those numbers are worth repeating--when you are speaking about \n$83 billion, which our trade deficit was in 2001, and now in 2010 it \nhas skyrocketed to $273 billion.\n  This ever-expanding, explosive trade deficit, unprecedented, of \ncourse, in our history, which grew 20 percent between 2009 and 2010, \ndestroys existing jobs, prevents new job creation and, as economists \nfrom the Economic Policy Institute have indicated, increases the global \n``race to the bottom,'' in their words, when it comes to middle-class \nwages.\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\n  For example, the Economic Policy Institute recently released a report \nnoting that as plants have closed, workers displaced by trade from the \nmanufacturing sector have had particular difficulty in securing \ncomparable employment, and average wages of those who found new jobs \nfell by 11 to 13 percent.\n  As we see on the chart, reflected and demonstrated here, most \ngraphically, the Economic Policy Institute report discovered that since \nChina's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 and through \n2010, when we saw that explosive growth of the trade deficit from $83 \nbillion to $273 billion between 2001 and 2010, the increase in the \nU.S.-China trade deficit eliminated or displaced 2.8 million American \njobs or 310,000 jobs per year.\n  As we can see illustrated on the chart, virtually every State in \nAmerica has been affected by the trade deficits with China, with \ndisplaced thousands and thousands of jobs, and in less than a decade \n2.8 million American jobs.\n  In my State of Maine this means the trade deficit has displaced \nnearly 10,000 workers or nearly 2 percent of State employment. As the \nchart depicts, the pain of job losses is not unique to one individual \nState or region of the country. Workers in all 50 States, from \nCalifornia to South Carolina, from Michigan to Texas, have been harmed \nand unable to compete against artificially cheap Chinese imports.\n  While these charts and reports may paint a picture of doom and gloom, \nthere is recourse available to American workers injured by unfair \ntrade. Under the U.S. countervailing duty law, tariffs can be imposed \non imports benefiting from foreign government subsidies if it \ndemonstrates that the subsidies cause or threaten injury to a U.S. \nindustry producing the same or similar product.\n  But while numerous U.S. industries have attempted to bring \nallegations of currency manipulation as an export subsidy under our \ntrade laws, in each instance the Department of Commerce has refused to \ninvestigate.\n  For example, it is a little known fact that the U.S. pulp and paper \nindustry employs 900,000 workers--roughly the equivalent number \nemployed by the U.S. auto industry--making it an indispensable economic \npillar in rural communities in Maine and across the country.\n  Last year, several U.S. paper manufacturers with mills in Maine \nbrought forward allegations that China was violating trade rules by \nillegally subsidizing their products in the U.S. market. Just over a \nyear ago, in 2010, I testified before the International Trade \nCommission and made the case--and we were ultimately successful on \nthese points--that foreign paper manufacturers in China and Indonesia \nwere illegally selling their products in the United States at unfairly \nsubsidized and underpriced rates.\n  Amazingly, however, the Commerce Department refused to investigate \nwhether China's currency practices constituted an illegal--and \ntherefore countervailable--export subsidy.\n  Simply put, this failure to take action is unacceptable. In response, \nin November of last year, the Senator from Ohio, Senator Brown, and I \nsent a letter to the Senate's leadership asking that a vote be \nscheduled on legislation directing the Commerce Department to \ninvestigate allegations that currency undervaluation provides a \ncountervailable subsidy at the expense of American jobs. When the \nSenate failed to take action, Senator Brown and I filed the House-\npassed currency reform bill as an amendment to the tax extender package \nin December of 2010.\n\n  In January 2011, during Chinese President Hu's visit to the United \nStates, we sent a letter to Secretary Geithner underscoring the need to \nenforce trade remedy laws to provide U.S. industries affected by \nChina's currency practices with a lifeline to compete. And, finally, in \nresponse to our government's failure to investigate these unfair trade \npractices, on February 10 of this year, Senator Brown and I introduced \nour legislation, the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act.\n  Simply put, the Department of Commerce has failed to use its \nauthority to respond to currency manipulation by investigating these \nallegations brought by U.S. industry and placing countervailing duties \non foreign imports benefiting from these unfair trade practices. The \npurpose of our bill is to make clear that Commerce has the ability to \ninvestigate--regardless of whether the subsidy is provided to all \nforeign businesses in a given country or just to those that are \nexporting.\n  That is an important point, because if we wait to make that \ndemonstration, they can continue to export their goods to the United \nStates before we could ever reach the point of being able to make that \ndetermination on imposing that countervailing subsidy or determining \nwhich companies in China are actually doing the exporting. So it is \nimportant to eliminate that distinction, because that has been a \nbarrier.\n  In fact, it certainly prevented the Department of Commerce, in their \nwords, from being able to impose any kind of subsidies or to \ninvestigate the case before they could impose a countervailing duty. So \nthis way we eliminate the distinction, irrespective of whether a \nbusiness is exporting within China their goods. The point is, we don't \nwant to wait for the Department of Commerce to make that determination. \nThose industries that do export--and once they do export--have already \ndone the damage. So it is clearly important to be able to have the \nDepartment of Commerce in a position of being able at the outset to \ninitiate this investigation on those companies that actually export \ngoods to the United States from China at an unfair price.\n  Notably, our bill does not legislatively deem that a currency \nundervaluation satisfies the requirement of finding a countervailing \nsubsidy. It just requires Congress to determine on a case-by-case basis \nwhether currency undervaluation is giving foreign companies an unfair \ncompetitive advantage over their counterparts in our country.\n  Since introducing our legislation in February, we have added 11 \nbipartisan Senate cosponsors, and the House companion to our \nlegislation has over 200 cosponsors. Furthermore, on September 23, I \nwas proud to join as a lead original cosponsor of the bipartisan \nlegislation before us today, which combines the key elements of our \nbill with critical provisions of the legislation authored by the \nSenator from New York, Senator Schumer, and the Senator from South \nCarolina, Senator Graham, that I also supported as an initiative when \nit came before the Senate Finance Committee in 2007.\n  The merged bill utilizes U.S. trade law to counter the economic \ndamage and harm to U.S. manufacturers caused by currency manipulation \nand it authorizes new consequences for countries that fail to adopt \nappropriate policies to eliminate unfair currency undervaluation. Most \ncritically, it will also provide businesses that are damaged by China's \ntrade practices with the tools to respond on behalf of American \nworkers. It ensures our government will heed the requests of a wide \nrange of U.S. industries, such as paper manufacturers in Maine, to \ninvestigate whether currency undervaluation by a government provides a \nsubsidy, and one in which we can initiate an action by imposing \ncountervailing duties.\n  Finally, while some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that \nchallenging China's unfair trade practices could lead that government \nto retaliate against U.S. goods and jeopardize our economic recovery, \nthe fact is the potential benefit of currency reform is enormous when \nit comes to fighting unemployment and boosting the American economy, \nbecause as of today China essentially rigs the game to undercut true \nmarket competition and undermine U.S. businesses.\n  For example, a study released in June by the Economic Policy \nInstitute discovered that addressing Chinese currency manipulation and \nenforcing fair trade provisions when it comes to these violations would \nsupport the creation of more than 2 million U.S. jobs, increase the \ngross domestic product by as much as $285 billion, and reduce the \ndeficit by more than $70 billion a year.\n  Failing to act now is not an option. The International Monetary Fund \nrecently announced that China will surpass the United States \neconomically in 2016--a mere 5 years from now. If this turns out to be \ntrue, it will be due in large part to our current policies, which are \nfueling our decline and China's rise. We import more than we export, \nkeep running huge trade deficits, consume more than we produce, and \noutsource thousands of jobs.\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\n  If one manufacturer is compelled to close because we failed to combat \nsubsidized imports, that is one less manufacturer able to export and \nhelp grow our economy. And frankly, if there was ever a moment to \nempower a workforce when it comes to competing in a global economy, is \nthere any doubt, given our dire economic state, that time is now? From \nMaine to the Midwest, China's currency manipulation has been among the \ngreatest impediments to our manufacturing sector. Unfortunately, the \nsilence of our government when it comes to this issue has become the \nsilence of our factories.\n  It is time to take action to rebuild our economic foundations, and \nthis legislation will ensure our government has the tools to respond on \nbehalf of American companies and workers by imposing countervailing \nduties on exports subsidized by currency manipulation undervaluation.\n  It is absolutely vital we take this action this year--right now--\nbecause, as I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, if you look at \nthe historical picture of the consideration of this legislation, it is \nclear it has been underestimated, it has been overlooked in terms of \nthe value it brings to our country, to the value it brings to the \nmanufacturing segment of our economy, and to the value it brings to our \nworkers. I am deeply concerned, because it also seems as if it is an \neither/or proposition when we talk about trade-related issues--either \nwe do nothing or we will invite a trade war.\n\n  We have to look at the trade practices of our trading partners and \nthe laws which they are required to uphold--in this case, for China, \nthrough the World Trade Organization. They made a commitment at the \nonset when they joined that organization, and they have refused to \nuphold it when it comes to leveling the playing field and creating the \nequilibrium--to let the currency flow as required and stipulated under \nthat agreement when they became a member of that organization. They \nhave failed time and again to monitor these agreements and to monitor \nthe actions of their own companies with respect to this practice, and \nit has decimated many industries across this country.\n  As I indicated with this chart, virtually every State in America has \nbeen damaged as a result of the loss of jobs because we have failed to \nuphold the standards of fair trade. So it isn't about encouraging a \ntrade war. Far from it. I think it creates not only a level playing \nfield, but it creates an equitable circumstance for our trading \npartners. And it is important for those countries, such as China, to be \nprepared to live up to the agreements to which they have subscribed \nthrough the World Trade Organization. They are required to live by \ntheir agreement, and that means they have to establish the standards \nwhere they cannot manipulate their currency, as they have been doing \nfor more than two decades.\n  It has been a problem, and it has been a persistent problem. \nUnfortunately, both sides of the aisle--whether it is Democratic or \nRepublican administrations, the presidency or here in Congress--have \nfailed to take a concrete, concerted action that could have made a \nprofound difference long before this point. This could have been \naverted. Time and again we haven't been able to have a Treasury \nSecretary designate China as a currency manipulator that I think would \nhave then prompted much more significant action on the part of any \nadministration.\n  So that issue has been addressed in this legislation--to change the \nthreshold, to redesign and to target the legislation more precisely so \nthat it will give the tools to the administration, and specifically to \nthe Treasury Secretary, to be able to designate China as a currency \nmanipulator, which then kicks in certain safeguards and actions.\n  The same is true for the Department of Commerce, that they will be \nable to initiate at the outset an investigation to determine whether \ndevaluing the currency on the part of China has contributed to unfair \ntrading practices and, obviously, adversely affecting our goods and \nworkers and companies here in the United States. It is important to \ngive the tools to our agencies to make sure they can fulfill their \nobligations.\n  I know there are times in which they have not done so, even when they \nhave had the tools, and they have been empowered to use those tools, \nmuch to the detriment of our industries--much to the detriment of these \njobs and these manufacturing companies all across America--that have \neither closed their doors or they have sharply curtailed their \nbusinesses or their level of employment.\n  I know that firsthand from my State. It has brought tremendous \nconsequences to rural Maine and to rural America as a result, because \nthat is what has been the basis of our economy. The manufacturing \nsegment of our industry has been so critical to good-paying jobs, and \nthat ultimately has been damaged and harmed as a result of this \ncurrency manipulation issue that has been persistent on the part of the \nChinese, and one that we now have to address through this legislation.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to address the Senate on this critical \nissue. As we go forward in the days ahead in debating this legislation, \nI look forward to working with my colleagues--the Senator from Ohio, \nwho has done yeoman's work on this issue and has brought this issue to \nthe highest levels in terms of its attention and importance to this \ncountry, most assuredly. I am looking forward to working with him and \nour other colleagues to make sure we can fulfill our commitment to \npassing this legislation.\n  It is not only about debating it, it is not just voting on it, it is \nabout its becoming law. I think we should bring this to its logical \nconclusion and send it to the President for his signature. The time has \ncome, as I said, and it is long overdue. We have failed the workers and \nthe industries of this country who are trying to compete and who can \nmake goods. We are not going to forsake our manufacturing sector, \nbecause we have the ability to make the best goods with the most \nproductive workers in the world, and we should be able to continue to \ndo that. The only way we can fulfill that obligation to them is through \nthis legislation. There is no other recourse at this moment in time.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I, first of all, thank Senator \nSnowe for her leadership on this currency legislation. Its time has \ncome, as she has said. She has been a real leader on this for months--\nyears, for that matter. I so appreciate her work on this problem.\n  Pure and simple, this is the most important bipartisan jobs bill the \nSenate will pass in my 4\\1/2\\ years since I have been a Member of the \nSenate. Senator Snowe has been here a good bit longer and has been a \nmember of the Finance Committee that understands these issues of how \nChina has gamed the system. Senator Snowe and I were joined in our \nlegislation, combining it with Senator Schumer and Senator Graham in \ntheir legislation, also Senator Stabenow, a Democrat from Michigan; \nSenator Sessions, a Republican from Alabama; both Senators from North \nCarolina, Senator Burr, a Republican and Senator Hagan, a Democrat; \njoined by Senator Casey and the other Maine Senator, Senator Casey from \nPennsylvania, a Democrat, and the other Maine Senator, a Republican, \nSenator Collins. And that just shows the bipartisan support.\n  We had this vote today. On S. 1619, the cloture vote was 79-19, which \nis a strong message to the House and to our colleagues that this \nlegislation as we debate this week is so important. It is deserving of \nbasically a week of the Senate's time to discuss and debate what China \ntrade is all about.\n  We know what China trade is all about. We know, as Senator Snowe \nsaid, the trade deficit with China has ballooned in the 10 years since \nChina has been part of the World Trade Organization. Think of it this \nway. Every day we buy $750 million more from China than we sell to \nChina--every single day--Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, \nFriday, Saturday--every day of every week every year. So for the past \nyear, $750 million we buy from China more than we sell to China. You \njust can't keep doing that. You can't keep doing that and hold the \nindustrial base that the people of Oregon, the people of Maine, the \npeople from Ohio care about.\n  Look at it this way. I don't want to inundate my colleagues with \nfigures and numbers and dollars and job numbers and all that, but \nPresident Bush I\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nsaid $1 billion in trade surplus or trade deficit translates into \n13,000 jobs. He said that 15 years ago. No President has quantified \nthat since. But think about that. Thousands of jobs for every $1 \nbillion in trade deficit or surplus. Well, with China alone, we have \nthree-quarters of $1 billion every single day. Our trade deficit with \nthe whole world is $600 billion, more than that.\n  So we buy $600 billion more than we sell to the world every year. How \ncan a country, no matter how wealthy--and this is a rich country still, \neven though millions of people have been unemployed, have lost \nmanufacturing jobs in my State and other States across the country. How \ncan we continue as a prosperous nation if manufacturing is outsourced \nand these jobs go somewhere else?\n  I don't believe ever that I can think of in world history--and I have \nsaid this before and nobody has challenged it--have we seen a business \nplan of American companies moving to China, manufacturing there, and \nthen selling back to the United States. A company such as Proctor & \nGamble, on the other hand, they moved production to China, but they \nsell from their Chinese operations to China, East Asia, probably Taiwan \nand maybe Japan and Malaysia. They have their production in the areas \nthey sell to. That makes perfect sense. That is good for those \ncountries, good for those workers, good for the United States, and good \nfor Cincinnati where Proctor & Gamble is located. But these companies \nthat have it as their business plan to shut down production here, move \nto China, and then sell those products that they make in Shanghai and \nWuhan and Beijing instead of in Akron, Canton, and Toledo--sell those \nproducts back to consumers in Oregon, Ohio, and Maine--that is why this \nlegislation is so important.\n  A new study said we have lost 2.8 million jobs in the last decade to \nChina because of currency manipulation; 1.9 million of those jobs are \nin manufacturing. You know what has happened in places such as \nPortland, and the Senator from Maine knows what has happened in her \nPortland, and what that has meant to lost jobs in this country. And \nunderstanding the reason that happens is because China games the \nsystem, because China doesn't play fair--pure and simple, say it \nstraight, because China cheats. They have been given, for all intents \nand purposes, a 25 or 30 percent subsidy to their products. So because \nthey cheat on currency--putting aside how they subsidize their paper \nindustry, for instance, with water and capital and energy and land. \nJust on currency alone, when they sell something into the United \nStates, they have a 25 to 30 percent cost advantage. I know companies \nin places around my State, in Mansfield, Springfield, Zanesville, \nChilicothe, will say that the cost of raw materials is higher than the \ncost of the product when it comes from China. Why? Because China \ncheats. And one of the ways they cheat is they undervalue their \ncurrency so they have a 25-percent discount on their products sold into \nthe United States. We can't compete with that, no matter that our \nworkers are efficient, no matter that our companies are efficient, no \nmatter that we cut costs in so many ways with the more advanced \ntechnologies and advanced manufacturing that we do.\n  So that is why this was such an important step, passing \noverwhelmingly and sending to the floor for debate today--79-19--this \nbipartisan jobs bill called the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight and \nReform Act of 2011.\n  Earlier today I was in Cleveland and I had a meeting with two owners \nof a company in Brunswick, OH, more or less a Cleveland suburb, \nAutomation Tool & Dye. It is a family company that has been in \noperation since 1974. The owners, the two sons, Randy and Bill Bennett, \nspoke today about their company. They have, I believe they said, 55 \nemployees who are a major part of American manufacturing. They are the \nkind of company that when it is such a disadvantage on currency, it \nputs them in a less than competitive position sometimes. They are still \ndoing OK, but they know how hard the business climate is when they are \nat that disadvantage.\n  So when they are making products, because China has gamed the system \nand an American company might move to China to do production, they \ncan't up and move their family company of 55 employees--they can't move \nto China to service the company that has moved to China because of the \ncompetitive disadvantage.\n  So we know how that has worked. We know why this legislation that \nSenator Snowe has worked on, the two bills we put together, Senator \nSnowe and my bill with Senators Schumer and Graham. As I said, we have \nhad good strong bipartisan sponsorship on this bipartisan jobs bill and \nwe have also had a very good vote today that was 79-19 to move this \nforward.\n\n  The Economic Policy Institute issued a new report showing that \naddressing Chinese currency manipulation could support the creation of \n2.25 million American jobs, mostly in manufacturing, mostly the kind of \njobs that will create other jobs because of the wealth that Senator \nSnowe talked about, the wealth that manufacturing creates. And as \nSenator Snowe pointed out, when the opponents to this--and too often we \nhave seen administrations of both parties oppose bills such as this. \nWhen opponents say this is protectionism, I don't know what is wrong \nwith protecting our families and protecting our neighbors and \nprotecting our country. But ceding that, they say this is \nprotectionism. This, in fact, is a reaction to Chinese protectionism. \nAnd the People's Republic of China has not really believed in the rule \nof law when it comes to trade. There is an emphatic strong insistence \nby the U.S. Senate that we do believe in the rule of law for \ninternational trade; that we do think all actors should behave. We do \nthink that everybody in the trading system should work on a level \nplaying field.\n  Today was the biggest step I have seen the U.S. Senate take since I \ncame here in 2007. We are going to have a long debate this week. \nEverybody is going to get their chance. Some Members of the Senate who \nwanted us to debate this are still not quite sure exactly where we go \nwith this. I think it is pretty clear, though, that the U.S. Senate \ntoday reflects what the people of this great country believe: That we \nmake things.\n  My State is the third largest manufacturing State in America. Only \nTexas and California, States that are twice and three times our size in \npopulation, make more than we do. We know how to produce. We need to \ncontinue to produce. We know that manufacturing creates wealth.\n  This is a huge victory--only a first step but a huge first step and a \nvictory for American manufacturing to help us reindustrialize our \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleagues for this 79-19 vote. I thank Senator Snowe \nespecially for her terrific work on both sides of the aisle in getting \nthis bill moving forward. It is going to matter for workers in Toledo, \nDayton, Cleveland, and Columbus. And for that, I am grateful.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to note final passage last week \nof the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which extends sanctions on \nthe Burmese regime for another year. As in years past, I am joined in \nthis effort by my good friend, Senator Dianne Feinstein. Alongside the \ntwo of us are 64 other cosponsors, including Senators McCain, Durbin, \nand Lieberman. This overwhelming bipartisan support for sanctioning the \njunta reflects the clear view of the U.S. Senate that the purportedly \n``new'' Burmese regime that took office earlier this year so far \nappears little different from the ``old'' regime.\n  The casual observer could be excused for thinking that things have \nchanged\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\ndramatically for the better in Burma over the past year. After all, \nelections were held last fall, a ``new'' regime took office earlier \nthis year, and Aung San Suu Kyi was freed. However, as our experience \nwith Burma has taught us, things there usually require a closer look.\n  First, the November elections took place without the benefit of \ninternational election monitors, and no reputable observers viewed the \nelections as free or fair. This was in large part because the National \nLeague for Democracy--Suu Kyi's party and the winner overwhelmingly of \nthe last free elections in the country in 1990--was effectively banned \nby the junta and couldn't participate in the election. There were \nrestrictions placed on how other political parties could form and \ncampaign. No criticism of the junta was permitted. And the results were \nunsurprising: the regime's handpicked candidates won big and the \ndemocratic opposition was largely sidelined.\n  Second, the ``new'' regime appears to be essentially the junta with \nonly the thinnest democratic veneer. The Constitution, which places \ngreat power in the hands of the military, cannot be amended without the \nblessing of the armed forces. Furthermore, those in parliament are \nlimited in how they can criticize the regime.\n  The only legitimately good news was Suu Kyi's release. Yet the extent \nof her freedom to travel remains an open question. Moreover, despite \nher release, nearly 2,000 other political prisoners remain behind bars \nin Burma; they are no better off than before. Neither are the hundreds \nof thousands of refugees and displaced persons who are without a home \ndue to the repressive policies of the junta.\n  That the political situation in Burma remains largely unchanged is \nalso reflected in the defection this summer of two Burmese diplomats. \nOne of them was the Burmese Deputy Chief of Mission here in Washington. \nHe wrote a letter to the Secretary of State requesting political asylum \nand, according to press reports, in the letter, he stated as follows:\n\n       My efforts to improve bilateral ties have been continually \n     rejected and resulted in my being deemed dangerous by the \n     government. Because of this, I am also convinced and live in \n     fear that I will be prosecuted for my actions, efforts, and \n     beliefs when I return to Naypyidaw after completing my tour \n     of duty here. The truth is that senior military officials are \n     consolidating their grip on power and seeking to stamp out \n     the voices of those seeking democracy, human rights, and \n     individual liberties.\n\n  These words do not come from a Western government or an NGO; they \ncome from a senior Burmese diplomat. His words make clear that the \ndemocratic trappings of the ``new'' regime are in many ways just a \nfacade.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that there remain important security \nconsiderations that must be addressed before ending sanctions. The \njunta's increasingly close bilateral military relationship with North \nKorea, in particular, is a source of much concern.\n  I am hopeful that the time will soon come when sanctions against the \nBurmese government will no longer be needed; that like South Africa in \nthe early 1990s, the people of Burma will be able to free themselves \nfrom their own government. However, as evidenced in the Deputy Chief of \nMission's letter, the Burmese junta appears to maintain an iron grip on \nits people, and continues to carry out a foreign policy that is \ninimical to U.S. interests. The United States must continue to deny \nthis regime the legitimacy it craves by continuing sanctions, and these \nsanctions must remain in place until true democratic reform comes to \nthe people of Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6040-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HUNGER ACTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this past month we recognized Hunger \nAction Month, a time for all Americans to focus on the problem of \nhunger in our communities. As we begin the month of October, we must \nremember that this is a year-round reality for many individuals and \nfamilies around the country and that our efforts to eradicate this \nproblem must continue.\n  Our Nation continues to face both a 9.1-percent unemployment rate, as \nwell as a 15.1-percent poverty rate. Everyone has been touched in some \nway by this challenging economy. Many of our friends, neighbors and \nfamily members still might be struggling in ways that they never \nimagined with less money to spend and tough choices to make. \nThankfully, there have been a number of community assistance \norganizations that have been able to step up and help out.\n  Many of these are local food banks and soup kitchens that are \nchallenged to find resourceful ways to do more with less in order to \nprovide services to those in need in their communities. One such \norganization that is still making a significant difference is the \nArlington Food Assistance Center, AFAC. For over 20 years the AFAC has \npartnered with local churches, schools and social service agencies to \nassist over 1,200 families weekly with their basic food needs. Last \nyear the AFAC was able to distribute over 2.3 million pounds of food \ndirectly to Arlington community residents. Community support of AFAC \nand thousands of organizations like it across the country is integral \nto their ability to provide the necessary services to those most in \nneed. We must continue to give our support.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the Arlington Food \nAssistance Center and the many other organizations like it, as well as \nthe importance of our commitment to addressing the problem of hunger \nacross the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6040-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6040-S6041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record an article highlighting the Castro regime's continued abuse \nof the Cuban people as they organize efforts to create a freer Cuba. \nThe people being held unjustly and abused in Cuban prisons--as well as \nthose being intimidated and repressed outside of prison--need the \ncontinued support of America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 3, 2011]\n\n                 America's: Cuba's Repression Escalates\n\n                      (By Mary Anastasia O'Grady)\n\n       Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson returned home from \n     an attempted hostage-rescue mission to Cuba last month empty-\n     handed and ``still scratching [his] head'' as to why the \n     Castro regime double-crossed him. What is truly baffling is \n     why Mr. Richardson expected anything different from a \n     dictatorship operating in extreme-repression mode.\n       In a Sept. 14 interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Mr. \n     Richardson said he had been invited to the island to discuss \n     the release of U.S. Agency for International Development \n     contractor Alan Gross. Mr. Gross was arrested in December \n     2009 and is serving a 15-year sentence.\n       Mr. Richardson admitted that he got stiffed by Cuba's \n     ``foreign ministry, which a lot of the people there I know \n     and have been friends'' with. What he could not grasp is why \n     those ``friends''--a strange designation for individuals who \n     might one day be hauled before an international human-rights \n     tribunal--don't appreciate the Obama administration's \n     outreach. Yes, they are ``hardliners,'' he admitted, but they \n     ought to understand that the White House has been bending \n     over backward to get along.\n       Actually they do understand, and that's why they treated \n     him so badly.\n       Mr. Richardson told Mr. Blitzer that he was \n     ``flabbergasted'' when, after a ``delightful'' three-hour \n     lunch discussing how U.S.-Cuba relations might be improved--\n     including, he told me by phone Friday, the possibility of \n     removing the country from the list of state sponsors of \n     terrorism after the release of Mr. Gross--the foreign \n     minister ``slammed me three ways: one, no seeing Alan Gross; \n     no getting him out; and no seeing Raul Castro.''\n       What happened was very predictable. The ``loosened travel \n     restrictions'' and increased ``remittances [from] Cuban-\n     Americans'' that Mr. Richardson cited as signs of Mr. Obama's \n     willingness to deal are read as weakness by the bullying \n     regime. It has something, i.e., somebody, the U.S. wants back \n     very badly, and the administration acts as if it is \n     powerless. Why should Castro deal?\n       Mr. Richardson did even less for Cuba's dissidents. One \n     Richardson pearl of wisdom, shared on CNN, was that Cuba's \n     ``human-rights situation has improved.'' In fact, human \n     rights in Cuba are rapidly deteriorating. To claim otherwise \n     is to abandon the island's brave democrats when they most \n     need international solidarity.\n       Ask Sonia Garro, pictured in the nearby photo (See \n     accompanying photo--WSJ October 3, 2011) . . . For years Ms. \n     Garro has denounced the regime's discrimination against Afro-\n     Cubans. Despite her own poverty, in 2007 she created a \n     recreation center in her home for poor, unsupervised \n     children, according to a report by an independent Cuban\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\n     journalist. One of her goals: to get young girls out of \n     prostitution. Ms. Garro is also a member of Ladies in \n     Support, a group that pledges solidarity to the Ladies in \n     White, which was founded by the wives, sisters and mothers of \n     political prisoners in 2003 to work for their liberation.\n       In October 2010, Ms. Garro was detained by state security \n     and held for seven hours. She emerged from the ordeal with a \n     broken nose. Another woman taken into custody with Ms. Garro \n     had her arm broken.\n       The nongovernmental organization Capitol Hill Cubans has \n     reported that in the first 12 days of September, authorities \n     detained 168 peaceful activists. These ``express detentions'' \n     are designed to break up dissident gatherings, which risk \n     spreading nonconformist behavior. Locking up offenders for \n     long periods would be preferable, but the regime wants people \n     like Mr. Richardson to go around saying that human rights \n     have improved. The regime is also making greater use of \n     civilian-clothed ``rapid response'' brigades that are \n     trained, armed and organized to beat up democracy advocates.\n       Mr. Richardson told me he considers Cuba's record improved \n     because 52 political prisoners were sent to Spain in 2010. \n     Yet exiling promising opposition leadership hardly qualifies \n     as a humanitarian gesture. Nor are gruesome Cuban prisons \n     anything to ignore.\n       Last month in a speech in New York, one former prisoner, \n     Fidel Suarez Cruz, described his seven years and seven months \n     of solitary confinement, including two years and eight months \n     in a cell with no windows, ventilation or artificial light. \n     One favorite pastime of his torturers: Four military men \n     would pick him up and then drop him on the floor. His \n     testimony, posted on Capitol Hill Cubans website, is required \n     viewing for anyone who doubts the evil nature of this regime.\n       Nevertheless, Cuba's dissidents remain relentless, and \n     there are signs that the regime is giving up on the express-\n     detention strategy. Fearless democracy advocate Sara Marta \n     Fonseca and her husband Julio Leon Perez have been in jail \n     since Sept. 24. Ms. Fonseca's son has seen her and says she \n     is black and blue all over and has an injury to her spinal \n     column. Word is the regime is preparing to charge the couple; \n     11 other dissidents are awaiting trial. Meanwhile, Yris Perez \n     Aguilera, the wife of the prominent dissident Jorge Luis \n     Garcia Perez ``Antunez,'' and two peers were detained on \n     Sept. 26. Their whereabouts are unknown.\n       Any hope of protecting these patriots lies in international \n     condemnation. Mr. Richardson could help by returning to CNN \n     to correct the record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6041-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MARY ELLEN NELSON\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 18 years ago, Mary Ellen Nelson started in \nmy Kalispell office. In that time, Mary Ellen earned the respect and \nadmiration of her colleagues both in my offices across the State, in \nWashington, DC and with the Finance Committee. Staff always enjoyed \ngetting the chance to talk with Mary Ellen and hear her words of \nwisdom. I have treasured her caring nature and thoughtful advice and am \ngrateful for all her hard work over the years. It is important to note: \nmy staff members don't just work for me--they work for all Montanans. \nMary Ellen has served the young, the old, the successful, the \ndowntrodden, and Montanans of all political stripes. It has been an \nhonor to have her on staff and to work together for the State we \ncherish.\n  Working for VISTA is what brought Mary Ellen to Montana where she met \nand married her husband Ray of 34 years. A few years later they moved \nto Kalispell where she worked for the school system and the mentally \ndisabled children of Flathead Valley before her work in the U.S Senate. \nMary Ellen's compassion to others resonates in her dedication to her \nfamily, community and the constituents of Montana. Mary Ellen has \nhelped thousands of Montanans work their way through Social Security, \nMedicare, and other issues throughout the years. Her calm, nurturing \ncharacter and commitment to helping others have benefitted thousands of \nMontanans throughout her 18 years of service.\n  A few years ago when Mary Ellen's two sons were graduating from \ncollege, I told her that graduations and weddings were important events \nand needed to be celebrated. The same is true of retirements. Mary \nEllen will be enjoying her hours with her family, including her son \nMatthew in Kalispell, son George and daughter-in-law Monica in DC, her \n90-year-old father, Leo Holland, and visiting her first grandchild \nDominic who was born on Mary Ellen's birthday January 24 of this year. \nMary Ellen, congratulations, good luck, and enjoy your retirement. \nThank you for your many years of service in my office, the U.S. Senate, \nthe community of Kalispell, and countless Montanans for your tireless \nwork to help others. We are sure going to miss you, your talents, and \nyour warm and accommodating personality.\n  Mary Ellen is proud of her Irish heritage so I would like to end with \nthis Irish Retirement Blessing:\n\n     May you always have work\n     for your hands to do.\n     May your pockets hold\n     always a coin or two.\n     May the sun shine bright\n     on your windowpane.\n     May the rainbow be certain\n     to follow each rain.\n     May the hand of a friend\n     always be near you.\n     And may God fill your heart\n     with gladness to cheer you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6041-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO COLONEL TRACEY L.

Watkins of the U.S. Air Force on the occasion of his \nreassignment from the Air Force Congressional Budget and Appropriations \nLiaison Office and to say hail and farewell.\n  Colonel Watkins graduated from the Citadel in 1991 and since then has \nserved in a variety of comptroller assignments across the Air Force. He \nhas held leadership positions at all field and staff levels, including \nassignments in personnel, logistics, and operational planning. Colonel \nWatkins' time in the Air Force has included three joint tours: on the \nJoint Staff, as part of Combined Joint Task Force 76 in Uzbekistan, and \nin the Multi National Corps in Iraq.\n  Colonel Watkins' experiences in those tours were a benefit when he \nassumed the directorship of the Air Force's Congressional Budget and \nAppropriations Liaison Office. In that role, Colonel Watkins directed \nall Air Force appropriations liaison work on the Hill, including \narranging key engagements for Air Force senior leaders with Members of \nCongress and helping to prepare their testimony during Appropriations \nCommittee hearings. In each of those engagements, Colonel Watkins \nserved as the Air Force point man for working with the Congress on all \nbudgetary and appropriations issues. His office also supports \ncongressional delegation trips and Colonel Watkins accompanied me on an \nimportant trip to Russia.\n  I have been impressed with many of the staff that Colonel Watkins led \nduring his tenure as Director of the Air Force Congressional Budget and \nAppropriations Liaison Office, which I find to be the mark of an \noutstanding leader and manager. I am sure that my colleagues join me in \nexpressing our appreciation to Colonel Watkins for his service to the \nAir Force and to the Congress. On the occasion of his reassignment to \ncommand the Mission Support Group at Little Rock Air Force Base in \nArkansas, I wish Colonel Watkins, his wife Kelly, and his children all \nthe very best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6041-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6041-S6043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO HOWARD FRANK MOSHER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the great treasures of Vermont is \nHoward Frank Mosher. Mr. Mosher is a writer who knows and understands \nVermont, and in books like ``Where The Rivers Flow North,'' he makes \nany Vermonter know they are home.\n  A recent article in The Burlington Free Press by Sally Pollak speaks \nto the man he is, and I would like to take this opportunity to share \nthis with the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nthe article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Burlington Free Press]\n\n                    All Roads Lead to Kingdom County\n\n                           (By Sally Pollak)\n\n       (Vermont author Howard Frank Mosher has lived in the \n     Northeast Kingdom since 1964 and the region is character-like \n     in his books. Free Press Staff Writer Sally Pollak and Free \n     Press photographer Glenn Russell spent a day traveling the \n     roads in the north country with Mosher, listening to his \n     stories and discovering his sense of place.)\n       Irasburg--The tan Nissan rolling down the dirt road in \n     Brownington came to a slow stop, and the man behind the wheel \n     surveyed the shallows and grooves of mud in front of him. The \n     place he wanted to go was on the far side of the mud pit, and \n     up a small hill that curved out of sight.\n       Two men with trucks were on the other side of the mud \n     ravine. The Nissan driver left his car to approach the men. I \n     was in the\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\n     back seat of the Nissan. Glenn Russell, a Free Press \n     photographer, had the front seat.\n       Through the window, we watched the three locals talk mud, \n     and discussed if we'd try to forge the muddy road if we were \n     driving. No way, I said.\n       Glenn said he might if he were Howard Frank Mosher, our \n     tour guide that day. Mosher knows the people and trucks \n     around here; he can always get a tow.\n       Mosher, meanwhile, had made another arrangement.\n       If he couldn't get to the other side of the mud, where \n     Margery Moore, 91, his longtime friend lives, then Moore \n     would come to him. One of the men Mosher had been talking to \n     was her son, Michael; he'd pick up his mother in his truck \n     and drive her through the mud to Mosher.\n       While we waited for Moore to arrive, Mosher, 68, told us \n     stories. Delightful and engaging tales--warm and humorous, \n     with a north country bite. The kind of stories you might read \n     in his Kingdom County novels.\n       And now here we were, deep in the Northeast Kingdom on \n     Moore Lane in Brownington, waiting to meet a woman of Mohawk \n     ancestry, whom Mosher got to know 47 years ago, his first \n     year in the Kingdom.\n       She showed up in a big blue rig to say hello. Her son \n     lifted her from his truck and helped her into a wheelchair. \n     Moore greeted Mosher with a hug.\n       He gave her a copy of his most recent novel, ``Walking to \n     Gatlinburg.'' After some talking, we headed back to the \n     Nissan.\n       Michael Moore called to us as we walked to the car: ``Don't \n     let Howard lead you astray out here!''\n       To read Mosher is to be led, if not astray, then away--to a \n     place that is, at once, invented and familiar, enchanted and \n     real, made-up and true.\n       The truth can be found in Mosher's evocation of the place \n     he calls Kingdom County, a rugged, rural border landscape \n     where people scratch out hardscrabble livings, go without \n     spring, learn to read the woods and rivers, build strong \n     allegiances and cast a wary eye on newcomers. Mosher's county \n     and the characters who inhabit it are informed by and created \n     from the landscape and people around him: He uses for his \n     material a place that is distinct and fascinating, yet one \n     that's been changing--maybe merging with outer and other \n     regions--even as Mosher put pen to paper: making it last.\n       In Mosher's 1999 novel, ``The Fall of the Year,'' the \n     book's central figure, Father George Lecoeur, is writing ``A \n     Short History of Kingdom Common.'' Mosher, too, is the author \n     of a history of the Kingdom--his history is contained in the \n     thousands of pages that make up his 11 books.\n       The words Mosher uses to describe ``A Short History,'' can \n     be applied to his own work. They are narrated by Frank \n     Bennett, Father George's adopted son, as Frank settles down \n     to read the history: ``I could hear Father George's voice in \n     my head, hear its slightly speculative, wry resonance. And at \n     that moment, whatever else I still did not understand about \n     the events of the past summer, I realized that long after the \n     passing of the hill farms and the big woods and Kingdom \n     Common as we had known it, these stories would remain: a \n     golden legacy, to me and to the village, from Father \n     George.''\n\n\n                            A special place\n\n       Mosher and his wife, Phillis, a retired teacher and school \n     counselor, have lived in the Northeast Kingdom since 1964. It \n     is where they raised their two children, Jake and Annie. \n     Advertisement I was like a kid in the backseat on a recent \n     drive to the hot spots of Mosher's adopted home turf.\n       The kid thing involved a surprise and recurring attack of \n     carsickness: no fun! On the upside, it meant that as a \n     passenger of Mosher's, even a newcomer from Burlington, I was \n     given a free pass to the Kingdom, embraced by the old timers \n     on Moore Lane.\n       Like a kid who (still) believes in the grownups up front, I \n     saw the world through the eyes and observations of the \n     driver--which thankfully transcended my own hazy vision. As \n     we pulled out of the driveway of his Irasburg home, not far \n     from the town green, Mosher enticed us. First stop, he said, \n     was a place he'd had an ``epiphany.''\n       What and where it was, we'd find out when we arrived at the \n     scene: Orleans' sleepy main street. This is going to be a fun \n     trip, I thought. Anyone who can have an epiphany in downtown \n     Orleans, is the right person to ride with.\n       The street was deserted the day Mosher steered his \n     grandfather's Super 88 Oldsmobile into town. He and Phillis, \n     farm kids from upstate New York barely in their 20s, were in \n     Orleans to interview for teaching jobs.\n       The Kingdom quiet was busted that day by two rough-looking \n     drunks in fisticuffs, fighting their way down the otherwise \n     empty street. Mosher rolled down his window to speak a \n     sentence that revealed the budding wordsmith within: ``Could \n     one of you gentlemen please tell me how to get to the high \n     school?''\n       We'll do you one better, promised the brawlers. We'll take \n     you there. With a welcome from Mosher, they climbed into the \n     backseat of the Oldsmobile and directed the teaching recruits \n     to the school.\n       ``I was beginning to get the idea we had come to a special \n     place,'' Mosher said. Just how special, was soon to be \n     revealed: After the gentlemen disembarked from Mosher's car, \n     Phillis turned around to peek at the two. She saw they had \n     started punching each other again, and suggested Mosher take \n     a look.\n       ``Well, honey,'' she said. ``Welcome to the Christly \n     Kingdom.''\n\n\n                   Reciting Frost at a covered bridge\n\n       Kingdomy words like Christly--if there's another word like \n     Christly--were flowing from the front seat, sprinkling my way \n     that day.\n       Gool, Glenn said. What is that word?\n       It's a dam, Mosher said.\n       At least he thinks it is, and that's how he uses it. He \n     picked it up from the locals many years ago; people talk \n     about taking a walk to the gool after supper.\n       What about carcajou? Glenn asked.\n       ``Wolverine,'' Mosher replied.\n       We talked about poems and poets and novels and writing that \n     day in the car--and outside it, too.\n       At a covered bridge in Coventry, which Mosher noted with \n     appreciation was set afire after it received historic \n     designation, we talked about Kingdom colors and seasons, \n     poised for change. The novelist recited a poem by Robert \n     Frost: Nature's first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold.\n     Her early leaf's a flower; But only so an hour.\n     Then leaf subsides to leaf.\n     So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day.\n     Nothing gold can stay.\n       Switching tenor and tone, Mosher launched into a story of a \n     Depression era whiskey runner and friend who, fleeing the \n     law, missed the curve at the bridge and wound up in the \n     river. He hid in the river while the feds passed by on the \n     bridge above, satisfied his thirst, and finally made his way \n     to Barre.\n       Stories like these, which Mosher heard from Kingdom old-\n     timers and which still give him a kick, persuaded Mosher he \n     had found his living and writing place. (``Imagine if \n     Faulkner got here first,'' he said.)\n\n\n                       Wise people of the Kingdom\n\n       Mosher found, in the woods and village, not just stories, \n     but wisdom and guidance and important friendship--in \n     particular from two people. As a pair, the two are as \n     improbable as Mosher's talking turtle or spire-climbing \n     tomboy.\n       James Hayford, who died in 1993 at age 79, was a \n     Montpelier-born poet who settled in Orleans, where he had a \n     teaching career. Hayford studied poetry with Robert Frost at \n     Amherst College, and captured the life of his village in \n     verse.\n       The memory of meeting Hayford, at a teachers' party in \n     Orleans, is as vivid as the day his kids were born, Mosher \n     said. Hayford, a scholar of Vermont, assured Mosher he would \n     find his voice as a novelist.\n       Frost had assured Hayford he would find his poet's voice, \n     Mosher said.\n       From Moore, a close friend, he heard real life stories of \n     traveling in a boxcar with a menagerie of animals, of cooking \n     in a lumber camp and waitressing in a dance hall. He heard a \n     different voice assure him he'd find his way.\n       After her first marriage fell apart, Moore allowed herself \n     to cry only after her sow's 13th--and final--piglet was born.\n       ``Margie, my girl,'' she said to herself. ``What have you \n     done with your life?''\n       ``And she told me that right when I was trying to figure \n     out what to do with mine,'' Mosher said.\n       In their ways, characterized by a fierce independence of \n     mind, Hayford and Moore are among the great people he has \n     known, geniuses to some degree, Mosher said.\n       ``They could've gone anywhere, done anything and been \n     anything including president of the United States,'' Mosher \n     said.\n       ``What they wanted to do was live in the Northeast \n     Kingdom.''\n       Mosher spoke wise words of his own that day from the front \n     seat. After asking if we'd like to stop for lunch at \n     McDonald's--holy moley! McDonald's in the land of the \n     localvores and I'm carsick!--Mosher said something I've \n     passed on to my daughter.\n       He told Glenn and me he's never known a person who pursued \n     an interest in the arts and regretted it.\n       But he could think of many people who turned away from \n     artistic interests and talents, and did.\n\n\n                         Go back while you can\n\n       Teachers' pay wasn't so great in Orleans back in 1964, \n     Mosher discovered not long after the drunk brawlers guided \n     him to the school. By then, however, he'd had his first \n     Kingdom epiphany--and that was clearly worth something.\n       Still, the working plan was to teach a few years, save \n     money and go to graduate school. Was it possible on a salary \n     of $4,100, and less than that for Phillis? Sensing hesitation \n     from the teaching recruits from upstate New York, the \n     superintendent asked the couple if they fished. When they \n     answered yes, he took them to the Barton River.\n       The trout were jumping that spring day, making their way up \n     river.\n       ``I looked at Phillis, she looked at me,'' Mosher said. The \n     sight of the fish jumping the falls persuaded them to move to \n     Orleans. They accepted the teaching jobs, and taught for a \n     few years before moving to California, where Mosher planned \n     to get his master's of fine arts in writing. He scrapped that \n     plan after eight days, long enough for a truck driver to pull \n     up to the Moshers' car at Hollywood and Vine in L.A., and \n     deliver a message on seeing their green license plates. ``I'm \n     from Vermont, too,'' the trucker driver\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\n     said. ``Go back while you still can.'' The stories Mosher \n     wanted to tell were rich and ready and far from Hollywood and \n     Vine. ``I cut myself off from all my material before I \n     understood it well enough to write about it,'' Mosher said. \n     They headed home; Mosher to write, Phillis to teach. ``We \n     knew right away we had found a gold mine of stories,'' Mosher \n     said. ``And we found out nobody had written them. I couldn't \n     believe it. It took me 15 years or so to begin to figure out \n     how to do it.''\n       Much of his first novel, ``Disappearances,'' was written in \n     the library/opera house in Derby Line, a granite and brick \n     building that straddles the U.S.-Canada border. Mosher would \n     place half his chair in the U.S., and half in the foreign \n     country, when he wrote. He sometimes got such a kick from his \n     own work, he created a disturbance. Or so the librarian \n     thought. ``I would burst into gales of laughter with each new \n     outrageous passage,'' Mosher recalled. `` ` Mr. Mosher,' he \n     was warned, if you can't control yourself, we will have to \n     ask you to leave.' ''\n\n\n                     Keep the kids out of the mill\n\n       Talking in hushed library tones in the dual nation reading \n     room where he wrote Disappearances,'' Mosher said he was \n     amusing himself during the writing of the book. ``But I was \n     also in a state of desperation,'' he said. ``There's a degree \n     of desperation about the writing.''\n       Decades later, Mosher is amused by the response to \n     ``Disappearances'' of Wallace Stegner, the famous novelist \n     who lived in Greensboro. Stegner read Mosher's book to write \n     a possible blurb for the cover.\n       Stegner, the story goes, didn't get too far before \n     crumpling up the manuscript and throwing it in the fire, \n     announcing: ``This book is a hymn to irresponsibility.''\n       ``I didn't know enough to use it,'' Mosher said.\n       Mosher drove us past the place in Irasburg that would serve \n     as a springboard for perhaps his best known story: the house \n     where a black minister was living in the summer of 1968, when \n     his home was shot at. The racial shooting, which came to be \n     called the Irasburg Affair, informed Mosher's 1989 novel, ``A \n     Stranger in the Kingdom.''\n       We visited, too, a place that will figure in the book \n     Mosher is writing. His forthcoming novel also has a black man \n     as a central character: Alexander Twilight, believed to be \n     the first black person in the country to graduate from \n     college (Middlebury, 1823).\n       We walked outside the wonderful stone schoolhouse, \n     reminiscent of the Middlebury campus, Twilight designed and \n     built on a quiet plateau in Brownington. Twilight was \n     principal of the school, and a minister and state legislator.\n       ``He had a dream,'' Mosher said of Twilight.\n       ``There's no doubt about it.''\n       When the Moshers started teaching in Orleans, they were \n     instructed by the district superintendent to ``keep the kids \n     out of the mill.'' The administrator was referring to the \n     Ethan Allen furniture factory, which appears in Mosher's \n     novels as American Heritage.\n       Mosher, whose first apartment was next to the mill, said he \n     heard the words ``keep the kids out of the mill; keep the \n     kids out of the mill'' rise in rhythmic chant from the \n     plant's vents outside his window.\n       It is unlikely the long-ago superintendent, issuing that \n     directive, had in mind the manner by which Mosher would \n     fulfill the mandate. But any Kingdom kid who has found his \n     way to Mosher's novels, is transported to a place that is \n     true to the mill, and the river nearby, yet worlds apart and \n     away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6043-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JACK WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nJack Williams of Boston, MA. For the past 30 years, Jack, a well-\nrespected veteran news anchor, has hosted WBZ-TV's ``Wednesday's \nChild'', the longest-running adoptive-family-recruitment TV feature in \nthe Nation. Since ``Wednesday's Child'' first aired on WBZ in 1981, \nJack Williams has used the weekly news segment to tell the story of \nmore than 1,000 special needs children who are in need of loving, safe \nand permanent homes. Thanks to Jack's effort, many of these children \nhave found ``forever'' homes with viewers of the weekly segment.\n  Jack Williams has used his notoriety and public platform to provide \nan invaluable service that has changed the lives of so many children \nand their adoptive parents. ``Wednesday's Child'' is backed by the \nEndowment for Wednesday's Child, an exemplary nonprofit with very \nlittle overhead and no employees. In fact, Jack and Marcie are the sole \nemployees of the Endowment for Wednesday's Child; they have never drawn \na salary and run the foundation out of a home office.\n  The Endowment for ``Wednesday's Child'' is supported by individual \nand corporate donations including Wendy's Restaurants, as well as \nVolvo, which donates a vehicle for the ``Win a Volvo, Help \n``Wednesday's Children'' campaign. The endowment has raised and donated \nmillions to worthy nonprofits that assist with special needs adoptions. \nAmong these are the Massachusetts Adoption Resource Exchange and group \nhomes including the Walker Home, St. Ann's Home in Methuen and the \nItalian Home for Children in Jamaica Plain.\n  I also thank WBZ-TV for being exemplary stewards of the public \nairwaves in allowing Jack to use his position for such a noble cause.\n  On November 6, the Massachusetts Adoption Resource Exchange, other \nWednesday's Child beneficiaries and Wednesday's Child ``alumni'' will \ngather to honor Jack Williams' 30 years of service to Massachusetts' \nfoster children in need of permanent homes. I join them in \ncongratulating Jack and Marcie and all those who support Wednesday's \nChild for their hard work and generosity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6043-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL DAVID J. BIXLER\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I honor Corporal David J. \nBixler for his courage, heroism and selfless dedication to the U.S. \nArmy and his fellow soldiers.\n  CPL David J. Bixler of Harrison, AR, recently received the United \nService Organizations Soldier of the Year Award for distinguishing \nhimself both on the battlefield and during his recovery from the wounds \nhe received from his actions during a firefight in the Arghandab River \nValley of Afghanistan.\n  On September 30, 2010, Corporal Bixler and his platoon conducted a \npatrol in the volatile and dangerous region to talk with some local \nelders. During the mission, Corporal Bixler was assigned a small team \nof Afghan National Army soldiers to lead. The patrol came under heavy \nenemy fire forcing the unit to turn back to safety.\n  Corporal Bixlers following actions are heroic and inspiring. As the \npatrol turned around, one of the Afghan Army partners stepped outside \nof the cleared path and Corporal Bixler, recognizing the danger ran \nafter the Afghan soldier. As he attempted to shove the soldier back \nonto the cleared path, he detonated an IED that caused extensive damage \nto his body. Through this courageous and selfless action, he saved the \nlife of the Afghan soldier and the other members of his patrol. For his \nheroism, he was awarded the Silver Star.\n  Throughout his difficult recovery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, \nCorporal Bixler has been an inspiration to those around him and to his \nunit that continues its service overseas.\n  CPL David Bixler has not only met the criteria for the Soldier of the \nYear Award, but eclipsed it. Words cannot express how proud I am of \nCorporal Bixler and his valor and bravery now how grateful I am for his \nservice. We thank him, and all our servicemen and women, for their \nsacrifice and efforts on our behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6043-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6043-S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I wish to commend the American \nAcademy of Arts and Sciences on the occasion of the institution's \nOctober 1, 2011, induction ceremony for the 231st class of members in \nCambridge, MA. These 211 new members earned election to the American \nAcademy of Arts and Sciences for extraordinary individual achievement \nand are among the world's most influential artists, scientists, \nscholars, authors, and institutional leaders. In accepting membership \ninto the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, these individuals \nagreed to contribute their talents, experience, and knowledge to help \nthe academy advance the Nation's social welfare.\n  The American Academy of Arts and Sciences is an august, \nquintessentially American institution founded by Massachusetts' own \nJohn Adams and other scholar-patriots during our Nation's struggle for \nindependence. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences is currently \nchaired by Louis W. Cabot and led by President Leslie C. Berlowitz and \nis a vital center of knowledge focused on the great challenges and \nconcerns of the day, from science and technology policy to global \nsecurity; social policy to the humanities; and culture, and education.\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\n  I won't read all 211 of the new members' names, but listed among \nthese brilliant individuals are;\n  Dr. Daniel Arie Haber, the leading physician-scientist whose research \nhas focused on the molecular genetics of human cancer. He identified \ngenes implicated in breast cancer development and in Wilms' tumor, a \nchildren's kidney cancer.\n  Chester C. Langway, Jr., who is responsible for launching the era of \ndeep ice core drilling programs. He recruited scientists from other \ndisciplines and countries to work on ice cores and collaborated closely \nwith them. Consequently, international teams of scientists have \nextracted fundamental information from ice cores, and studies have \nprovided detailed climatological and other environmental data, over a \ngeological time period including the Holocene and late Pleistocene \nages, on the regional and global conditions existing at the time of \nsnow deposit. Results reveal man's impact on the changing environment \nand long-term evidence regarding abrupt global climate changes and led \nto discovery of the Dansgaard-Oeschger event.\n  Dr. W. Jason Morgan, who was the first to propose that Earth's \nsurface is made up of a number of rigid crustal blocks, establishing \nthe kinematic framework for the paradigm of plate tectonics, which \nrevolutionized the study of Earth and its history.\n  Also included in this group is Robert Kraft, who is probably best \nknown as the owner of our beloved New England Patriots but has also \ndedicated his life to advancing science, philanthropy, the arts, and \neducation.\n  I am including for the Record the names of all 211 inductees into the \nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences. I wish them all the best and \nthank them for their contribution to the knowledge of our Nation.\n  The information follows:\n\n                        THE 231ST CLASS OF MEMBERS, AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Name                                    Affiliation                          Location\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDr. Richard Warren Aldrich..............

ALFONSO BATRES\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to recognize Dr. Alfonso Batres with the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for his dedicated service to our Nation's veterans. Dr. Batres \nis a Vietnam veteran who now serves as the chief officer for \nReadjustment Counseling Service, where he has devoted his career to \nbuilding a national network of community-based vet centers. At these \nvet centers, veterans can obtain counseling, job assistance, and \nmedical referrals, in addition to other services.\n  Dr. Batres was recently awarded a 2011 Samuel J. Heyman Service to \nAmerica Medal from the Partnership for Public Service. The award, also \nknown as a ``Sammy,'' is awarded annually to exceptional Federal \nemployees. Specifically, Dr. Batres was awarded the 2011 Career \nAchievement Medal, which recognizes a Federal employee for significant \naccomplishments throughout a lifetime of achievement in public service.\n  Under Dr. Batres' leadership, the number of vet centers across the \ncountry has dramatically expanded from 200 to 300 in an effort to meet \nthe growing needs of hundreds of thousands of combat veterans and their \nfamilies. In addition, Dr. Batres created and launched 50 mobile vet \ncenters, greatly improving the access to services available to \nveterans. Dr. Batres also developed the Combat Call Center, a national \ncall-in service where combat veterans can call in to talk to another \ncombat veteran regarding any readjustment issues they may be facing.\n  Dr. Batres is an especially deserving recipient of the Career \nAchievement Medal as he has led the Vet Center Program to provide \nservices to a record level of veterans and their family members. As a \nresult of Dr. Batres' efforts, over 191,000 veterans and their family \nmembers visited vet centers nearly 1.3 million times in the year 2010 \nalone.\n  Vet centers have proven so successful due to the unique services they \nprovide, which seek to treat the whole person. At vet centers, combat \nveterans can receive counseling from other combat veterans who truly \nunderstand the struggles veterans face. In 2010, approximately 80 \npercent of vet center staff members were veterans, 60 percent were \ncombat veterans, and approximately one third of all Vet Center staff \nhad served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  In addition, vet centers are located in convenient locations within \ncommunities that possess a large population of underserved veterans. \nThe programs are constantly adapting to meet the evolving needs of \nveterans and have strict protections in place in order to ensure \nmaximum privacy for veterans. This is a truly revolutionary method of \ndelivering services and Dr. Batres' vision, along with his natural \npropensity to foster young talent, have proven invaluable in its \nsuccess.\n  Dr. Batres' selfless service on behalf of our Nation's veterans has \ngreatly improved the lives of many, and I am so pleased to see his \nachievements recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6046-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO W. TODD GRAMS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to recognize W. Todd Grams for his service to our Nation's \nveterans. Mr. Grams serves as the chief financial officer and executive \nin charge for the Office of Management at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, where he has led the effort to improve the provision of \nbenefits for our veterans through efficient financial management.\n  Mr. Grams was recently awarded the prestigious 2011 Samuel J. Heyman \nService to America Management Excellence Medal from the Partnership for \nPublic Service. The award, also known as a ``Sammy,'' is one of the \nmost important annual awards provided to Federal civil servants who \nhave made a significant contribution to our country. Mr. Grams was \nrecognized for his leadership in integrating and streamlining VA's \noperations, reducing costs, and improving delivery of services to \nveterans.\n  Mr. Grams is a worthy recipient of the Management Excellence Medal. \nIn his role as VA chief financial officer, he has demonstrated not only \nthe courage, but also the creativity and tenacity necessary to help VA \nmaximize value for our veterans. Along with the help of his qualified \nteam, Mr. Grams' initial push for an in-depth analysis of VA's \nfinancial management priorities allowed VA to serve veterans with \nhigher quality service and care. He redirected resources to lower the \ncost and risk for investment for VA. Furthermore, Mr. Grams integrated \nthe management governance structure and established systems that \nallowed VA to spend money more wisely and improve services to veterans.\n  I appreciate Mr. Grams' hard work and dedication at VA, and I am so \npleased that his extraordinary talents and effort have been \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6046-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6046-S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THEODORE M. DOLNEY\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I honor Theodore M. Dolney, a \nveteran of World War II and a member of this Nation's Greatest \nGeneration.\n  Mr. Dolney, on behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to \nsay ``thank you'' for your service to this Nation.\n  I am proud to share Mr. Dolney's story of heroism, because like so \nmany others, it is a story that should never be forgotten.\n  Ted Dolney joined the Army in April of 1941, after spending the first \n19 years of his life growing up on his family farm in Glenville, SD. \nAfter training, the Army sent Mr. Dolney to northern Africa. In \nFebruary of 1943, German troops captured him and took him as a prisoner \nof war.\n  Mr. Dolney spent 27 months more than 2 years of his life imprisoned \nby Nazis. Mr. Dolney was moved from place to place in Germany. \nConditions were cruel and brutal. Food was scarce. In fact, Mr. Dolney \nsays many American POWs would have died if it had not been for \nsupplemental food packages sent by the Red Cross.\n  Because Mr. Dolney knew how to speak German, and because he had the \nstrength to work as a POW on railroads, he sometimes got extra food.\n  On the eve of the invasion of Normandy, some of the prisoners \nsmuggled in a radio. Hours later, they heard news of the allies landing \nin France.\n  Months later, when Germany lost the war, the Nazi guards simply ran \naway. Mr. Dolney and the others left on foot to find help. After \nwalking several days, they finally encountered American soldiers. And \nthey were sent home as heroes.\n  Ted Dolney returned to the United States. He moved to Montana where \nhe met Darlene, his wife of 50 years. He worked for three decades as a \nlineman for the Rural Electrification Administration.\n  But Mr. Dolney never received recognition for his service and \nsacrifice as\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\na Prisoner of War in World War II. And throughout his life, he never \ncomplained.\n  In 1973, his military records were destroyed by a fire in St. Louis.\n  But after his family reached out to my office, we were able to secure \nthe medals Mr. Dolney never received.\n  Last month, I had the honor of presenting to Ted, a Bronze Star, and \na European-African-Middle-Eastern Campaign Medal with four Bronze \nService Stars.\n  It was also my honor to present an American Defense Service Medal, \nand a World War II Victory Medal.\n  Last month I also presented to Ted: a Combat Infantryman Badge First \nAward, a Good Conduct Medal, and the Honorable Service Lapel Button, \nWorld War II.\n  These seven medals are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6047-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN HORIGAN\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor John L. \nHorigan, a veteran of Vietnam.\n  John, on behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say \n``thank you'' for your service to this Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of John Horigan's sacrifice in \nVietnam, because no story of heroism should ever fall through the \ncracks.\n  John joined the Army in October of 1967. He was part of the 86th \nTransportation Company, based in Long Binh, Vietnam.\n  His job? Operating equipment and driving trucks for the Army in \nunimaginable, dangerous conditions.\n  On August 26, 1968, John's unit came under fire. And he was shot in \nthe arm and in the back.\n  John returned to the United States after 2 years of service to this \nNation. He worked as a millwright in California, and eventually moved \nwith his wife Cindy to the Big Sky State of Montana, where he is \nwelcome as a hero.\n  After his return home, the military lost John Horigan's records. And \nhe never received the recognition he earned more than 40 years ago. \nThroughout that time, he never complained.\n  Last month, I had the honor of presenting to John, in the presence of \nhis family, a Purple Heart, and a Vietnam Service Medal and Bronze Star \nAttachment.\n  It was also my honor to present a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and \na National Defense Service Medal.\n  Last month I also presented to John: a Republic of Vietnam Campaign \nRibbon with Device, and the Cold War Recognition Certificate.\n  These six decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols \nof true heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6047-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO POSTMASTER SHAUNA D. ANDREWS\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize and honor \nPostmaster Shauna D. Andrews, of Hereford, OR, for her exceptional \nservice to her customers and dedication to her neighbors.\n  Located in eastern Oregon, Hereford is a highly rural, unincorporated \ncommunity in Baker County. Although Hereford is unincorporated it has a \npost office that serves approximately 100 postal patrons. Like many \nrural postmasters, Shauna knows her customers well and connects with \nthem on a regular basis; especially older folks who don't have access \nto the Internet, cell phones, and other conveniences that are driving \ndown the traditional use of post offices. In Hereford, the post office \nis a place where people send and receive packages, including mail order \nprescriptions and vote by mail.\n  Over the years, Shauna, who is also a first responder, has \ndemonstrated a strong commitment to the folks she considers customers \nand neighbors. During the week of September 19, 2011, she became \nconcerned when an 85-year-old patron who lives alone on a rural route \nfailed to collect her mail. After 2 days, she grew worried and decided \nto go to the patron's home. When Shauna and her 19-year-old son arrived \nat the patron's house, they discovered the woman lying incapacitated on \nthe floor. Shauna immediately called Baker City for transport to the \nnearest hospital, located 38 miles from Hereford. As of last week, the \npatron remained in the hospital in Baker City. It is more than a \npossibility that by taking the time to check on her postal patron, \nShauna saved this woman's life.\n  Shauna has displayed exceptional service and dedication to her \ncustomers and neighbors. The Hereford Post Office is on the national \nclosure study list and as we address the future of the Postal Service, \nit is absolutely imperative that we examine the function of post \noffices in rural communities. As Shauna has demonstrated, many rural \npostmasters know their customers well and having a post office is \ncentral to a town's identity and vitality.\n  I recognize Shauna Andrews for her exceptional service to the \ncommunity of Hereford. Her example is one from which we can all \nlearn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6047-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6047-4", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6047-5", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6047-S6048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LEGISLATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE UNITED STATES-\n                   KOREA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT--PM 24\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \nreports and papers; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to \nimplement the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (Agreement), a \nlandmark agreement that supports American jobs, advances U.S. \ninterests, and reflects America's fundamental values.\n  The Agreement levels the playing field for U.S. businesses, workers, \nfarmers, ranchers, manufacturers, investors, and service providers by \noffering them unprecedented access to Korea's nearly $1 trillion \neconomy. The Agreement eliminates tariffs on over 95 percent of U.S. \nexports of industrial and consumer goods to Korea within the first 5 \nyears and, together with the agreement entered into through an exchange \nof letters in February 2011, addresses key outstanding concerns of \nAmerican automakers and workers regarding the lack of a level playing \nfield in Korea's auto market. The Agreement also ensures that almost \ntwo-thirds of current U.S. agricultural exports will enter Korea duty-\nfree immediately. In addition, the Agreement will give American service \nproviders much greater access to Korea's $580 billion services market.\n  The Agreement contains state of the art provisions to help protect \nand enforce intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory red tape, \nand eliminate regulatory barriers to U.S. exports. The Agreement also \ncontains the highest standards for protecting labor rights, carrying \nout covered environmental agreements, and ensuring that key domestic \nlabor and environmental laws are enforced, combined with strong \nremedies for noncompliance.\n  Increased U.S. exports expected under the Agreement will support more \nthan 70,000 American jobs. The Agreement will bolster our economic \ncompetitiveness in the Asia-Pacific region and our regional security \ninterests. The United States once was the top supplier of goods \nexported to Korea. Over the past decade, our share of Korea's import \nmarket for goods has fallen from 21 percent to just 10 percent--behind \nChina and Japan, and barely ahead of the European Union (EU). The EU \nand several other trading partners are negotiating or have recently \nconcluded trade agreements with Korea. If\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\nthe United States-Korea trade agreement is not approved, the United \nStates could lose further market share, export-supported jobs, and \neconomic growth opportunities, with damage to our leadership position \nin the region.\n  As a part of an ambitious trade agenda, it is important that the \nCongress renew a strong and robust Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nconsistent with reforms enacted in 2009. Renewal of that program is \nnecessary to support Americans who need training and other services \nwhen their jobs are adversely affected by trade. As we expand access to \nother markets abroad, we need to ensure that American workers are \nprovided the tools needed to take advantage of these opportunities and \nare not left behind in the global economy.\n  Approving and implementing the Agreement is an opportunity to shape \nhistory. We must seize the moment together to support jobs for the \nAmerican people today and to sustain U.S. leadership well into the 21st \ncentury. I urge the Congress to enact this legislation promptly.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, October 3, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6048-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LEGISLATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE UNITED STATES-\n                PANAMA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT--PM 25\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \nreports and papers; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to \nimplement the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement \n(Agreement).

The Agreement \nwill create significant new opportunities for American workers, \nfarmers, ranchers, manufacturers, investors, and businesses by opening \nPanama's market and eliminating barriers to U.S. goods, services, and \ninvestment.\n  The Agreement also represents an important development in our \nrelations with Panama, and accords with the goal, as expressed by the \nCongress in the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, to conclude \ncomprehensive, mutually advantageous trade agreements with beneficiary \ncountries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative trade preference program. \nThe Agreement further reflects a commitment on the part of the United \nStates to sustained engagement in support of democracy, economic \ngrowth, and opportunity in Panama and the region.\n  Panama is one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America. Upon \nentry into force of the Agreement, Panama will immediately eliminate \nits tariffs on over 87 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and \nindustrial goods and on more than half of U.S. exports of agricultural \ngoods. Panama will eliminate most other duties on U.S. exports within a \n15-year transition period. Eighty-five percent of U.S. businesses \nexporting to Panama are small- and medium-sized enterprises. The \nelimination of duties provided for in the Agreement will help to level \nthe playing field for them and for all U.S. exporters, based on 2010 \ntrade flows, as approximately 98 percent of our imports from Panama \nalready enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market. In addition, the \nAgreement will give American service providers greater access to \nPanama's $20.6 billion services market.\n  The Agreement contains state of the art provisions to help protect \nand enforce intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory red tape, \nand eliminate regulatory barriers to U.S. exports. The Agreement also \ncontains the highest standards for protecting labor rights, carrying \nout covered environmental agreements, and ensuring that key domestic \nlabor and environmental laws are enforced, combined with strong \nremedies for noncompliance. Panama has already made significant reforms \nrelated to the obligations it will have under the labor chapter.\n  As a part of an ambitious trade agenda, it is important that the \nCongress renew a strong and robust Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nconsistent with reforms enacted in 2009.

The Agreement is an important part of my Administration's \nefforts to spur economic growth, increase exports, and create jobs in \nthe United States, while promoting our core values. The Agreement will \ncreate significant new opportunities for American workers, farmers, \nranchers, businesses, and consumers by opening the Colombian market and \neliminating barriers to U.S. goods, services, and investment.\n  The Agreement also represents a historic development in our relations \nwith Colombia. Colombia is a steadfast strategic partner of the United \nStates and a leader in the region. The Agreement reflects the \ncommitment of the United States to supporting democracy and economic \ngrowth in Colombia. It will also help Colombia battle production of \nillegal crops by creating alternative economic opportunities.\n  Under the Agreement, tariffs on over 80 percent of U.S. consumer and \nindustrial exports will be eliminated immediately. United States \nagricultural exports in particular will enjoy substantial new \nimprovements in access to Colombia's market. Currently, no U.S. \nagricultural exports enjoy duty-free access to Colombia. Once the \nAgreement enters into force, almost 70 percent, by value, of current \nU.S. agricultural exports will be able to enter Colombia duty-free \nimmediately. In addition, the Agreement will give American service \nproviders greater access to Colombia's $134 billion services market. \nThis will help to level the playing field, since 91 percent of our \nimports from Colombia have enjoyed duty-free access to our market under \nU.S. trade preference programs.\n  The Agreement contains state of the art provisions to help protect \nand enforce intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory red tape, \nand eliminate regulatory barriers to U.S. exports. The Agreement also \ncontains the highest standards for protecting labor rights, carrying \nout covered environmental agreements, and ensuring that key domestic \nlabor and environmental laws are enforced, combined with strong \nremedies for noncompliance. Colombia has already made significant \nreforms related to the obligations it will have under the labor \nchapter. A number of these steps have been taken in fulfillment of the \ncommitments Colombia made in the agreed Action Plan Related to Labor \nRights that President Santos and I announced on April 7. Colombia must \nsuccessfully implement key elements of the Action Plan before I will \nbring the Agreement into force.\n  This Agreement forms an integral part of my Administration's larger \nstrategy of doubling exports by the end of 2014 through opening markets \naround the world. In addition, the Agreement provides an opportunity to \nstrengthen our economic and political ties with the Andean region, and \nunderpins U.S. support for democracy\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\nwhile contributing to further hemispheric integration and economic \ngrowth in the United States. This Agreement is vital to ensuring \nColombia continues on its trajectory of positive change.\n  As a part of an ambitious trade agenda, it is important that the \nCongress renew a strong and robust Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nconsistent with reforms enacted in 2009. Renewal of that program is \nnecessary to support Americans who need training and other services \nwhen their jobs are adversely affected by trade. As we expand access to \nother markets abroad, we need to ensure that American workers are \nprovided the tools needed to take advantage of these opportunities and \nare not left behind in the global economy.\n  Approval of the Agreement is therefore in our national interest. I \nurge the Congress to enact this legislation promptly.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, October 3, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6049-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LETTERS EXCHANGED BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND KOREA THAT CONTAIN \n THOSE COMMITMENTS, WHICH FURTHER ENHANCE THE UNITED STATES-KOREA FREE \n                         TRADE AGREEMENT--PM 27\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \nreports and papers; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  By separate message, I have transmitted to the Congress a bill to \napprove and implement the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of P.S. 103 in West Baltimore, Maryland and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Justice \nThurgood Marshall's Elementary School Study Act. The elementary school \nthat Justice Marshall attended, known as PS 103, located in my hometown \nof Baltimore, is a place of national significance because it marks the \nsite where one of our Nation's greatest legal minds began his \neducation.\n  Thurgood Marshall is well known as one of the most significant \nhistorical figures of the American civil rights movement. By the time \nhe was 32, he was appointed the chief legal counsel for the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP. He served at \nthe NAACP a total of 25 years and was a key strategist to end racial \nsegregation throughout the United States.\n  Perhaps the greatest illustration of this effort was his victory \nbefore the Supreme Court overturning the Plessy doctrine of `separate \nbut equal' and ending school segregation with the landmark decision in \nBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, KS in 1954. Not only did this \ncase open up educational opportunity and sparked the civil rights \nmovement in this nation, it also established Thurgood Marshall, still a \nyoung attorney from Baltimore, as one of the greatest legal minds in \nall the land. This case was just one of the 29 cases he won before the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  Fittingly, Marshall was the first African American confirmed to the \nSupreme Court. He was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967 \nand served 24 years, until 1991. On the high court, Marshall continued \nhis fight for the Constitutional protection of individual human rights.\n  But Thurgood Marshall was not always a legal giant. He was once a \nyoung boy growing up in West Baltimore. He received the first 6 years \nof his public education at PS 103. An apocryphal story goes that a \nyoung Thurgood Marshall studied the U.S. Constitution in the basement \nof the\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nbuilding while serving detention. Regardless of whether or not this is \ntrue, the building powerfully tells the story of racial segregation in \nAmerica, PS 103 was a ``blacks only'' school when Justice Marshall was \na student there, and the rise of one of the country's paramount \nthinkers and pioneers in the civil rights movement.\n  The building is located at 1315 Division Street in the Upton \nNeighborhood of Old West Baltimore. The building is part of the Old \nWest Baltimore National Register Historic District, and is listed as a \ncontributing historic resource for the neighborhood. The Old West \nBaltimore historic district is one of the largest predominately African \nAmerican historic districts in the country, and its significance is \ncentered on the African American experience in the area.\n  In Baltimore, we are fortunate to have the National Park Service \noperate two historical sites, Fort McHenry and the Hampton Mansion. \nAdding PS 103 is a unique opportunity for the National Park Service to \nwork in Baltimore's inner-city and to expand its ability to engage \npeople around African American history.\n  Needless to say, Thurgood Marshall's legacy is one that should be \npreserved. He was one of our country's greatest legal minds and a \nprominent historical figure of one chapter of our country's great \nhistory--the civil rights movement. This bill authorizes the Secretary \nof the Interior to conduct a special resource study of PS 103 to \nevaluate the suitability and feasibility of establishing the building \nas a unit of the National Park Service. Preserving the building that \nwas Justice Marshall's elementary school will give Americans insight \ninto Justice Marshall's childhood.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 285\n\n       Whereas the United Nations has designated the first Monday \n     of October every year as World Habitat Day, and the theme of \n     2011 World Habitat Day is Cities and Climate Change;\n       Whereas World Habitat Day calls on global citizens to \n     reflect on the state of our towns and cities and the \n     importance of adequate shelter and serves as a reminder of \n     our collective responsibility for the future of the human \n     habitat;\n       Whereas approximately 51 percent of the world's population \n     currently lives in cities of all sizes and produces the \n     majority of the world's economic output;\n       Whereas projections indicate that \\2/3\\ of the world's \n     population will reside in cities just over a generation from \n     now;\n       Whereas approximately 1,000,000,000 people currently live \n     in slums, and more than half of this population is under the \n     age of 25;\n       Whereas it is estimated that, by 2030, the number of people \n     living in slums will double;\n       Whereas, according to the Center for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, approximately 884,000,000 people lack adequate \n     access to safe water, and nearly 50 percent of the developing \n     world's population, over 2,500,000,000 people, lack access to \n     sanitation services;\n       Whereas the Center for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates that unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, \n     and poor hygiene contribute to the deaths of more than \n     1,500,000 children younger than 5 years of age per year;\n       Whereas, according to the World Bank, more than \n     1,400,000,000 people still live without electricity, a \n     critical component of economic growth and development;\n       Whereas insecure lease and real property ownership tenure \n     often subject slum dwellers to arbitrary, supra-market rents, \n     forced evictions, threats, and harassment;\n       Whereas insecurity of land and property tenure severely \n     inhibits economic development by undermining investment \n     incentives and constraining the growth of credit markets, \n     imperils the ability of families to achieve sustainable \n     livelihoods and assured access to shelter, and often \n     contributes to conflict over property rights;\n       Whereas women are affected disproportionally by forced \n     evictions and insecure tenure as a result of gender-based \n     discrimination, often including gender-biased laws that \n     define women as legal minors or otherwise prevent them from \n     acquiring and securing land, property, and housing lease or \n     ownership rights, making them more vulnerable to poverty, \n     violence, and sexual abuse;\n       Whereas many of the world's large cities are located in \n     low-lying coastal areas that are more susceptible to \n     environmental events and face serious threats from the \n     effects of climate change such as storm surges;\n       Whereas the slum dwellers in low-lying coastal cities are \n     disproportionately affected by disasters;\n       Whereas, according to the International Organization for \n     Migration, there could be up to 200,000,000 environmentally-\n     induced migrants by 2050, many of whom will be forced from \n     their homes by rising sea levels and the increased frequency \n     of flooding or drought, thereby challenging the security of \n     the United States and United States allies;\n       Whereas adequate housing and universal access to basic \n     shelter serve as catalysts for economic, social, and \n     democratic development in the United States and elsewhere;\n       Whereas international organizations, faith-based groups, \n     and nonprofits are working towards providing safe, \n     affordable, and decent shelter for all; and\n       Whereas the 2006 National Security Strategy states, \n     ``America's national interests and moral values drive us in \n     the same direction: to assist the world's poor citizens and \n     least developed nations and help integrate them into the \n     global economy'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Habitat Day;

and\n       (H) improves environmental sustainability in urban areas; \n     and\n       (4) encourages the leaders and citizens of cities, which \n     are the source of, and solution to, many of the world's \n     development challenges, to build upon their successful \n     experiences and develop more ambitious goals for\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\n     urban sustainable development at the upcoming United Nations \n     Conference on Sustainable Development to be held June 4-6, \n     2012, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/03/senate-section/article/S6053-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 669.
