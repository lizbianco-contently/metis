Madam President, there has been a lot of discussion about \nthe affordable health care act passed by Congress. In fact, just next \nweek, across the street, the Supreme Court will take up this bill and \ndecide whether it is constitutional. It is an important decision. It is \none that will affect millions of Americans, and scarcely anyone \nunderstands the impact of this law and what it means to their daily \nlives.\n  The first aspect I wish to speak about is the most controversial \naspect of it, the so-called individual mandate. What is it? From my \npoint of view, it is a basic method of saying to everyone in America: \nYou have a personal responsibility. You cannot say you are just not \ngoing to buy any health insurance; that you don't think you are ever \ngoing to need it and are not going to worry about it.\n  The problem is, of course, those people who make that statement get \nsick. Some of them get involved in accidents. Some go to a doctor and \nare diagnosed with terrible illnesses and diseases that require \ntreatment and surgery, and that costs a lot of money. The uninsured \npeople show up at hospitals. They are not pushed away; they are invited \nin. They receive the treatment. Then they can't pay for it.\n  It turns out that 63 percent of the medical care given to uninsured \npeople in America isn't paid for--not by them. It turns out the rest of \nus pay for it. Everyone else in America who has health insurance has to \npick up the cost for those who did not accept their personal \nresponsibility to buy health insurance.\n  So, so what? What difference does that make? It makes a difference. \nIt adds $1,000 a year to our health insurance program. In other words, \nyou and me and everyone with health insurance is subsidizing those \npeople who say: Don't mandate anything on me. Don't tell me I have a \npersonal responsibility. But when I get sick, you can pay\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\nfor it.That is what the individual mandate comes down to.\n  I listen to those who say, well, this is just too darn much \ngovernment to say that people who can afford it need to have health \ninsurance. Keep in mind, this health care bill says if people cannot \nafford it--if they are too poor or their income is limited--there is a \nhelping hand, not only in the Tax Code but even through Medicaid to \nmake sure they have affordable health care insurance which will never \ncost them more than 8 percent of their income. A lot of American \nfamilies would jump at health insurance that would only cost 8 percent \nof their income. But the law says people have to be willing to pay up \nto 8 percent of their income to have health insurance. The reason, of \ncourse, is if they don't pay, everyone else pays. If they get sick, \nthey cost us $116 billion a year in uncompensated health care coverage \npaid for those who do not accept their personal responsibility to buy \nhealth insurance.\n  Ruth Marcus has an article in this morning's Washington Post, and I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2012]\n\n          116 Billion Reasons To Be for the Individual Mandate\n\n                            (By Ruth Marcus)\n\n       The most compelling sentences in the Obama administration's \n     brief defending the constitutionality of the health-care law \n     come early on. ``As a class,'' the brief advises on Page 7, \n     ``the uninsured consumed $116 billion of health-care services \n     in 2008.''\n       On the next page, the brief drives the point home: ``In \n     2008, people without insurance did not pay for 63 percent of \n     their health-care costs.''\n       Those figures amount to a powerful refutation of the \n     argument that the individual mandate--the requirement that \n     individuals obtain insurance or pay a penalty--exceeds the \n     government's authority to regulate interstate commerce. To \n     me, $116 billion seems like a whole lot of commerce.\n       But let's leave the Supreme Court justices to hack their \n     way through the underbrush of the Commerce Clause. Because \n     those numbers are not only relevant to Commerce Clause \n     jurisprudence, they illuminate the fundamental irrationality \n     of public opposition to the individual mandate.\n       The mandate is by far the most unpopular feature of a law \n     on which Americans are otherwise evenly divided. A Kaiser \n     Family Foundation poll this month found that two-thirds of \n     those surveyed disliked the mandate. Even among Democrats, a \n     majority (53 percent) opposed the requirement; independents \n     (66 percent) and Republicans (77 percent) were even more \n     hostile.\n       Yet this is a provision that the overwhelming majority--\n     those with insurance--should support, for the simple reason \n     that these people currently end up footing the bill for much \n     of that $116 billion.\n       As the government's brief notes, ``Congress found that this \n     cost-shifting increases the average premium for insured \n     families by more than $1,000 per year.''\n       In other words, those worried about having to pay ever-\n     higher premiums should be clamoring for the individual \n     mandate, not agitating for repeal.\n       Indeed, for all the bristling over the mandate, it will be \n     irrelevant to the 80 percent of non-elderly Americans who \n     already have insurance, either through their employers, \n     government programs, or purchased on their own.\n       The biggest real-world risk to these people would be if the \n     court were to overturn the mandate yet allow the rest of the \n     health-care law to remain in place, driving premiums ever \n     upward.\n       Amazingly, Republicans have managed to transform the \n     mandate from an exemplar of personal responsibility into the \n     biggest public policy bogeyman of all time.\n       The irony of the fight over the mandate is that President \n     Obama was against it before he was for it. During the 2008 \n     campaign, one of the signature differences between Obama and \n     Hillary Clinton was that Clinton's health plan included an \n     individual mandate whereas Obama's mandate covered only \n     children.\n       Once elected, Obama quickly recognized the inescapable \n     truth: An individual mandate was essential to make the plan \n     work. Without that larger pool of premium-payers, there is no \n     feasible way to require insurance companies to cover all \n     applicants and charge the same amount, regardless of their \n     heath status.\n       In part, hostility to the mandate reflects a broader \n     uneasiness with the perceived encroachment of big government.\n       In the Kaiser poll, 30 percent of those who opposed the \n     mandate cited government overreach as the biggest reason. Not \n     surprisingly, twice as many Republicans (40 percent) cited \n     that reason as did Democrats (18 percent).\n       But opposition to the mandate also stems from the public's \n     failure to understand--or, alternatively, the \n     administration's failure to communicate--basic facts.\n       For example, Kaiser found that when people were told that \n     most Americans ``would automatically satisfy the requirement \n     because they already have coverage through their employers,'' \n     favorability toward the mandate nearly doubled, to 61 \n     percent.\n       Favorable attitudes rose to nearly half when people were \n     told that without the mandate, insurance companies would \n     still be allowed to deny coverage to those who are sick; that \n     without the mandate people would wait until they were sick to \n     purchase insurance, driving up premium costs; or that those \n     unable to afford coverage are exempt.\n       ``People don't understand how the mandate works at all and \n     they don't understand why it's there,'' Kaiser's polling \n     director, Mollyann Brodie, told me.\n       Brodie suspects that it's too late to change minds. ``This \n     law as a whole has really become a symbolic issue to people \n     and they really aren't open to information,'' she said.\n       Maybe, but the administration must keep trying--not only to \n     sell the law's goodies but to explain how the mandate makes \n     them possible. Otherwise, they could end up winning the minds \n     of the justices, yet losing the hearts of the people whose \n     votes they need to keep the law in place.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this article spells it out. This issue \nof an individual mandate is an issue of personal responsibility. If you \nbelieve someone should be able to walk away from their responsibility \nto have health coverage they can afford and that their medical bills \nshould be your family's responsibility, then cheer on all these folks \nwho are saying we are going to repeal ObamaCare. That is what it boils \ndown to. Do you want to pay their bills? I don't think we should have \nto. I think everyone in this country should accept that responsibility.\n  There are some other aspects of the affordable health care act which \nwe don't hear talked about from those who are calling for its repeal. \nLet me tell my colleagues one. Do you have a child graduating from \ncollege, looking for a job? I have been in that circumstance. My wife \nand I raised three children. Some of them found a job, but it took a \nlittle while. While they were looking for a job, did you ever say to \nyour son or daughter fresh out of college: How about health insurance. \nThey probably said to you: Sorry, Mom; sorry, Dad. I can't do that now. \nWhen I get a job, I will get back to it. But I feel just fine. I feel \njust fine.\n  It doesn't work that way, and any responsible parent knows it. So we \nchanged the law, and here is what we said: If you have family health \ninsurance, it can cover your son or daughter up to the age of 26. That \nexpanded the reach of health insurance coverage. It covered these young \ncollege graduates and young people looking for work so they had that \nprotection even when they were unemployed.\n  So did it make any difference? Thanks to this provision, 2.5 million \nyoung people have gained coverage nationwide, and 102,000-plus in my \nState of Illinois. That means for 2.5 million parents, some peace of \nmind, knowing their kids are covered by the family plan. That was part \nof this bill which many Republican Presidential candidates are saying \nthey want to repeal. Really? Do you want to explain that to 2.5 million \nfamilies who have the peace of mind that their son or daughter is \ncovered with health insurance up to the age of 26?\n  How about the seniors paying for their Medicare prescription drug \nbills. There was this doughnut hole, which means if seniors have \nprescription drugs covered by Medicare and they are expensive, they \nwill reach a point during the course of a year when they have to go \ninto their savings to pay for about $2,000 worth of prescription drugs \nbefore the government comes back and starts helping them again. We \nstarted closing that doughnut hole, closing that gap, giving $250 of \nthat $2,000 they have to pay back to people in a rebate initially, and \nthen providing a discount on drugs for seniors. That is part of \naffordable care. That is part of what the Republicans scream is \nObamaCare.\n  Is it a good idea? Well, just ask 152,000 Medicare recipients in \nIllinois who have received this rebate to help pay for their \nprescription drugs. Ask 144,000 seniors in Illinois who have received a \n50-percent discount on drug costs, and then ask the millions across \nAmerica who have benefited. We are giving people on fixed incomes and \nlimited savings a helping hand so they can have the prescription drugs \nthey need to be healthy and strong and safe and independent. Is that \nwhat you want to be when you are a senior? Most of us do, and this bill \nhelps.\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\n  Third, this bill basically covers preventive services. We all know \nthe story: Get in and see a doctor for a colonoscopy or a mammogram. \nEarly detection and treatment is money saved and lives saved. We \nextended preventive care under Medicare. For 1.3 million Medicare \nrecipients in Illinois--just in my State, 1.3 million; more in the \nPresiding Officer's State--they have preventive care now that they \ndidn't have before. It means they are likely to stay healthy longer and \ncost less to our health care system. This is another aspect they want \nto repeal, those who are running against the affordable care act, \nrunning against the health care bill President Obama has pushed for.\n  There is also a provision which says insurance companies have to \nspend 80 percent of the premiums they collect--80 percent--on actual \nmedical care. They can take 20 percent for profits and administrative \ncosts and the like but 80 percent on actual medical care. The State of \nMinnesota already had that on the books, and it worked. So we said \nlet's do it nationwide so if premiums go up, it is to reimburse health \ncare--not to take out in profits, not to take it out in bonuses, not to \nspend on an advertising budget for an insurance company. That is a big \nchange. The insurance companies hate it like the devil hates holy \nwater, and the Republican Presidential candidates want to repeal it. I \nthink it is a sensible change to ensure coverage and one that we ought \nto protect, not prohibit.\n  There are other provisions in this law as well, but one that affects \nme personally and has affected, I am sure, thousands of Americans is \nthe question of preexisting conditions. Do you have one? A lot of \npeople do. A lot of people don't even know they have one. Sometimes \ninsurance companies dream them up. They would deny coverage for health \ninsurance if somebody had--get ready--acne, a preexisting condition so \nno coverage. If there is a history of suicide in a family, they would \ndeny them health care coverage, preexisting condition.\n  Let me just say to every parent listening: Thank the Lord if your \nchild doesn't have asthma, diabetes, or something more serious because \nuntil the affordable care act was passed, that was enough to disqualify \nyour child and maybe your family from health insurance coverage. Oh, \nthey can't wait to repeal that. They say: Let's repeal ObamaCare. Let's \nget rid of that preexisting condition provision, and let those \ninsurance companies deny coverage.\n  America, is that what you want? Is that what you are looking for? Is \nthat too much government to say to insurance companies: You can't deny \nchildren under the age of 18 health insurance coverage if they are \nvictims of diabetes, if they have had a bout with cancer, if they have \nasthma? Oh, some of these folks are for the Wild West: Get government \nout of my life.\n  I will tell my colleagues this: We know sensible regulation of \ninsurance coverage gives people peace of mind and gives families a \nchance to know their child with a challenge or a problem is still going \nto get the very best medical care.\n  There is something called lifetime limits, which is another change. \nYou go to the doctor, and the doctor says: Well, sorry to tell you, but \nyou have been diagnosed with a form of cancer. We can treat it. It is \ngoing to take aggressive chemo, radiation, maybe even surgery. It is \ngoing to take some time, and it is going to cost some money, but at the \nend of the day we are going to save your life, and you are going to \nlive. You are going to live to see your daughter's wedding, and you are \ngoing to live to see your grandchildren.\n\n  Then you get into it. You say: I am determined, my family is with me. \nI am going to pray for it and get the right outcome.\n  Guess what happens. It turns out the cost blows the lid off your \nhealth insurance coverage. You had a lifetime limit on how much they \nwould pay, which you never thought you would use until that diagnosis \ncame down. So now we have basically said we are removing lifetime \nlimits on health care. That is part of ObamaCare. That is part of the \naffordable care act.\n  So I say to my Republican friends and those running for President: \nYou want to go to the American Cancer Society and enter into a debate \nwith them about whether lifetime limits are the right thing to do? They \nare going to explain to you thousands and thousands of American \nexamples of why people with lifetime limits end up in a tragic \nsituation where they need more coverage, they need more care. Their \nlives can be saved, but their health care coverage is cut off. That was \nthe old days. That was before the affordable care act.\n  So those who want to repeal it stand up and get cheering crowds. In \nthose cheering crowds are cancer patients. They ought to stop and think \nbefore they start cheering and know what they are cheering for.\n  The affordable care act is a sensible, reasonable step in a direction \ntoward containing health care costs and making health care insurance \ncoverage fairer for Americans all across our Nation.\n  Is it a perfect law? Of course not. As I have said many times, the \nonly perfect law I am aware of was carried down a mountain on clay \ntablets by Senator Moses. Ever since, we have done our best. We can \nalways do better, and I am open to change, I am open to improvement. \nBut for those who want to walk away from the affordable care act, \nlisten to what they are walking away from.\n  They are imposing a $1,000 premium on families to pay for the \nuninsured who will not accept their personal responsibility to buy \nhealth insurance. They are walking away from helping seniors pay for \ntheir Medicare prescription drugs. They are turning their back on \nfamilies with young children fresh out of college looking for jobs, \nwith no health insurance coverage. They are inviting the insurance \ncompanies to once again turn down your child and your family because of \na preexisting condition. They are saying, once again: Let's get into \nthe world of lifetime limits on insurance no matter how much health \ncare costs.\n  That is their idea of a future--not mine, not my family's. I have \nlived through part of this. Many others have as well. So when you hear \ntheir cheering crowds about repealing the affordable care act, hoping \nthe Supreme Court finds some aspect unconstitutional, step back and ask \nthose cheering crowds about their own health insurance.\n  The last thing I want to say is this. It is interesting that Senators \nare debating this. You ought to see our health insurance. You ought to \nsee what we have as Members of Congress. We have the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program. Guess what. It is a government-administered \nprogram. Oh, my goodness. You mean Republican Senators are part of a \ngovernment-administered health care program? Yes. And you mean to tell \nme they have to deal with an insurance exchange? Yes. That is what the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program is.\n  Eight million Federal employees and their families choose once a \nyear--in my case from nine different plans that cover Illinois. We like \nour coverage in my family. Federal employees like their coverage. \nSenators like their coverage. But when it comes to extending this same \nbenefit to every other American, oh, what a horror story; that is too \nmuch government. Really? If you are a person of principle and believe a \ngovernment-administered health care plan is too much government, step \nup here in the well and tell people: I am giving up my Federal health \ninsurance.

Madam President, for the past several months, I and \nothers have been calling on the Democratic majority here in the Senate \nto take up and pass the various bipartisan jobs bills that House \nRepublicans have been sending across the dome. These bills on their own \ncertainly will not\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\nsolve the jobs crisis, but they will make it a lot easier for \nentrepreneurs and innovators to get the capital they need to build \nbusinesses and create jobs. And because these bills are more concerned \nwith getting Washington out of the way than getting it more involved, \nthese bills also send an important message that the economy and the \ncountry are a lot better off when folks have more control over their \neconomic destinies, not less.\n  Last night, we were on the cusp of passing a collection of bills \nknown as the JOBS Act. This bill had overwhelming bipartisan support in \nthe House. Nearly 400 Members voted for it. And the President himself \nsays it will create jobs, he supports it and would sign it into law.\n  Unfortunately, a handful of Democrats here in the Senate wants to \nslow it down. They denied Americans this bipartisan victory for jobs \nthat we could have had last night.\n  So this morning I would ask our friends on the other side to \nreconsider. I would ask them to put the politics aside and allow this \nbipartisan bill to actually move forward. We could pocket this \nachievement and move on to other measures, including the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which I suggested yesterday. \nOne bill alone cannot undo the damage inflicted on the economy by this \nadministration, but it sure could help, and we need to show the \nAmerican people we can do this.\n  This bill is exactly the kind of thing Americans have been asking \nfor: greater freedom and greater flexibility. That is one of the \nreasons it has had such overwhelming bipartisan support. At a moment \nwhen millions are looking for work and Democrats say they want more \nbipartisan action on jobs, this is it.\n  We are in the middle of March Madness here. To use a basketball \nmetaphor: This is a layup. Let's get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1876-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this week marks the 2-year \nanniversary of the President's health care law--one that is often \ndescribed as his signature legislative achievement. But you would not \nknow it based on the President's schedule this week. For a President \nwho is not particularly shy about taking credit even for things he did \nnot have anything to do with, he is curiously silent this week about a \nbill he talked about for more than a year before it passed. According \nto news reports, the President does not even plan to mark the occasion.\n  Well, we are happy--Republicans are very happy--to talk about it for \nhim, even though he is reluctant. We are happy to point out the ways in \nwhich this law has failed to live up to the promises the President made \nabout it. We are happy to make the case for why this unconstitutional \ninfringement on America's liberties needs to be repealed and replaced \nwith the kind of commonsense reforms Americans actually want.\n  Two years ago, then-Speaker Pelosi said:\n\n       We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is \n     in it.\n\n  Well, 2 years later, here is what we have found so far.\n  The Democrats' health care law has led and will continue to lead to \nhigher costs and hundreds of thousands of fewer jobs over the next \ndecade.\n  We now know it is loaded with broken promises, such as the one the \nPresident made over and over during the health care debate. He said:\n\n       If you like your current plan, you will be able to keep it.\n\n  According to the independent Congressional Budget Office, 3 million \nto 5 million Americans will lose their current plan each year under the \nmost likely scenario.\n  The health care law will strip billions out of Medicare and increase \nthe Medicaid rolls in States by nearly 25 million, costing already \ncash-strapped States an additional $118 billion and almost certainly \nlowering the quality of care for millions of Americans who depend on \nthis vital program.\n  In my State of Kentucky, an estimated 387,000 more people will be \nforced into Medicaid--at a time when Kentucky's Medicaid Program is \nalready facing huge deficits just trying to provide benefits to current \nMedicaid recipients. As a result of this law, more than a million \nKentuckians or 29 percent of my State's population will soon be on \nMedicaid. Kentucky's Governor, a Democrat, is on record saying he has \nno idea--no idea--how Kentucky will meet its responsibilities if the \nlaw forces several hundred thousand more people into the State's \nMedicaid Program. The math simply does not add up.\n\n  This is just one example of how the law is unsustainable and hurts \nthe most vulnerable the most. The bottom line is this: This health care \nlaw is an absolute mess--a mess--and the American people do not want \nit. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll out this week, more \nthan a half of Americans do not like it--a figure that has not changed \nmuch at all since the Democrats forced it through Congress 2 years go. \nTwo-thirds believe the Supreme Court should throw out the individual \nmandate or the whole law.\n  When it comes to the cost of health care, this law makes everything \nworse. Two and a half years ago, the President said his health care \nplan would ``slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our \nbusinesses, and our government.'' Yet the Obama administration itself \nnow admits total spending on health care will increase by $311 billion \nunder the President's health care law. According to the CBO, it \nincreases net Federal health spending and subsidies on health care by \n$390 billion, and drives up premiums on families by $2,100 per year.\n  Americans wanted lower costs and to have more control of their health \ncare decisions, and they got the opposite instead. They wanted lower \npremiums; they got higher premiums. They wanted a government that lives \nwithin its means, and they got a new entitlement instead. They wanted \nmore options; they got fewer. They wanted better care; it is going to \nbe worse. That is why Americans want this bill repealed.\n  Look, this bill would be unconstitutional even if it did the things \nthe President said it would. But the fact that it did the opposite of \nwhat he promised means it should be repealed either way, whether the \nconstitutionality of it is upheld or not.\n  It should say something when the President himself is not talking \nabout this bill except in closed campaign events.\n  It is time to repeal this bill and replace it with the kind of \ncommonsense reforms people want--reforms that actually lower costs, \nprotect jobs and State budgets, and return health care decisions back \nto individuals and their doctors. That is a reform that both parties \nand all Americans could support.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, those who have followed this debate know \nMembers can disagree, and, obviously, I disagree with the Republican \nleader on the issue of health care reform. I would say there are a \ncouple elements I would add.\n  Yes, we expand the Medicaid rolls. That is health insurance for those \nin low-income categories. But the Federal Government picks up the tab. \nIt is not an added expense to the State governments for 4 or 5 years, \nand we are hoping their economy gets better.\n  What about the 1 million Kentuckians who are going on the Medicaid \nrolls? Those 1 million Kentuckians have no health insurance today. Will \nthey ever get sick? Will they show up at a hospital? Yes, they will. \nWho will pay for their bills? The rest of the folks living in Kentucky \nwith health insurance and the rest of us.\n  Is that fair? Do these people have a personal responsibility to have \nhealth insurance, as long as we help them, if they are in lower income \ncategories, pay the premiums with tax breaks and enrolling them in \nMedicaid? Of course they do.\n  Accepting personal responsibility used to be the first thing the \nRepublicans told us about their family values. Why don't people have to \naccept personal responsibility and have health insurance so the cost of \ntheir care is not borne by their neighbors and the rest of America?\n  Let me also add again, Members of the U.S. Senate have a government-\nadministered health care program that\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\nprotects them, their family, and their children. They sign up for it \nevery single year.

Madam President, I see my colleague from Colorado is on \nthe floor, and he is going to speak to an amendment which is very \nimportant. The Republican leader addressed an aspect of it. I will make \na brief comment.\n  If we want to create jobs in this country, we know how to do it. We \npassed a bill here last week, 74 to 22--a bipartisan bill. What a \nmiracle. A bipartisan bill passes the Senate, a bill that would create \n2.6 million, maybe 2.8 million jobs--create and save that many jobs in \nthis economy--a bill that will help the American economy expand in the \n21st century. What could it possibly be? It is called the Federal \ntransportation bill. We do it every 5 years. If we do not do it--if we \ndo not build the roads, the bridges, the airports, sustain passenger \nrail service and Amtrak, make certain we have mass transit and buses \naround America--our economy starts to contract instead of grow.\n  We passed this bill with a strong bipartisan vote, thanks to Senators \nBoxer and Inhofe. A Democrat and a Republican, a progressive and a \nconservative, came together on the bill. We sent it over to the House \nof Representatives and they said: Sorry, we are not going to take it \nup. We will not vote on it. We are going to send you a bill that allows \npeople to create new startups, these new private companies, and we are \ngoing to eliminate the regulation that makes sure investors do not get \nfleeced. That is how we want to create jobs.\n  Well, that is like hoping America has amnesia. We remember the \nsubprime mortgage mess when a lot of unsuspecting people were dragged \ninto offices and into mortgages they had no idea were going to explode \nwhen the balloon burst.\n  Now, once again, the Republicans have said: The best way to create \njobs in the future is to let that happen when it comes to the sale of \nstock in new companies. I am with Mary Schapiro, the Commissioner of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. She has warned us, we need to \nput protections in this bill. It is not going to create the jobs they \ntalk about. It is going to endanger investors.\n  I yield the floor for the Senator from Colorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Thank you, Madam President. And I thank the Senator from \nIllinois for his leadership and agree it is vital we pass the \ntransportation bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1877-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1877-S1879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CROWDFUNDING\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, in my townhalls we talk about a lot of \nthings that are very different from what people argue about in this \nplace. One of the issues we talk about is the economy. And we talk \nabout these four lines, as shown on this chart.\n  The first line is our gross domestic product, the economic output of \nthe United States of America, which is higher today than it was before \nwe went into this recession. A lot of people do not know that. We are \nproducing more than we were producing before we went into the \nrecession.\n  Our productivity has gone up dramatically since the early 1990s, as \nwe have responded to competition from China and India and other places, \nas we have used technology to enhance our economic output. We have the \nmost productive economy we have ever seen.\n  But we also face some very potentially catastrophic circumstances in \nthis economy, one of which is that median family income has fallen for \nthe last 10 years--the first time that has happened in our country's \nhistory.\n  And the other is that we have 23 or 24 million people who are \nunemployed or underemployed in an economy that is producing what it was \nproducing before the recession happened. That is a structural issue. I \nhave spoken on this floor about the importance of education in that \ncontext because the worst the unemployment rate ever got for people \nwith a college degree during the worst recession since the Great \nDepression was 4\\1/2\\ percent. That is a pretty good stress test of the \nvalue of a college education.\n  The other thing we need to make sure we are doing as a country is \ncontinuing to innovate and drive innovation across the United States \nbecause it is those companies--the ones that are created tomorrow, the \nones that are created next week--that are going to create new jobs in \nthis country. That is going to drive our median family income up \ninstead of down.\n  That is why I am on the floor today to talk about a bipartisan bill, \na bill Senator Merkley and Senator Brown and I have worked on, on \ncrowdfunding. It is an amendment that I hope will come to the floor. I \nhope we can get to a vote. Over the past months, we have worked \ntogether in a bipartisan way on a crowdfunding proposal that would \nallow crowdfunding to thrive but would also create an appropriate level \nof oversight and investor protection.\n  We have done something very unusual in this town: we took time to \nlisten to people. We listened to crowdfunding platforms, entrepreneurs, \nand investor protection advocates. Many of them support this bill and \nhave endorsed this bill. We worked hard to incorporate their ideas. As \na result, we have a bipartisan amendment that has the support of both \nbusinesses and consumer advocates. That is something which does not \nhappen frequently in this town.\n  I hope we will have a chance to vote on it. I will urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to see this as a real opportunity to take \none step--not a huge step but one important step--forward to filling \nthis gap we see, to creating an economy again where rising economic \noutput also means rising wages, and that rising economic output also \nmeans growing jobs. This crowdfunding amendment is a chance to do it. \nIt is bipartisan.\n  I have some letters of support, and I ask unanimous consent that they \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Small Business\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     The National Small Business Association (NSBA) supports the \n     Capital Raising Online While Deterring Fraud and Unethical \n     Non-Disclosure Act of 2012 (CROWDFUND Act, S. 2190), which \n     would promote entrepreneurship, job creation and economic \n     growth by making it much easier for small companies to raise \n     capital and get new ideas off the ground. This legislation \n     represents a reasonable effort to accommodate differing \n     points of view and to move this important idea forward.\n       Representing over 150,000 small-business owners across the \n     nation, NSBA is the country's oldest small-business advocacy \n     organization and greatly appreciates your leadership on such \n     an important issue for America's entrepreneurs and small-\n     business community.\n       This legislation creates a crowdfunding exemption allowing \n     a company to raise up to $1 million with reasonable per \n     investor limits. It also pre-empts state level registration \n     requirements, which is critical if crowdfunding legislation \n     is to have a meaningful positive impact. Furthermore, it adds \n     additional regulations designed to safeguard investors.\n       Under current law, equity markets are largely closed to \n     entrepreneurs and small businesses because they are generally \n     only permitted to raise capital from people with whom they \n     have a pre-existing relationship or through investment \n     bankers who demand a large share of the company for their \n     services. Even private placements (usually Regulation D \n     offerings) involve high legal fees and generally require that \n     the offering be limited to accredited investors (those with \n     incomes over $300,000 or a residence exclusive net worth over \n     $1 million).\n       The costs associated with starting and growing a business \n     are significant. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n     (BLS), from March 2009 March 2010, only 505,473 new \n     businesses were created in the United States, the lowest rate \n     of growth since the BLS started compiling data. This bill \n     would facilitate job creation, incentivize entrepreneurs, and \n     promote long term economic growth.\n       Despite our general support for S. 2190, there are a few \n     areas where we hope this legislation could be further \n     improved as it moves forward:\n       We would hope and recommend that the $1 million annual \n     limit could be increased to $2\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\n     million in conference. There are many small business ideas \n     that require more than $1 million to get off the ground.\n       Although we regard most of the investor safeguards as \n     reasonable, there are a few provisions that we believe should \n     be amended, as they may increase legal risk and \n     administrative costs considerably. In particular, the \n     provision requiring an explanation of the valuation method \n     used by the issuer creates substantial legal risk and \n     uncertainty since in retrospect almost any valuation method \n     will prove incorrect. It is not clear what ``valuation'' \n     would meet this requirement and protect issuers from \n     litigation risk given the fact that any valuation is going to \n     prove wrong either on the upside or, more relevantly, on the \n     downside.\n       In addition, the provisions granting the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission almost unfettered discretion to issue \n     additional regulations governing crowdfunding could prove \n     highly problematic. The legislation should contain a \n     provision limiting this discretion and requiring the \n     Commission to consider the costs of any additional regulation \n     and its likely impact on the crowdfunding marketplace.\n       Small businesses are America's economic engine and are the \n     most dynamic and innovative sector of the U.S. economy. They \n     comprise 99.7% of all domestic employer firms, employ \n     approximately 50% of all private sector employees, and have \n     created roughly 65% of America's new net jobs over the past \n     17 years.\n       NSBA is pleased to support the Capital Raising Online While \n     Deterring Fraud and Unethical Non-Disclosure Act of 2012 \n     (CROWDFUND Act, S. 2190) and thanks Senators Merkley, Bennet, \n     Brown and Landrieu for their tireless efforts to improve \n     small-business capital access. We look forward to working \n     with you to address the concerns outlined and, ultimately, \n     together help to enact this critical piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Todd O. McCracken,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                     SoMoLend,\n\n                                   Cincinatti, OH, March 16, 2012.\n     Senator Jeff Merkley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Merkley: It is with great pleasure that I, on \n     behalf of my company, SoMoLend, write to you today in support \n     of your most recent compromise bill with Senators Brown and \n     Bennett. As a platform that has been developed to eventually \n     allow peer to peer lending (debt only), we applaud your \n     efforts to allow for new small business borrowing \n     opportunities while also protecting the lender and borrower.\n       Specifically, we appreciate the language that lifts the \n     financial limits on investment to be robust enough to support \n     the borrower industries we serve. Additionally, the new \n     disclosure/regulatory requirements are robust enough to \n     provide guidance to a new industry, but will also benefit the \n     crowd-funding industry in the long-term (as compared to a \n     possible race to the bottom with a ``no regulatory'' \n     approach). Finally, we believe the disclosure/regulatory \n     requirements will provide adequate information to investors, \n     advising of risk but also deterring fraud. Again, this has \n     long-term benefits to the industry as a whole.\n       We also recognize a shift from your original bill and thank \n     you for removing the requirement for audited and reviewed \n     financials for businesses raising small amounts of money, as \n     this requirement would have been so cost-prohibitive that it \n     would have served as a dis-incentive for small business \n     participation.\n       While I believe that your legislation is much stronger than \n     previous bills, I do still have concerns regarding \n     requirements that do not adequately consider the different \n     role debt plays in the capital structure, and hope that we \n     have the opportunity to address these differences in the rule \n     making process (we appreciate your guidance in drafting \n     potential legislative history to this effect). We also \n     believe that the current requirements still take a one size \n     fits all approach, and we ask that the rule makers consider \n     the cost/benefit of additional disclosure for very small \n     offerings. In addition, the existing requirement for portals \n     to belong to a national securities association provides a \n     potential obstacle to our industry (time/cost), with no real \n     benefit, since existing associations do not have any specific \n     rules for crowd funding sites. We do realize, however, that \n     our industry will need to quickly form its own self-\n     regulatory association.\n       We believe that rule making should permit portals/issuers \n     to rely on investor representations to comply with funding \n     limits. Finally, the rule making process with the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission will take time--we believe that \n     someone should address what occurs in transition.\n       Overall, we are very supportive of your most recent \n     legislation, and we are happy to help in any way to assist in \n     advocating its passage.\n       Please let me know if I can do any more to be of \n     assistance, and we look forward to working with your team to \n     create an exciting new opportunity for small business access \n     to capital.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Candace Klein,\n     Founder/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Fund Democracy,\n\n                                                   March 14, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: I \n     am writing on behalf of Fund Democracy to express my support \n     for the Capital Raising Online While Deterring Fraud and \n     Unethical Disclosure Act of 2012 (``CROWDFUND Act''). As the \n     Act's title suggests, an exemption from registration \n     requirements for very small securities offerings creates \n     significant potential for fraud and unethical conduct. The \n     CROWDFUND Act addresses this concern by providing significant \n     regulatory relief to very small issuers without unreasonably \n     compromising the investor protection provisions on which the \n     federal securities laws are grounded and the long-term \n     success of the U.S. securities markets has been based.\n       In particular, I note the substantial improvements over the \n     crowdfunding exemption contained in Title III of the \n     Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (``JOBS Act'') recently \n     approved by the House. The JOBS Act's crowdfunding exemption, \n     aptly referred to by Columbia Law School Professor John \n     Coffee as the ``The Boiler Room Legalization Act,'' removes \n     fundamental investor protection measures that are essential \n     to the successful operation of the U.S. securities markets.\n       Most notably, the JOBS Act would grant broker-dealers who \n     act as intermediaries in crowdfunding offerings a complete \n     exemption from registration as brokers. Such an exemption is \n     grossly overbroad and removes an entire regulatory structure \n     for precisely the kind of small offerings where experience \n     has demonstrated a high risk of fraud. In contrast, the \n     CROWDFUND Act provides a reasonable alternative to broker \n     registration by permitting crowdfunding intermediaries to be \n     lightly regulated as ``funding portals.'' These portals would \n     continue to be subject to essential investor protection rules \n     while relieving them of regulation that is unnecessary in the \n     crowdfunding context.\n       Furthermore, the CROWDFUND Act requires that issuers \n     provide appropriately limited financial disclosures depending \n     on the size of the offering, whereas the JOBS Act provides a \n     one-size-fits-all blanket exemption from providing any \n     financial information for offerings of up to $1 million. The \n     CROWDFUND Act also provides regulators with 21-day advance \n     notice of crowdfunding offerings. In contrast, the JOBS Act \n     allows for notice with the making of the first offer, at \n     which point regulatory action will often be too late.\n       Notwithstanding the CROWDFUND Act's significant \n     improvements over the JOBS Act's crowdfunding exemption, I \n     remain concerned regarding the potential for fraud in \n     crowdfunding markets. I strongly encourage the \n     reconsideration of the $2,000 investment limit as applied to \n     low-income individuals and recommend that investments not \n     exceed the greater of $500 or 5% of income. I also encourage \n     a thoroughgoing re-evaluation of the operation of the \n     crowdfunding exemption in practice following the delivery of \n     each of the SEC reports required in Section 6 of the Act.\n       In conclusion, I applaud the CROWDFUND Act's reasonable \n     balancing of the costs of raising capital for the smallest \n     issuers, and the benefits of adequately protecting both \n     investors and the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mercer Bullard,\n     President and Founder.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        The Startup Exemption,\n\n                                  Miami Beach, FL, March 14, 2012.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: We began this process over a year ago \n     with the goal of creating a system under which entrepreneurs \n     can raise capital to create jobs. We understand there are \n     major differences between the House and Senate versions of \n     the Crowdfunding bills and we desire for the Senate Banking \n     Committee to have a chance to work these issues out there so \n     that both Houses of Congress can pass this legislation.\n       In January 2011, we proposed the regulatory framework, \n     which is the basis for all the Crowdfunding bills currently \n     under consideration in Washington, DC. After a year of \n     dedicated work we are comforted by the fact that the Senate, \n     House and President understand how important capital is to \n     our nation's entrepreneurs for innovation and job creation. \n     The passage of the House Crowdfunding Bill (H.R. 2930), \n     coupled with the President's very strong leadership and \n     support was a great demonstration of bipartisanship. The \n     active debate in the Senate, further reinforces the \n     commitment to updating securities regulations that were \n     written at a time when we didn't have the technology to \n     better enable the free flow of information and investor \n     protection. Once legalized, Crowdfund Investing (CFI) will \n     allow a limited amount of community-based capital to flow \n     into the hands of our nation's job creators and innovators, \n     while providing prudent investor protections.\n       We are three successful MBA entrepreneurs having raised in \n     excess of $100M in venture and private equity capital and \n     deeply understand the capital markets, and their risks and \n     rewards. In drafting our framework, we worked hard to balance \n     the interests of the\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\n     entrepreneur, investor, intermediary and regulator. We \n     endorsed H.R. 2930, as it is aligned with our framework. \n     Since then, we worked closely with the Senate to understand \n     their concerns and work on a bill to include provisions that \n     can yield bipartisan support while creating an regulatory \n     environment in which a Crowdfund Investing industry can grow \n     and succeed.\n       It is with this in mind that we write to suggest that if \n     you consider the House version of the bill you consider \n     adding the following crucial components:\n       1. Crowdfund Investing intermediaries that are SEC-\n     regulated to provide appropriate oversight\n       2. All or nothing financing so that an entrepreneur must \n     hit 100% of his funding target or no funds will be exchanged\n       3. State notification, rather than state registration, so \n     the states are aware of who is crowdfunding in their states. \n     This ensures they retain their enforcement ability while \n     creating an efficient marketplace.\n       Senators Merkley, Bennett, Brown and Landrieu should be \n     commended for their thoughtfulness in crafting a bipartisan \n     compromise bill. Passage of Crowdfund Investing legislation \n     this session will create the American jobs and innovation \n     that our economy so desperately needs. Please consider taking \n     up this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                  Sherwood Neiss, Jason Best &\n\n                                               Zak Cassady-Dorion,\n     Co-founders.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 15, 2012.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I write to express support for the \n     bipartisan CROWDFUND Act recently proposed by Senators \n     Merkley, S. Brown, Bennet and Landrieu.\n       CrowdCheck, Inc. was formed to support entrepreneurs \n     seeking crowdfunding by giving them a way to establish their \n     legitimacy in a field that many have predicted will be \n     vulnerable to fraud, and to give investors a tool to \n     recognize and avoid fraud. Our founders include several \n     business lawyers, and I am a securities lawyer with three \n     decades of experience helping companies comply with SEC \n     disclosure requirements. I thus understand the burdens such \n     regulations can impose on entrepreneurs, and also the \n     information investors need to make an informed investment \n     decision. I am therefore pleased to see the careful balance \n     in the bill between investor protection and burden on the \n     entrepreneur.\n       While we have some concerns with respect to interpretation \n     of certain provisions in the bill, we look forward to working \n     with the sponsors of the bill to address these. We therefore \n     urge you to support this bipartisan effort to pass the \n     CROWDFUND Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Sara Hanks,\n                                             CEO, CrowdCheck, Inc.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. It moves this ball down the field. I hope it establishes \na model for how we can work together to make sure that we are actually \naddressing things I am hearing about in the townhalls and that we are \ndriving wage growth and job growth here in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, on Friday of this week 2 years will have \npassed since President Obama signed the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act into law. This is actually a sad anniversary \nbecause more than enough time has gone by to reveal the failures of \nthis massive, burdensome piece of legislation.\n  The fact that 26 of our 50 States--more than half of the States--are \npart of the legal challenge currently under review by the Supreme Court \npoints out the inevitable truth: This is a law that simply does not \nwork.\n  The case that will be heard in a few days will be one of the most \nconsequential Supreme Court cases of my lifetime--consequential not \nonly because it deals with this massive, burdensome piece of \nlegislation but because the implications go so much further. The \nSupreme Court case will decide the scope of the commerce clause. \nIndeed, my colleagues, if the Supreme Court decides this law can \nwithstand constitutional scrutiny, then this large, massive Federal \nGovernment can, in fact, do almost anything, and there will be hardly \nany limitations under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights on the \npower of the U.S. Federal Government.\n  Americans are right to be disappointed with Obamacare, and they are \nright to want it repealed. And regardless of the outcome of the Supreme \nCourt case, this Congress can decide and, as a matter of fact, the \npeople of the United States will have a chance in November, as we do \nevery 2 years, to decide.\n  A recent Gallup poll shows that twice as many Americans think the law \nwill make things worse for their families than those who believe it \nwill make things better. Seventy-two percent of Americans believe the \nindividual mandate is unconstitutional.\n  The truth is that Americans deserve affordable, high-quality health \ncare, not a 2,700-page, big-government piece of legislation that taxes, \nspends, and regulates. The President's health care law has not lowered \nthe cost of health care as promised. It has not created jobs as \npromised. It has not reduced the deficit as promised. So this week we \nmark the anniversary not with progress but with bitter realities.\n  President Obama, in his joint session speech to Congress in 2009, \nasserted that his plan ``will slow the growth of health care costs for \nour families, our businesses, and our government.'' In fact, last week \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on \nTaxation updated their outlook of the health care law's impact on the \nFederal budget. Not surprisingly, their latest analysis says Obamacare \nwill cost even more than anticipated. And the anticipated costs were \nhigh, indeed, but they say the health care law will cost nearly $1.8 \ntrillion over the next decade or double the estimated cost that \naccompanied the bill when Democratic supermajorities passed it in 2010. \nThis is hardly the relief President Obama promised.\n  During his campaign, the President said the plan would reduce health \ncare premiums by an average of $2,500 per family. Instead, premiums \nhave grown by nearly that much since he was elected.\n  I see I am joined by two of my colleagues, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming and the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  There are a number of other promises we are talking about today, and \nI know we don't impugn motives around here--that is against the rules--\nbut one has to wonder, did advocates of this massive law actually \nbelieve these promises or were they simply duped and misled? And I \ndon't know which is worse, but I know that my colleague Dr. Barrasso, \nhimself a physician who is on the front line of this issue, has given \nthis a great deal of thought, so at this point I ask him to join in \nthis colloquy.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I stand here with my friend and \ncolleague from Mississippi because he and I both attended, in his home \nState of Mississippi, a meeting at a hospital where we met with \ndoctors, also met with patients, and met with people from the community \nwhile the debate and discussion was being conducted about this health \ncare law. At the time, people were asking all sorts of questions \nbecause they had heard the promises. Would this actually lower the cost \nof insurance by $2,500 a family? That is what people wanted. That is \nwhat they expected. The other question: Will I really be able to keep \nthe care I have and the doctor I have if I like it?\n  Now here we are a couple of years later, the second anniversary of \nthis health care law being passed, and I am here with my friend and \ncolleague from Mississippi, and it just seems to me that the questions \nthat were asked by his constituents, by the doctors in those \ncommunities who take care of the patients, by the patients, the \nhospital administrators whom we talked to that day in his home State of \nMississippi--it does seem that many of these promises have been broken.\n  The costs seem to go up higher than had this health care law not been \npassed at all. The numbers and the statistics we are hearing now from \nthe budget office on the cost seem to be much, much higher than what \nthe\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nPresident promised. Parts of this health care law--the so-called CLASS \nAct--it now comes out were accounting gimmicks, budget schemes to make \nit seem as though the cost of this health care law would be much less \nthan what American people now know it to be.\n  So it is no surprise to me--and I see this in Wyoming, and I am sure \nthe Senator sees it in Mississippi, and I would imagine the Senator \nfrom Kansas who is on the floor has seen the same thing at home because \nI know he has gone to hospitals and just--maybe almost every hospital \nin the State of Kansas as he has traveled around. We are all seeing \nthat this health care law is less popular now than when it was passed. \nThat is what I hear at townhall meetings. When I ask, do you think you \nare actually going to pay more under the health care law, every hand \ngoes up. And when I say, do you think the quality and availability of \nyour own care at home is going to go down, again, every hand goes up.\n  So if I could ask my colleague from Kansas if he is hearing the same \nthings. And I see we are also joined by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. MORAN. I appreciate the opportunity to be on the floor today, \nespecially with the Senator from Wyoming, a doctor who is such an \nexpert on the topic of really not just the moment, not just the day, \nbut the topic of what our country faces.\n  I will say that I do spend a lot of time in hospitals across our \nState talking to health care providers, talking to patients, doctors, \nto administrators, trustees. In fact, there are 128 hospitals in our \nState. I have visited all of them, and there is genuine concern about \nthe future of the ability for health care to be delivered in \ncommunities across our State. And you add to that the physician and \nother health care provider community, and this health care reform act \nis creating significant challenges.\n  My interest in public service started a long time ago with the belief \nthat we live our lives in rural America, in my State of Kansas, in a \npretty special way. When I came to Congress, it became clear to me that \nif our communities were going to have a future, it was dependent upon \nthe ability to deliver health care close to home. And those rural \ncommunities across our Nation often have high proportions of senior \ncitizen populations where Medicare is the primary determining factor of \nwhether they can access health care.\n  When the affordable care act was passed, many promises were made, but \none of the things that was told to the American people--or at least the \nattempt was made to sell to the American people--was that there would \nbe greater access. And I would certainly say that one of the promises \nthat is not being kept about the affordable care act is the likelihood \nthat there is going to be greater access for Americans across our \ncountry to health care because this bill is underfunded, it is not paid \nfor. The consequences are that the administration is already proposing \nand Congress will always be looking for ways to reduce spending when it \ncomes to health care, and the most likely target is the payment \nMedicare makes to health care providers, which in many instances \nalready doesn't cover the cost for providing the service. So when we \nlook for access to health care, every time we make a decision, every \ntime a decision will be made in order to try to make this more \naffordable, we are going to see fewer and fewer providers able to \nprovide the services necessary to folks across the country but \nespecially in rural communities where 60, 70, 80, even 90 percent of \nthe patients admitted to the hospital are on Medicare.\n  So one of the problems with the affordable care act is the reality \nthat it will reduce access to health care for people who live in rural \nAmerica and we will see fewer physicians accepting patients on \nMedicare, we will see fewer hospital doors remain open; as this bill \ntakes $500 billion out of Medicare to begin with, the Congress that \npassed and the President who signed this legislation set the stage for \nthere to be less affordable health care available to Americans across \nthe country but especially for constituents of mine who live in a rural \nState such as Kansas.\n  Mr. WICKER. If I could jump in on the issue of Medicare because I \nhave a quote here from President Obama, July 29, 2009: ``Medicare is a \ngovernment program, but do not worry, I am not going touch it.'' As a \nmatter of fact, only months later he signed into law Obamacare, which \ntakes $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare. And it touches on the very issue \nthe Senator from Kansas was referring to with regard to Medicare access \nfor people in rural Kansas.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I might point out to my friend from \nMississippi that the first amendment we had on the floor of the Senate \nwhen we were considering ObamaCare was to restore that $500 billion, \nand it was voted down on a party-line basis.\n  I thank my friends for allowing me to engage in this colloquy. I want \nto discuss this with my friends. In my view, probably what encapsulates \nthe problems with this legislation--the commitment began that we would \nprovide affordable health care to all Americans, which meant we had to \nput the brakes on inflation in health care because health care was \nbecoming unaffordable--the highest quality health care in the world. \nNothing, in my view--and I ask my colleagues this--describes more how \nthis whole plan went awry than the so-called CLASS Act.\n  Late in the debate, the CLASS Act was thrown in to provide long-term \ncare for seniors, which seems like a worthy cause, but the whole thing \nwas a gimmick. It was described by Senator Conrad, our chairman of the \nBudget Committee, as a ``Ponzi scheme of the first order, the kind of \nthing that Bernie Madoff would have been proud of.''\n  They foisted that off on us. Why? Initially, because of CBO scoring, \nit would show an increase in finances into revenues and into the whole \nObamaCare program. But as soon as those people who were paying in \nbecame eligible, obviously, the reverse happened. Thank God for former \nSenator Gregg of New Hampshire, who had an amendment adopted that \nrequired the Secretary to certify that the program would be solvent for \nover 75 years before the program could be implemented. If it hadn't \nbeen for that, the CLASS Act would be here today.\n  Then, last October, the Secretary of Health and Human Services issued \na report confirming what many of us knew was inevitable: that the \nSecretary could not certify the CLASS Act's solvency as required under \nlaw. So we went through this exercise of frantically searching for ways \nto increase revenue, at least the way CBO does scoring. So we did the \nCLASS Act and, thank God, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire put in an \namendment that they had to certify that it would be viable over 75 \nyears. There was not a snowball's chance in Gila Bend, AZ, that they \nwere able to certify that for over 75 years it would be a viable \nprogram.\n  It was kind of entertaining, but late on a Friday night the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services said she could not certify that the \nprogram would be solvent throughout a 75-year period. The result of \nthis was, obviously, that they didn't have the false revenues that CBO \ncould score. They didn't have a program that could provide long-term \ncare for seniors. Again, as the Senator from North Dakota aptly pointed \nout, this ``Ponzi scheme of the first order'' faced and met a well-\ndeserved death.\n  That is why an overwhelming majority of the American people \ndisapprove of this whole exercise of ObamaCare. They want it repealed. \nThey don't support it. I am proud to say in this election we will \ndecide whether we repeal and replace ObamaCare. The American people \ncare about that.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, to summarize what the Senator from \nArizona has just said, the CLASS Act was sold to the American people as \na budget deficit reducer. It was going to reduce the deficit. No sooner \nwas it signed and they started looking at it that the administration \nitself said: We know it is unworkable, and we abandon it. We are not \neven going to try to enforce it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They could have kept it on the books. If it had not been \nfor the amendment of Senator Gregg from New Hampshire which said they \nhad to certify its solvency over a 75-year period, we would have the \nCLASS Act today, a Ponzi scheme where people would be paying in, and \nthat is scored as revenues, and some years later when they retire, \nobviously, the reverse would have been true.\n  I have yet to hear one of my colleagues come over and admit that they\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\nwere wrong about the CLASS Act. I would love to hear some of those who \nstrongly advocated for it. My friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, said:\n\n       So we get a lot of bang for the buck, as one might say, \n     with the CLASS Act that we have in this bill.\n\n  Senator Whitehouse said this:\n\n       Certain colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \n     argued that the CLASS plan would lead to a financially \n     unstable entitlement program and would rapidly increase the \n     Federal deficit. That is simply not accurate.\n\n  I look forward to my colleagues who supported and voted for the CLASS \nAct to come over and agree that it was, as Senator Conrad pointed out, \na Ponzi scheme.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I know our friend from South Dakota has \njoined us and is eager to join in this discussion. I wonder if he has \nanything to add about the broken promises that were made during the \npassage of ObamaCare.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before that, the whole point of reforming health care was \nto reduce the cost of health care. That was the goal. We all know \nMedicare cannot be sustained for the American people if the inflation \nassociated with health care continues. The whole object of this game \nwas to reduce the cost of health care and preserve the quality of \nhealth care.\n  Does anybody think that was achieved with this legislation? That is \nwhy the American people have figured it out. I yield for the Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I echo what the Senator from Arizona said \nabout the CLASS Act. He was here, as was I and many others, debating \nthis bill and saying this was a program destined to be bankrupt. In \nfact, if we look at the independent Actuary, he was saying the CLASS \nAct was unworkable. They said it would collapse in short order.\n  Within the HHS Department, there was a nonpartisan career staff that \ncalled it a ``recipe for disaster.'' There was plenty of advance \nwarning this wasn't going to work.\n  The Senator from Arizona correctly pointed out it was used as a \ngimmick to make the overall cost look less and, therefore, bring it \ninto balance. As we know now, the CLASS Act could not work. They have \nhad to acknowledge that, and the amendment put on by Senator Gregg, \nwhich would have forced them to certify, made that abundantly clear.\n  To the point of the Senator from Mississippi, the purpose of the \nexercise was that we have to do something about the cost of health \ncare. In fact, the President of the United States, when he was running, \nsaid this:\n\n       If you've got health insurance, we are going to work with \n     you to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year. We \n     will not wait 20 years from now to do it, or 10 years from \n     now to do it; we will do it by the end of my first term as \n     President of the United States.\n\n  I am sure the Senator from Arizona probably remembers very well many \nof these statements. But the facts tell a different story. If we look \nat what health care costs are doing, and even what was predicted by the \nCongressional Budget Office, they said the law was going to increase \nhealth insurance premiums by 10 to 13 percent, which means families \npurchasing coverage were going to pay an additional $2,100 because of \nthe new law. That has actually been borne out.\n\n  If we look at the cost of health insurance for people in this country \ntoday, it has gone up, not down; it has gone up dramatically--since the \nPresident took office, about 25 percent for most Americans. All these \npromises about getting costs under control, the promises about keeping \nwhat people have, the promises about this being done in a way that \nwould protect Medicare--we all know Medicare was going to be slashed \nwhen this was fully implemented, to the tune of $1 trillion, and there \nwould be $1 trillion in new taxes also.\n  The American people got a bad deal, and they know it. That is what \nthe public opinion polls show.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator, even though we have shut down the \noffice of the CLASS Act, even though the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices said they can't certify that it will be fiscally solvent over \n75 years, it is still on the books. Isn't the CLASS Act still on the \nbooks? Does the Senator think it might be appropriate, since we cannot \ncomply with the law, to maybe repeal that portion of the law? Is that \nsomething we might think about? It might be a pretty good amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. It would be, and, by the way, we have that amendment and \nwould be happy to offer it. We tried to call up the bill, but it was \nobjected to by the Democrats. The thing about bad ideas around here is \nthat they tend to come back. This idea ought to be put away once and \nfor all. Yet it is on the books, as the Senator pointed out. I don't \nknow why, after all the evidence out there now that has been put \nforward, including the Health and Human Services Secretary saying this \nwill not work. But we continue to maintain it on the books in the hopes \nof some in the administration, I am sure, that it can be resurrected in \nthe future. It was a bad idea then, and it will be in the future. It \njust doesn't pencil out. We cannot make it work. It saddles future \ngenerations of Americans with massive amounts of debt.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, let me ask my colleagues about another \npromise. They will call time on us soon.\n  Does anybody recall hearing this statement from the President of the \nUnited States in 2009? He said this:\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep \n     your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no \n     matter what.\n\n  That was the President on June 15, 2009. What happened to that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, when we look at it, even the \nadministration admits that wasn't true. Small businesses--people who \nget their insurance in small businesses--will have a difficult time \ncontinuing to provide coverage for people because of the mandates that \nsay they have to provide Washington-approved insurance. That is the \nproblem: that people have what they like, and it may be something they \nwant, need, and can afford. Now they are being mandated to have \nsomething they may not want, need, or be able to afford.\n  So, again, we have another broken promise, which is why Senator \nCoburn, who practiced medicine for a quarter century, as I did, and I \nhave come out with a report, released yesterday called, ``Warning, Side \nEffects, a Checkup on the Federal Health Law: Fewer Choices.''\n  That means people cannot choose to keep what they have. There are \nfewer choices, higher taxes, more government, and less innovation. None \nof that is what the American people have been promised by the \nPresident.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In addition, I ask the Senator how many new regulations \nhave been issued, and how many new regulations do we anticipate as a \nresult of this exercise?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. This over 2,000-page law will result in over 100,000 \npages of regulations. There is one part of the law where, for a couple \nof pages--4 to 6 pages--they had 400 pages of regulations and 50 pages \nof legal guidance.\n  When we talk to hospitals--I know those of us who visit with \nhospitals in our States--they say they are spending money on \nconsultants and lawyers to help them understand the law. They say: It \nis money we ought to spend on patients and equipment and technology for \nour hospital, to provide care in our community.\n  I know the Senator from Kansas has visited over 100 hospitals in his \nState. He has heard the same thing.\n  Mr. MORAN. That is true. The point made earlier about the goal of the \nlegislation bending the cost curve down--it didn't do it, it doesn't do \nit, and it cannot do it. That created the problem we all face now. How \ncan we have access to affordable health care if we are not reducing the \ncost of health care?\n  The end result, in my view, is that Americans will have less options \nfor their own plans. As employers, they will provide either less \noptions or no options for their employees. So the idea that people are \ngoing to get to keep what they have, that begins to disappear. If they \nare a senior citizen and Medicare has been their primary provider, we \ngo back to the idea that we didn't bend the cost curve. So in order to \nmake health care affordable--when the legislation fails to do that, we \nfind other gimmicks to do that. One of the things this bill creates is \nIPAB, an independent agency that will make decisions about what is \ncovered by people's health care plans. The goal will not be to have \nbetter quality health care; the goal of the IPAB will be to reduce \nexpenditures.\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\n  As the promise was made that people get to keep what they have, it \nbecomes totally different than what they have experienced in their \nhealth care plans--either in their own private health care insurance or \nas a beneficiary of Medicare. Even the President's own Medicare Actuary \nestimates that the law will increase overall national health care \nexpenditures by $311 billion during the first 10 years alone, and that \nprivate health care insurance premiums will rise 10 percent in 2014.\n  So if we are complaining today about the increase in premium costs, \nthere is more to come. In 2014, the Medicare Actuary says there will be \nanother 10 percent increase in your health care premiums. At the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, their economists found the \nincreasing growth rate in health care spending will occur in every \nsector of health care. More recently, the Congressional Budget Office, \nour neutral provider of analysis, says the cost of the health care law \nmay be substantially higher than earlier estimated.\n  One of the things I would suggest we should have done and that never \nhappened--if we want folks to be able to keep what they have, if we \nwant access to health care in rural and urban and suburban places in \nthe country--we should have done something about fixing permanently the \nreduction of payments to physicians--the so-called doc fix. One would \nhave thought, in health care reform, that would have been front and \ncenter. Because if we don't have a physician providing a service, we \ndon't have health care. Yet we have a Medicare system that is going to \nreduce the payments. In fact, expected this year, the reduced payments \nto physicians was going to be 30 percent.\n  The reality is, no longer will physicians accept Medicare patients. \nThe option the American people were promised about keeping what they \nhave disappears one more time. In fact, at a townhall meeting in \nParsons, KS, this year, a physician in the front row said: Senator, you \nneed to know I no longer accept Medicare and Medicaid. I will take \ncash, but I cannot afford to provide the services based upon the \nMedicare reimbursement rate I get. When you add in all the paperwork, \ntrying to comply with Medicare and Medicaid, it is no longer \nfinancially feasible for me in this small town to provide the services \nmy patients need under Medicare.\n  So we are going to see a lot less access because, once again, this is \na failure. The promise that was made to bend down the cost curve, to \nreduce health care costs, to reduce premiums was totally false.\n  Mr. WICKER. So the promise was not to touch Medicare, and that \npromise has not been fulfilled. The promise was to reduce the deficit, \nand that turned out to be an empty promise.\n  Also, we were told by the President and by Speaker Pelosi this bill \nwould create jobs. The President said it was a key pillar for a new \nfoundation for prosperity. How has that turned out? Former Speaker \nPelosi said in its life the health care bill will create 4 million \njobs--400,000 almost immediately.\n  Of course, neither of those promises has come true. The nonpartisan \nCBO has estimated the health care law will reduce America's workforce. \nThis is the bipartisan CBO. They said it will reduce America's \nworkforce by 800,000 jobs over the next 10 years. That fact has been \nconfirmed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to my colleague from Mississippi that one of \nthe areas where jobs may be created is in the Federal Government \nbecause it is going to take an awful lot of Federal bureaucrats to \noversee and lots of new IRS agents to implement this legislation. That \nwould be the only place we will see job creation.\n  But when it comes to private sector job creation, the thing about \nthis is, it raises the cost for health insurance coverage for \nemployers, and it raises taxes on a lot of people who are involved in \nhealth care.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. The combination of those things is only going to cost \njobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, 2 years ago President Obama signed into \nlaw what I believe was the most forward-thinking and humane reform of \nour health care system since Medicare. Just like the Republicans \nopposed Medicare when it came in, they still want to get rid of it. If \nwe look at the Ryan budget that came out, what do they want to do? They \nwant to privatize Medicare. They have been at it ever since. They do \nnot want this humane reform we passed 2 years ago.\n  When the affordable care act became law, I said we have made America \na more compassionate and a more just society. I believe this with even \ngreater conviction now. In listening to my colleagues, my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, one would think this is all just about \nlittle nuts and bolts and this and that, but it is about humaneness. It \nis about compassion and about justice and, yes, it is about making the \nsystem work better for patients, not just for insurance companies and \nthe insurance industry.\n  Now that we have moved ahead to implement the law, the results have \nbeen striking. Every American now is protected against the abusive \ninsurance company practices of the past. Let me put it another way. \nBecause of the health care reform law, Americans now have protections \nthat every Senator in this Chamber has enjoyed for years under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program. We now have extended that to \nall Americans. Listening to my friends on the other side of the aisle, \nthey want to take it away from Americans but keep it for themselves. \nOh, no; they do not want to give it up. I think what is good for \nSenators ought to be good for the American people.\n  The young lady shown on this chart is Emily Schlichting. She \ntestified before my committee last year, and this is what she said:\n\n       Young people are the future of this country and we are the \n     most affected by reform--we're the generation that is most \n     uninsured. We need the Affordable Care Act because it is \n     literally an investment in the future of this country.\n\n  Why does she say that? Because she suffers from a rare autoimmune \ncondition which insurance companies would not even cover. But because \nwe have said they cannot now discriminate if someone has a preexisting \ncondition, Emily gets insurance coverage. Plus, she can stay on her \nparents' health insurance program.\n  So far, the law has extended coverage to more than 2\\1/2\\ million \nyoung people such as Emily. Yet the Republicans want to take it away. \nThey want to take away Emily Schlichting's insurance coverage. That is \nwhat this is all about. They want to repeal the affordable care act--\nObamaCare. What that will mean is that 2\\1/2\\ million people similar to \nEmily will lose their insurance. But they do not talk about that. They \ndo not talk about that.\n  Here is the coverage Americans have right now. We have banned \nlifetime limits. Let me tell everyone about Ross Daniels and Amy Ward \nfrom West Des Moines, IA. After developing a rare lung infection on a \nsummer trip, Amy needed intensive treatment, including a course of \nmedication costing--get this--$1,600 a dose--$1,600 a dose. Her \ninsurance policy had a $1 million lifetime limit. Without our health \ncare reform's ban on lifetime limits, this couple would have had to \ndeclare bankruptcy. After this experience, Ross said he can't \nunderstand why opponents of the law want to repeal it. He said:\n\n       It is hard for us to believe that so many of the GOP \n     candidates would have us go back in time where an illness \n     like this would have forced us, or any other family for that \n     matter, into bankruptcy.\n\n  Listen to what Republicans are saying. They want to take this \nprotection away from Amy Ward and Ross Daniels and millions of other \nAmericans. There are 100 million people being helped by the ban on \nlifetime limits.\n  We have also covered vital preventive services free of charge. That \nhas benefited more than 80 million people who\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\nnow get free preventive care. It allows young people to remain on their \nparents' insurance plans until they are age 26. I can't tell you how \nmany families I have talked to in my State of Iowa who have said this \nhas been a godsend to them and to their kids.\n  Here is the preventive portion. We all know prevention is the best \nthing we can do to change our sick care system into a health care \nsystem. Here is what we did. Here is what the affordable care act does \non prevention. Before health care reform, colorectal cancer screening \nwas covered only 68 percent by insurance companies, cholesterol \nscreening was only covered by 57 percent, tobacco cessation only 4 \npercent. Under the affordable care act, colorectal cancer screening, \ncholesterol, and tobacco cessation all are covered at 100 percent by \nevery insurance company. Madam President, 100 hundred percent, not 57 \npercent or 68 percent but 100 percent. We all know that early screening \nmeans people live longer and it cuts down on health care costs.\n  So millions now receive free preventive care, and 86 million \nAmericans had at least one free preventive service in 2011. Almost 1 \nmillion Iowans, in my State, received at least one free preventive \nservice in 2011. Yet Republicans want to take this away. That is what \nthis is about.\n  But Americans now have preventive care. They now are able to keep \ntheir kids on their policies until they are age 26. They now have a ban \non lifetime limits. We now have a ban for children up to age 19 on \npreexisting conditions. That is all they want to do; they want to take \nthis away. I say, don't let them take this away from the American \npeople.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 50 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1883-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in a few minutes, we are going to vote on \nwhether we should end debate on a House bill which carries the false \nlabel of a jobs bill--a bill which cries out for debate and amendment.\n  If we continue down this track, we will approve legislation that \nendangers America's senior citizens, its small investors, and its large \npension funds and foundations. In doing so, we would, far from \nencouraging job growth, endanger job growth, by endangering the \ninvestments that help America's businesses grow and create new jobs. \nThe jobs bill before us, as it now stands, is anything but a jobs bill. \nAnd if we invoke cloture, we will end debate and the opportunity to \nremedy this bill's flaws. The Senate should not take that step.\n  Its flaws are deeply worrisome. It threatens to dampen investment, \nand therefore dampen job growth, in at least six ways.\n  First, investors are now protected by federal securities laws that \ngenerally prevent companies from making largely unregulated stock \nofferings to the public. By limiting such unregulated stock offerings \nto investors who can better withstand the substantial risk of these \ninvestments, we discourage fraud while allowing companies to access \ncapital. But the House bill does away with these restrictions. They \ncould market them with cold calls to senior centers. This would expose \nAmericans with few protections against fraud and little ability to \nanalyze complex, risky investments to devastating losses.\n  It gets worse. The House bill changes when a company is large enough \nto warrant SEC disclosure and transparency requirements--from one with \nfewer than 500 shareholders to one with 2,000 or more shareholders, and \nperhaps many more. Those could be very large companies. In fact, the \nHouse bill maintains a loophole that allows shareholders of record, on \npaper, to hold shares for potentially hundreds of real owners as a way \nof evading this shareholder limit. They would be exempt from filing \nregular financial reports and other measures that give investors the \nconfidence they need to invest their hard-earned dollars.\n  Taken together, these first two flaws would allow even large \ncompanies to make largely unregulated stock offerings to potentially \nunwary investors, and to evade even the most basic requirements to \naccurately inform shareholders of their financial condition. Combined, \nthese provisions are a recipe for fraud, abuse, financial crisis and \nreduced investment to grow our economy.\n  The House bill has other deep flaws. It erases barriers, erected \nafter the dotcom bubble of the 1990s, that prevent conflicts of \ninterest in which investment banks could promote the stock offerings \nthat they underwrite by having their research analysts provide pumped-\nup assessments on the stock.\n  This provision would mean that nearly 90 percent of all IPOs would be \nexempt from providing basic protections that help investors commit \ntheir money with confidence.\n  Now, it has been said by supporters of this bill that we should \napprove this bill because the President supports it. I would remind my \ncolleagues of two things. First, the President's support would not \ndissolve our own responsibility. We are in danger of rubber-stamping a \nbill simply because someone slapped a clever acronym with the word \n``jobs'' on it. If this bill threatens, rather than encourages, \ninvestment and job creation, we should repair its flaws. That is our \nresponsibility. Madison told us two centuries ago:\n\n       A senate, as a second branch of the legislative assembly, \n     distinct from, and dividing the power with a first, must be \n     in all cases a salutary check on the government.\n\n  We should be that check today.\n  Second, those who point to the President's support fail to mention \nanother aspect of his position: support for common-sense fixes that \nprotect the integrity of our markets. The White House said this week:\n\n       The President strongly supports the efforts of Senate \n     Democrats to find common ground by supporting the most \n     effective aspects of the House bill to increase capital \n     formation for growing businesses, while also improving the \n     House bill to ensure there are sufficient safeguards to \n     prevent abuse and protect investors.\n\n  The President supports this bill, yes--but he also supports improving \nit. And we should have the chance to do so.\n  This is not a bill to promote investment in our economy. This bill \nwill discourage investment. As SEC Chairman Schapiro wrote:\n\n       If the balance is tipped to the point where investors are \n     not confident that there are appropriate protections, \n     investors will lose confidence in our markets, and capital \n     formation will ultimately be made more difficult and \n     expensive.\n\n  Unless we protect investors, they will not invest in our economy. We \ncan only add those protections if we slow this rush, debate this bill, \nand amend it. If we invoke cloture now, we end debate rather than \nbeginning it. If we invoke cloture, we restrict amendment rather than \nallowing it. That would be a grave mistake, one that puts American \ninvestors, American workers and the stability of our economy at risk, \nand I urge my colleagues not to walk that path.\n  Again, this bill would allow companies to advertise these virtually \nunregulated stock offerings on television or on billboards. This House \nbill would allow large companies with thousands of shareholders to \navoid SEC regulation. The House bill would allow banks of any size to \navoid SEC regulation if they have fewer than 1,200 shareholders. The \nHouse bill would allow companies with annual sales of up to $1 billion \nto evade the most basic transparency, accountability, and disclosure \nrequirements in making initial public offerings.\n  This is not a bill which will promote investment in our economy. This \nbill will discourage investment. As SEC Chairman Schapiro wrote us:\n\n       If the balance is tipped to the point where investors are \n     not confident that there are appropriate protections, \n     investors will lose confidence in our markets.\n\n  That is why the Council of Institutional Investors warns us ``this \nlegislation will likely create more risks to investors than jobs.''\n  This is not a bill which will allow new opportunities for American \nworkers but one which will create new opportunities for fraudsters and \nboiler-room crooks. I urge defeat of cloture. We should not end debate \non this bill and make it more difficult to amend this bill by \nrestricting amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1883-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1883-S1884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Merkley, Mr. \n     Bennet, and Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1884.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, March 19, 2012, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up the second-degree amendment, No. \n1931, offered by Senator Reed of Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Reed, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1931 to amendment No. 1884.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following. ``The Commission shall \n     revise the definition of the term `held of record' pursuant \n     to section 12(g)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \n     (15. U.S.C. 781(g)(5)) to include beneficial owners of such \n     class of securities.''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the bill before this body had broad \nbipartisan support, bicameral in nature. The bill we are considering \ntoday is the IPO bill, of course. The bill passed the House by an \noverwhelming majority. President Obama supports it.\n  I want everybody to know that the bill is imperfect, and that perhaps \nis an understatement. What we are trying to do with amendments offered \nby Senators Merkley and Reed is to improve this bill, which has a lot \nof problems. These two amendments would go a long way toward correcting \nthose.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, and we are confident that \nit will improve innovators' access to capital and give startups the \nflexibility they need to hire and grow. But it is not perfect, I \nrepeat. As with any other piece of legislation, there are ways we can \nimprove it. On this bill, there are many ways we can improve it. I am \nsorry we cannot do more.\n  To that end, the Senate will consider two germane amendments to this \nIPO bill that will protect investors and prevent fraud.\n  The first amendment is sponsored by Senator Merkley and others. It \ndeals with companies that raise capital online from small investors. \nThis amendment will ensure that watchdogs are in place to protect the \nsmall investors and their money from fraudulent companies and abuse of \nthe system.\n  People are lurking out there waiting for ways to cheat. I am sorry, \nbut it is true. These are people who are either amoral or immoral, \nlooking for opportunities to make money. I appreciate very much the \nwork that a number of Senators have put into this amendment. It is an \nimportant amendment, and it is so important to improving this bill. You \nwill hear much more this afternoon from the sponsors of the amendment \nabout why it is so important.\n  The second amendment is sponsored by Senator Reed of Rhode Island. \nAll Senators have stature, but Jack Reed, with his military background, \nhis experience in the House, and his experience in the Senate, is a man \nwe all look to for leadership. His amendment will ensure fair and \nhonest disclosure by companies raising capital. It will stop businesses \nfrom gaming the system and avoiding oversight by hiding thousands--or \nmaybe tens of thousands--of investors. This will stop when this \namendment passes.\n  Democrats and Republicans agree that we need to pass the IPO bill and \nmake it easier for American companies to raise capital, to grow \noperations, and to hire new workers, but we must do so in a way that \nbalances the needs and rights of investors and prevents fraud and \nabuse.\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\n  These two amendments will accomplish that. These two amendments are \nnot going to make the bill perfect, but it will be a lot better.\n  While the IPO measure before the Senate today is an important piece \nof legislation, experts agree its impact on job creation will be \nsomewhat limited.\n  This legislation is something that is before this body. Yesterday, \nSenate Republicans blocked a bill that would create, in 1 year, as it \ndid this year that we are in, 300,000 jobs. It is hard to comprehend, \nbut people who sponsored the amendment voted against it. But this isn't \nanything new. I think it is such callous disregard for what is fair and \nright.\n  The Republican leader has been talking nonstop about how important it \nis for Congress to continue to create jobs. So I am disappointed--and \nthat is an understatement--that yesterday Senate Republicans, led by my \nfriend the Republican leader, rejected an opportunity to help American \nexporters grow and hire.\n  The Ex-Im Bank helps American exporters compete in a global economy, \nand it has always enjoyed broad, bipartisan support--until this \nRepublican minority stepped in here. The last time it was offered, in \n2006, a Republican offered it. It got unanimous consent to pass. This \nlegislation has been going since the 1930s. It is backed by the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, the \nBusiness Roundtable, and labor unions. All my Republican friends can \nexplain to the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, and the Business Roundtable that not only did they kill \nthis bill but they stopped the deficit from going down by $1 billion, \nbecause the Ex-Im Bank bill reduces the deficit by $1 billion. Of \ncourse, it had Republican cosponsors.\n  In fact, my Republican colleagues, including many who voted against \nthis amendment yesterday, admitted they support the legislation. I had \na number of Senators come to me saying, we like it. As I said yesterday \nin my remarks, they are voting against a bill they say they like. The \nRepublican leader said a number of things yesterday, but he said he \nwanted to vote down this worthy proposal because he wants to pass it \nseparately.\n  We understand what is going on here. The Republican-dominated House \nof Representatives wants to send over here a hollow shell of the Ex-Im \nBank, and they would look to us and say that we now have an Ex-Im Bank \nbill. What they have come up with is so foolish, and that is a good \ndescription of it. Their offer is hollow. They want to appear to \nsupport the Ex-Im Bank and at the same time kill it.\n  Democrats actually do support the Ex-Im Bank, and we made that very \nclear to everybody and voted accordingly. We want it to become law.\n  House Republicans have shown no desire to even consider this \nimportant jobs measure--let alone pass it. The only way to ensure the \nEx-Im Bank can continue to help American companies grow and create jobs \nis for the Senate to attach it to this IPO bill, and that failed.\n  Yesterday, Senate Republicans had an opportunity to join with \nDemocrats to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country over \nthe next many years. They passed up that opportunity. Once again, they \nchose to pick an unnecessary fight instead. They want to fight over \neven things they agree with. How do you like that one? They love this \nbill, but they want to fight about it.\n  Our No. 1 priority is to create jobs, and we have shown that. It is \nobvious that the Republicans don't have their priorities straight. But \nthis is something we have had to live with.\n  We are going to work with the minority to come up with a time to have \na vote. The time expires around 6 o'clock tonight. Because of a number \nof things going on here today, I hope we can have a vote earlier than \nthat. We will do our best to work with the Republican leader to try to \ncome up with a vote. There will be three votes: Merkley, Reed, and \nfinal passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask to speak for up to 10 minutes, with \nSenator Merkley following me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \ncapital formation bill that we received cloture on a few minutes ago.\n  In a place where we too often get bogged down by politics, this \nlegislation reflects a strong, bipartisan commitment to creating jobs \nby ensuring that small businesses have access to critical capital that \nthey need. This legislation has tremendous potential to create jobs and \nspur economic growth and innovation. The key component to achieving all \nof these goals is ensuring that small businesses have access to the \ncapital they need to grow their businesses and create jobs.\n  This legislation is a rare instance in Congress where both Chambers \nin both parties come together to focus on this Nation's most urgent \npriority, and that is jobs. The President has already expressed his \nsupport for it. So let's get this bill done and off to him for his \nsignature.\n  Over the past few years, I have held 12 small business opportunity \nworkshops all over the State of Montana. Without a doubt, access to \ncapital is always one of the most critical issues that I hear from \nsmall business owners. Access to capital makes all the difference for a \nsmall business. If the money is there, so is the expansion; so is the \ncapacity to do more research and development; so is the next great \nidea. Without capital, though, there is no growth, no risk-taking, and \nthere are no jobs.\n  Montana is a State of entrepreneurs. It is a frontier State. It has a \ntradition of self-reliance, which is clearly reflected in the \nentrepreneurs and the successful and innovative small businesses they \nhave created and grown in this great State. They clearly reflect \nAmerica's entrepreneurial spirit, which helps keep rural America strong \nand makes our economy the most innovative in the world.\n  Our small businesses in Montana vary from family farms, ranches, and \none-man manufacturing shops, to innovative biotech companies and \ncutting-edge information analytics firms. Many of these newer firms \nhave the opportunity to change the landscape when it comes to \ndiversifying Montana's economy.\n\n  According to research from the Kauffman Foundation, nearly all net \njobs created since 1980 have come from firms 5 years or younger. The \nrole of startups in creating jobs and driving innovation has been well \ndocumented, but that ability to create jobs is limited if these firms \ndo not have access to financing to scale and to grow their companies. \nSo central to job creation is making sure investors and capital markets \nare accessible for startups.\n  Because of this potential for growth, we need to do all we can to \nempower these businesses with the tools they need to survive and thrive \nat every stage of their development. These young companies must be able \nto access the capital they need to bring innovative ideas and products \nto the marketplace.\n  Back in July I held the first of a series of hearings in the Banking \nCommittee to examine the challenges and opportunities facing innovative \nsmall businesses as they try to access capital. A major take-away from \nthe hearing was the need to ensure that capital markets remain within \nreach of startups at various stages of their development, particularly \nin the stages before they may be ready to go public.\n  A key recommendation offered at the hearing came from Rob Bargatze of \nLigocyte Pharmaceuticals in Bozeman, MT. He said we should take a \ncloser look at updating SEC regulation A to better enable small \nbusinesses to raise capital through these public offerings. The \nregulation A exemption was created in the Securities Act of 1933 to \nprovide small companies with an opportunity to raise capital without \nbeing subject to full registration with the SEC.\n  Ligocyte is developing a new norovirus vaccine with the potential to \nprevent hospitalization and save significant health care costs--and to \ncreate those jobs of the future. Working through the FDA approval \nprocess is not easy. It requires years of hard work and tens of \nmillions of dollars. It can be tough for any company to stick it out \nfor that long or for that much money, but for a small firm in Bozeman, \nMT, it can be especially difficult. Access to capital to fund their \nclinical trials will be the determining factor in their ability to gain \nFDA approval.\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n  Back in September, Senator Toomey and I introduced the Small Company \nCapital Formation Act to update regulation A by increasing the total \namount of capital that can be raised through these offerings to $50 \nmillion, while protecting new investors. Currently, the businesses can \nonly raise $5 million under regulation A--a limit that has not been \nupdated in nearly 20 years and one that many view as too low to be a \nvaluable tool in raising capital.\n  The bill maintains the most attractive elements of regulation A, \nincluding the ability for issuers to test the waters before registering \nwith the SEC. It also preserves the nonrestricted status of securities \nsold through a reg A offering so that these securities can be resold to \ninvestors after the initial offering.\n  New investor protections include a requirement that issuers file an \naudited financial statement with the SEC--a requirement that has been \nincluded in the legislation that I introduced as well as the House bill \nbefore us today. The bill also directs the SEC to establish additional \ndisclosure requirements and requires issuers to electronically file \noffering statements with the Commission.\n  Additionally, the bill subjects those offering or selling securities \nunder regulation A to negligence-based liability under section \n12(a)(2), and it includes disqualification provisions to prevent bad \nactors from making these offerings in a way that is consistent with \nDodd-Frank.\n  From what I have heard said about the House version of regulation A, \nyou would presume none of these investor protections are included. Let \nme clarify that the bill I introduced with Senator Toomey, S. 1544, is \nidentical to the language included in the House bill, H.R. 3606, that \nis before us today.\n  The truth is that the substitute amendment that was voted on \nyesterday made very minor changes to this portion of the House bill, \nsuch as changing a ``may'' to a ``shall'' and adding a study by the SEC \n5 years after implementation of these changes.\n  We should have been able to pass this bill by a voice vote here in \nthe Senate since this bill has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate, with six bipartisan cosponsors. Regardless of that, I am \npleased that this balanced bill also enjoyed a 420-to-1 vote in the \nHouse--420 for, 1 against. Imagine that--all but one voting Member of \nthe House of Representatives agree on this bill.\n  I would also note the SEC's recently released recommendation from its \nForum on Small Business Capital Formation increasing the regulation A \nexemption to $50 million was one of the top recommendations at this \nforum.\n  By the way, this is an idea which has been in the SEC's Forum on \nSmall Business Capital Formation recommendations almost every year \nsince 1993, the year after the limit was last raised to $5 million. So \nthe idea that this is some risky new idea is not correct. In fact, at a \nbriefing with the SEC a few weeks ago, SEC lawyers suggested that there \nwas absolutely nothing scary about S. 1544 and that they felt very \ncomfortable with the existing investor protections included in that \nbill.\n  The bottom line is that I am thrilled we will finally have an \nopportunity to pass this legislation--hopefully very soon--and get it \nto the President's desk.\n  What does this legislation mean for Montana entrepreneurs? Let me \ncite a few examples.\n  For Brett Baker, president and CEO of Microbion Corporation in \nBozeman, lifting the cap on regulation A offerings will provide him \nwith broader opportunities to raise capital. Instead of worrying about \nwhere the next phase of financing will come from, he can focus on \ndiscovery and research, working with the Department of Defense to use \ncompounds Microbion discovered to treat antibiotic-resistant wounds. \nThese changes will also allow a company such as Microbion to access \ncapital at an earlier stage without diluting its earlier investors who \nbelieved in them from the earliest days of that company. And raising \ncapital publicly through regulation A would also give folks in Bozeman \nwho know about the company an opportunity to share in its success, \nsomething that is not possible now unless they are an accredited \ninvestor.\n  More broadly, this legislation is going to provide small businesses \nin Montana's emerging data and biotech industries with new tools and \noptions to access capital at different stages of development, and it \nwill also provide necessary updates to existing regulations. For \nexample, changes to the SEC's 500 shareholder rule would ensure \ncompanies, such as investment brokerage D.A. Davidson in Great Falls, \ncan continue to provide their employees with stock in the company \nwithout having to go through a costly and time-consuming registration \nprocess with the SEC. This Montana-grown company dates back over 75 \nyears and has always believed in rewarding its employees so they can \nhave a stake in the success of the firm, which now operates in 16 \nStates. Without these changes, a company such as D.A. Davidson would be \nfaced with the choice of costly public registration or potentially \neliminating existing employee shareholders.\n\n  For companies such as Rivertop Renewables in Missoula, this \nlegislation will provide them with an onramp to going public if that is \nan option they choose to take one day. Rivertop has begun full-scale \nproduction of their groundbreaking green biochemical products used in \ncommercial products such as dishwashing detergents and de-icer. These \nchanges will ensure that Rivertop will have multiple strategies at \ntheir disposal so they can go public at a time that is right for them \nand take advantage of the public markets as they continue \ncommercialization of their products.\n  For Lance Trebesch of ticketprinting.com and Ticket River, this \nlegislation will enable him to grow his ticket printing, event \nmanagement, and online ticket printing firm. Since 1997 this company \nhas expanded its reach internationally, with over 25 employees in \nBozeman and Harlowton, MT.\n  This bill will ensure that entrepreneurs across the State of Montana \nwill have a whole new set of tools at their disposal so they can make \nsmart decisions about their future to develop and expand their \nbusinesses. They will have more choices and better access to capital \nmarkets, which should also give them more leeway to create and \ninnovate.\n  We have seen ecosystems of support for small businesses such as these \nas they spring up in virtually every county in Montana. Obviously, the \nsuccess of these companies has implications for job creation and \ngrowth, but there are also tremendous opportunities for innovation.\n  It is not surprising that in Montana so many startups have located \nnear universities in Missoula and Bozeman. In fact, many of these firms \ngot their start with discoveries in the labs at Montana State and the \nUniversity of Montana. With this legislation, the possibilities are \nendless for Montana and for entrepreneurs and innovators across Montana \nand this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to voting on this legislation and \ngetting it to the President for his signature.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of Senator Merkley and Senator Bennet, I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1884\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak to amendment No. 1884. \nSpecifically, this is the crowdfunding amendment. That might be a term \nthat is new to many, so let me explain.\n  The Internet provides new opportunities for capital to reach small \nbusinesses and startup entrepreneurs, and what this crowdfunding \namendment does is to say that when the crowd; that is, all of those who \nare surfing the Internet, goes to a funding portal on the Internet, a \nWeb site, to support a company, to invest in a company, there is an \norderly process that adequately facilitates this type of opportunity \nwhile providing fundamental investor protections. So this will be an \neffective instrument of capital formation because, indeed, if \ncrowdfunding becomes a situation where inaccurate information is put \nforward, where there is no\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\naccountability, where there are pump-and-dump schemes, then the \nreputation of crowdfunding will be deeply damaged and the opportunity \nfor capital formation will be equally affected.\n  This follows on a model that is already on the Internet in some other \ncontexts. For example, you can visit a Web site called kickstarter.com, \nand you as an individual can look at a host of concepts that are being \nput forward for social and artistic activities across this country. You \ncan say: Yes, I want to help that artist build that sculpture or so on \nand so forth. They may say how much money they want to raise, and you \nwould decide what you want to donate. That is a donation model. You \nalso can go to Web sites such as prosper.com or kiva.com, and these are \npeer-to-peer lending Web sites. If you go to prosper.com, you will see \na whole list of folks who are saying: Yes, I want to consolidate my \ncredit cards, I would like to borrow X amount and I am offering an \ninterest rate of such-and-such, and here is a little bit of background, \nand you can decide if you want to lend to that individual or not. That \nis peer-to-peer lending.\n  Well, what crowdfunding does is to create an equal opportunity for \nfolks to invest in early-stage businesses, startup businesses, small \nbusinesses. Imagine, for example, you run into someone at a cafe who \nsays: I have this new idea for a coffee shop called Starbucks. I am \ngoing to call it Starbucks. Would you like to help me launch this?\n  And you say: Well, another coffee shop--I don't know if the world \nneeds another coffee shop.\n  Maybe you jump in and maybe you don't. Then years later, you say: Oh, \nI should have seized that opportunity.\n  Well, through a crowdfunding portal, you get to hear those stories. \nYou get to read those stories being presented by folks from across the \ncountry about their efforts, and you can decide if you want to \nparticipate.\n  Now, crowdfunding is in the larger capital formation bill that comes \nto us from the House, but that particular formulation is deeply flawed, \nand I am going to walk through a series of differences between the \nHouse bill and the Senate bill for my colleagues so they can understand \nwhy we need to pass amendment 1884.\n  The first factor is that the House bill does not require someone \nlisting themselves or asking for startup money to provide any financial \ninformation. Well, that is a huge mistake. If there is no information, \nthere is nothing to guide, if you will, the wisdom of the crowd.\n  What we do in this Senate amendment is to create a simplified format. \nIf you are seeking less than $100,000, then your CEO simply certifies \nwhat the financials are for the company. If you are seeking from \n$100,000 to $500,000, then you need to have a CPA review the financial \nstatements. If you are seeking more than $500,000, then you need to \nhave audited financial statements. So, as the amount of money you are \nasking for increases, the degree to which you need to do due diligence \nfinancially and present the details increases as well.\n  There is certainly nothing that would prevent a particular Web site \nfrom establishing its own standards above and beyond these particular \nlevels.\n  A second thing is it is critical there be accountability for the \naccuracy of the information. The House bill not only doesn't even \nrequire information, but they put out information and there is no \naccountability. Basically, it is an invitation to spin any story one \nlikes.\n  What the Senate bill says is, in order for this capital market to \nwork well one has to stand behind the accuracy of their information. It \nhas basic liability accountability; that is, as a director or officer \nof this organization, they are standing behind the accuracy of what \nthey put out. It has a due diligence protection so this is very \nbalanced. It has a requirement that the information be relevant or \ngermane to the conduct of the company. So that is another protection \nfor the business itself. So it is balanced between the two. But this \ncan give investors a basic belief that what is being set up are \nreasonable amounts of information proportional to the request and that \nthe officers and directors are standing behind this information. That \ncreates the foundation for an effective marketplace.\n  A third distinction between the House bill and our amendment No. 1884 \nis the House bill does not require companies to go through an \nintermediary. In other words, under the House bill, if someone wants to \npromote their company, they can simply put out an e-mail. An e-mail can \nsay anything they want because they are not responsible for the \naccuracy, and they can send it to everyone in the world. They can \nproceed to put up popup ads that simply promote their company--again, \nwith no accuracy required. But by creating an Internet intermediary and \nthat intermediary has to register, we create a streamlined formulation \nso they have a funding portal registration much simpler than a broker \ndealer. But in doing so, they agree they are not going to take any \nposition on the various investment opportunities they are listing. So \nyou truly are the marketplace. They are not saying, by the way, that \nparticular offering by that company is a sweet deal. They can't pump \nit; they can't favor it. So you are a neutral marketplace, again, \nenabling the investor to know they are getting straightforward \ninformation, not something that is spun.\n  Another distinction is the House bill has no aggregate caps. The \nresult of that is that a person could lose their entire life savings in \none fell swoop. The Senate bill puts on very reasonable proportional \ncaps that say if one's income is $40,000 or less, their cap is $2,000; \nif they are between $40,000 and $100,000, their cap is 5 percent of \ntheir annual income; if they are over $100,000, it is 10 percent. So it \nallows for larger amounts of money from those who have much higher \nincomes but provides basic aggregate cap protections so we don't end up \nwith folks who are on public services because they were swindled out of \neverything they had.\n  Another key distinction is that under the House bill one can list \ntheir offering and close their offering within a single day, which \nprovides absolutely no feedback loop for any type of detected \ndeception. Under the Senate bill, we create a 3-week period from one's \nlisting to their closing. So one lists their idea. If enough people \nsign up to reach one's funding request level--say one has requested to \nraise $600,000. If enough people sign up and they are investing \n$100,000 here, $1,000 there that one reaches their goal, as soon as the \n21-day period expires, then they close. So that does give time for some \nsort of feedback loops regarding any sort of fraudulent activity.\n  Another distinction is that the House bill allows a company to pay \npromoters and not disclose it. That is called pumping. If one has ever \nseen the movie ``Boiler Room,'' one can see a basic classic pump-and-\ndump scheme, where a roomful of folks on the phone are calling people, \ncold-calling them, and they are saying: Hey, I am calling because I am \ngiving you this incredible investment opportunity and here is the \nstory. They can say anything they want and they can talk people into \nbuying that stock and then the stock is actually being purchased from \nthe folks who own the boiler room. Then, as soon as they sell all the \nstock they have, they quit making phone calls, the value of the stock \ndrops, and everybody who invested loses out. That is a classic boiler \nroom. That is a classic pump and dump. The House bill allows paid \npromotion with no disclosure.\n  The Senate bill says if they are going to get on the blog's site \nwithin a Web site portal and say favorable things about a stock and if \nthey are paid by the company to do it, they have to disclose that. They \nsimply say: Hey, I am employed by such and such, but I want to bring to \nyour attention some merits of this. But at least the public knows where \nthey are coming from.\n  Another essential issue is the issue of dilution. Dilution is not a \nsolution in this world; it is a problem. Those are folks who get in on \nthe front end and think: I got in on this idea early. I am going to \nbenefit from having made this effort, and find out later a bigger \ninvestor came in and the stock was diluted in a fashion in which they \nare basically written out of their share of the ownership. So the \nSenate bill directs the SEC to provide investor protections in this \narea.\n  These are key distinctions. These are the distinctions between a \nsolid foundation for capital formation in this incredibly exciting new \nopportunity, new\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nmarket, and simply a path to predatory schemes that the House is \nproviding. That is why I am encouraging my colleagues to support the \namendment Senator Bennet, who will be speaking next, and I have put \ntogether and a number of our colleagues have joined us, including \nSenator Landrieu and Senator Scott Brown. This is a credible foundation \nfor an exciting idea.\n  Let me close with this notion; that is, that across America, \nAmericans have $17 trillion invested in their retirement accounts. If \nthey were to put 1 percent of those funds into this type of \ncrowdfunding startup, they would be providing $170 billion of \ninvestment potential for small companies and startup companies. That is \nan incredibly powerful potential form of capital to put America \nforward. It is small businesses that create most of the jobs, and this \ncapital formation idea will help in that. Let's get it done.\n  I certainly deeply appreciate the contributions of my colleague from \nColorado, Senator Bennet, who will make his points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Merkley, for his leadership on this issue and for his \nwillingness, when times got tough, to dig even deeper and make sure we \nget to the balanced approach that is reflected in this amendment. It is \na bipartisan amendment, which around this place I think is worthy of \nall of us taking a moment to recognize, and it is an amendment the \npeople who know most about crowdfunding support. I wish to read several \nparagraphs from some of those folks.\n  From Launcht, which is a crowdfunding platform, they note that our \ncompromise:\n\n       [i]s important because, unlike previous bills, for the \n     first time, we have a Senate bill with bipartisan \n     sponsorship, a balance of state oversight and federal \n     uniformity, industry standard investor protections, and \n     workable funding caps.\n\n  From the National Small Business Association, we hear that our \ncompromise:\n\n       [w]ould promote entrepreneurship, job creation and economic \n     growth by making it much easier for small companies to raise \n     capital and get new ideas off the ground. This legislation \n     represents a reasonable effort to accommodate differing \n     points of view and to move this important idea forward.\n\n  One prominent investor protection advocate wrote that:\n\n       [t]he CROWDFUND Act addresses this concern by providing \n     significant regulatory relief to very small issuers without \n     unreasonably compromising the investor protection provisions \n     on which the federal securities laws are grounded and the \n     long-term success of the U.S. securities markets has been \n     based.\n\n  The Senator from Oregon did an excellent job of describing the \nprovisions in this bill, so I am not going to go over that ground \nagain. But I do wish to talk for a moment before I yield to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island about what it is we are trying to solve. Too often I \nthink we don't ask ourselves what the nature of the problem is we are \ntrying to solve before we actually set about solving it, and then--no \nsurprise--we end up actually making matters worse.\n  In my townhalls the chief concern of the people who come is that \nmedian family income has continued to decline in this country. For the \nfirst time in this country's history, the middle class is earning less \nat the end of the decade than they were at the beginning of the decade. \nThat has never happened before in the United States.\n  So person after person has come and said: Michael, I have done what I \nwas supposed to do. I kept working at my job. Nobody said I didn't do a \ngood job. But my wage is actually less in real dollars today than it \nwas at the beginning of the decade, but the cost of health insurance \ncontinues to go up, the cost of college. I have had at least half a \ndozen people say to me they cannot afford to send their kid to the best \ncollege they got into. I can't think of anything that is more of a \nwaste of our productivity than that.\n  The essential problem we are facing in this economy is structural. \nOur gross domestic product, believe it or not, as we stand here, is \nhigher than it was when we went into this recession, the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. Productivity is also way up. The \nefficiency with which we are driving that economic growth is way up \nbecause we have had to respond to competition from abroad. We can't \ntake anything for granted anymore. We have employed technology to drive \nproductivity from the cotton pickers in my wife's hometown to the \nlargest Fortune 500 companies that we have, and we have 23 or 24 \nmillion people who are either unemployed or underemployed in this \neconomy.\n  The economic output is back, but it has decoupled from wages and it \nhas decoupled from job growth and that was true before we went into the \nworst recession. You see, the last period of economic growth in this \ncountry's history is the first time our economy grew and wages fell, \nthat our economy grew and that we lost jobs. It was a decoupling of \neconomic growth from wage growth and from job growth. There is \nsomething terribly wrong with that picture, and it is creating an \nenormous downward pressure on the middle class in this country.\n  There are a bunch of things we need to do, but there are two major \nthings that I think we need to do; one is, we need to educate our \npeople for the 21st century. The worst the unemployment rate ever got \nfor people with a college degree in the worst recession since the Great \nDepression, the one we just went through, was 4.5 percent. That is a \npretty good stress test, it seems to me, of the value of a college \neducation in the 21st century. But as a country today, if someone is a \nchild living in poverty, their chances of getting a college degree are \n9 in 100. If we don't change the way we educate people in this country, \nwe will continue to see 91 of 100 children living in poverty \nconstrained to the margin of our economy and the margin of this \ndemocracy. That is an important piece of work. We have a vital national \ninterest in that, and we are not paying attention to it here.\n  But also we have to create the conditions in this country where we \nare driving innovation and driving job growth because the days of just \nexpecting the largest companies in this country to create jobs are \nover. The jobs that went away in the 20th century, many of them are not \ncoming back in the 21st century. It is about businesses that are \nstarted tomorrow and next week and the week after that and the month \nafter that. In order to create those sorts of conditions, the amendment \nwe have presented, this crowdfunding amendment, could unleash billions \nof dollars, as the Senator from Oregon said, of local investment, \ninvestment on Main Street--or on someone else's Main Street through the \nInternet--that could allow people with great innovative ideas for the \nfirst time to raise capital from our middle class and from other people \nwho would like to participate in this kind of new business venture.\n  This is not all we need to do. There are many things we need to do, \nand I think there are things in this overall bill we need to fix. But \nthis bipartisan amendment represents a real step forward. As we look to \nthe future, it is the reason we need to do comprehensive tax reform in \nthis Congress. It is the reason we need to fundamentally think \ndifferently in this Congress about our regulations. We should be asking \nourselves the question: Are we more or less likely to be creating jobs \nin the United States with rising wages? I think we should put the \npolitics of this aside because there isn't a person in this Chamber who \ndoesn't want to do this. We start, though, with the recognition that we \nhave structural issues we need to resolve.\n  I hope everybody who hasn't had the chance to get a look at the \namendment will look at it. I hope people on both sides of the aisle \nwill support this amendment. I am very pleased it is bipartisan, with \nSenator Merkley and Senator Brown, and I look forward to voting on this \namendment this afternoon.\n  I see the Senator from Rhode Island is here. I thank him for his \nleadership on this legislation, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Senator Merkley and Senator Bennet \nfor their extraordinary work, indeed, in collaboration I believe with \nour colleague Senator Brown from Massachusetts to make significant \nimprovements in the crowdfunding provisions\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nof the House bill. As Senator Bennet and Senator Merkley have \nindicated, this represents a potentially very productive way to raise \ncapital, and they have provided protections that will ensure investors \nin this process are not disadvantaged, and I commend them for that.\n  It addresses one of the significant issues in the House bill but, \nfrankly, not all the significant issues. There are some extremely \nglaring, I think, provisions in the House bill that we attempted to \naddress in the Reed-Landrieu-Levin substitute. That substitute \namendment, although it received a majority of votes, did not receive \nenough to achieve cloture to be the bill we are now considering. We are \nnow considering the House bill.\n  I have an amendment to that House bill that addresses one of several \ndifficulties with the House legislation. Investors, when they buy stock \nin public companies, expect routine disclosures. They expect to know on \na quarterly basis, and in a very real sense on an annual basis, what is \nthe company doing? What are the prospects of the company? All that goes \nhand in hand with the widely dispersed ownership of a public company. \nThe House legislation would allow many companies with a substantial \nnumber of beneficial shareholders, the actual owners, the real owners \nof the stock, the ones who can vote the stock, the ones who get the \ndividends, the ones who vote on the proxies or directly for the \nleadership of the corporation--it would allow them to remain dark. This \nmight be appropriate for some companies that have a relatively small \nbase of real owners, but the way the House has drafted this legislation \nit could risk allowing a significant number of larger companies to go \nor remain dark.\n  The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 set up a system of public \nreporting. Beginning in 1964, the SEC required that companies with at \nleast 500 holders of record--and at least $10 million in assets, to \nfollow the routine reporting requirements under the securities laws. \nThe decision was made that at that point a company does have a size \nthat is adequate and necessary so that they should be disclosing.\n  The issue that is motivating the House is this 500-person \nrequirement. It was adopted, as I said, in 1964. There is a sense that \nthe limit is probably too low. The House version is 2,000. We make no \nattempt to change the House limit of 2,000 now, the new limit. But what \nwe want to be sure of is that the individuals who are being counted are \nnot the record holders, they are the real owners, the beneficial \nowners. In fact, many companies are very astute and assiduous in \nassuring that these record holders fall beneath this 500 level.\n  There are many large companies, well-known companies, as I mentioned \nin my previously remarks, that have thousands of beneficial owners but \nstill have, on their own records, less than 500 holders of record. The \nSEC defines record holders as ``each person who is identified as the \nowner of such securities on records of the security holders maintained \nby or on behalf of the issuer.''\n  Holder of record is very direct. It is the shareholders who are \nrecorded as such on the books of the company. This is where the term \n``beneficial owner'' comes from. In such instances, the shares are held \nof record by a third party, usually a broker, on behalf of the \nshareholder. For example--and this is one of many examples--if you buy \nshares from Charles Schwab, that discount brokerage firm would likely \nserve as the record holder and you would be the beneficial owner. It is \nyour money; you paid for it. It is your vote because you are a \nbeneficial owner. It is your right to sell the shares. But as far as \nthe company is concerned, the holder of record is the broker, Charles \nSchwab.\n  I think we have all been familiar and all received in the mail a big \npackage of proxy materials from our broker. It is not, in many cases, \ndirectly from the company. It is from the Wells Fargo Advisors, it is \nfrom Schwab Advisors, et cetera, because they are on the records of the \ncompany as the ones who are the record holders. They distribute the \nmaterial to beneficial owners.\n  The consequence is that for companies that may have a very few or \nrelatively few record holders, they have thousands and thousands of \nbeneficial owners. Those are the individuals who will lose out if the \ncompany decides, under the House bill, to suddenly go or remain dark, \nto avoid public reporting.\n  As I have indicated before, most investors today do so through \nintermediaries--through brokers, through others. As a result, they \nwould not necessarily be counted as a record holder. Record holders--\nthe brokers, the large entities--are increasingly purely passthroughs. \nThey are agents with no economic interest in the company, no voting \nrights. Those are held by the beneficial owners. That is why I believe \nthat beneficial ownership should be the test for whether companies have \nto report under the Securities Exchange Act. It should encompass those \nwho have the power to sell and/or the power to vote the shares. They \nare the actual shareholders. They are the individuals who management is \ncommitted by fiduciary duties to work for. So I think it is appropriate \nthat when we raise this level to 2,000 we also ensure that it is not \nsimply record holders, it is the beneficial owners--the real owners, \nfor want of another term.\n  There also could be, for example, two identical companies with \nidentical numbers of beneficial owners but they might have different \nnumbers of record holders because of the way the shares are held--in \ntrust or by a broker, et cetera. And one company reporting and one not \nreporting does not seem to be to be a fair or efficient way to do \nbusiness.\n  Companies already have to obtain numbers of beneficial owners from \nbrokers and banks in order to know how many copies of annual reports \nand proxy materials they have to print, so every company knows about \nhow many beneficial numbers they have. They have to provide the proxy \nmaterial through the brokerage or bank to the beneficial owners, so \nthey know very well--in fact, quite precisely--their beneficial \nownership, their real shareholders.\n  But using record level as the trigger to remain private, to avoid \npublic reporting, to me again is the wrong approach. My amendment would \nclarify the definition in this new shareholder threshold section of the \nunderlying bill, and ensure that companies are not avoiding these \npublic reporting requirements by using a threshold of 2,000 record \nholders if they have 2,000 or fewer beneficial owners. If this is a \ntruly small business that has 1,500 individual shareholders, beneficial \nowners, and they want to remain dark--that seems to be something that \nwe certainly would countenance, and with my language it would be \npossible to do so.\n\n  I think this approach makes it fair for everyone. It also doesn't \nfrustrate the expectations of a person who buys a share of nationally \nknown stock that is publicly reported and gets a 10 Q and every year \nthe 10 K, and suddenly they don't get anything. They wonder what is \ngoing on at the company. Maybe the company merges with another company, \ncreates a new company, and now has less than 2000 holders of record. I \nthink that is not an approach we should countenance. I think \ntransparency and accurate information are critical to the success of \nour capital markets, and I think this legislation will do that. \nRequiring quarterly reporting of firms with a large number of \nshareholders--real shareholders, beneficial shareholders--protects \ninvestors while at the same time improving overall market transparency \nand efficiency. From this information, those individual analysts and \nbrokers who follow companies are able to determine their \nrecommendations, are able to advise clients that you should buy this \ncompany, it is a good company.\n  When the company goes dark, that information source dries up and it \nis harder for individuals, brokers, investment advisors to give advice. \nI think this would not be helpful to the market. In fact, I think it \nmight, ironically, impede capital formation, not facilitate capital \nformation.\n  There is one important point that has to be stressed, and that is my \namendment does not affect the employee exemption in the underlying \nbill. The House bill has a blanket exemption for counting owners of the \ncompany for employees. We have reviewed this exemption in our \nlegislation with eminent experts, including Prof. John Coates at \nHarvard Law School, and he concurs that employees would not be swept up \ninto being\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\ncounted because they happen to receive compensation through stock in \ntheir company.\n  There are many companies--WaWa, Wegmans--that want to have active \nemployee participation in the company through stock plans but are \nprivate companies and want to remain private. This should allow them to \ndo so.\n  Again, my legislation makes no attempt to change the underlying House \nbill, which gives a very broad blanket exemption for employees, who are \nexempted from the shareholder threshold.\n  There is another aspect here, too, and that is ESOPs, employee stock \noption plans, because they do acquire stock on behalf of employees. We \nspecifically asked Professor Coates, one of the preeminent experts in \nsecurities law, whether this would inadvertently trigger or \ninadvertently complicate the beneficial ownership rule. His opinion is \nthat ESOPs typically count as one record holder and one beneficial \nowner because they do not pass through the votes or the right to direct \nsales. They do not have the characteristics which are typical of the \nbeneficial owner: the right to vote and the right to sell the stock. \nThey maintain those rights. They do not delegate those to the \nindividual employees who might be part of the pool. So Professor \nCoates' view is that ESOPs also would be exempt from being counted, if \nyou will, as more than one entity.\n  We have also reached out to the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand we have received some assurances, from talking to Meredith Cross of \nthe SEC, that, given their rulemaking power, they have within the ambit \nof their power in implementing this legislation the ability to clarify \nany of these points. So that not just employees who receive stock \nthrough an employee plan, but an ESOP and other entities that hold \nstock--not on behalf of their investors but have the right as an entity \nsuch as a venture capital fund or a private equity fund--have the right \nat that fund level to vote and to direct the sale of the shares and \nreceive the dividends--that they, too, would be counted as one entity.\n  Professor Coates, as I said, believes this will not affect the \nventure capital/private equity firm structures, which would typically \ncount as one shareholder, whether of record or beneficially. The VC \nfirm or PE firm does not pass through votes or the right to direct \nsales to its own investors, and the same might be said with mutual \nfunds, pension funds, et cetera--the primary passthrough which would be \ncounted as brokers and banks, who hold on behalf of beneficial owners.\n  What we have, I think, is legislation that recognizes the need to \nincrease the number adopted in 1964, but also to recognize that the \nreal owners of companies far exceed, in many cases, the holders or \nrecord, and that these real owners depend upon the routine reporting \nthat is required under the Securities Exchange Act so they can be \ninformed, so they can follow their stock. Indeed, the analysts who look \nclosely at these companies, who make recommendations to buy and sell, \nalso need this type of information. For this reason I have proposed \nthis amendment. I think it is something that improves the bill. It was \nincluded in our substitute which did not receive 60 votes to pass \ncloture but did receive the majority of votes in this body. I think it \nis something, again, that will improve this legislation. I would not \nhesitate to add that many more improvements are necessary, but \ncertainly this would be an improvement.\n\n  I would note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my Republican colleagues for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on the Senate floor this morning Senator \nDurbin called on Republican Members to offer to give up what he called \ntheir Federal health care. I heard his comments, and he makes an \ninteresting argument. But, once again, Democrats in the Senate are \nignoring history, as the Senator did today. They are ignoring the facts \nand ignoring the Democrats' record on this issue.\n  The truth is, Republicans in this body have already offered to give \nup their health insurance coverage. In fact, here is the rest of the \nstory:\n  During the debate on the health care law--almost 2 years ago today--\nRepublicans offered to forego their private coverage and instead enroll \nall Members of Congress in Medicaid, the government's safety-net \nprogram for low-income individuals. The Democrats in this body \nunanimously rejected this idea. Every Democrat voted no. This was on an \namendment by former Senator LeMieux from Florida, an amendment that \nasked to enroll all Members of Congress in the Medicaid Program. Yet at \nleast 50 percent of the newly covered individuals under the Democrats' \nnew law are going to get coverage, and they will get their coverage \nthrough Medicaid.\n  So the President's solution for health care in this country is to put \n50 percent of the newly covered individuals under Medicaid. Yet the \nDemocratic Members of the Senate unanimously voted no. If Democrats \nbelieve Medicaid is good enough for the 24 million people they will \nsoon force onto the rolls, my question is, Why isn't it good enough for \nthe Democratic Members of Congress?\n  So I am joined today by my colleagues on the Senate floor who \ncontinue to raise questions about the health care law and so many \nbroken promises made by this President. I am fortunate to be joined by \na senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Grassley.\n  I would ask my colleague from Iowa, as a senior member of the Senate \nFinance Committee, who spent a lot of time studying and debating \nPresident Obama's health care law, my question to the Senator is, Do \nyou think the President's promises match the reality?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say to the Senator from Wyoming, definitely not, and \nAmericans are seeing every day that is not the case. If I could respond \na little bit more in length, I would go back to 1994 and point out a \nproblem President Clinton had, and in turn that President Obama tried \nto avoid about 14 years later. It was in 1994 that the health care \nreform issue came before the Congress--promoted by President Clinton at \nthat time--and it failed in large part because it fundamentally changed \nthe health care coverage for nearly every American.\n  We know the bill that is now law has fundamentally changed, but \nPresident Obama, in 2009--and throughout his campaign in 2008--decided \nhe would combat the failure of the Clinton administration on health \ncare reform, and not being successful there, by repeating over and over \nto Americans: ``If you like what you have, you can keep it.'' That is \nbasically what we heard at least 47 different times while the bill on \nhealth care reform was being debated.\n  We heard that from the President himself. We probably heard it from \nMembers of this Congress hundreds of times. While it may have been \npolitically useful to make that promise to the American people, it \nremains a promise he cannot keep and he did not keep.\n  The fact is, millions of Americans are seeing changes in their \nexisting health plans due to the health reform law. So, basically, when \nthe President said, ``if you like what you have, you can keep it,'' it \nis not turning out that way, and Americans are seeing it every day.\n  The administration's regulations governing so-called ``grandfathered \nhealth plans'' will force most firms--up to 80 percent of the small \nbusinesses--to give up their current health care programs, and that is \nhappening fairly regularly. When those businesses lose their \ngrandfathered status, they immediately become subject to costly new \nmandates and increased premiums that follow. So the economics of health \ncare costs and health care insurance dictate that people are not going \nto be able to keep what they have, as the President promised.\n  Families in 17 States no longer have access to child-only plans as a \nresult of\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\nthe health care law. So if you were a voter in 2008, and the President \nsaid to you ``if you like what you have, you can keep it,'' and you \nwanted only health insurance for your children, you cannot do that \ntoday in these 17 States. It is not known how many families who lost \ncoverage for their children because of the law have been able to find \nan affordable replacement.\n  Medicare Advantage covers about 20 percent of the senior citizens of \nAmerica. There is a study that shows the Medicare Advantage enrollment \nis going to be cut in half. The choices available to seniors are going \nto be reduced by two-thirds. Then there is the open question about \nAmericans who receive their health care through large employers. The \nCBO recently released a report that constructed a scenario where as \nmany as 20 million Americans could lose their employer coverage.\n  While I acknowledge that the Congressional Budget Office report \nprovided the number that I just mentioned as only one possible \nscenario, there are many who believe that is very plausible given the \nincentives in the health care law created for large businesses.\n  So I say to the Senator from Wyoming, 47 times--just while we were \ndebating it; I don't know how many times during the campaign--this \nPresident said, ``If you like what you have, you can keep it.'' It is a \npromise that was not kept.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, I say to my colleague from Iowa, it is \ninteresting that we take a look at this and so many promises that \nreflect one specific promise, ``if you like what you have, you can keep \nit.''\n  I practiced orthopedic surgery for 25 years, taking care of families \nin Wyoming. Many of those families included family members who were on \nMedicare, the program for our seniors. Senator Grassley has made some \nreference in his earlier comments about seniors, people who are on \nMedicare, people who are having a harder time finding a doctor. This \nhealth care law clearly had an impact on seniors as well.\n  So I would ask my colleague from Iowa, are there specific things the \nSenator has been hearing as he travels around the State and visits with \nfolks at home in terms of perhaps promises made specifically to seniors \nand those broken promises related to Medicare?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is not only a promise that has been broken, that \nis a promise that is very easy to quantify because, on July 29, 2009, \nduring the consideration of this health care reform law, the President \nsaid:\n\n       Medicare is a government program. But don't worry: I'm not \n     going to touch it.\n\n  So let's take a look at the health care law and see if that promise \nwas kept. The health care law made significant cuts in Medicare \nprograms. This is what we can quantify in dollars and cents.\n  On April 22, 2010, the Chief Actuary of Medicare analyzed the law and \nfound that it would cut Medicare by $575 billion over 10 years. The \nPresident said, about Medicare, as I told you, ``I'm not going to touch \nit.'' But the President has touched it in a big way: $575 billion out \nof Medicare.\n  Medicare is on a path to go broke by 2021; $575 billion is not going \nto guarantee Medicare for everybody in the future. We have to reform \nand change Medicare if that promise is going to be kept. We all want to \ndo that, but the President has made that more difficult.\n  The Congressional Budget Office wrote that over $500 billion in \nMedicare reductions ``would not enhance the ability of the government \nto pay for future Medicare benefits.'' You know what the President said \nduring the debate on this bill: ``I'm not going to touch it.'' But he \nhas touched it in a big way.\n  The Chief Actuary had this to say about the Medicare reductions:\n\n       Providers--\n\n  Meaning hospitals and doctors--\n\n       Providers for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive \n     portion of their business could find it difficult to remain \n     profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end \n     their participation in the program.\n\n  So not only touching 500-and-some billion dollars, but also touching \nit in a way of limiting access for senior citizens of America when the \nPresident said, ``I'm not going to touch it,'' he misled the American \npeople.\n  The CM Actuary said, in essence, these cuts could drive providers \nfrom the Medicare Program. I have a hard time understanding how these \nmassive cuts to Medicare count as somehow: I'm not going to touch \nMedicare.\n  On the other hand, the biggest problem facing Medicare in the near \nterm is a physicians payment update problem that we constantly have to \naddress and could have been addressed in the health care reform bill. \nYou know what. It was not addressed. Of course nothing was done about \nit. Perhaps that is what the President meant when he said about \nMedicare, I say to the Senator from Wyoming, ``I'm not going to touch \nit.''\n  Mr. BARRASSO. That clearly points out to the people around the \ncountry what they know, and if they are on Medicare that it is that \nmuch more challenging for them to even find a doctor because of the \n$500 billion of cuts to Medicare--and not to save Medicare, not to \nstrengthen Medicare, but to start a whole new government program for \nother people. So those are several of the promises the President made.\n  We just heard from my colleague from Iowa, ``if you like what you \nhave, you can keep it.'' We know that promise has been broken, and now \nthe promises by the President--I will protect Medicare--which is \nclearly not the case, as the American people have seen, which is why \nthis health care law is even more unpopular today than it was when it \nwas passed.\n  But thinking back to the time it was passed, the Senator from \nMissouri Mr. Blunt, who is joining us on the floor, was very actively \ninvolved in the debate and the discussions in pointing out the concerns \npeople in his home State had with regard to the health care law and the \nobjections he heard. My recollection is that there was even an issue on \nthe ballot about the health care law and mandates and related issues.\n  So I ask my friend and colleague from Missouri if there are comments \nhe would like to add to help with this discussion of the broken \npromises of the Obama health care law.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank the doctor for his leadership on \nthis issue during the debate on the health care law itself and right up \nto now, the second anniversary of it being signed into law. Certainly \nMissouri voters were the first voters who went to the polling place and \nregistered their views on this. As I recall, 72 percent said they did \nnot want to be a part of it. The famous comment made on the other side \nof the building by the Speaker--we will know what is in the bill once \nwe pass it--has proven to be very true and not very positive from the \npoint of view of that bill.\n  The Senator from Wyoming and Senator Grassley have talked about the \npromises made already--the promise not to touch Medicare, the promise \nthat if you like what you have, you can keep it--surely nobody can say \nthat with a straight face anymore--and the promise during the campaign \nthat there wouldn't be a mandate.\n  Four years ago this was the big division of the two principal \ncandidates for the nomination on that side. Senator Obama's view was \nthat there would be no mandate, that there was no need for a mandate. \nIn fact, at one point he said that having a mandate would be like \nsolving homelessness by mandating that everybody buy a house. Now, that \nis not my quote, that is President Obama's quote when he was Senator \nObama--having a mandate on health care would be like solving the \nhousing problem by saying we are going to require that everybody buy a \nhouse.\n  This plan does not work. It doesn't come together. The parts of the \nplan that were supposed to pay for the plan are one by one being \ndiscarded.\n  Remember the so-called CLASS Act, the long-term care act, which \ntechnically, I guess, would have produced some money because it \ncollected money the first 10 years; the first 10 years, we are counting \nthe money and we are not allowed to spend any of it for the first 10 \nyears. So, sure, that would be a net income to the Federal Government. \nWe are not spending and money is coming in. But even the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services said what many of us said at the time, which \nis that this plan won't work, so we are not even going to collect the \nmoney because we know there is no way this particular structure will do \nwhat it is supposed to do.\n  It is just one broken promise after another, it is just one set of \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nafter another, and the more the American people look at it, the more \nthey realize this just doesn't add up. Not only does it not add up \nfinancially, it doesn't add up to better health care.\n  We are going to see lots of people--the Congressional Budget Office \nrecently estimated that I think 20 million people who get insurance now \nat work would lose that insurance at work once this goes into effect, \nand that was not a calculation in the original bill. Everybody was at \nleast calculating that anybody who has insurance now would keep what \ntheir employer would continue to pay for. Well, for 20 million of them, \napparently, that is not going to be the case.\n  I yield to the Senator from Wyoming on that topic of just what \nemployers are going to have to decide to do once they are faced with \nthis new mandated policy that covers not only what they think they can \nafford but whatever some government official decides is the perfect \npolicy for all Americans. Now, imagine that--the perfect policy for all \nAmericans. One-size-fits-all almost always means that one size doesn't \nfit anybody. And these employers, it is now understood, are in many \ncases just going to take the option that they will pay the penalty that \nis less than they are paying now for insurance or they are going to \nhave to require their employees to go get their insurance in a \nsubsidized exchange. That means taxpayers will be helping buy insurance \nfor people who today have insurance through their employers at the rate \nof at least 20 million, and I think that number will be a lot higher \nthan that.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, it does seem that way to me, to the point that \nnow, 2 years out, Senator Coburn and I put together a report on what we \nare finding. It is a checkup on the Federal health law, and the title \nis ``Warning: Side Effects.'' That is because there are huge side \neffects from this health care law. The four that we have written out on \nthe prescription pad, as we see it, on the prescription pad handed out \nby President Obama, No. 1 is fewer choices; No. 2, we have higher \ntaxes; No. 3, more government; and No. 4 is less innovation. That is \nwhat the American people are seeing as the side effects of this health \ncare law. People don't want few choices, they want more choices. People \ndon't want higher taxes, they want lower taxes. They don't want more \ngovernment, they want less government. They don't want less innovation, \nthey want more innovation. That is what the American people asked for.\n  There was a reason to do health care reform--because people wanted \nthe care they need from a doctor they want at a cost they can afford. I \nknow that is what my colleague from Iowa sees when he goes home every \nweekend and talks to people in his home communities.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if I could add one thing at this point, \nwe don't really know how bad this law is yet. I am going to add \nsomething to what Senator Blunt said when he quoted the Speaker of the \nHouse saying that we don't really know what is in this bill and we are \ngoing to have to pass it to find out what is in it. That is what she \nhad to say to get a majority vote even within her own party to get it \nthrough the House of Representatives. But, in a sense, she is right. \nOne could understand every letter of this law, but it has 1,693 \ndelegations of authority for the Secretary to write regulations, and \nuntil they are written, we aren't really going to know what is in it. \nWe remember the accountable care organization rules that came out. Six \npages out of 2,700 in the bill dealt with accountable care \norganizations, but the first regulations that were written were 350 \npages long. So we really won't know how bad this legislation is maybe \nfor a few years down the road, and hopefully we never get that far down \nthe road.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My understanding of the accountable care organization \ncomponent is that the very health programs the accountable care \norganizations were modeled after, the ones the President held up as the \nmodels across the country--one was in Utah, one was Geisinger in \nPennsylvania, and I believe the Mayo Clinic may have been a third--once \nthose 350 pages of regulations came out, the programs the President \nsaid were the models we want to follow, they all said: We can't comply \nwith these regulations. They are too stringent. They are too confining. \nThey will not work in our program.\n\n  So if it is not going to work in the places where the President said \nthey are doing it well, to me that means they are not going to work \nanywhere in Wyoming and very likely not anywhere in Iowa or anywhere in \nMissouri as we try to make sure patients get the care they need from \nthe doctor they want at a cost they can afford.\n  That is why I continue to look at this health care law and go home \nevery weekend and talk to people, and I continue to hear that this bill \nis bad for patients, bad for providers--the nurses and the doctors who \ntake care of the patients--and bad for taxpayers.\n  When we take a look at Medicare--and Senator Blunt made a comment \nabout Medicare and some of the changes--who is going to make these \ndecisions? It looks to me as though, from reading through this law, it \nis about 15 unelected bureaucrats with this so-called Independent \nPayment Advisory Board who will decide what hospitals will get paid for \nproviding various services. So in small communities, the hospital may \nsay: Well, we can no longer offer that service. I have heard my \ncolleagues talk about the specific loss of the ability of hospitals to \neven stay profitable with some of the cuts, from taking $500 billion \naway from Medicare, again, not to save and strengthen Medicare but to \nstart a whole new government program for others.\n  Those are the things we are dealing with and why, at townhall meeting \nafter townhall meeting, people continue to tell me they want this \nrepealed and they want it replaced with patient-centered health care--\nnot government-centered, not insurance company-centered, but patient-\ncentered health care. That is what people are asking for, and they get \ntired of all these broken promises the President has made.\n  I remember the President said he was going to bring down the price of \npremiums by $2,500 per family per year. What family wouldn't want that? \nThe whole purpose of the health care law initially was to get the costs \nof health care under control. This didn't do it.\n  If I go to a townhall meeting, as I did not too long ago in Wyoming, \nand say: How many of you under the new health care law are finding that \nyou are paying more for health insurance, not the $2,500 less a year \nthe President promised, but how many are paying more, every hand goes \nup. Then we ask the question: How many of you believe the quality and \nthe availability of your own care is going to go down as a result of \nthis health care law, and every hand goes up. I know that in the Show \nMe State of Missouri, that is not what people want. They don't want to \npay more and get less. I don't know if my colleague has been hearing \nthings similar to that at home.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I think that is what we are all hearing. Whether you are \nfor this bill or not, my guess is that you are hearing that if you are \nasking that question.\n  Another of the President's promises was that an average family, if \nthis health care plan went into effect, would pay $2,500 less, as the \ndoctor just said, per year. In fact, since he became President, \ninsurance premiums have risen by $2,213 a year--not a $2,500 cut but a \n$2,213 increase, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The survey \nsays that in 2008, for employer-provided insurance, the average family \npremium was $12,860. Last year it was $15,073. These are incredible \nincreases for families, coupled with the bad energy policies and other \npolicies that put families into a condition they would hope not to be \nin and we hope for them not to be in. So you have increased costs to \nfamilies, increased costs to the system.\n  That is the other thing the President said. Another broken promise \nwas that this health care bill would control costs. Recently, according \nto the Medicare Actuary--the person who calculates these costs--the \nestimate was that national health spending would go up at least $311 \nbillion over 10 years under this plan. Now, that is not cost control; \nthat is $311 billion, almost one-third of $1 trillion in increases.\n  Payment reductions to hospitals--the Senator from Wyoming mentioned \nthis board that will make these decisions. I am not sure there will be\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nenough people on that board who understand rural hospitals and \nunderstand why it is critical that rural hospitals that are critical-\ncare hospitals continue to have different arrangements with the \ngovernment than others do for the government-provided health care, such \nas Medicare and Medicaid. And if they understand that, there may not be \nenough people on the board who understand the unique needs of urban \nhospitals that have a heavily uninsured population.\n  How is this 15-member board going to be better than the 500 Members \nwho serve people in Washington now, trying to look at specifics and \nthen be accountable? To whom is this board accountable? What decision \ndo they make that somebody can challenge in a meaningful way, in a way \nthat they would be really concerned about?\n  So it doesn't control costs as the President said it would. It \ndoesn't reduce insurance costs as the President said it would. I think \nit will wind up with maybe even more people uninsured as long as the \npenalty paid is less than the premiums paid, particularly for young \nworkers who are outside the system today. Under the President's plan, \nwe eliminate the advantage they have for being young and healthy by \nsaying: No, you can't really classify groups, whereas if a person gets \nlife insurance, that person will certainly pay more if they are 75 than \nif they are 27. They are just going to pay less. It is the same way \ntoday for health insurance as well because it is clear that the \nlikelihood of a person using that plan at 26 is different than it is at \n62. So all of these things just don't add up, and people are beginning \nto figure that they don't add up.\n  I thought Senator Grassley made a very good point about even when we \npassed the bill, we wouldn't know all of the costs of this bill until \nit actually goes into effect. I am very much in support of his view \nthat we never want to let this get so far down the road where we would \nknow how much it would really cost or all the rules and regulations we \nwould really have because it will head health care in a direction where \nwe might not be able to reverse course and get to a health care system \nthat is really focused on patients and health care providers rather \nthan government bureaucrats deciding what is the best health care for \neverybody. I want my doctor to decide. I want to be part of that \ndiscussion. I do not want some government bureaucrat deciding what \nprocedure is the only procedure that is acceptable for me.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is interesting--because I know the Senator goes \nhome, as I do, very often to talk to many of the small business owners \nin the State of Missouri, as I do in Wyoming, and as Senator Grassley \ndoes in Iowa--one of the promises the President made is, he said 4 \nmillion small businesses may be eligible for tax credits. Well, it \nturns out that the key word there by the President is ``may''--may be \neligible.\n  Even the fact that the White House has sent out postcards to all \nthese small business--the IRS spent over $1 million of taxpayers' money \nto send out millions of postcards promoting the tax credit--the \nTreasury Department's inspector general recently testified that ``the \nvolume of credit claims has been lower than expected''--as a matter of \nfact, only 7 percent of the 4 million firms the administration claimed.\n  Why? Well, because of the complexity and the whole way the system was \nset up, the President was able to talk big and deliver very small. That \nis why so many people are very unhappy with the claims in the health \ncare law because they know these promises have been broken.\n  With regard to Nancy Pelosi's famous quote--that first you have to \npass it before you get to find out what is in it--that is why I come to \nthe floor every week with a doctor's second opinion because it does \nseem just about every week we do learn some new unintended consequence, \nsomething new about the health care law and another reason why \nAmericans are unhappy with it, why it remains as unpopular, if not more \nunpopular, today as when it was passed, and why so many people believe \nthe Supreme Court should find this bill unconstitutional, for the \nreasons that do have Americans at home in an uproar, and very unhappy \nthat the government can come into their homes and mandate that they buy \na government-approved product and pay for it or pay a fine. Nothing \nlike this has happened before, and people are, frankly, offended.\n  We do not know what the Supreme Court is going to do, but I know what \nthis body ought to do. This body ought to vote to repeal and replace \nthis broken health care law and get a health care law in place which is \nwhat the American people wanted, which is, the care they need, from the \ndoctor they want, at a price they can afford.\n  We have not seen that yet. But that is why we are here on the second \nanniversary of the President's health care law, to continue to point \nout the flaws of this legislation. Quite interestingly, when you take a \nlook at some of the national poll numbers, for people who have talked \nto a health care provider--whether that be a nurse, a doctor, a \nphysician's assistant, a physical therapist, a nurse practitioner, no \nmatter who--they are even less supportive of it than the general \npublic.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this Friday the Nation observes an \nanniversary that most Americans would prefer to see removed from its \ncalendar. I am talking about the second anniversary of the passage of \nthe President's health care law. Rather than celebrate this day, it is \none that citizens and taxpayers have come to rue and regret. The \nprocess by which Obamacare became law was an affront to republican \nprinciples of democratic self-government. The substance of this law is \nan historic threat to the liberties our Constitution was designed to \nsecure.\n  A decent respect for the opinions of the American people cautioned \nagainst passing this law on a purely partisan basis. Yet in spite of \nthe clear opposition of the American people to this massive expansion \nof government power, and to its historic spending and tax increases, \nthe President and his congressional allies were determined to jam this \nbill through the Congress.\n  The architects of this strategy, if not the party loyalists who \ncarried it out against the wishes of their constituents, sleep easy at \nnight having done so, because they knew that this was a once-in-a-\ngeneration opportunity, the crowning achievement of the liberal \nbureaucratic state. A takeover of the Nation's health care sector and \nits top-down regulation by Washington had eluded Democrats for over 70 \nyears.\n  The economic downturn of 2008 changed that. With the election of \nPresident Obama and significant majorities in the Congress, the left \nwas not going to, in the words of the President's Chief of Staff, ``let \na crisis go to waste.'' What this strategy meant in practice was that \nDemocrats would advance a radical liberal agenda whether the American \npeople supported it or not. That is the anniversary we are observing \nthis week, and it is a dark spot on our Nation's history, in my \nopinion.\n  The Obamacare episode showed a fundamental disrespect for the \nopinions and constitutional common sense of the American people. Faced \nwith growing unrest and real concerns about the impact of this law on \nfamilies, the economy, and access to health care, the law's proponents \nassumed that the American people were too dumb to get it; that once \nObamacare became law, the American people would come to love it, as \nwell as the benefactors who gave it to them. That is what they thought. \nAs Speaker Pelosi explained: We have to pass the bill so you can find \nout what is in it.\n  The great liberal conceit was on full display in the process that led \nto this bill becoming law. We know better than you, they said. We can \nplan one-sixth of the American economy, and you will eventually come to \nlike it.\n  Well, as we all know, the American people had something else in mind. \nThey reminded Congress and the President that in this country the \npeople are sovereign. They stood up as free men and women rejecting \nObamacare before it became law and refused to embrace it afterwards. \nAnd as their understanding of the law has deepened, they have remained \nconstant in their commitment to full repeal. According to a Rasmussen \npoll this week, over half of Americans support the full repeal of \nObamacare.\n  Next week, the Supreme Court will hear oral argument on the \nconstitutionality of this misguided law. In arriving at their decision \nlater this year, they will consider Obamacare through the prism of past \nprecedents and the\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nConstitution's original historic meaning. But the Justices of the \nSupreme Court are not the only ones evaluating the constitutionality of \nthis law. The American people and citizens of this Nation have their \nown obligation to consider whether this law comports with our \nConstitution and principles of limited government, and on that the \nverdict is already in. According to a recent Gallup poll, 72 percent of \nAmerican adults, including 56 percent of self-professed Democrats, \nbelieve that the law's individual mandate is unconstitutional.\n  The average American who opposes this law on constitutional grounds \nmight not be a law professor or an appellate advocate, but those \ncitizens and taxpayers understand our Constitution was designed to \nguarantee liberty and that it did so, in part, by limiting the powers \nof the Federal Government and maintaining the sovereign powers of the \nStates.\n  They know the unconstitutionality of ObamaCare runs far deeper than \nthe onerous individual mandate. The law is, at its core, a violation of \nour most deeply held constitutional principles.\n  It undermines personal liberty and puts more power in the hands of \nthe Federal Government. In the interest of advancing what the left \nviews as a constitutional right to health care, they undermine actual \nconstitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.\n  The law's mandate for abortion-inducing drugs undermines sacred \nrights of personal conscience and religious liberty.\n  Its expansion of Medicaid fundamentally transforms the relationship \nof the States to the Federal Government, undercutting the ability of \nthose sovereign communities to make basic decisions about the welfare \nof their citizens by crowding out spending for police, infrastructure, \nand education.\n  The American people might not have submitted complex legal briefs in \nthe Supreme Court litigation, but their conclusions about ObamaCare \npossess a unique and powerful wisdom. The people of Utah and the rest \nof this country understand the very DNA of ObamaCare--a commitment to \nmore government control, the empowering of an already unaccountable \nadministrative state, and an assault on free markets--is \nunconstitutional.\n  This was not what President Obama promised the American people. The \nPresident couched this government takeover of the Nation's health care \nsector as a modest reform designed to reduce costs.\n  When he spoke before a joint session of Congress in September of 2009 \nto push for his plan, the President promised it would ``slow the growth \nof health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our \ngovernment.''\n  The President swung and missed on all three. According to the \nPresident's own Actuary at CMS, national health expenditures would \nincrease by $311 billion over the law's first 10 years. This comes as \nno surprise to the American people. The President's health care law \npromised all sorts of new free care. But we all know, contrary to the \nrepeated assertions of President Obama and his administration, nothing \nin life is free.\n  The bill will eventually come due for all this so-called ``free \ncare,'' and it is taxpayers who will pay that bill.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, ``Rising costs for \nhealth care will push Federal spending up considerably as a percentage \nof GDP.''\n  This is not what the President and his allies promised. We were \npromised lower costs. What we got were higher costs, more Federal \nspending on health care and, with it, more taxes and more debt.\n  When fully implemented, ObamaCare authorizes $2.6 trillion in new \nFederal spending over 10 years. It will increase premiums by $2,100 for \nfamilies forced by ObamaCare to purchase their own insurance. Its \nMedicaid expansions will impose $118 billion in new costs on the \nStates.\n  It will increase spending on prescription drugs, physician and \nclinical services, and hospital spending. It will increase the deficit \nby $701 billion over its first 10 years.\n  How does the President propose to pay for this? Here is how: He will \npay for it by selling more Treasurys to China. He will pay for it by \nincreasing taxes and penalties by over $500 billion, and American \nworkers will ultimately pay for it with 800,000 fewer jobs than would \nhave otherwise existed.\n  This is not the story the President or the Democrats in Congress \nresponsible for this law want the American people to hear. So they will \nattempt to spin their way out of it.\n  In a memo obtained by the press last week, the advocates of ObamaCare \nlaid out their strategy to sell the merits of this misguided law prior \nto oral arguments at the Supreme Court.\n  This week was designed to lay out all the great things provided by \nObamaCare. But, naturally, that memo mentions absolutely none of the \ncosts. It doesn't mention the cost of these benefits for Federal \ntaxpayers. It doesn't mention the costs for employers and workers. It \ndoesn't mention that the law could lead to as many as 20 million \nAmericans losing employer-sponsored health benefits by 2019. It doesn't \nmention the impact the $\\1/2\\ trillion in tax increases and penalties \nwill have on the economy, and it doesn't mention the harm this law does \nto our Constitution and its principles of republicanism, personal \nliberty, and limited government.\n  I wish I could say I was surprised, but I am not. ObamaCare is merely \nthe capstone to a generations-long liberal project that has attempted \nto convince citizens that they can have their cake and eat it too. They \ncan have all the benefits of an ever-expanding welfare state, and \nnobody--or only the very rich--would have to pay for it. ObamaCare \nexploded this myth. It is the culmination of generations of government \nexpansion, and it shows once and for all that we are all going to be \npaying for the liberal welfare state.\n  Taxing Warren Buffet is not going to cut it. All American families \nwill pay for this $2.6 trillion spending law one way or the other. \nAfter centralizing control of the Nation's health care system in \nWashington, DC, and putting health care decisions into the hands of \ngovernment bureaucrats, we will all pay for it through higher taxes, \nless opportunity, and diminished access to care.\n  Our children are going to have to pay for it, as a nation conceived \nin liberty is increasingly burdened by an unsustainable national \nindebtedness; that is, unless the American people get the final word on \nthis. They certainly should.\n  I believe in the American people. I know what my fellow Utahans think \nabout the President's health care law. No less than legislators or \nJustices, they take the Constitution seriously. They know this law is \nunconstitutional. They know what it does to free markets and to free \nmen and women. They know that if this law is constitutional, then there \nare effectively no limits on what the Federal Government can do. They \nknow this law has to go. I look forward to showing it the door.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I enjoyed the preceding \npresentation by the Senators dealing with issues surrounding health \ncare. I think it is a very relevant discussion we need to all pay \nattention to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1884\n\n  I want to talk on two issues today. I will start first with the \ncrowdfunding amendment that has been offered by Senators Bennet, \nMerkley, and me--something we have been working on in a truly \nbipartisan manner, as it should be done here, and as I do many of my \nactions.\n  For those of you who may be listening either up in the gallery or on \ntelevision, crowdfunding is an opportunity for individuals to invest \nmoney upwards of $1,000, upwards of $1 million total--so $1,000 per \nperson, totaling $1 million--not dealing with a lot of the traditional \nSEC filings that are in place and a lot of the other problems in which \nonly very wealthy people in years past have been able to participate in \nthese types of offerings.\n  For example, right now, if I had a good idea, and I wanted some of my \nfriends to invest in it, and then we go and start marketing, we could \nnot do that. That is illegal. One of the President's objectives in his \njobs speech was to talk about these new opportunities, and crowdfunding \nis one of them. He\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nsupports it. The House has done a similar crowdfunding bill. We are \nactually taking this crowdfunding opportunity and putting a little bit \nmore safeguard in it.\n  I think our bill is different--well, I know our bill is different \nthan the House bill in that the House bill does not require that you \nactually are a legal business or even some kind of incorporated legal \nforum before you try to issue stock. That bothers me somewhat in that \nyou could have somebody in their living room taking people's money and \nissuing stock with no check and balance, and I think that is important.\n  It also does not require that you offer securities through an \nintermediary. You could put up your own Twitter site: Buy shares is my \ngreat idea. Come on and buy shares.\n  All the experts agree that we would need to require an intermediary, \nsay, like an eBay, where the crowd can help identify the good and bad \nplayers, the way that eBay uses identified bad sellers on their site.\n  But also, as I said, it allows investments to take place that cannot \nbe done right now, and allows those entities, those groups, to take \nthat money and either use it as the investment seed money to create \nthose new ideas and new jobs--as we know, startup businesses are the \nentities that are actually looking to create jobs at this point--and/or \nuse that money as seed money to go to a more traditional lender and \nsay: Hey, we have a great idea and we also have some money to back it \nup, and we would ask you to sign on with us.\n  I am hopeful the amendment comes up. I understand it is. I am looking \nforward to having that very important vote. I would appreciate, \nobviously, the Presiding Officer and everyone else giving strong \nconsideration to that.\n\n\n           Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to shift gears for a minute and talk about the \nViolence Against Women Act. As we know--you may not know--Jessica \nPripstein of Easthampton, Lisa Stilkey of Douglas, Belinda Torres of \nWorcester, Kristin Broderick of Haverill, Patricia Frois of Marshfield, \nEdinalva Viera of Brighton, Milka Rivera of Lawrence, Nazish Noorani of \nEast Boston, Casey Taylor of Winthrop, Alessa Castellon of Roslindale, \nLauren Astley of Wayland, Michael Trusty of Edgartown, Janice Santos of \nWorcester, Beth Spartichino of Easton, Son Tran of Lowell, Jettie \nLincoln of Plymouth, David Walton of Tauton, Elaine McCall of \nWakefield, Jennifer Freudenthal of Webster, Brian Bergeron of Malden, \nLancelot Reid of Dorchester, Joel Echols of Springfield, Maria Avelina \nPalaguachi-Cela of Brockton, Troy Burston of Medford, Joseph Scott of \nWorcester, and Aderito Cardoso of Brockton--are constituents of mine \nwho have been killed by their husbands, wives, partners, girlfriends, \nor boyfriends in domestic violence incidents in 2011 and 2012 alone, \nand it is only March of this year.\n  It is unacceptable. The loss of those lives is tragic. But in \naddition to the people who have lost their lives, the lives of the \nvictims' children, families, and friends have been destroyed. I know \nbecause I was a victim of domestic violence. As a child, I watched as \nmy mother was beaten by abusive stepfathers. I did what I could to \nprotect my mom and my sister, but as a young boy there was only so much \nI could do.\n  I remember vividly being a 6-year-old boy going to protect my mom and \ngetting beaten on until the police came. It is something that still \nlives with me, and I try to use that experience and knowledge to help \nin many different ways.\n  When I was growing up, quite frankly, there were not the resources \nthat are available to victims today. I wish my mother had known back \nthen that she was not alone. I wish she could have used one of the \nfantastic support providers that now exist in Massachusetts today. \nSince being elected to the Senate, I have been moved by the \norganizations in my State that are stepping to the plate--and \ncontinuously step to the plate each and every day--to provide support \nto victims of domestic violence.\n  Quite frankly, as a government, we have made tremendous progress in \nhelping victims get their lives back in order--not only the victims \nthemselves but the family members of those victims.\n  The Violence Against Women Act was first signed into law in 1994, as \nyou know, and made a bold statement that we would redouble our efforts \nto support law enforcement efforts to crack down on offenders and \nassist those working in our communities to provide assistance to \nvictims seeking a new life away from the violence they had been \nsubjected to.\n  In each reauthorization we have improved upon the previous bill and \nmade it stronger and made stronger commitments to those who have been \nabused. Now is not the time--let me repeat: now is not the time--to \ntake our foot off the gas and avoid dealing with this problem.\n  The landmark Violence Against Women Act must be reauthorized this \nyear. I am incredibly proud to have cosponsored this reauthorization \nwhen it first came to my attention. I believe it makes critical \ncommitments against this horrific problem.\n\n  Historically, VAWA has been a bipartisan effort, where both parties \nlocked arms in support of our enforcement and victims against \nperpetrators of domestic violence. It was a glimmer of hope for an \notherwise contentious and overly partisan atmosphere. I have to tell \nyou--this is not the first time I have said this--but there is no \nDemocratic bill that is going to pass, there is no Republican bill that \nis going to pass, for those listening. It needs to be a bipartisan, \nbicameral bill that the President will sign.\n  I have been deeply troubled to see that this year's reauthorization \nhas become, once again, partisan. There is no reason for it. There is \nno excuse for it. We just did the Hire a Hero veterans bill, we did the \n3-percent withholding, we are doing the insider trading, we did the \nhighway bill. There is no reason we cannot do the VAWA bill on a \ncompletely nonpartisan basis.\n  I am on the floor today to call on my colleagues to band together and \npass this reauthorization and send a very strong signal to Americans \nthat the Senate--yes, the Senate--stands united in recognizing victims \nfrom across the country, to give them the help they need and, \nobviously, deserve.\n  In Massachusetts, VAWA is supported by law enforcement and many \nservice providers that are on the front lines in assisting domestic \nviolence victims. I know. Previously, as an attorney, I dealt with \nfamily law matters. I know of the yeoman's work these entities do.\n  On Friday, I will be visiting Voices Against Violence in Framingham, \nMA. They receive VAWA funding to support direct services to victims and \nsurvivors of sexual assault and ensure that a trained rape crisis \ncounselor is available after hours and on weekends.\n  The YMCA in central Massachusetts in Worcester uses those funds for a \nproactive program that has service providers working very closely with \nlaw enforcement to provide information to domestic violence victims and \nadvocate on their behalf--at a time when, quite frankly, these folks \nneed advocates.\n  Because of VAWA, REACH Beyond Abuse in Waltham has supported many \ncutting-edge prevention efforts with teens and the placement of \nadvocates in police departments as a symbiotic, a give-and-take \nrelationship in those departments.\n  The Jeanne Geiger Crisis Center in Newburyport, where my dad lives, \nused VAWA funds to establish a high-risk homicide prevention project \nand was recently recognized by the White House for their work.\n  I could go on and on and on about the tremendous involvement and \ngreat organizations not only in my State but throughout this country \nthat are making a difference in the lives of victims. We need to stand \nas a body and not get into party rhetoric, and declare to women across \nAmerica that they are not alone in this fight. We need to do everything \nin our power to help the millions of women like my mom who were once in \nthis situation and are now survivors. And we need to help them become \nsurvivors, not victims. So I call upon my colleagues to join me in \nsending a very strong bipartisan vote and get this done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Yes. I am sorry. I did not see the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for his remarks in support of the Violence Against Women \nAct. I believe the bill will be before us shortly. We will count on \nSenator Brown's vote. So we look forward to that.\n\n\n                  TRIBUTES TO SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \npublic servant, a social worker, and a tenacious advocate for \nvulnerable Americans. I rise today to honor a trailblazer and a mentor \nfor me and countless others. I rise today to honor an outstanding U.S. \nSenator from Maryland and the dean of the Senate women, my friend \nBarbara Mikulski.\n  I am privileged to have represented California in this body for \nalmost 20 years. When I first ran for the Senate, back in 1992, I \nreceived a call from Barbara Mikulski, personally urging me on and \nreaching out to provide encouragement.\n  I have relied on her advice, her friendship, and the Mikulski brand \nof candor ever since. As a matter of fact, one of my fondest evenings \nwas a three-onion martini right down the street.\n  It is hard to believe, but when Senator Mikulski took office in 1987, \nthere was only one other woman in this body, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, \nlater Nancy Kassebaum Baker, the great Republican Senator from Kansas. \nIncreasing the number of women in the Senate has been painfully slow. \nIn 1991, the ranks of women in this body rose to three, then later to \nseven after the 1992 election. Today we have 17 women in this body and \n76 in the House. As Senator Mikulski reflected in the Washington Post \nlast year:\n\n       Women were so rare even holding statewide political office \n     [back then] . . . I was greeted with a lot of skepticism from \n     my male colleagues. Was I going to go the celebrity route or \n     the Senate route? I had to work very hard.\n\n  And she has. Barbara has worked very hard to become an outstanding \nlegislator and a trailblazing public official. Let me list a few of her \nfirsts. She was the first female Democrat to serve in both Chambers of \nCongress--that in itself is impressive--the first female Democrat to be \nelected to the Senate without succeeding her husband or her father; the \nfirst woman to chair a Senate appropriations subcommittee; the first \nwoman to serve a quarter century in the Senate; and the first woman \nelevated to a Senate leadership position.\n  She is the only current Member of Congress in the National Women's \nHall of Fame. And she is not done yet. Just last week, Barb achieved \nanother historic first. According to the Senate Historical Office, she \nreached 12,858 days of service, becoming the longest serving female \nMember of Congress in our Nation's history.\n  Senator Mikulski was born and raised in Baltimore. Determined to make \na difference in her community--and you know that well, Mr. President--\nand guided by her Catholic belief and a belief in social justice, she \nbecame a social worker, helping at-risk children and educating seniors \nabout Medicare. She once said, ``I feel that I am my brother's keeper \nand my sister's keeper.'' Social work evolved into community activism \nwhen Barb successfully organized communities against a plan to build a \nhighway through Baltimore's Fells Point neighborhood.\n  Shortly thereafter, in 1971, she was elected to the Baltimore City \nCouncil where she served 5 years. That was about the time I was elected \nto the Board of Supervisors in 1970 in San Francisco. In 1976, she ran \nfor Congress and won, representing Maryland's 3rd District for a \ndecade. She was then elected to the Senate and has won reelection in \n1992, 1998, 2004 and 2010 by large majorities.\n  As I said, Barb is an accomplished legislator. She is also one of the \nvery best. She cares passionately about quality education and ensuring \nevery student has access to higher education. She is a fighter for stem \ncell research to cure our most tragic and debilitating diseases. She is \na tireless advocate for the National Institutes of Health. And she is a \nleader on women's health, writing law requiring Federal standards for \nmammograms, and a fearless proponent of breast and cervical cancer \nscreenings and treatment for uninsured women.\n  We serve together on the Intelligence Committee. She asks some of the \nmost prescient questions. I have seen her commitment to the FBI, to \nfighting terrorism, and also to cybersecurity where she headed a task \nforce for our committee that has resulted in the cybersecurity \nlegislation newly pending.\n  Finally, she has led the way to strengthen pay equity for women. The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act is the law of the land today \nbecause of Barbara Mikulski's effort. As Barb said when we passed the \nbill:\n\n       I believe that people should be judged solely by their \n     individual skills, competence, unique talent and nothing else \n     in the workplace. Once you get a job because of your skill \n     and talent, you better get equal pay for equal work.\n\n  Or, in a manner that best captures Barb's candor, she said, ``Women \nof America, square your shoulders, put on your lipstick, suit up, and \nlet's close that wage gap once and for all.'' To me, that is classic \nBarbara Mikulski.\n  Let me close with a story. Every so often at Barbara's leadership, \nthe Senate women get together for dinner. There is no agenda or staff, \njust Republican women, Democratic women, and a lot of lively \nconversation. We talk about our families, we talk about the workplace, \nwe talk about the world, and, of course, we even talk, to some extent, \nabout this place. Sometimes we enjoy Senator Mikulski's world-famous \ncrab cakes, the best you will ever taste, and second only to the \nDungeness crab of the west coast, I might add. If you have not, make \nsure you try the recipe on her Web site. We talk about our families and \nthe way we can work together. It is a throwback to the civility of the \nSenate. These dinners are when Barb really stands out as the dean of \nSenate women.\n  Women in this country have always had to fight for the most basic of \nrights. I think young women forget that it was not until 1920 that we \nwere able to vote in this country, and it was only because women fought \nfor it. Barb will be the first to say her milestones are symbols of how \nfar she has come. But she will also show us how much farther women have \nto go.\n  Today we take it for granted that a woman can be Secretary of State--\nwe have had two--or Speaker of the House--we have had one or a \ncandidate for President. Not quite yet. Oh, no, I take that back. We \nhave had one. And one day soon, a woman will sit in the Oval Office of \nthis great country. When she does, she will owe a great deal to Barbara \nMikulski.\n  But on this day, let the Congressional Record of this Senate reflect \nand forever record that Senator Barbara Mikulski is the longest serving \nwoman in the history of the United States Congress, and this country is \nforever better because of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I came here to talk on another matter, but \nI wish to take a few minutes to talk about my friend Barbara Mikulski. \nWe have served a long time together. When she came to this body, I \nthink I may have been chairman of what was then called the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, now the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee.\n  From the day she got on that committee, she made a difference in \nevery way, not just for women but for every single American in this \ncountry. I have a tremendous amount of profound respect for Senator \nMikulski and what she has been able to accomplish.\n  Let me mention one thing. Back in the early 1990s, she and I worked \ntogether on what was called the FDA Revitalization Act. That act was a \nvery important one, because we had the FDA spread out all over the \nGreater Washington, DC, area, probably 30, 35 different offices, some \nof which were in converted chicken coops. It was ridiculous to have \nthese top scientists in anything but a centralized location with top \ncomputerization and all of the other scientific instruments they need \nto do this work for the American people. I have to say that Barbara \nMikulski played a pivotal role in helping to\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\ndevelop that tremendous facility. I want you to know that I do not \nthink it would have been developed without her effort and her dogged \nwork to make sure that we now have a centralized--and it still needs \nimprovement but centralized FDA campus that literally is saving the \nlives of millions of people and making the lives of millions of people \nbetter.\n  I could go on and on. But I have a lot of respect for my \ndistinguished colleague from Maryland. I would feel badly if I did not \nget up and tell people how much I do respect her. She believes in what \nshe does. She loves this body, most of the time, I think. And she cares \nfor her follow Senators. We care for her. I want her to know that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in honoring \nour friend and colleague who is often regarded as the dean of the women \nin the Senate, Barbara Mikulski.\n  Earlier this week Senator Mikulski added to her already long list of \naccomplishments the distinction of being the longest serving female \nMember of Congress in the history of the United States of America.\n  Senator Mikulski's life is a story of the American dream. Raised in a \nworking-class immigrant family in the east Baltimore neighborhood of \nHighlandtown, Senator Mikulski learned at a young age about the \nstruggles of working families and ethnic Americans and the value of \npaying it forward.\n  She helped at her father's grocery store, which opened early in the \nmorning so that steelworkers could buy lunch before their morning \nshift. She delivered food to seniors and families when parts of her \nneighborhood were set on fire after the assassination of Dr. Martin \nLuther King. At one point she even rode on the top of a tank to deliver \nthe groceries.\n  Senator Mikulski's roots helped shape her role today as a mentor, \nfighter, and true public servant. She worked as a social worker for \nCatholic Charities, helping at-risk children and counseling seniors on \nMedicare. She had her start in politics as a community organizer and \nsocial worker.\n  In 1970--one side of Barbara Mikulski her colleagues have certainly \nseen is her dogged determination--she organized Marylanders to stop a \n16-lane highway project that would have threatened Fells Point and \nanother neighborhood in Baltimore. She got the job done. Many people \nsay that work helped to save Fells Point and the Inner Harbor, two of \nthe showcase areas in the great city of Baltimore. She gave a speech at \nCatholic University to a Catholic conference on the ethnic American. It \ncaught the attention not only of people in Baltimore but far beyond its \nreach as she talked about her family story and the story of millions \njust like her.\n  One year later, she ran for and won a seat on the Baltimore City \nCouncil--the first step in her now 41-year career in public service.\n  Over the course of the Senate's 223-year history, there have only \nbeen 38 female Members; the first, Rebecca Latimer Felton, of Georgia, \nwas appointed for political reasons to fill a vacancy, and she served \nonly a single day in 1922.\n  Senator Mikulski has so many firsts in her story of public service. \nShe was the first woman elected to the Senate in her own right--the \nfirst--and not because of a husband or father or someone who served \nbefore her in higher office. She was the first woman Democrat to serve \nin both Chambers of Congress--the first. Last year, she was inducted \ninto the National Women's Hall of Fame for her trailblazing political \ncareer, including, with this recognition today, becoming the longest \nserving woman Senator in the history of our Nation.\n  Given her years of experience, it is no wonder other Members of \nCongress have turned to her for guidance, men and women alike.\n  I can recall so many meetings of our Democratic caucus when, after a \nlong debate involving many people saying many things, Barbara Mikulski \nwould stand and, in a few terse words, get it right. At the end of the \nday people would say: That is what we ought to do. She has this insight \nbased on her life experience and her ability to try to peel through the \nlayers of the political onion and get to the heart of the issue.\n  Following the election of a number of esteemed women into the Senate, \na lot of reporters deemed 1992 as ``The Year of the Woman.'' Senator \nMikulski's response was so typical and so right. This is what she said:\n\n       Calling 1992 the ``year of the woman'' makes it sound like \n     the ``year of the caribou,'' or the ``year of asparagus.'' We \n     are not a fad, a fancy, or a year.\n\n  That was typical Barbara. Senator Mikulski rises above and beyond all \nthat. From her first days in the Senate in 1987, she has fought an \nuphill battle to address the most important issues of national \nimportance.\n  First and foremost for her is her family, next is her great State of \nMaryland. She is a fearless advocate, and I know the Presiding Officer \nknows that better than most as her colleague from that great State.\n  She has supported educational initiatives, veterans causes, \ninterstate commerce, access to health care and women's health and fair \npay.\n  The Chair knows the answer to this question, but some of those \nlistening to the debate might not. What was the first bill that the \nnewly elected President Barack Obama signed in the White House with a \npublic ceremony? It was a bill Barbara Mikulski pushed hard for, the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, so women going to work all \nover the United States--not just in the Senate--would get a fair shake \nwhen it comes to the compensation for the jobs they did. It was \nPresident Obama's first bill. When he signed it, the very first pen he \nhanded over to Senator Barbara Mikulski. I was there and I saw it.\n  Championed by Senator Mikulski, the long-awaited and much needed bill \nclarifies time limits for workers to file unemployment discrimination \nlawsuits, making it easier for people to get the pay they deserve \nregardless of race, age or gender.\n  I wish to start here--but I don't know where I would end--to talk \nabout the important issues she has worked for. Let me talk about health \ncare for a minute. When we set out to pass this historic affordable \nhealth care act, Barbara was assigned the job to make sure it connected \nwith the families and workers across America in a very real way, to \nmake sure that at the end of the day we weren't talking to ourselves or \nengaged in political gibberish but passing a law that could literally \nchange a life for the better. She led that effort and made invaluable \ncontributions to the substance of that bill.\n  We knew those provisions would be important and that they would work \nbecause we knew where Barbara Mikulski came from and we knew where her \npolitical heart resides. While it is a milestone to celebrate Senator \nMikulski's distinction as the longest serving woman in the Congress, \nthere is a much greater cause for celebration; Senator Mikulski's \ndecades of service to this Nation is an admirable feat for any man or \nwoman.\n  I extend my congratulations to my colleague and friend Senator \nMikulski for this milestone. Thank you for what you have done for the \nSenate, for the State of Maryland, and for our great Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the hour of 2:30 having arrived, it is my \nhonor and my pleasure to rise to honor a patriot, a pioneer, and now \nthe longest serving woman in the Congress of the United States ever, \nand that is the senior Senator from Maryland Barbara Mikulski.\n  Barbara and I served together in the House, and we came to the Senate \ntogether in 1986. I remember that day so well, when we had our first \nappearance in the Senate as new Senators. It was quite a moving event \nfor me. But one of the events I remember about that day is the \npresentation of Senator Mikulski.\n  We all said a word or two, and everything we said will be long \nforgotten. But what Barbara Mikulski said, in the way she has of saying \nthings, will not be forgotten.\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\n  Here is this woman who is not even as tall as my wife, who is 5 feet \ntall, but she said, ``I slam-dunked Linda Chavez,'' her opponent. That \nsaid it all.\n  That was the beginning of my working closely with this good woman. \nShe has been a friend, an inspiration to me in so many different ways \nin the time we have served together. When we got on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, she was here, and I was here. She was always \nahead of me in seniority because of her longer service in the House. On \nthe Appropriations Committee, for more than two decades, I was here, \nshe was here. She was always one ahead of me.\n  Barbara was the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her \nown right. Last year, she surpassed the legendary Margaret Chase Smith \nof Maine as the longest serving woman in the history of the Senate. On \nSaturday, she officially surpassed Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers of \nMassachusetts, who, by the way, served in the House from 1925 to 1960 \nas the longest serving woman in the history of the Congress.\n  Senator Mikulski's service--and the service of many female Members of \nCongress--has paved the way for girls of today to know they can become \nSenators, they can become professional basketball players, and they can \nbe engineers and doctors. The sky is the place they need to go, and \nthat is where they believe they can go because of the work that has \nbeen done by Barbara Mikulski.\n  When I came to the Senate with her, she was the only woman who served \nin the Senate as a Democrat. There was one other Republican at the \ntime. Now, since then, Mr. President, I have watched very closely on \nthis side of the aisle. Now we have 12 Democrats, and if the elections \nturn out the way I hope they do--and I am cautiously optimistic they \nwill--we will have 17 women who are Democrats in the Senate.\n  She has been truly a trailblazer. We recognize Barbara's achievements \ntoday and her outstanding record as a tireless advocate for the State \nof Maryland. She grew up in the Highlandtown neighborhood of east \nBaltimore. She learned the value of hard work by working in and \nwatching her dad, especially, open that family grocery store and work \nfrom early in the morning until night. He sold lunch to steelworkers \nand other people who came by that little grocery store.\n  In high school she was educated by the nuns at the Institute of Notre \nDame. She credits the nuns with instilling in her faith and a thirst \nfor justice. She went on to study at Mount Saint Agnes College, which \nis now part of Loyola College in Maryland. She earned her master's \ndegree in social work from the University of Maryland.\n  Barbara was a social worker and has always been proud of the fact \nthat she has been a social worker. She was employed by Catholic \nCharities and the City of Baltimore's Department of Social Services. I \ncan imagine what a dynamo she was--and she still is. There is no work \nharder than being a social worker. The problems one sees and has to \ndeal with are extremely difficult.\n  During her years as a social worker, she was a powerful voice for \nchildren and seniors in need of an advocate. Barbara Mikulski then and \nnow is an advocate. It was there the spark for service and activism was \nlit, but it was a plan to build a 16-lane highway that fanned the \nflames that had been lit by her activism.\n  The highway would have gutted historic Fells Point, a neighborhood \nthat she believed should have been protected. It would have uprooted \nhomeowners in a majority African-American neighborhood. She organized \nthe residents of Fells Point and Baltimore's Inner Harbor and stopped \nthe construction of that highway.\n  That is a testament to the power of democracy that she believes in \nwith all her soul. Looking back on that triumph, Senator Mikulski said:\n\n       I got into politics fighting a highway. In other countries, \n     they take dissidents and put them in jail. In the United \n     States of America, because of the First Amendment, they put \n     you in the United States Senate. God bless America.\n\n  She has always been an advocate for the disenfranchised and \ndisadvantaged in this country, but she has also been an advocate for \ndissidents in other countries, of whom she has spoken so eloquently on \nso many occasions. Her family was Polish. She has heard all the Polish \njokes, and she has withstood a little of the ``barbs'' when \nneighborhoods were different than they are now. But she took special \npleasure and was so proud of her heritage.\n  Barbara took a special interest in the plight of Polish people \noppressed under communism. We know in 1980 the people of Poland started \na fledgling little group called Solidarity--a movement to engage in \nnonviolent resistance against communism and in support of social \nchange.\n  Senator Mikulski and I had the wonderful pleasure of traveling under \nthe guidance of a trip led by John Glenn--a world famous man then and \nnow. It was a wonderful trip for a couple of new Senators. The Iron \nCurtain was down, and it was down hard, but we went to Poland on a \ncodel. I can remember we had the opportunity to meet with members of \nthe Solidarity movement. We met in secret with them, in a secret \nlocation, and Senator Glenn talked, Senator Stevens, then a senior \nmember of the Senate at the time spoke, and I said I would like to hear \nfrom Senator Mikulski.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not articulate enough to explain the \npresentation she made extemporaneously, but this powerful woman stood \nand talked about her heritage and her religion and what that meant to \nthe people of America and what it should mean to the people of Poland. \nIt was truly--and I have told her this personally over the years on \nseveral occasions to remind her--one of the most heart-warming, \nstirring speeches I have ever been present to listen to. She spoke to \nthe people assembled there--there weren't many of them--as a fellow \nactivist. She spoke as an American of Polish descent and a fellow \nCatholic. She spoke as one of them. When that presentation was \ncompleted, everyone knew she was one of them.\n\n  It took almost a decade for the Solidarity movement to strike victory \nin Poland, and I know Senator Mikulski's speech was not the reason, but \nI guarantee you it was one of the reasons they had the audacity and the \ncourage to proceed as they did.\n  Remember, Poland was an interesting country. It was the only country \nbehind the Iron Curtain where the Communists could not destroy their \neducational system, and that was because of the strength of the \nCatholic Church in Poland at that time. Solidarity's victory in Poland \ninspired a stream of peaceful anti-Communist revolutions that \neventually caused the fall of communism entirely all over Eastern \nEurope.\n  Barbara's Polish ancestry and the Polish community in which she grew \nup in Baltimore were very important to her, but I never knew it until \nthat moment in Warsaw with those few members of Solidarity who were \nassembled to honor us.\n  Her great-grandmother had come here from Poland with just a few \npennies in her pocket--literally--but she had a dream of a better life \nfor her and her family. This is what Barbara Mikulski said about her \ngreat-grandmother.\n\n       She didn't even have the right to vote, and in this great \n     country of ours, in three generations, I joined the United \n     States Senate.\n\n  It was a remarkable feat for her. But, more importantly, it was a \nconfirmation of the American dream. For Barbara, what began as \ncommunity activism, a fight against a highway, grew into a successful \ncareer in public service.\n  I just want to add a side note, Mr. President, and talk about \nsomething very personal to me. When Senator David Pryor got sick, he \nwas the Democratic conference secretary in the Senate. That opened up a \nspot in the Senate leadership. That was something I thought would be \ninteresting to me. It was known who was interested in filling that \nspot, and I knew Barbara was interested.\n  I went to Barbara and said: Barbara, if you want it, it is yours. Two \nyears later, Wendell Ford decided he was going to retire. He was the \nwhip. I can still remember that morning walking from the Hart Building \nover to the Russell Building, in that long walkway there, and I saw \nBarbara Mikulski. I didn't say a word to her.\n  She said: I want to talk to you. She said: You supported me when I \nwanted to be the conference secretary. You\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\nwant to be the whip, I am supporting you. But for Barbara Mikulski, I \nwould not have had that leadership position. Once the Democratic caucus \nknew Barbara Mikulski supported me, it was all over. I won. And I won \nbecause she came to me, as she did that morning.\n  So, Mr. President, my respect, admiration, and love for this woman is \ndifficult for me to describe, but it is there. Barbara Mikulski ran for \nCongress and won after serving on the city council of Baltimore for 5 \nyears. She represented Maryland's Third District for 10 years before \nwinning the seat in the Senate she now holds.\n  Again, I appreciate all she has done for me--so many different things \nshe has done for me. As a very able member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and somebody who loves this institution, I am in awe of the \nlegislative record of this amazing woman.\n  She has been a dedicated representative not only for the State of \nMaryland but the State of Nevada. One thing she did for me--and there \nhave been a lot of them--when we were new Senators and she was on one \nof the subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee concerning \nveterans benefits and affairs, as a favor to me she traveled to Reno, \nNV, to look at an old veterans hospital. She went through it and said: \nThis is not the way a veterans hospital should be, and I, Barbara \nMikulski, am going to change it. And she did.\n  Through the appropriations process we renovated and improved that \nhospital so it was one of the better hospitals at the time. So I am \ngrateful for this good woman, an advocate for parity for women on \neverything from salary to health care access. But for Barbara Mikulski \nthe National Institutes of Health would not have a center for women. \nShe got a little upset when she learned they had done a study of the \neffect of aspirin on people's hearts and she realized they had tested \n10,000 people and they were all men.\n  I had a situation that arose in Nevada about at the same time where \nthree women came to me who had something called interstitial cystitis, \na devastating, debilitating, painful disease that is described as \nrunning slivers of glass up and down your bladder. It was said to be a \npsychosomatic disease. These women had nowhere to go. I talked to \nBarbara Mikulski about this, and now 40 percent of these women have \nmedicine that takes away their symptoms totally.\n  I could go on here a long time, as everyone can see. But I do it \nbecause I congratulate Barbara on this milestone, which is so important \nto me and the Senate, and to tell her how much Nevada appreciates her. \nIt is not just for Maryland. She has done things for the entire \ncountry.\n  I wish her well for years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my honor to be here this \nafternoon to extend, on behalf of the Republican Conference of the U.S. \nSenate, our respect and admiration for the senior Senator from Maryland \non achieving this important milestone.\n  I am sure she would be the first to tell you that becoming the \nlongest serving woman in the Congress wasn't easy. A life in public \nservice is filled with many highs and lows. But Barbara is nothing if \nnot both tough and resilient.\n  Barbara would point to her upbringing as the daughter of a Baltimore \ngrocer, where she learned firsthand how hard work, honesty, and \ndetermination can lead to a successful and rewarding life. She later \nlearned, while fighting a freeway that would have destroyed several \nBaltimore communities, including her own, that if you fought hard \nenough for something you believed in, you too can make a difference. So \nif you knew Barbara back then, it wouldn't surprise you we are honoring \nher today.\n  Last year, when Senator Mikulski became the longest serving female \nSenator, she said she never saw herself as a historical figure. To me, \nBarbara said, history is powdered wigs and Jane Addams and Abigail \nAdams, both pioneers in their own right.\n  However, Barbara is a pioneer. She is only the second woman to be \nelected to both the Senate and the House. When first elected in 1986, \nshe was only the 16th woman to serve. Today, in Congress, there are 76 \nwomen in the House and 17 in the Senate. As dean of the Senate women, \nshe served as a role model and a mentor to many of these women. To put \nthis in perspective: When she first arrived in the Senate, there \nweren't any natural mentors to teach her the ways of the Senate. At the \ntime, even the Senate gym was off limits. A lot has changed since then, \nand Barbara had a lot to do with it.\n  Later, as more women were elected to the Senate, Barbara worked with \nthem to help them understand the Senate and how best to be an effective \nSenator, both here and back home. She wanted to give back.\n  Most importantly, regardless of party or issue, Barbara would push \nher female colleagues in the Senate to think differently, encouraging \nthem to think of themselves as a force--a force of good and, oft times, \na force for change. I know many are grateful not only for Barbara's \nleadership and courage but for her willingness to take the time to \nshare her experiences with them. I don't want to just be a first, \nBarbara once said. I want to be the first of many.\n  In 35 years, nearly 13,000 days as a Member of Congress, Barbara has \nbeen a champion of the space program, science research, welfare reform, \nmajor transportation, homeland security, and environmental issues in \nMaryland.\n  I wish to recognize Barbara not only for the tremendous \naccomplishment as the longest serving female in the history of the \nUnited States in Congress but also for all of her many accomplishments \nin the House and the Senate. As she once said herself, it is not how \nlong you serve, but it is how well you serve.\n  I wish to recognize Barbara for the pioneering model she has been to \nso many women in her distinguished career.\n  Congratulations, Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator McConnell and I have tentatively \nworked out something so we will have votes tomorrow, not today. That \nbeing the case, we are not under a crunch for time here today.\n  We have a number of Senators here who wish to say something regarding \nSenator Mikulski, and I wish to set up an orderly time to do that. So I \nask that Senator Mikulski be recognized. Following that, we have \nSenator Cardin to be recognized for 10 minutes; Senator Boxer, 10 \nminutes. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has been here since before \nanybody else. So following Senator Boxer, I ask that she be recognized. \nAnd Senator Gillibrand?\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. At the conclusion of my colleagues' remarks, 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I know there are a lot of us who want to \npay our tribute and respect to the senior Senator from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski. I want to make sure everybody has their opportunity. \nAre we operating under a consent order?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The consent order to this point has Senator \nCardin, followed by Senator Boxer, and then Senator Hutchison. Senator \nKerry is asking to be recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I believe he included my name for 10 minutes at the same \ntime. Madam President, I believe Senator Reid included my name in that \nlist for 10 minutes--I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Senator \nKerry will be added, and a complete list will be put together.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am glad we could get that straight.\n  Let me first thank all of our colleagues who are here to pay honor to \nthe senior Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski.\n  This is March Madness in basketball. Sweet 16 is starting. We are \nvery proud in Maryland of our Lady Terps. They are in the Sweet 16. But \nI want you to know that we are all getting our fantasy teams, and I \nwant Senator Mikulski on my fantasy basketball team because she is a \ntrue leader, she understands the importance of working together, and \nshe is a winner.\n  We are proud of her roots in Maryland. She is the great-granddaughter \nof Polish immigrants who owned a bakery. She began her public service \nin\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\nhigh school, where she helped deliver groceries to seniors who were \nlocked in their apartments and she helped the homebound seniors get the \nfood they needed. She went to the University of Maryland School of \nSocial Work because she wanted to be a social worker. She wanted to \nhelp other people. She knew that she was good at that and she could \nmake a difference in people's lives. She worked for Catholic Charities \nand dealt with children at risk and helping seniors with Medicare.\n  As you have heard from several of my colleagues already, she gained \nher reputation by taking on a highway that was scheduled to be built \nthat would have gone through Canton and Fells Point, disrupting a \nneighborhood in Baltimore. This was a 16-lane highway. It was \nconsidered to be a done deal; it was going to happen. The powers that \nbe said we are going to have a highway coming through downtown \nBaltimore. The powers to be did not know Barbara Mikulski. That highway \nnever happened. Senator Mikulski stopped that highway from being built.\n  She then went on to serve in the Baltimore City Council with great \ndistinction. Then in 1976 she was elected to the Congress for the Third \nCongressional District, a seat that was vacated by our esteemed \ncolleague Paul Sarbanes, who then came into the Senate, and Barbara \nMikulski followed in the great tradition of Senator Paul Sarbanes. In \n1986, when Senator ``Mac'' Mathias's seat became vacant, Senator \nBarbara Mikulski was elected to the Senate.\n  She has many firsts: The first female Democrat elected in her own \nright to serve the United States Senate. At the time she was elected to \nthe Senate, she was only one of two female Senators. Today, we have 17 \nfemale Senators in the Senate in large part because of Senator Barbara \nMikulski. I know the Presiding Officer was part of that expansion. You \nwill hear how Senator Mikulski was not only a role model and an \ninspiration but an incredible help to get more women elected to the \nSenate.\n  Last year we joined in this body to celebrate Senator Mikulski \nbecoming the longest serving woman in the history of the Senate, \nsurpassing Margaret Chase Smith from the State of Maine. Then on this \npast Saturday, on St. Patrick's Day, she became the longest serving \nwoman in the history of the Congress, replacing Edith Nourse Rogers \nfrom Massachusetts who served, as the majority leader pointed out, from \n1925 to 1960.\n  Marylanders understand longevity records. We are very proud of Cal \nRipken and the record he held in baseball. Senator Mikulski's, like Cal \nRipken's, legacy is what she has done in office to make a difference, \nnot the length of her service. She is a fierce and effective advocate \nfor so many causes. We have heard about her accomplishments in \neducation and health care, what she has done to advance sensible health \ncare to improve quality for the people of this country. That was her \nmission in the Affordable Care Act, to make sure that we had the \ndelivery systems in place that would deliver quality health care, and \nSenator Mikulski's leadership was critical in that regard.\n  She has been a leader in women's health care issues. I will never \nforget her reminder to all of us in the caucus: Don't forget women's \nhealth care issues when you bring that bill to the floor. And we \ndidn't. We put that in under Senator Mikulski's leadership. We talked \nabout breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings. Senator Mikulski \nhas been in the leadership on all those issues.\n  We in Maryland are proud to be where the National Institutes of \nHealth is headquartered. Its growth in large measure has been the \nresult of Senator Barbara Mikulski. We are proud of HOPE VI and \nhousing. Senator Mikulski has been in the forefront of that program, \nmaking it possible for many people in our community to have decent, \naffordable, and safe housing.\n  Senator Mikulski has been critically important to America's space \nprogram. I have been with her many times at Goddard and seen firsthand \nthe results of her advocacy and what it has meant. The Hubble space \ntelescope is another legacy of which Senator Mikulski can be rightly \nproud.\n  We in Maryland are also proud to house NSA, the National Security \nAgency, with its new mission with the cyber command located in \nMaryland. Senator Mikulski, as Senator Feinstein pointed out, has been \none of the real leaders on national security issues. We can't issue \npress releases on this. She is a member of the intelligence committee. \nShe works behind closed doors to keep us safe. But we all know that she \nis one of the key leaders in this Nation on national security issues.\n  We know about pay equity and the Lilly Ledbetter law, the first bill \nsigned by President Obama. It was Senator Mikulski's leadership that \ngot that bill to the President's desk, recognizing that we are still \nnot where we need to be on gender pay equity in America.\n  In our region, the Chesapeake Bay is center to our way of life and \nour economy. Senator Mikulski has been one of the real champions on \nwater quality and the Chesapeake Bay. She understands the respect for \nState and local government, that we have to work together as a team. I \nknow the Governor of Maryland, Governor O'Malley, would agree with me \nthat there is no better friend to the people of Maryland working with \nthe State than Senator Barbara Mikulski, getting the Federal Government \non the same page as the State and local governments to get things done \nfor the people of Maryland. That is true with what she has been able to \ndo for all of us working across the Nation.\n  I think the Baltimore Sun put it best when it said:\n\n       There is nobody more feisty, more willing to take on big \n     business, big government, or anyone when it is time to look \n     out for the interests of her constituents.\n\n  I think all of us would agree.\n  On a personal note, I thank Senator Mikulski for her friendship, I \nthank her for being my buddy and my adviser. Whether she is with \nPresidents or Kings or the patrons at Jimmy's Restaurant in Fells \nPoint, you get the same common sense, the same down-to-earth person--\nyou get Senator Barb. We are so proud of her.\n  Thank you, Senator Barb, for what you have done to make this Nation a \nbetter place to live. Thank you for being such a role model for young \npeople, especially young women, to get involved, to make a difference. \nThank you on behalf of my two granddaughters. Their future is much \nbrighter, their opportunities are much greater because of you, Senator \nBarb.\n  Congratulations. Your colleagues here want to express our love and \nrespect and admiration for your incredible service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what an incredible milestone Senator \nMikulski has reached. The words of her colleagues and the love they \nfeel for her are coming through. It is a wonderful thing for me to be \npart of this tribute. I don't know how many Senators would have the \nGovernor of their State here--Your Honor; and the former distinguished, \nincredible Senator Paul Sarbanes is here. That in itself, Senator \nMikulski, is testimony to your status among all of us.\n  So many of us are here in the Senate because Barbara Mikulski knocked \ndown the barriers one by one--the first Democratic woman ever elected \nto the Senate in her own right, the first woman to serve in both \nChambers, the longest serving woman in the Senate. Now she has made \nhistory once again. This past Saturday, after 12,858 distinguished days \nof service, no other woman in history has served in Congress longer \nthan Senator Mikulski--ever.\n  Some trailblazers make history, and they are content to stand proudly \nalone. ``Aren't I great? I did it.'' But not Senator Mikulski. She \nalways made clear that she was honored to be the first Democratic \nwoman, but she never wanted to be the last.\n  I will never forget her saying:\n\n       Some women stare out the window waiting for Prince \n     Charming. I stare out the window waiting for more women \n     Senators.\n\n  Well, 17 women, Republicans and Democrats, now serve in the Senate. I \nknow all of us have stories to tell about how Senator Mikulski helped \nus along the way, reaching out to mentor us, encourage us, lead us and \norganize our regular meetings filled with folders and pens and pencils, \nand organizing dinners. She and Senator Hutchison teamed up. We are so \nfortunate to have\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nthem working together. We get together now and then. Just in the heat \nof debate, we sit down and break bread together.\n  When I considered running for the Senate in 1992, Senator Mikulski \nwas the very first person I went to see, after my husband. I was \nconflicted. I had a good House seat. I was told I could hold it for as \nlong as I wanted, and I was not sure I should give it up for the \nSenate. I was considered a long shot. Senator Mikulski told me the \nfollowing: ``If you run, and I want you to run,'' she said, ``it will \nbe the toughest thing you will ever do and the best thing you will ever \ndo.'' And she was right.\n  Those of us of a certain age have probably seen the play or the movie \n``A Man For All Seasons.'' Today we celebrate a woman who is truly a \nSenator for all seasons. Some Members have passion, others have policy \nskills, some are brilliant negotiators, others great advocates for the \nleast among us, some are very serious students of history, and others \nare flatout hilarious. But I do not think our country has ever seen so \nmany incredible traits combined in one Senator. Whatever the issue, she \nwill address it. Whatever the problem, she will solve it. Whatever the \nwrong, she will fix it. Whatever the need, she will meet it. Whenever \nand wherever people without a voice need a champion with a keen mind, a \nsharp wit, and an unparalleled ability to speak from the heart and get \nthings done, Barbara Mikulski is there. A lot of us have been there \nwith her, and we have watched her and we love it and we marvel at her. \nAnd she does it with a sense of humor that is unparalleled. Anyone who \nhas ever listened to a speech or interview with Senator Mikulski has \nheard her utter these incredible quips, which I fondly called \n``Mikulski-isms.''\n  She has called us women into battle by asking us to go ``earring to \nearring'' with our opponents. She has challenged us to square our \nshoulders, suit up, put our lipstick on, and fight. She has said often \nthat women do not want to talk about gender but an agenda that helps \nAmerica's families.\n  When asked by Glamour Magazine how she felt about being named \nGlamour's Woman of the Year along with singer Madonna, Senator Mikulski \nreplied, ``She's got her assets, I have mine, and we both make the best \nof what God has given us.''\n  When asked about the different perspective women bring, she often \nsays, ``Women, we are not so much about macro issues but, rather, the \nmacaroni and cheese issues.'' Who else could say that better?\n  When discussing the challenges women face in politics with a group of \nfemale parliamentarians from around the world, this is what Barbara \nMikulski explained to them when they asked about what is it like and is \nit tough. She said:\n\n       Let's put it this way. In an election, if you are married, \n     you are neglecting him; if you are single, you couldn't get \n     him; if you are divorced, you couldn't keep him; and if you \n     are widowed, you killed him.\n\n  Then there was one of my favorite Mikulski moments. This is a \ntreasured moment. The women of the House still hadn't managed to \nintegrate the House gym, so we were relegated to this tiny room with \nold-fashioned, hooded hair dryers and hardly any room to move. But \nthere were very few of us, and we decided to make the most of it by \nhaving an aerobics class. Of course, coming from California, I \norganized it.\n  In came Geraldine Ferraro, Barbara Kennelly, Olympia Snowe, Barbara \nMikulski, and me. Our instructor started the class by asking us to \nstretch our arms way up, and we do.\n  Groans.\n  ``Put your hands on your hips.''\n  More groans.\n  Now she says, ``Bend from the waist.''\n  Suddenly, a voice bellows from the back of the room: ``If I had a \nwaist, I wouldn't be here.''\n  We all turned around to see Senator Mikulski, and we just cracked up. \nNeedless to say, that was the end of the aerobics class.\n  As funny as she can be, I can't think of anyone more resilient than \nBarbara Mikulski. I remember when she was mugged a few years back, one \nevening outside her home in Baltimore. A man pushed her to the ground \nand grabbed her purse. It was terrifying--for the mugger. He had no \nidea whom he was dealing with. At 4 feet 11, Senator Mikulski fought \nback and defended herself, just like she defends the people she \nrepresents, just like she defends women and families, just like she \ndefends equal pay and equal rights and civil rights and the health care \nof our citizens and the dignity of our seniors.\n  The truth is, the Senate used to be a very lonely place for women, \nbut Senator Mikulski changed that. From the day she was first sworn in, \nshe has carried the challenges, the hopes, and the dreams of millions \nof women with her. Barbara Mikulski has inspired generations of young \nwomen everywhere. She has given them the confidence that they can do \nit, too, because even as we celebrate this incredible milestone, I know \nSenator Mikulski's greatest hope is that a young girl growing up today \nwill be inspired to follow in her footsteps and one day to break her \nrecord. When that happens, it will be because Barbara Mikulski--our \ndean, our cherished leader, our Senator for all seasons--opened the \ndoors of the Senate wide enough to let the women of America walk in.\n  Thank you, Barbara Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand and add my \nexperiences with and admiration for Senator Barbara Mikulski. It is \nfitting that she is now the longest serving woman in the U.S. Congress.\n  When I first got here--I was elected in 1993--Barbara Mikulski, as \nthe dean of the women in the Senate, had a workshop the previous year \nfor the newly elected Democratic women Senators. When I arrived in \n1993, she expanded it to include all new women Senators, and her sort \nof opening comment was, civility starts with us.\n  Surely, she has carried through as the dean of the women of the \nSenate to ensure that all the new women get their bearings in the \nSenate, that they get the advice of the ones who have been here before. \nIt has been a huge help and really a fun opportunity for us to get to \nknow each other on a personal level as we have our women Senators' \ndinners.\n  From this came a book Senator Mikulski and I worked on together. The \ngenesis of the book--which became ``Nine and Counting,'' the nine women \nSenators who were here in the year 2000--came from a meeting called by \nSenator Mikulski to meet with the women of Northern Ireland, along with \nthe women of Ireland, when there was so much strife in that country. \nBarbara Mikulski called all of the women Senators together, our nine, \nto give encouragement and advice to the women who were trying to bring \nthe people of Ireland and Northern Ireland together so that there could \nbe a peaceful conclusion to the conflicts in Northern Ireland. From \nthat, as we were sharing our stories to show the women of Northern \nIreland how much they could do, from our experiences and our overcoming \nof obstacles, Barbara Mikulski and I sat down and said:\n\n       You know, I think we have a book here. If each of the nine \n     women Senators could write a chapter about our obstacles and \n     our beginnings in politics and help encourage other young \n     women and girls to aspire to and be able to succeed in \n     politics, then we ought to do it.\n\n  So we worked with a publisher. We got together and decided how we \nwould lay it out. We then decided as a group that we would give all of \nthe proceeds to the Girl Scouts of America because almost each of us \nhad been a Girl Scout at one point.\n  From so from that we put a book out, which is still being sold here \nin the Senate bookshop called ``Nine and Counting.'' It has given a lot \nof money to the Girl Scouts of America, to a leadership fund so that \nthey can continue to create girls who will be leaders in our \ncountry. But that started with the meeting Barbara put together for \nthose of us who could maybe give advice and help these women of \nNorthern Ireland.\n\n  When I came into the Senate in 1993, the first thing I wanted to do \nwas give equal treatment to women who work at home in their ability to \nsave for retirement as those who workout outside the home. I had the \nexperience, as a single working woman, of putting aside some money for \nmy IRA, and then when I married my husband Ray, I found out I could put \naside only $250 in an IRA. I said: Wait a minute. Why would someone \nworking inside the home--a woman\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\nwho is probably going to need retirement security more than any of us--\nnot be able to save for her own retirement security if she is a married \nwoman? So I authored the Homemaker IRA, and of course I wanted to have \na Democrat lead because we had a Democratic Congress. So I asked \nSenator Mikulski, and she said she would absolutely sign on--as she \nalways does--when it is something that is going to benefit women. So it \nbecame the Hutchison-Mikulski bill. I said to Barbara: I want this bill \nto pass. I don't care if my name is first. I would love to put your \nname first if you think that will help us get it through. She said: \nAbsolutely not. I would not take your name off that bill for anything \nbecause it was your idea. There are not very many people in this body \nwho would make that gesture and also put her weight behind the passage \nof the bill.\n  Of all the things I have done and that we have done together, \nBarbara, and of all the things that bill is going to affect the most \npeople in our country because now we have the Homemaker IRA that passed \nin 1996 that allows women--whether they are married and working at home \nor outside the home and single or married--they will be able to set \naside the same amount. Fortunately, that amount has grown, and so it is \nnot $2,000, but it can be $2,500 or $3,000 or $5,000, depending on \ntheir age. It is a wonderful thing we were able to do together.\n  Senator Mikulski and I also worked on behalf of Afghan women. When we \nstarted hearing the atrocities that were happening to the women of \nAfghanistan that were brought back by great women's organizations, such \nas Vital Voices, that told stories of not only unequal treatment of \nwomen in Afghanistan but inhumane treatment of women in Afghanistan. \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Clinton, and I introduced the Afghan Women \nand Children Relief Act, which was signed into law in December of 2001, \nwhich authorized funding for women in Afghanistan and Afghan refugee \nwomen. Political participation was supported for Afghan women, and we \nfollowed up with appropriations. I have to say our Republican \nPresident, President Bush, and our Democratic President, President \nObama, have always said American money will go into Afghanistan or Iraq \nor anywhere else to support equally the education of girls and boys; \nthat we would support women where they are not being treated as equals \non a human rights basis. So our Presidents have stood and, of course, \nour bipartisanship in Congress has done the right thing. Again, Senator \nMikulski is a leader in that area.\n  I cannot think of a stronger supporter in this Senate than Barbara \nMikulski in the area of NASA. I wish to say Senator Bill Nelson also \nhas been such a strong supporter, as well as Senator Lamar Alexander, \nbut Senator Mikulski and I now are the--she is the chairman and I am \nthe ranking Republican on the committee that is appropriating for NASA. \nWe are also fortunate to have Chairman Jay Rockefeller on the \nauthorizing and oversight committee for NASA. He, too, has been such a \nstrong leader in assuring that we continue America's preeminence in \nspace.\n  When the rubber hits the road in appropriations, Senator Mikulski has \nbeen there to say: We are going to have the science in the Hubble \ntelescope, which has given us so much information, as well the James \nWebb telescope. Now, of course, we have the human space flight issues \nand Barbara Mikulski has been right there saying, of course we are \ngoing to utilize the International Space Station, of course we are \ngoing to keep America's priorities in space because it has done so much \nfor our economy and our jobs and our technology and our health care \nimprovements, but it has also been a national security issue that \nBarbara Mikulski recognizes, first and foremost.\n  I cannot match a lot of the stories about Barbara Mikulski and her \npersonality, but I can tell you I took Barbara Mikulski to tour the \nJohnson Space Center in 2001, and we did a wonderful event at Baylor \nCollege of Medicine to talk about the research that is being done in \nthe biomedical sciences and on the space station. I thought, I am going \nto bring Barbara where we can show her a little bit of Texas.\n  We know Texas has a lot of personality and sometimes we are thought \nto have a little too much fun, but I will tell you what, Barbara is one \nof us. I brought her to the Houston rodeo. During the month of the \nHouston rodeo, everybody is ``Go Texas,'' and everybody dresses Texan, \nwhich means cowboy, and we have a great time. So I took Barbara \nMikulski into the steer auction, where just this past Saturday a steer \nwas sold for $460,000.\n  It is a grand champion steer, I might say. All of that money goes for \nscholarships for our young people to go to college.\n  Barbara came into the steer auction, and she looked around. There \nwere 2,000 people at the breakfast before all these people are going to \ngo and bid on the steers so we can fund scholarships. We were all \ndressed appropriately for Texas, and she reached over to my ear and she \nwhispered: Now, Kay, if we were here on Monday morning and we went to a \nchamber of commerce meeting, do these people look like this? I love to \ntell that story in Houston because it gets huge laughs. She won over \neverybody in Houston. They adored her from the beginning. She put on \nher cowboy hat, she rode in the grand entry on a buckboard and she \nbecame an honorary Texan in our hearts. So Barbara Mikulski knows how \nto win over others.\n  Let me mention one of my early experiences when I first came into the \nSenate. There was an effort to have health care reform. A program was \nput forward and this particular program had some things that were good, \nbut one of the things in it was that no health insurance coverage would \nbe required for women to have mammograms if they were 40 or below. I \nwill tell you something, the biggest eruption in the Senate was Barbara \nMikulski saying: Are you kidding? I will not let this go by me in the \nSenate. We are not going to say that a woman who is 40 or under is not \ngoing to be eligible for insurance coverage for a mammogram. It is not \ngoing to happen. Barbara Mikulski took the lead, and I am going to tell \nyou, the first thing that came out of that plan was that provision, and \nit will never be in a plan as long as Barbara Mikulski is in the \nSenate. So I am just going to tell anybody who is looking at health \ncare reform, take a little advice, don't mess with Barbara Mikulski \nbecause we are going to have mammograms.\n  Not only that, Barbara Mikulski came forward in the next month and \npassed unanimously in the Senate a mammogram standards bill. During \nthis process she learned that there were varying degrees of standards \nof mammography. She was going to make sure there were standards that \nevery clinic would have, that every piece of equipment would have and \nshe led the effort. It is law today.\n  I will end with yet another accomplishment; that is, single-sex \neducation in public schools. Senator Jack Danforth of Missouri started \nlooking at the issue and said: We need to allow our public schools to \noffer single-sex education--meaning girl schools and boy schools--\nbecause so many of us have seen that we have to adapt education for the \nneeds of each individual child to the best of our ability. We know \nthere are so many wonderful private schools for boys and girls, but we \ncould hardly have a public school that would be single sex in this \ncountry in the 1990s.\n\n  So Jack Danforth started the effort, and when he left the Senate, I \npicked it up. The more I looked at it, the more I saw the benefits to \nboys and to girls--particularly in the middle and high school grades--\nwere palpable. Senators Clinton, Barbara Mikulski, Susan Collins, the \nthree of them, had gone to an all-girls school. I had not, but they \nknew the benefits firsthand of single-sex education. Barbara was the \nproduct of single-sex education, having gone to a parochial school.\n  I first introduced the amendment in 1998, but it was in 2001--when \nthe four of us came together--that we actually got the bill passed \nthrough an amendment and that amendment then not only made public \nsingle-sex education an option and legal, it also made it eligible for \nFederal funding grants similar to all our public schools.\n  I wish to say it has been one of the joys of my time in the Senate to \nwork with Senator Barbara Mikulski, and I think this 4-foot-11-inch \nmighty-might has 10 times the impact. She has made an impact on \nCongress and an impact\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\non America because she is relentless, she is reasonable, she \nunderstands an issue, and she understands the importance of listening \nas well as talking. She is effective and she is respected. If there is \nanyone in the Senate who doesn't like her, respect her, and work well \nwith her, I have not met them. When one is the longest serving woman in \nthe Senate and Congress, they have worked with a lot of people. She is \nunanimously so well regarded, I have never met an enemy of hers.\n  I will close by saying the people who know her best love her most, \nand I cannot think of a finer thing to say about any person.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to say what a pleasure \nit is to welcome Senator Sarbanes back. I had the pleasure of sitting \nbeside him on the Foreign Relations Committee for 24 years. We miss his \njudgment and wisdom. We could use it these days.\n  I wish to welcome Governor O'Malley. I can't think of a time, when \npeople have stood up to laud a fellow Senator, that a Governor of their \nState is sitting and listening. All of the comments to this moment and \nbeyond will undoubtedly echo the remarkable affection that everybody \nhas for Barbara Mikulski and particularly the high regard in which she \nis held.\n\n  This is a very special celebration for the longest serving woman in \nthe history of the Congress, 12,862 days today and counting. In that \ntime--I recall when I first came here there was one woman serving, and \nthat was Senator Nancy Kassebaum--it is fair to say Barbara Mikulski \nhas been one of the pivotal forces in creating and assembling what I \nwould call a true ``band of sisters''--the women with whom she has \nserved in the Senate, each of whom makes extraordinary contributions to \nthis institution.\n  We have heard from other colleagues that her career is filled with \nmilestones, and it is. She is the first Democratic woman to serve in \nboth Houses of Congress. She is the first Democratic woman elected to \nSenate leadership. She is the first woman elected to statewide office \nin Maryland. These are just a few.\n  When Barbara came to the Senate in 1986 after 10 years in the House \nof Representatives, women were still, as she describes it--these are \nher words--``a bit of a novelty'' in the Senate. Indeed, then, it was \nonly Barbara and Senator Nancy Kassebaum. But now Barbara says:\n\n       We're not viewed as novelties. We're not viewed as \n     celebrities. We're viewed as U.S. Senators.\n\n  One of the reasons for that is that Barbara Mikulski has demonstrated \na seriousness of purpose, an ability to legislate, and an ability to \nmake friends and bring people together that has defined her role as the \ndean of the women in the Senate.\n  Some of her women colleagues in the Senate call her Dean. Others call \nher Coach Barb. But no matter what they call her, she has brought them \ntogether in this bipartisan sisterhood, as we just heard from the \nSenator from Texas. She holds workshops and serves as a mentor to all \nnewcomers and organizes regular monthly dinners. They don't always \nagree on everything, but the dinners are what some of them have called \na ``zone of civility,'' which is something the Senate could use a \nlittle more of these days. Again, it is Barbara Mikulski's example that \nhelps point us in that direction.\n  But for all of her firsts, I would say to my colleagues that Barbara \nMikulski's career has never been about gender as much as it has been \nabout agenda. I have had the privilege of working with her enough on \ndifferent issues of being what she calls one of her Galahads. I have \nseen her laser focus on what is right, on her conscience, on her gut, \non her sense of what the people of Maryland want, and what she thinks \nis her duty as a Senator. That is why I wanted her on the Speaker's \nplatform in 2004 in Boston at the convention, and she delivered just \nthe right message in her forceful and commanding way. She stood up \nthere and declared:\n\n       When women seek power, we don't seek it for ourselves; we \n     seek it to make a difference in the lives of other people.\n\n  There is no arguing, as we heard from a number of colleagues, about \nwhat an extraordinary difference Barbara Mikulski has made in the lives \nof other people, not just Marylanders but all Americans. She has been \nan extraordinary advocate for the Goddard Space Center, for the Wallops \nFlight Facility, and for Johns Hopkins Applied Science Lab in Maryland, \nas well as the Port of Baltimore and Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts.\n  For decades, she proudly worked beside my colleague of 26 years Ted \nKennedy. She loved Ted Kennedy and Ted Kennedy loved her. Together, on \nthe Health Committee, they worked to make universal health care a \nreality. Her role when Senator Kennedy was sick was an extraordinary \nrole of picking up that baton and helping to bring it across the finish \nline.\n  Along the way she became a leader on women's health, fighting for \nequality in health research and making sure women get the quality of \ncare they deserve. She was one of the chief sponsors of Medicaid \nfinancing of mammograms and Pap smears.\n  Personally, I will never forget how Barbara  reacted when the \nNational Institutes of Health said it would not include women in trials \nof aspirin as a preventive for heart attacks because ``their hormones \npresent too many biological variables.'' Barbara  fired back: ``My \nhormones rage because of comments like that.''\n  Her proudest accomplishment, she says, is the Spousal Anti-\nImpoverishment Act, which helps to keep seniors from going bankrupt \nwhile paying for a spouse's nursing home care. But throughout her \ncareer, Barbara Mikulski has fought to strengthen the safety net for \nchildren, for seniors, and for anyone who needed somebody to stand for \nthem or push open a door for them.\n  That fight started in east Baltimore where her Polish immigrant \ngrandparents ran a bakery and her father a grocery store. She says she \noften watched her father open the doors to his grocery store for local \nsteelworkers so they could buy their lunches before the morning shift. \nShe got it in her head at that time that she would rather be opening \ndoors for others on the inside than knocking on doors from the outside.\n  So no surprise, after college she got a job as a social worker \nhelping at-risk children and educating seniors about Medicare. She got \ninvolved in politics by organizing community groups to stop a highway \nfrom going through the Highlandtown neighborhood where she grew up. Let \nme tell my colleagues, nobody had ever seen anything like her. At one \nrally, she jumped up on a table and cried:\n\n       The British couldn't take Fells Point, the termites \n     couldn't take Fells Point, and goddamn if we'll let the State \n     Roads Commission take Fells Point.\n\n  As they say on ESPN, the crowd went nuts, and the roads commission \nnever knew what hit them. And I assure my colleagues, that was a \nnonprofane use of our Lord's name.\n  Again, no surprise, that led to her election to the Baltimore City \nCouncil. I think that explains a lot about just how good a politician \nshe is--how well she knows the street. I think every one of her \ncolleagues, all of us, are in awe of Barbara's ability to focus on the \nstreet emotion, on the simplicity of an argument, and to be able to sum \nit up in a razor-like comment that just cuts to the quick and makes the \nrest of us who search around for the words seem pretty inept in the \nprocess. Whether it is at Camden Yards, Fells Point, the Eastern Shore, \nthe Washington suburbs, or up along the Mason Dixon Line, Barbara  has \nher finger on the political pulse of Marylanders. She understands their \nconcerns, shares their aspirations, and sums up their hopes and their \ndreams in a few short sentences that nobody else can parallel.\n\n  If anyone expected Barbara Mikulski to accept being just a novelty or \na celebrity in Congress, they obviously had no understanding of her \ndeep roots as an immigrant, being an American, and the values she \nlearned about hard work in her family.\n  If anyone expects her to slow down just because she is now the \nlongest serving woman in the history of Congress, they don't know \nBarbara Mikulski. A couple of years ago, Barbara  and I talked--I think \nit was at one of our retreats--about how similar Maryland and \nMassachusetts are in certain ways, especially their rural and fishing \nhistories which we actually both have.\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\nShe told me she wasn't much of a fisherman, but she liked to hunt. The \nonly problem she cited was the recoil of the rifle given that she \nstands 4 feet 11 inches tall.\n  Well, it is clear from the record, clear from the comments of all of \nher colleagues, and clear from this extraordinary longest serving \nrecord in the Congress and all that she has accomplished that she \nstands as one of the tallest Senators and packs a punch way beyond her \n4 feet 11 inches.\n  We are proud to have her as a colleague, and we are in awe of her \nability to galvanize action, which is what this institution should be \nall about.\n  Mr. LEVIN. When you read over the long list of Senator Barbara \nMikulski's accomplishments, one word keeps coming up, ``first.'' First \nwoman to be elected to the Senate from Maryland, first woman of her \nparty to serve in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate, \nfirst woman to serve in the Senate leadership. Today we gather to honor \nSenator Mikulski, who in addition to her many firsts, now stands as the \nlongest serving woman in the history of the Congress.\n  Senator Mikulski began her service in Congress in 1976, and in all \nher time here since, she has championed the causes dearest to her--\ncauses dear to the needs of her constituents and to our Nation's most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  As chairwoman of the Children and Families Subcommittee, Senator \nMikulski has been a determined champion of the young, the old, and the \nsick. She has fought for access to higher education for every child \nbecause she believes ours is a nation where every young boy and girl \nshould have the chance to reach his or her true potential. She has \nfought for secure pensions for seniors because she believes ours is a \nnation where, after a lifetime of work, every person should have the \nchance to enjoy their retirement. And she has fought for preventive \nscreening and treatment for every woman because she believes ours is a \nnation where no one should lose a mother, daughter, or wife from a \npreventable illness.\n  As chairwoman of the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Mikulski has led the charge to promote economic \ndevelopment, equip our first responders, and invest in science and \nresearch. Senator Mikulski understands the importance of the private \nsector, particularly small businesses, in creating job opportunities. \nThat is why she has fought for legislation making it easier for \nbusinesses to make investments and hire new workers. No one has fought \nharder to support our emergency first responders than Barbara Mikulski, \nwho said:\n\n       We must protect our protectors with more than just words--\n     we must protect them with the best equipment, training and \n     resources.\n\n  Senator Mikulski is also committed to the promotion of scientific \nresearch and laying the groundwork for maintaining U.S. leadership in \nthe area. She has advanced legislation to substantially increase the \nnumber of students earning degrees in science, technology, engineering, \nand math.\n  As a Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski understands the \nimportance of the Federal workforce. Many of her constituents are \nresponsible for the high quality of life many of us take for granted \nevery day. Whether its food inspectors, air traffic controllers, or \nmedical researchers, many Marylanders who make up the Federal workforce \ncontribute to our Nation's health and safety. Fortunately for them, and \nthe rest of us, they have a powerful advocate in the Senate. Senator \nMikulski said, ``I want every Federal employee to know I am on their \nside.'' Indeed she is--not only because it is in the interests of her \nState, but because she knows well that an effective Federal workforce \nis in the interests of every citizen in every State. Throughout her \ncareer, Senator Mikulski has fought off misguided efforts to privatize \nessential functions of the Federal workforce, and fought for fair pay \nand benefits for these committed public servants.\n  Fair pay has been a focus for Senator Mikulski, and women across the \ncountry can be grateful for that. In 2007, the Supreme Court considered \nthe case of Lilly Ledbetter, a woman who for nearly 20 years had been \npaid less than her male coworkers for equal work. In its decision, the \nCourt ruled that Ms. Ledbetter could not proceed with her case, not \nbecause it had no merit, it did; but because of a technicality. Once \nthe Supreme Court rules against you, where can you turn? Just ask Ms. \nLedbetter; she will tell you. Senator Barbara Mikulski introduced the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to address the flawed Supreme Court \ndecision; and on January 29, 2009, it was signed into law.\n  In the Book of Genesis, the first question asked of God is ``Am I my \nbrother's keeper?'' Senator Barbara Mikulski has spent a lifetime and \nbuilt a career in answer of that question. She said:\n\n       I feel that I am my brother's keeper and my sister's \n     keeper. I think that's why I am shaped by the words of Jesus \n     himself: Love they neighbor. And I took it seriously.\n\n  The Senate is better off because she did. The people of Maryland are \nbetter off. Our Nation is better off. I am grateful not just because \nshe has become the longest serving woman in the history of Congress, \nbut because she has served her Nation so well.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to offer my heartfelt \ncongratulations to my esteemed colleague and dear friend, Senator \nBarbara Mikulski, on becoming the longest serving woman in the history \nof the United States Congress. This milestone, reached on March 17, \nmarks 12,858 days--more than 35 years--of dedicated service to her \nbeloved State of Maryland and to our Nation.\n  A little more than a year ago, in January of 2011, Senator Mikulski \nbegan her 25th year in the Senate, surpassing my personal role model in \npublic service, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, the Great Lady from \nMaine. Adding in her 10 years in the House, Senator Mikulski now \nestablishes the record for longevity in either chamber, set by \nCongresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers, who represented Massachusetts but \nwas born in Maine.\n  For me, the special meaning of this occasion goes far beyond such \ncoincidences. Just as Congresswoman Rogers and Senator Smith inspired \nyoung women in the past to lives in public service, Senator Mikulski \ninspires the young women of today. As a new Senator in 1997, I was \nwelcomed by her kindness and helped by her wisdom. She taught me the \nropes of the appropriations process and instituted regular bipartisan \ndinners for the women of the Senate.\n  It has been a privilege to work with Senator Mikulski for 15 years. \nDuring that time, I have come to know her as a fighter and a \ntrailblazer.\n  Senator Mikulski is, above all, a hard worker. Growing up in east \nBaltimore, she learned the value of hard work at her family's grocery \nstore. Her commitment to making a difference in her neighborhood led \nher to the path of service, first as social worker, then as a city \ncouncilor and as a Member of Congress.\n  Senator Mikulski's longevity is only the preface to her story of \nexceptional accomplishment. She has fought for increased access to \nhigher education for our young people and for improved health care for \nour seniors. I am proud to have fought at her side on those issues, as \nwell as for increased Alzheimer's research, improved women's health \ncare, and enhanced educational opportunities for nurses.\n  As House colleagues during and after World War II, Margaret Chase \nSmith and Edith Nourse Rogers were instrumental in achieving full \nrecognition for women in uniform. Senator Mikulski carries on that \nlegacy as a determined advocate for all who serve our country. Working \nwith her on the Appropriations Committee, I have witnessed firsthand \nhow seriously she takes her responsibility to the American taxpayers.\n  Throughout her life in public service, Senator Mikulski has lived by \none guiding principle: to help our people meet the needs of today as \nshe helps our Nation prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. It is an \nhonor to congratulate Senator Barbara Mikulski for her many years of \nservice, and to wish her many more.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is heartwarming to see such a \nspontaneous outpouring of respect and appreciation for the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski. It is certainly well \ndeserved.\n  She is one of the hardest working and most effective Senators serving \nin the Senate today. It has been a great pleasure working closely with \nher on the Appropriations Committee.\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to our dear \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Maryland, Barbara \nMikulski. This week, Senator Mikulski became the longest-serving woman \nin the history of the United States Congress. That is quite a milestone \nand I want to congratulate her on her many years of devoted service to \nthe people of her home State.\n  Senator Mikulski is a Maryland native. Descended from Polish \nimmigrants, she was born and raised in Baltimore. She attended college \nat both St. Agnes College in Baltimore and the University of Maryland.\n  After several years of working as a social worker in the Baltimore \narea, Senator Mikulski began her political career in 1971 when she was \nelected to the Baltimore City Council. She served there for 5 years \nbefore running for Congress in 1976. For 10 years, she represented the \nThird Congressional District of Maryland. Then, in 1986, she was \nelected to serve here in the Senate.\n  Although the milestone we are recognizing today is a significant one, \nit is not the first for Senator Mikulski. Indeed, throughout her time \nin the Senate she has been a pioneer for women in public service.\n  For example, Senator Mikulski was the first woman elected to \nstatewide office in Maryland. She was also the first Democratic woman \nelected to a Senate seat that was not previously held by her husband. \nAnd, she was the first woman to serve in both the Senate and the House \nof Representatives.\n  I have known Senator Mikulski a long time, having served with her in \nthe Senate for over 25 years now. While she and I have often found \nourselves on opposite sides of many issues, I have long admired her \ncommitment to her principles and, most importantly, her devotion to the \npeople of her home State. Indeed, she has been a stalwart and often \ntimes fierce advocate for the interests of Marylanders.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Mikulski on this important milestone \nand I am grateful for this opportunity to pay tribute to her and to her \nmany years of public service.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate having this opportunity \nto join my colleagues in expressing our congratulations to Barbara \nMikulski as she reaches another great milestone in her career of \nservice to the people of Maryland in the United States Congress.\n  Senator Mikulski is now the longest serving woman in the history of \nthe United States Congress. Although outstanding in and of itself, it \nis an achievement that represents far more than the number of years she \nhas served in the nation's Capitol. It is also a testament to her \noutstanding public service and her commitment to our future that has \nmade it possible for her to help to make our great Nation both stronger \nand more secure.\n  Back home, Senator Mikulski's constituents have come to appreciate \nher more and more as they have seen how hard she works to represent \nthem every day. That is why they always come out in such great numbers \nevery election day to make sure she will continue to do so. They can \nsee the difference she has made all around them and they appreciate the \nway she has made their cities and towns better places to live.\n  I have often heard Senator Mikulski referred to as the Dean of the \nSenate women, a title she has earned that was conferred upon her with \nthe great admiration, affection and appreciation of those with whom she \nhas served. Over the years so many of them have acknowledged the \ndifference she has made in their lives with her support, her \nencouragement, her guidance and her direction. She has been such a \ngreat mentor to them because she has always led the best way--by \nexample. It is another mark of distinction that has come to her as, \neach day, she has helped to write another chapter of the history of \nMaryland and this great Nation of ours.\n  Looking back, she has played an active role in a long list of changes \nthat have come to our country over the years. Because she has been at \nthe forefront of so many of them she has been a role model not only for \nthose with whom she has served, but for those who have been watching \nher in action back home. I have no doubt, in the years to come, many \nmore women will serve in the House and the Senate who will credit \nSenator Mikulski for first giving them the idea of serving in the \nCongress. Her own record of success then assured them that it would be \npossible for them to do the same if they were willing to work hard and \ntake their case to the people for their consideration.\n  In the end, that is what our service in the Senate is all about--\ndoing everything we can so that the current generation will have the \ntools they will need to succeed and then take their place as the next \ngeneration of our nation's leaders. Thanks to good people like Barbara \nMikulski the people back home know that someone cares. She has given \nthem a voice and it is heard and heard clearly whenever she takes to \nthe Senate floor to make their concerns known.\n  I have often heard it said that the meaning of public service is \nfound in the definition of the word ``service.'' That is why we are \ntaking a moment today to thank Senator Mikulski for putting her \nprinciples and her beliefs into action all these many years for her \nbeloved Maryland and the United States of America. If I may paraphrase \nthe words of Abraham Lincoln, it isn't so much her years of service \nthat matters so much as the service of her years. Through the years she \nhas made a difference in so many ways that will be long remembered and \ncelebrated.\n  Congratulations, Barbara. You are setting a record pace here in the \nSenate. From this day on, you will be setting a new record every day. \nThank you for your service, but most of all, thank you for your \nfriendship. Diana and I have appreciated having the chance to come to \nknow you and to work with you.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to Senator \nBarbara Mikulski of Maryland, who has just become the longest serving \nwoman in Congress, and to applaud the pioneering role that she has \nplayed in the evolution of the Senate.\n  Things have certainly changed since 1986, when Senator Mikulski was \nelected to the Senate. When Senator Mikulski joined the Senate as the \nfirst Democratic woman elected in her right as opposed to filling the \nterm of a spouse, the Senate looked very different. There was only one \nother woman senator, Nancy Kassebaum, a Republican from Kansas. The \nSenate had just begun to televise their proceedings the year she was \nelected. And, obviously, there were no women in leadership positions in \nthe Senate.\n  Senator Mikulski set out to change all that. She became the first \nwoman in the Democratic leadership. She became the first woman to serve \non the Appropriations Committee. And then she became the first woman to \nchair the Senate CJS Appropriations subcommittee.\n  And things certainly have changed. Now, in the 112th Congress, there \nare 17 women, both Republican and Democrat, in the Senate overall. \nThere are seven women on the Appropriations Committee alone. Five women \nchair Senate committees. Women have had significant roles in both the \nDemocratic and Republican Senate leadership.\n  While all of these changes were clearly not solely a function of \nSenator Mikulski's pioneering leadership, she blazed a trail as bright \nand as wide as anyone could possibly hope for. With her impassioned \nspeeches, her plain spoken delivery, and her commitment to fairness and \njustice, Senator Mikulski could not be ignored or pigeonholed. She \nstood up for what she believed in, and she would not allow her voice to \nbe silenced.\n  Senator Mikulski cared deeply about health care issues, and women's \nhealth in particular. When she learned that many Federally-funded \nresearch protocols did not include women, she led the fight to insure \nthat would never happen again. She established the Office of Women's \nHealth at NIH to ensure women would always have a voice in critical \nhealth issues.\n  One of her proudest accomplishments was working to pass the spousal \nimpoverishment law, which changed the rules that forced elderly couples \nto spend all their assets and give up their home before the Government \nwould help one member of the couple pay for a nursing home.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Senator Mikulski's \nefforts on\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\nbehalf of her beloved State of Maryland. From the crabbers of the \nChesapeake Bay to the steelworkers at Sparrows Point to the scientists \nat Goddard to all the other families all across the State, no one has \nworked harder to give them a voice on Capitol Hill than Barbara \nMikulski. On this historic day, I wish her the best, and I know that as \nlong as she is a United States Senator, she will never stop fighting \nfor what she believes is right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we mark March as Women's History Month, as \na time of year for us to remember the valiant female leaders of our \ngreat Nation. One of them is very special to Montana. In 1916 Jeannette \nRankin was the first woman elected to the United States Congress, 4 \nyears before women were granted the right to vote.\n  As a member of the House of Representatives, her daring and vocal \nstance on controversial issues such as war and peace brought critical \nrecognition from the press. In every situation, the strength of her \nvalues persisted, even under the pressures of unanimous opposition to a \nwar with Germany. Jeannette Rankin said, ``I may be the first woman \nMember of Congress, but I won't be the last,'' and helped to pave the \nway for future generations of women leaders.\n  This past Saturday, March 17, 2012, marked a monumental day in \nAmerican history. The Senator from Maryland, Ms. Barbara Mikulski, \ncelebrated her 35 year in the United States Congress.\n  That important accomplishment is a milestone for American culture and \nfemale leaders in Congress. Senator Mikulski is now the longest serving \nfemale in the Senate and in the history of the U.S. Congress. She spent \nher first 10 years in the House of Representatives, followed by the \nnext 25 years here in the Senate. She has worked every day to make \nAmerica a better place for the next generation.\n  When Senator Mikulski began her work in the House of Representatives, \nthere were 18 female Members of the House and three female Members of \nthe Senate. When she began her first term in the Senate, there were 23 \nfemale Members of the House and only one other female Member of the \nSenate. Now, she is a leader among our 17 female Senators and 76 female \nMembers of the House of Representatives.\n  Her strong sense of community and instinctive nature pertaining to \nthe needs of Americans is exemplified by her action-oriented attitude. \nEven before her tenure in Congress, as a social worker for the people \nof Maryland, Ms. Mikulski was active in local issues in and around the \nBaltimore area and worked to help at-risk children and seniors. She \ncontinues working passionately to address those issues throughout her \ntenure in Congress.\n  Her advocacy for justice and contributions to social issues are \nevident with her work to fight for women's rights and improved access \nto health care, to better education, and to volunteering and national \nservice opportunities. She offers tremendous leadership for the Senate \nboth as the chairwoman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nSubcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, and as the chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related \nAgencies.\n  Like Jeannette Rankin, Senator Mikulski has been a leader and an \nexemplar for strong and courageous women leaders in America.\n  Senator Mikulski gets things done, and I have enjoyed our friendship \nduring our work together in the Senate. Her brave spirit is one that \nsets the bar for new and incoming Senators, both male and female. I \ncongratulate Senator Mikulski on her special day and I look forward to \ncontinuing our work in the Senate together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I am enormously \ntouched and gratified by the warm words my colleagues have spoken on \nboth sides of the aisle. I am particularly moved by the fact of the men \nof Maryland who are here today. I am moved by the wonderful words of \nSenator Cardin, my colleague. I am moved as well that Governor O'Malley \nis here today.\n  When I came to the Senate, Senator Paul Sarbanes was my senior \ncolleague, and he is here today as well. Governor O'Malley and Senator \nSarbanes are on the bench, but these men are certainly not back-\nbenchers. I must say about the Governor and Senator Sarbanes and \nSenator Cardin, they prove the old adage that men of quality will \nalways support good women who seek equality. I have enjoyed their \nsupport, their wise counsel, and their collegial efforts on behalf of \nthe people of Maryland during my years in Maryland politics.\n  It is a great honor to be here today passing this significant \nbenchmark of becoming the longest serving woman in the history of the \nCongress, both in the House where I served for 10 years, and in the \nSenate. It is a great honor for me to be able to pass into the history \nbooks along with such an esteemed person as Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith. We spoke about that in January 2011 when I was sworn in. There \nwere tributes that day and wonderful words from our two women Senators \nfrom Maine. Today--actually over the weekend--I surpassed the record of \nEdith Norse Rogers who was the longest serving woman in the House. Both \nof those women came from New England. They were both hardy, resilient, \nand fiercely independent. I, as I have read their histories, so admired \nthem. They were known for devotion to constituent service, an unabashed \nsense of patriotism, and kind of telling it like it is. I hope that as \nI join them in the history books, I can only continue with the same \nspirit of devotion to duty and that fierce independence and patriotism.\n  I didn't start out wanting to be a historic figure. To, ``What do you \nwant to be when you grow up?'' you don't say, ``I want to be a historic \nfigure.'' When I was growing up, it was about service. For me, it is \nnot how long I serve, it is not about history. For me, history books \nwere Jane Adams and Abigail Adams and powdered wigs. I just welcome a \nday when I have time to even powder my nose, let alone powder my wig. \nBut the fact is, when I grew up, I wanted to be of service. I learned \nthat in my home, in my family, in my community, and with the wonderful \nnuns who taught me.\n  Today my colleagues have spoken about my wonderful mother and father. \nI had a terrific mother and father. I am so happy my two sisters and my \nfantastic brothers-in-law are joining me today. I only wish my mother \nand father could be here with me because they worked so hard to see \nthat my sisters and I had an education at significant sacrifice to \nthem. But they were really wonderful people where others saw them in a \nlife of business. Every day my father would open his grocery store and \nsay, ``Good morning, can I help you?'' When he did, he wanted to assure \nthat his customers got a fair deal.\n  My father opened his grocery store during the New Deal because he \nbelieved in Roosevelt and because, as my father said, ``Barb, I know \nRoosevelt believed in me.''\n  I also had the benefit of the wonderful Catholic nuns who educated \nme. I had the benefit of going to a school called the Institute of \nNotre Dame and then Mount St. Agnes College, the Sisters of Notre Dame \nand the Sisters of Mercy. These women, who concentrated their lives on \nthe message of Christianity and the message of Jesus Christ, wanted to \nmake sure that women in America could learn and be a part of our \nsociety. They didn't only teach us our three Rs, they taught us about \nleadership and service. But they also taught us about other values--the \nvalues of love your neighbor, care for the sick, worry about the poor, \nand be hungry and thirsty for justice.\n  When I was at the Institute of Notre Dame, a school that Nancy Pelosi \nwent to as well, there was something called the Christopher movement \nafter St. Christopher. The motto was, ``It is better to light one \nlittle candle than to curse the darkness.'' That is what I wanted to \ndo. I wanted to be a social worker. I even thought about being a \ndoctor. One time I even thought about being a Catholic nun, but that \nvow of obedience kind of slowed me down a little bit.\n\n  In this country wonderful things happen. When my great-grandmother \ncame to this country, she had little money in her pocket but a big \ndream in her heart: that she could be part of the\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\nAmerican dream, that she could own a home in her own name, in her own \nright; that she could have a job and so could the people in her own \nfamily; and that based on merit and hard work you could be something. \nWell, in three generations, I have become a Senator. Only in America \nthe story of my family could have occurred--modest beginnings, hard \nwork, effort, neighbor helping neighbor.\n  Much has been said about my fight for the highway. I was thinking \nabout getting a doctorate, a doctorate in public health at Johns \nHopkins. But they were going to run that highway through the \nneighborhoods, the older ethnic neighborhoods, the African-American \nneighborhoods. We were viewed in some of those neighborhoods as the \nother side of the tracks. I wanted to fight to keep those neighborhoods \non track. So I took on city hall, and I did fight them.\n  In this country, what happened? In another country, they would have \ntaken a protester like me and put me in jail. Instead, in the United \nStates of America, they sent me to the city council. I worked hard \nthere, and 5 years later, when Senator Paul Sarbanes, who was a \nCongressman, ran for the Senate, I ran for his House seat, and I got \nthe job.\n  When I arrived in the House in 1976, only 19 women were serving: 14 \nDemocrats and 5 Republicans; only 5 women of color. In 2012, there are \n74 women in the House: 50 Democrats, 24 Republicans; 26 women of color. \nIn the Senate, there are now 17 women serving: 12 Democrats, 5 \nRepublicans. Today, we saw visiting us Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, a \nwoman of color who served well while she was here.\n  Those are the numbers and those are the statistics. And though I join \nthis long number of firsts, for me it is not how long I have served but \nhow well I have served. When I came to Congress, I became a Member for \nthe fabulous Third Congressional District of Maryland. My job was to \nrepresent a blue-collar community that was in economic transition. What \ndid we do? We were a community that built things here so we could ship \nthem over there. We built cars. We built ships. We made steel. We knew \nif a country did not make something and build something, it could not \nmake something of itself.\n  I fought for those blue-collar people. I fought to keep those jobs in \nmanufacturing. We fought for the Port of Baltimore, its dredging, so we \ncould bring in the big ships so we could have exports. We worked again \nfor those people in those manufacturing areas while we saw jobs go \noverseas. Then we worked very hard for cities to make sure our cities \nwere safe, that we had great schools, and that they had a chance of \nmaking it.\n  I fought hard for health care. One of my greatest pieces of \nlegislation was the Spousal Anti-Impoverishment Act, so that if one \nspouse went into a nursing home, the other spouse would not have to \nspend down their life's savings and lose their home. AARP tells me my \nlegislation of so many years ago, that stands today, has kept 1 million \npeople--1 million people--from losing their home or their family farm.\n  Those were the battles then. Those were the battles when I changed my \naddress and I came to the Senate. Although I changed my address, the \nbattles are still the same: jobs, social justice, opportunity, based on \nhard work, peace in the world, and I continue to fight for this.\n  But for me, it is not only about issues. Issues are so abstract. \nIssues can be so bloodless when we talk about it. For me, issues are \nabout people--the people I represent in my own hometown, the people I \nrepresent in my State, and the people who live in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  My favorite thing is being out there talking to the people, going \ninto diners, going table to table, listening to their stories, holding \nroundtables with parents whose children have special needs, meeting \nwith scientists who have discoveries they think will lead to new ideas \nand new products that will bring new jobs, meeting with universities \nthat train our workforce. For me, it is about the people.\n  So as I pass this important benchmark, which I am so honored to do, I \nwant people to know I am still that young girl who watched her father \nopen that grocery store every day and say: ``Good morning. Can I help \nyou?'' I am still that young girl who went to the Institute of Notre \nDame and Mount St. Agnes College who said: I am going to light one \nlittle candle. I do not want to curse the darkness. I want to continue \nto fight for a stronger economy, a safer America, the people of \nMaryland.\n  In conclusion, I want to say thanks. I am going to thank the Dear \nLord for giving me the chance to be born in the greatest country in the \nworld, to be able to work hard and serve in one of the greatest \ninstitutions in the United States of America. But nobody gets to be a \n``me'' without a whole lot of ``thee.''\n  I thank my family. I thank the religious women who educated me. I \nthank all of my staff who have worked so hard to help me do a good job. \nAnd I thank the countless volunteers who believed in me and worked for \nmy election when nobody else did. Most of all, I thank the people of \nthe Third Congressional District and the State of Maryland for saying: \nBarb, we are going to give you your shot. Don't ever forget this. Don't \never forget us. I want them to know, though I have now served in the \nSenate 12,892 days, I will never forget them. Every morning I am saying \nin my heart: Good morning. Can I help you?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am so honored to join so many of my \nSenate colleagues and people from Maryland and across this country in \nrecognizing and congratulating the amazing woman you just heard from, \nmy good friend from Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, who, as you have \njust heard, has just become the longest serving female Member of \nCongress in the history of the United States.\n  This is an achievement that takes courage, it takes passion, and it \ntakes commitment. Those are three attributes all of us who know her so \nwell know she has in abundance. But my good friend, Senator Mikulski, \nhas not just served long, she has served well.\n  The senior Senator from Maryland, over her 35 years in Congress, has \nestablished herself as a trailblazer, as a leader, and as a fighter for \nthe people of her State. It is fitting that this milestone was reached \nduring Women's History Month because Senator Mikulski has given so much \nof herself in support of other women in Congress. She has guided us, \nshe has shown us how to stand and fight, and she has taken all of us \nunder her wing.\n  Senator Mikulski realized when she arrived here that there was no \nrule book for women in Congress. So she took it upon herself to guide \nthe way. She drew on her own experiences to make the transition easier \nfor all of us.\n\n  She organized seminars that you have heard about. She taught us how \nto work together. She taught us about the legislative process, the \nrules on the floor, and the many more subtle rules off the floor.\n  In short, Senator Mikulski showed us the ropes, and she has done it \nevery day I have been here for all the women who have come since she \nhas been here. While she knows it is important and courageous to lead \nthe charge, she also understands the first ones have to be responsible \nand successful so others can follow. It is because Senator Mikulski has \ndone her job so well that other women have been able to follow in her \nfootsteps.\n  She is here today as the longest serving woman in Congress, not by \naccident or by happenstance. She is here because she has earned it, \nbecause the people of her State know she is an indispensable champion \nof their causes, because she does work across party lines, and because \nshe delivers results.\n  I know many years from now when women have achieved a larger, more \nrepresentative role in our Nation's Capital, Senator Mikulski will be \nat the very top of the list of people to thank--the person who not only \nforged the path but who went back and guided so many of us down it.\n  I know many of my colleagues are on the floor today to thank Senator \nMikulski. But I am here especially to thank her, as one of those women \nwho have followed in her footsteps, for her more than 35 years of \nservice to her State and to her country. Those of us who know her well \nknow she is not even close to being finished.\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, my very best to my very good friend, Senator \nMikulski. I wish her very well in her next 35 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President I too want to speak of my dear friend \nBarbara Mikulski, who is just precious. She is precious to her family. \nShe is precious to the people of the Third Congressional District that \nshe represented for 10 years. She is precious to the people of \nMaryland, precious to the people of the United States, and precious to \nthose of us who have the privilege of serving with her in this body.\n  She has been affectionately known as a few things: The dean of women; \nthe breaker of the ceiling, as Patty Murray just said; setting the \nstage, setting the rule book--writing the rule book--for women in the \nSenate.\n  There will be 51 women in the Senate 1 day--there will be--and it \nwill come much more quickly because Barbara Mikulski was the first. \nThere is no question about that. The Senate will be a better place for \nit in so many different ways.\n  She is also not only known as the dean of women, we love her. She is \nknown as Barb. I love calling her on the phone late at night and having \nher say: This is Barb. Please call me. Make sure you say the words and \nleave your phone number twice.\n  Of course, when Barb says something, we all do it. So I always leave \nthe phone number twice.\n  I admire so much about her. But one of the things at the top of the \nlist is who she is. She is the real deal. She knows where she came \nfrom. She has never forgotten where she came from. As I have told her \npersonally, she has that internal gyroscope of who she is, what she \nshould do, and how she should do it that guides her almost \ninstinctively, and it is probably the most precious thing a politician \ncan have. Not very many people have it, but hers is about the best I \nhave ever witnessed.\n  It started from her upbringing and her faith, which she mentioned. We \nhave talked about Willy. She has mentioned Willy. But you never forget \nhow she reminds us because it is with her, and you can see it in her \nactions every day--how when people would come into the store that Willy \nhad, the grocery store in east Baltimore, when they had lost their job \nor someone was very sick and Willy would say: Take the groceries and \npay me later.\n  It reminded me of my grandfather Jake--we have talked about this--who \nwas an exterminator, not quite the same as Willy and not providing the \nsame services, but he would tell people: If you have roaches and rats \nin your house and you can't pay, I will still exterminate. Pay me when \nyou have the money. So I understood that instinctively.\n  I would have loved Willy to have met my grandfather Jake because I am \nsure they were kindred souls in a lot of ways. And the guidance of \nWilly and Barb's mom--you can see it every day in the way she acts.\n  I just want to say another thing about Barb. She got into public \nservice as a community activist. There was a highway that was going to \ntear up an important and historic part of her community, and she got \ninvolved. Being schooled by her and many of my colleagues, many women \nbelieved, oh, they would be excluded from politics if they went into \npolitics directly. But when you are a community activist and you take a \nlead because something is bothering you about your home or your \nneighborhood, politics just followed sort of naturally. It is a little \nbit like Patty Murray's story as well.\n  These days, because of what Barb has done, I think my daughters can \naspire--I do not know if they do, but they can aspire to go into \npolitical life directly. In those days, it was much harder. But there \nshe was. She led this fight. She went on to the city council, of course \nthe Third Congressional District in Maryland, and now to this august \nChamber. She has done so much. It has been cataloged by all my \ncolleagues.\n  Medical research: There are probably millions of people alive today \nbecause of the 35 years she has pushed to make that happen. They do not \nknow who they are, but they are there; and they are living happy and \nhealthy because of Barb Mikulski.\n  How about veterans and health care needs? Again, literally tens of \nthousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of our veterans are living much \nbetter lives because they were able to get the health care that Barb \nMikulski spearheaded, particularly in the earlier days when this was \nnot a popular cause.\n  The list goes on and on and on. She has done so much. In our Chamber \nshe is beloved. Beloved. People are sometimes afraid of her when she \ngets mad. People want her approval. But most of all, I think what most \nof us seek is her advice, because after so many years in politics, she \nhas that gift to understand what the average person needs and to talk \ndirectly to them. She does not talk through her colleagues or does not \ntalk through the media or does not talk through some community leader \nor other politician. She still is talking to that family sitting in \neast Baltimore or in Hagerstown or in Annapolis. She almost has them in \nfront of her eyes wherever she goes. That is why her speeches are so \neffective. She does not try to polish them. That is not her. She speaks \nfrom the heart directly to the people, and she cares so much about them \nthat it comes through. It is an amazing trait.\n  I most admire people in political life who never forget where they \ncame from. She is one of the most powerful people, not just women, one \nof the most powerful persons in America. I did not know Barb Mikulski \nwhen she was a community activist in East Baltimore, but my guess is \nshe is exactly the same today. All the power and the accomplishments \nand the emoluments and the praise, all deserved, have not changed her a \nwhit. That to me says an amazing thing about an individual.\n  Barb, I know my colleagues are waiting, but we love you. We cherish \nyou. And as Patty Murray said, I will put it my own way, I am sure that \nBarbara Mikulski, knowing her as well as I do, the best is yet to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I wish to join my colleagues in a \ntribute to Senator Mikulski.\n  I am delighted to join my colleagues in joining in this tribute to \nperhaps our favorite colleague, Barbara Mikulski, on her becoming the \nlongest serving woman in congressional history. Her work in these Halls \nhas made our country stronger. In a place where partisan rancor too \noften rules the day, she has established a legacy of service to her \nconstituents and to all of us in this body that stands as an example to \nevery one of us.\n  Her political career began in the late 1960s when she launched a \ncampaign to stop the construction of a highway over a historic \nneighborhood she wanted to protect in Baltimore. She won that battle \nand went on to run for the Baltimore City Council in 1971. More than 40 \nyears later and following a successful stint in the House of \nRepresentatives, Barbara Mikulski continues to blaze an impressive \ntrail.\n  During her 27 years in the Senate, she became the first woman to sit \non the Senate Appropriations Committee, the first woman to chair an \nappropriations subcommittee, and the first Democratic woman elected to \nSenate leadership. Last year, we celebrated Barbara as she became the \nlongest serving female Senator. Now she has crossed yet another \nmilestone, passing Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts, \nhaving served in the Congress longer than any woman in history.\n  Of course, we do not just celebrate the quantity of Barbara's service \nbut its quality. No one is better at drilling down to the heart of an \nissue and expressing it in punchy, unforgettable terms. No one cheers \nus up more than Barbara when she tells us to: Stand tall, square our \nshoulders, put on our lipstick, and rise to the occasion. We do not all \nput on lipstick, but we all get the message.\n  No one better combines the idealism of politics with the proactive \nabilities of government. She told me once with a twinkle in her eye, \n``I am a reformer, but I am a bit of a wardheeler too.'' Practicality \nand passion combined is what makes politics successful, and no one does \nit better than Barbara.\n  When she was first elected to the House in 1977, she was 1 of 21 \nwomen in Congress; 18 in the House and only 3 in the Senate. Today \nthere are 93 women\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\nserving including 17 Senators. Barbara has earned the distinction of \ndean of the Senate women. But she never, never forgot her roots as a \nchampion for those who need a voice in this building.\n  In her years in the Senate, Barbara Mikulski's dedication to her \nconstituents and women's rights has been clear, from becoming a \nchampion of women's health issues to organizing training seminars for \nwomen of both parties elected to the Senate, to sponsoring and pushing \nthrough with a force that we all remember the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct of 2009.\n  During my much shorter tenure as a Senator, I have had the great \nprivilege and pleasure to work with Barbara to pass landmark health \ncare reform legislation out of the HELP Committee. I have also served \nwith her on the Intelligence Committee, and worked closely with her on \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee's cyber task force to evaluate cyber \nthreats and issue recommendations to the full committee. I have taken \nfrom those experiences great affection and respect for Senator Barbara \nMikulski. These are issues that are complex, complicated, difficult, \nand abstruse, and she brought to them the verve and the vigor and the \nvision to move on them. And those really are her hallmarks: verve, \nvigor, and vision.\n  I know all of us here in this Chamber are proud to call Senator Barb \nour colleague and friend as she makes history yet again. Her hard work \nand collegial spirit have enriched this Senate. I wish her all of the \nbest in the accomplishments ahead. On behalf of all Rhode Islanders, \nSenator Mikulski, I congratulate you for this milestone in your \nhistory, the Senate's history, and our Nation's history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I consider it an honor and a privilege \nto rise for a moment to pay tribute to Senator Mikulski from the State \nof Maryland, And in so doing, I think it is only appropriate that I \nquote from a speech made on November 22 in 1922 by the first woman ever \nto serve in the Senate.\n  Rebecca Latimer Felton was the first woman Senator. She was appointed \nfor 1 day. Governor Brown had run against Walter George for the Senate. \nWalter George won. And because of Ms. Felton's unending help to him in \nhis race, he asked the Governor if he would appoint her for a day to \nhis seat before he took it and was sworn in.\n  She came to Washington, DC, to serve for 1 day and she made one \nspeech. In that speech she had a paragraph that to me exemplifies \nBarbara Mikulski. She said, ``Let me say, Mr. President, that when the \nwomen of the country come and sit with you, though there may be but \nvery few in the next few years, I pledge you that you will get ability, \nyou will get integrity of purpose, you will get exalted patriotism, and \nyou will get unstinted usefulness.''\n  That was Rebecca Felton in 1922. Today, in March of 2012, we honor a \nSenator who has lived up to every one of those promises Ms. Felton made \nalmost 100 years ago. I have had the privilege to serve on the HELP \nCommittee with the Senator, worked very closely on the Alzheimer's \nlegislation which she has been such a leader on, worked with her on \nmany other projects, including one I am happy to remind her about, and \nthat was the confirmation of Wendy Sherman a few months ago when \ntogether on the floor of the Senate, we worked together to see that she \nwas appointed and named and confirmed Under Secretary of State for the \nUnited States of America, serving under Hillary Clinton.\n  On that night when we worked on getting that UC done, and it was not \neasy, I saw the tenacity, I saw the grace, I saw the patriotism, and I \nsaw the integrity of Barbara Mikulski. It is an honor for me to rise \ntoday and commend her on a great individual achievement, not just for \nherself but for all of the women who have gone before her and all the \nwomen who will come later on, and to my five granddaughters and my \ndaughter.\n  She has led the life in the Senate exemplary of the contributions \nthat all women can make to our society. I commend her on her service, \nher compassion, her integrity, and all that she has done for the State \nof Maryland, the United States of America, and peace on this Earth.\n  Barbara, congratulations to you on a great achievement. It is an \nhonor for me to be here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I am honored to follow my good friend and \ncolleague from the State of Georgia in recognizing the remarkable \ncontributions of Senator Mikulski, now the longest serving woman in the \nhistory of the Congress.\n  Today we have been joined by many great Marylanders. We have had \nGovernor O'Malley and Senator Cardin, and former Senator Sarbanes, and \nSenator Mikulski's own family, her sisters and brother-in-law in \nattendance. I am also pleased that we have got two of her favorite \nconstituents, my father and my brother, who are with us today as well. \nThey live in Annapolis and they have known what I have known since \nchildhood when I lived in the suburbs of Baltimore, that Senator \nMikulski is a remarkable, a tireless, a passionate, and an effective \nSenator.\n  Reference has been made to her start as a community organizer, \nsomeone who saved Fells Point from a 16-lane superhighway, someone who \nwas not afraid to get into the gritty issues of a local community and \nstanding up for folks who did not have anyone to fight for them. We \nhave also heard about her early years as a social worker, helping folks \nin need understand the programs available to them and then fighting for \nthe programs that should have been available to them.\n  It is no surprise to any of us that the district she first \nrepresented in the House of Representatives, the Third, was known as \nthe ``steel district'' where lots of men and women worked in the \nBethlehem Steel plant. It is no surprise that she has earned a \nreputation here in the Senate as a woman of steel, who fights for \nmanufacturers, who fights for Federal workers, who fights for Western \nMaryland, who fights for poultry on the peninsula of the Eastern Shore \nof Maryland, who fights for her constituents day in and day out.\n  It is indeed just that in this Woman's History Month we would be \nrecognizing Senator Barbara Mikulski, who has stood up for Maryland \neach and every day. And though like me she comes up a little short \nevery time she stands, she stands incredibly tall in the company of \nSenators throughout American history. She is someone who is passionate \nfor people, who has determination to continue in the tradition of her \nfather, that fair deal grocer, who asked every day that simple \nquestion: How can I help, and then gets busy answering it.\n  She is a role model for me, for all of us, for my daughter, for my \nfamily, for our community. She is the only Senator I have heard say to \nme, fiercely, before going on a vote on the floor: To the barricades. \nAnd she is the only person who could say that and mean it. For a \nlifetime, she has been at the barricades of justice. She has been at \nthe barricades of service. She has been at the barricades of making a \ndifference. And for that, we are all grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I too stand today to pay recognition \nto a friend, a colleague, and truly a woman who brings a smile to my \nface. Because for as many years as she has served her State of \nMaryland, for as many years as she has served in the Halls of Congress, \nshe has the enthusiasm, the spontaneity, the excitement when she \napproaches an issue as a brand new rookie freshman coming into this \nbody.\n  That is quite remarkable because around here we can get kind of \ndragged down by the day-to-day politics, the partisan nature, and the \nconflicts that are inherent in this process.\n  Barbara Mikulski is one who embraces life and the responsibilities \nthat are put before her. She has an opportunity to represent her \nconstituents, and she embraces it with an enthusiasm that should be a \nreminder to us all of why we are here to serve.\n  I have so many different stories and quips and quotes about Senator \nMikulski, whose name sounds somewhat similar to mine--Murkowski. Every\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\nnow and again, we have an opportunity to share the same stage, the same \npodium, and the individual who is introducing us will trip on his or \nher tongue and refer to us wrongly. There was one occasion where we \nwere being recognized by the National Geographic Society, and she \npointed out to the individual making the introduction: She is the \nvertical one, and I am the not so vertical one.\n  This is just a recognition again that regardless of the situation, \nBarbara Mikulski has a good comeback, a quick quip. She is a \nquipmeister if there ever was one. It speaks again to the enthusiasm \nand passion she brings to the job she has in front of her.\n  With names such as Murkowski and Mikulski, we clearly have a Polish \nheritage we look to with pride. She reminds me of mine because she is \nperhaps a little more connected to those Polish roots. Again, there is \na sense of pride with whom she is, where she has come from, and what \nher family has done preceding her that allows her to go on and do so \nmuch for so many.\n  We have had the opportunity to work together on issues that, coming \nfrom different parts of the country--truly different ends of the \ncountry--and one would not think we would have as much commonality on \nsome of the issues. As the chairmen on the Commerce, Justice, Science \nAppropriations Subcommittee, we have worked closely on issues that \nrelate to our fisheries, coastal issues, and judiciary issues. She is \nalways reminding me that we have to take care of our fishermen out \nthere and make sure our families who rely on our waters are \nappropriately cared for.\n  We have worked together on women's health issues. We were recently at \nthe Sister to Sister event. I do feel a kinship and a relationship with \nthis Polish sister as we talk about those issues that are so important \nto women's health.\n  We share the same concerns about how we do more for our first \nresponders, our servicemembers, and our veterans. Just this past week, \nas Senator--I almost called her Murkowski myself--Senator Mikulski was \nchairing a committee, and I brought up an issue as it related to the \nlate Senator Ted Stevens and the Department of Justice investigation \nthat failed so miserably--and we are now pursuing it, through different \navenues, to make sure nobody should have to go through what Senator \nStevens did--Senator Mikulski literally stopped the committee hearing \nto remind the Attorney General that, in fact, this was not a partisan \nissue; this was an issue where we all should be concerned and that if \nthere is no justice within the Department of Justice, what does that \nmean for us as a nation.\n  She is never hesitant to speak and stand and make very clear, when \nthese issues are important to the Nation, it should know no bounds by \nparty. Barbara Mikulski has held true to that.\n  In many different ways, that makes this milestone we are recognizing \neven more important because I think there is a kind of a piling on of \nevents that can happen in the Halls of Congress, where the weight of \nwhat we do on a daily basis gets to be a load. To a certain extent, one \ncan get tired, one can get worn, but Barbara has not let the weight of \nthat responsibility bring her down.\n  I was joking with her a little bit ago when all the accolades were \ncoming her way. I said: Barbara, with all these kind words that are \nbeing said about you, by the time the tributes are done, you are going \nto be 7 feet tall. That woman is 7 feet tall in the minds of so many of \nus. She is a giant for the people of Maryland. She has proven herself \nto be a giant in so many ways as she works to do good for so many.\n  I am proud to stand with so many colleagues in recognizing her \ntenure, recognizing this historic place she has carved for herself \nwithin the Congress, and to call her my friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to honor the service of one of \nour most distinguished and long-serving colleagues, the tireless, \nsometimes relentless, and often spirited senior Senator from Maryland, \nMs. Barbara Mikulski.\n  To say she is a trailblazer for women in politics is an \nunderstatement. She has blazed a bold trial not just for women in \npolitics but for all women in every endeavor. She is a fighter, an \nadvocate, someone whom one is hopefully on the same side with because \nshe is a formidable opponent when one is on the opposite side. She is a \nrole model for leadership and getting things done.\n  Her impressive list of accomplishments is far too long to recite in a \nfew minutes or even a few hours. It would not adequately do justice to \nher incredible service to Maryland and the people of this Nation. \nSenator Mikulski has dedicated her career to serving Marylanders and \nhas dedicated her life to public service.\n  She began as a social worker in the neighborhoods of Baltimore, \nworking every day on the street helping at-risk children find their way \nand giving seniors the help they needed.\n  She was not, and is not, a bleeding heart, but there is no one who \nhas a fuller heart, a more open heart to the deepest needs of the least \npowerful among us than Senator Mikulski. She is someone one wants on \ntheir side.\n  Senator Mikulski came to public service with what I like to call the \nlong view. She can see beyond herself to the needs of society as a \nwhole, and she has fought for those needs and won on far more occasions \nthan she has lost.\n  When she first ran for public office in 1971, I know she had in her \nheart the deep and abiding memories of those kids and seniors she met \nin Baltimore when she began her career. I know she carries those \nmemories with her to this day. To this day, she has never forgotten the \npeople of Maryland who need her the most and have had the wisdom to \nelect her time and time again.\n  Her political career has taken her from the Baltimore City Council to \nthe House of Representatives and to this Chamber, where she has \nhonorably served for the past 26 years. For 7 years, I have had the \nopportunity to work with her in this Chamber, and there has been no \nstronger, more knowledgeable, more committed colleague on this side of \nthe aisle. She is an example for all her colleagues, determined to work \nacross the aisle when possible and ready to fight for her beliefs when \nnecessary.\n  She was the first woman elected to statewide office in Maryland, the \nfirst Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right, the \nfirst woman to serve in both Houses of Congress, and the longest \nserving female Member of the Senate.\n\n  As we all know, this past Saturday, Senator Mikulski became the \nlongest serving woman in the history of the Congress, serving more than \n35 years in the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n  It is only fitting that she achieve this milestone during Women's \nHistory Month because she has not only paved the way for women in \npolitics but she has helped pave the way for women everywhere.\n  I had the opportunity to work with Senator Mikulski during the long \nand difficult debate and negotiations on health care reform. Her work \nwas instrumental in ensuring that women have access to the \ncomprehensive health care they are now guaranteed under the law. During \nthat debate, no one's voice was clearer, no one's voice was stronger, \nno one was more convincing than she in the fight for a woman's right to \ncomprehensive health care coverage.\n  She fought for mandatory insurance coverage of essential services, \nsuch as mammograms and maternity care, services that many insurance \ncompanies refused to cover. She fought to end gender discrimination by \ninsurance companies.\n  As a result of the affordable care act and, in large measure because \nof Senator Mikulski's tireless efforts on behalf of women, being a \nwoman is no longer a preexisting condition, as insurance companies used \nto say, that can be discriminated against.\n  Those insurance companies that routinely denied coverage of basic \nwomen's health services--essential services--are now required to cover \nthose services under the comprehensive women's health services \nprovision of the law.\n  Whenever there is a need in the Chamber for a strong voice for women, \nwhenever there is a need for an advocate to stand for the powerless \nagainst the powerful, whenever there is a child who needs a friend or a \nsenior citizen\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\nwho needs a hand, Barbara Mikulski is there.\n  I believe there are many times she comes to this floor remembering, \nas she said, her days back in Baltimore, and she is right there--an \nadvocate's advocate--fighting for those children and seniors she met \nalong the way.\n  The rest of us are better off because she comes here with a full \nheart, ready to do what is right, not just what is politically \nexpedient.\n  Her bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, was signed into law by \nPresident Obama just days after his inauguration. I was proud to work \nwith her on that bill and on so many other efforts as well that make a \ndifference in the lives of average Americans.\n  Finally, Senator Mikulski has been a tireless advocate for something \nthat is near and dear to my own heart--for those who suffer from \nAlzheimer's and their families.\n  As the son of a mother who battled Alzheimer's for 18 years and lost \nher life to it, I understand firsthand the unique challenges of \nproviding long-term care for a loved one. Senator Mikulski has come to \nthis floor on countless occasions advocating for increased research, \neducation, and programs for individuals with Alzheimer's. She has found \nsupport from her colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  It is estimated that 5.4 million Americans are currently living with \nAlzheimer's and millions more have been touched in some way by this \ndebilitating disease.\n  I thank the Senator from the bottom of my heart for her passion for \nhelping those who suffer from this disease. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with her on this issue until we find a cure for \nAlzheimer's.\n  The bottom line: Barbara Mikulski is a deeply committed public \nservant. The State of Maryland has rightly recognized her invaluable \nservice for many years. Because of her efforts, those Maryland families \nknow their interests are protected and their voices are heard.\n  It has been an honor to serve with her. All of us in this Chamber can \nonly hope to serve our States with the same conviction, selflessness, \nand pride as Senator Mikulski has throughout her 35 years of service to \nthe State of Maryland.\n  I am reminded of what Mother Teresa said when she got the \nCongressional Gold Medal:\n\n       It is not the awards and recognition that one receives in \n     life that matters; it is how one has lived their life that \n     matters.\n\n  In that respect, Barbara Mikulski has lived an extraordinary life. We \nthank her for what she has done and not just for the people of Maryland \nbut for all the people of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am proud to be able to join my \ncolleagues on the floor this afternoon in honoring Senator Barbara \nMikulski for her service to Maryland and for the endless contributions \nshe has made to the people of this country.\n  It is very hard to adequately describe a political icon such as \nBarbara Mikulski. For all of us women in politics, she is a model of \nwhat we can aspire to or what we would hope to aspire to. I just want \nto tell a simple story about Barb that I think reflects her ability to \nget along with people, her zest for life, as so many of my colleagues \nhave described, and the connection she makes that makes a difference \nfor people.\n\n  She and I were on a flight with four other Senators to the security \nforum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, a couple of years ago, and the weather \nwas bad, so our flight was diverted to Bangor, ME. It was winter in New \nEngland, and of course, when there is bad weather in New England in the \nwinter, it sticks around for a while, so we were trapped overnight in \nBangor. Most of us just sort of sat there waiting to figure out what \nwas going to be done while we waited for a flight the next day, but not \nBarbara because she doesn't sit still. She is never afraid to pick up \nthe phone and take action, and that is exactly what she did. Barbara \ndialed up her old friend and colleague--the colleague of all of us--\nSenator Susan Collins, and said: Guess where I am. And that is how \nthose of us who were on that flight--the six Senators and the Secretary \nof Homeland Security--wound up joining Senator Collins and the \nlegendary Troop Greeters of Bangor, ME, in welcoming troops at the \nairport as they returned home from overseas. So what had earlier seemed \nlike an inconvenience turned into a fabulous opportunity to thank our \nbrave men and women in uniform and to have a good time while we were \ndoing it.\n  You find those kinds of things happening if you spend time with \nBarbara Mikulski. It is a byproduct of her relentless energy, her drive \nto better her community and our Nation as a whole, her deep commitment \nto fighting for women's health, and her unfailing grace and gumption as \na legislator, a colleague, and a friend.\n  As has been said, she got her start as a social worker trying to make \nthe lives of men and women in her native Baltimore a little easier to \nbear. She was working in the service of values that were taught to her \nby her family, who owned the neighborhood grocery store. And as so many \nhave commented, she often tells the story of her father opening the \nstore early so that steelworkers coming in for the early-morning shift \nwould have time to buy their lunch. Barb has carried that spirit, those \nvalues she learned from her family in that grocery store here to the \nSenate, and often those values are sorely needed here.\n  As dean of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, she has built \na sense of community within the caucus. Her bipartisan women's dinners \nare legendary. And, of course, what happens at those dinners stays at \nthose dinners. Those are Mikulski's rules. But we really don't need to \nlook any further than that wintry night in Maine to know how effective \nshe has been in making things happen for people.\n  I look forward to more of her dinners, to more conversations with the \nSenator, to more chances to work with her as she fights on behalf of \nwomen and seniors and veterans and all those who don't have a voice in \ngovernment and at the table. I thank the Senator for her friendship, \nfor her leadership, and for her many years of service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I too am honored to be able to rise \ntoday to speak of our dear friend Barbara Mikulski. So many good things \nhave been said, so many accolades have been shared about what Barbara \nhas done and what she means to all of us. I can only tell you there is \nnot a better ally, mentor, neighbor, and, most important, friend to \nhave in the Senate than Barbara Mikulski.\n  My State shares a border with Barbara's State. Maryland and West \nVirginia have had a long and illustrious relationship. As Governor, I \nhad always known of Barbara and had met her a few times when I served \nthe great State of West Virginia. But as a Senator, I have had the \nprivilege of being her colleague and working with her and becoming \nfriends, listening to her and watching her in how she works with her \nconstituents, how she considers the issues, how she fights for issues. \nI don't think anyone has ever had to guess where Barbara stands on an \nissue because we all know.\n  In the 15 months we have worked together, I can say it has been \nextremely rewarding to serve alongside her, whether it is her wisdom \nshe shares on the train ride over to our sessions here or whether we \ntalk about our both being raised in a grocery store. My grandfather had \na little grocery store and, as you know, Barbara was raised with her \nfather in a grocery store. I think, basically, if you have retail in \nyour blood, you understand the people of America.\n  Her sense of humor is something to behold. Every day I have the \nprivilege of serving with her is a good day in the Senate.\n  I know colleagues have all shared their stories about Barbara, and \nthey have had more experience with her in the Senate. As a freshman, \nbeing here only a little over a year and a half, I have not had that \nmany personal experiences, but I can tell you this: If there is a fight \nthat breaks out, if there is something going wrong, you want Barbara on \nyour side. She is the person to have in that foxhole when the shooting \nstarts. And I have been so appreciative to have her as my friend and \nalways counting on her.\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\n  As we have all heard, she has been an advocate for women's health, \nthe space program, and her most beloved State of Maryland, which she \nfights for every day.\n  Last year she became the first woman to reach the milestone of \nserving a quarter of a century in the Senate. Madam President, I have \nstaffers who are younger than her years of service. But I also have \nyoung staffers, especially my female staffers, who have said they see a \nworld of possibility because of the trail Senator Barbara Mikulski has \nleft for them. With all of that, she has blazed a trail for all of us. \nNo one will be able to fill the shoes of Barbara Mikulski. We will all \nbe lucky enough to follow in her footsteps.\n  When she began serving on the Hill in 1977, there were 20 other women \nin all of Congress. She and 17 others served in the House, while there \nwere 3 in the Senate. Today, 35 years later, there are 17 women serving \nin the Senate. If there is anything we can learn from Senator Barbara \nMikulski, it is that 17 women is far too few. We need more women like \nyou, Barbara, and, just as important, we need more Senators like you.\n  I can honestly say that I know the State of Maryland is much better \noff because of Barbara Mikulski, but I can tell you that the United \nStates of America is a better country because of Barbara Mikulski. So I \nsay thank you to my dear friend Barbara for her service to this great \ncountry and to all the constituents in Maryland who must be extremely \nproud of her and have a right to be so. I too am so proud to call her \nmy friend and my neighbor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, we have listened with interest and \ntotal accord as the life of Barbara Mikulski in the Senate has been \nreviewed by so many people. We have heard the friendship and good will \nwe all share toward her.\n  Her record is quite well known. She is determined to get things done. \nShe never lets minutia stand in the way or block an accomplishment. And \nI have noticed one thing: When Barbara Mikulski starts to talk during a \ndebate, the noise around the room quiets down. And if it doesn't, \nbeware; Barbara will call your attention to it and say it in a way that \ndemands attention.\n  Barbara and I arrived in the Senate in fairly close proximity. I came \nhere in 1983 and Barbara arrived in 1986, as I recall. We were both on \nthe Appropriations Committee. I had some slight seniority over her, and \none of the things that were being dealt with was seniority. Barbara \nasked for my help in the choice of subcommittee, and I tried to step \nout of the way and help Barbara obtain the chairmanship of a \nsubcommittee in Appropriations, which she managed so well and so \neffectively. She once called me her Galahad, and I was proud of the \nmoniker because it was intended to be a compliment and a sign of \nfriendship.\n  Strikingly, Barbara Mikulski and I have backgrounds that are not \ndissimilar. I came from Polish heritage. My grandparents on my paternal \nside were born in Poland, as Barbara's family was. They were \nimmigrants. My parents were brought as children from Europe and went \nthrough the traditional immigrant absorption.\n  My folks found it very hard to make a living as they grew up here in \nAmerica. My grandparents were essentially poor people with a kind of \nblue-collar background. They had to resort to storekeeping to keep food \non the table, a roof overhead, and clothes on their backs.\n  The one thing that threaded through those years for me--and I heard \nit coming from Barbara Mikulski so many times when she spoke--was there \nwas always dignity in the house, there was always a positive outlook.\n  As I heard, my parents, like hers, were not able to do much with \npresents and valuables. But they did something else, and you see it so \nfundamentally clear in Barbara Mikulski's demeanor and her behavior: \nthat what she learned at home, the same thing that I learned at home, \nwas the meaning of values not valuables but values. And values included \na character obligation for hard work and honesty and decency. They were \nthe yardsticks by which we were measured as children and as adults.\n  I worked very closely with Barbara. I left the Senate, as is known, \nfor 2 years and my seniority slipped as a consequence. Barbara's \nseniority continued to grow, and she is chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee. Barbara always brought a degree of strength and energy to \nthe things that she said and to the things she did. Although Barbara \nduring a presentation wanted to make sure that she was heard, and heard \ncorrectly, she would also pop up with humor. She had a facility with \nwords and a facility with expression that would have you engrossed in \nwhat she was saying and caught off guard when a joke or a humorous \nstatement would pop up.\n  When we note that Barbara Mikulski, from this modest background, was \nalways on the side of working people, it was never a mask; it was the \ntruth and it was where she wanted to be. I must say that she, for me, \nwas always a steadfast beacon that would remind us: Don't get carried \naway too much with your personal importance. Get carried away with the \nthings you have to do in your responsibility as a Senator.\n  When Barbara Mikulski came these years ago, as was noted, she was the \nfirst among the women to come to the Senate and ultimately, as we now \nknow, became the longest serving and carried herself through all of the \ndifficulties we have had. But always, always you could depend on \nBarbara Mikulski. When Barbara stood up, people stopped talking about \nthings that were extraneous and they would listen carefully, because \nBarbara Mikulski always made so much sense and she didn't let you get \nby without a challenge if she believed you were wrong.\n  We have heard about her record, we have heard about her \naccomplishments, and everybody had wonderful things to say about her. I \nlistened carefully to the statements that were being made and thought \nabout our days together and how wonderful it was to be able to hear \nBarbara Mikulski make sense out of what often escaped that challenge. \nShe would offer the challenge and she would offer solutions.\n  I, like our other colleagues, stand here in awe and respect and note \nthat Barbara Mikulski, the storekeeper's daughter, is so much like that \nwhich I saw in my own life and we have seen in America in the past \ncentury; and Barbara Mikulski who, in all due modesty, without any \nimpression of a smug satisfaction, is always ready to take up the \nbattle for the people she served, not only in the State of Maryland but \nacross the country. She is an inspiration for women coming to \ngovernment, and she serves so well as a demonstration of what could be.\n  I am delighted to be here, to stand here as a friend and an admirer \nof Barbara Mikulski, and wish her many more years of service. I know \nthat with Barbara around, you can always count on sense and good \njudgment to result.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks \nof my colleague, the Senator from New Jersey.\n  It is with great admiration that I rise today to join all of my \ncolleagues who have spoken before me and who will continue to speak \nhonoring the Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski, as the longest \nserving woman in the history of the Congress.\n  It has been such an honor to serve with Senator Mikulski. In my 3 \nyears in the Senate, she has quickly become a dear friend and an \ninvaluable mentor, as she has been for all of the other female \ncolleagues as the dean of women Senators.\n  It wasn't until 1932 that Hattie Caraway became the first woman ever \nelected to the Senate, and it wasn't until a half century later in 1986 \nthat, against all odds, Barbara Mikulski became the first Democratic \nwoman elected to the Senate. That is right. When she arrived in the \nSenate, she was just one of two women serving in this body. Now the \nlongest serving woman in congressional history, Senator Mikulski is \nshowing what is possible when you ignore conventional wisdom, never \nstop fighting for what is right, and honor our commitment to families \nwho elect us every single day.\n  One of her hallmark battles has been the fight for equal pay for work \nfor women. This is not only an issue of\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\nequality and justice but an economic imperative, because as we stand \nhere today, with more dual income households than ever, women only make \n78 cents on the dollar compared to men. For women of color, the \ndisparity is even greater, African-American women earning 62 cents on \nthe dollar, and Latinas 53 cents on the dollar. I know Senator Mikulski \nwon't give up until we correct this outrageous injustice, and I am \nhonored to be fighting alongside her.\n  Senator Mikulski has also led the fight to strengthen our laws \nagainst domestic violence, and open access to health screenings and \ntreatment that saves women's lives. Close to my heart, she was among \nthe first to stand up to insurance companies that said that being a \nwoman was a preexisting condition. You can always count on Senator \nMikulski to lead the charge in drawing a line in the sand in the Senate \nwhen it comes to protecting women's health and women's right to choose. \nWe saw it yet again when she stood up to the dangerous overreach of the \nBlunt amendment that would have denied women of this country the \nability to choose which medications to take and leave that decision to \ntheir boss.\n  She embodies the words of Eleanor Roosevelt:\n\n       The battle for individual rights of women is one of long \n     standing and none of us should countenance anything that \n     undermines it.\n\n  It is that spirit--making your voice heard, never backing down in the \nface of injustice--that has made Senator Mikulski one of the strongest \nvoices we have for women in this country and women around the world. \nEvery single day she is paving the way for more women leaders in \nAmerica by showing the young women and girls of this country that \nwomen's voices matter and are needed in our public debate.\n  I close by expressing my personal debt of gratitude to her for her \nvision, her leadership, and her pioneering spirit. I simply could not \nimagine working in this body without her leadership. She has taught me \nso much in such a short period of time. And, as importantly, she has \nfostered an unbreakable bipartisan spirit among our colleagues that has \nresulted in important victories for the American public.\n  Thank you, Senator Mikulski, and congratulations on your historic \nachievement. It is an honor to serve with you, and I hope to continue \nto serve with you for many years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Both Senator Sessions and Senator Snowe are \nhere, and I don't know if they wanted to speak. I know we have had a \nflow of speakers on this side, and if one of you wants to speak before \nI speak, I think it is the fair thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, my understanding was that Senator \nDurbin is going to make a UC request, which I plan to object to, and \nthere might be some brief discussion of that. But I don't see Senator \nDurbin on the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I am probably going to be the concluding \nremarks on celebrating Senator Mikulski, so I am going to proceed with \nthat.\n  Madam President, we have been here now for almost 3 hours--I was down \nhere when we started. Senator Feinstein started about 2:00 and we are \napproaching 5:00 now--for an incredible celebration of Barbara \nMikulski's career. I have listened to a lot of it both at my office and \nhere on the floor, and it is pretty remarkable to hear the kinds of \nthings she has done with her life and I rise today to honor my \ncolleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski.\n  As has been noted, this month Senator Mikulski becomes the longest \nserving woman in the history of Congress. With her perfect sense of \ntiming, Barbara  reaches this historic milestone during Women's History \nMonth. And it is for the history books. But, as Barbara  has said: It \nis is not how long I serve but how well I serve. And she has served \nvery well. She has served her beloved State of Maryland very well, and \nshe served this country in a number of capacities on the Appropriations \nCommittee and on various committees in the Congress.\n  We celebrate this historic occasion but, more deeply, we celebrate \nBarbara's record of achievement--a record that transcends gender, a \nrecord that is rooted in a life dedicated to public service.\n  Since she was first elected to public office in 1971 to the Baltimore \nCity Council, Barbara  has been setting milestones. Think about that \nfor a minute--1971. This is 40 years plus of public service. As the \nChair knows, this is pretty remarkable. She served in public service \nfor a while. I have served for a while. But 41 years of public service \nis remarkable--the first woman elected to statewide office in Maryland; \nthe first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right; the \nfirst woman in the Senate Democratic leadership; and the first \nDemocratic woman to serve in both Houses of Congress. Yet it is not her \nbeing first that is the most impressive; it is her commitment to \nputting others first. Barbara  has shown that commitment time and \nagain.\n  In over 35 years in the Congress, she has never wavered in her \nservice to our Nation and her dedication to the people of Maryland. She \nhas fought for quality education. She has fought for American seniors. \nShe has fought for women's health and for veterans. For women facing \nunequal pay, Barbara  championed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. For \nsenior citizens facing bankruptcy because of a spouse's nursing home \ncare, Barbara  wrote the Spousal Anti-Impoverishment Act. Yes, she is a \ntrailblazer, but she blazes those trails to help others--for young \npeople who dream of going to college, for families facing devastating \nillness, for opportunity for all Americans. That has been her passion, \nthat has been her true achievement, and that will be her greatest \nlegacy.\n  When Barbara  was first elected to the Senate in 1986, there was only \none other female Senator. Now there are 17. Barbara  is, rightly so, \nthe dean of the women. She is a mentor to her female colleagues, but no \nless so she is an inspiration to all of us.\n  I admire Barbara's remarkable determination and her tenacity, but \nalso her ability to work with others to get things done. She will fight \nfor what she believes, but she will sit down to dinner with her \ncolleagues across the aisle. And she has never forgotten where she came \nfrom. The daughter of a Baltimore grocer, each night she returns home \nto Baltimore. She has never forgotten the values she learned there: \nhard work, helping one's neighbor, patriotism.\n  She is diminutive in height only. That was evident early on. The \nstory is well known how, as a young community activist, Barbara  \nstopped that 16-lane highway from coming through Baltimore's Fells \nPoint neighborhood. She is not afraid to stand up to power, and she is \nnot afraid of speaking strongly to power. In all the ways that count, \nSenator Barbara Mikulski is a towering figure.\n  Albert Schweitzer once said: I don't know what your destiny will be, \nbut one thing I know for sure. The only ones among you who will be \ntruly happy are those who have sought and found how to serve. This \nBarbara Mikulski has done. From her early days as a social worker to \nher years in Congress, she has served. She has served long and well.\n  Congratulations, Barbara. It is an honor to be your colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I couldn't be more pleased as well as \nprivileged to join all of my colleagues today in congratulating a very \ngood friend and colleague, the dean of the women of the Senate, Senator \nBarbara Mikulski, on overtaking Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers as \nlongest serving woman in the history of the Congress.\n  As someone who has had the privilege of knowing Senator Mikulski \nsince 1978 when I was first elected to the House of Representatives, \nfor me, this milestone represents a watershed moment in the life of \nAmerican politics.\n  For nearly 35 years, I have witnessed Barbara Mikulski summon and \nharness a seemingly limitless reservoir of energy as a fierce advocate \nand a champion on behalf of the people of Maryland as well as the \ncountry. With equal parts vigor and vigilance, she has demonstrated a \ndevotion to her constituents that has been unerring in its promise and \nironclad in its purpose.\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\n  It is precisely that caliber of service that the people of Maryland \nhave rewarded time and time again.\n  As I stated on this very floor at the outset of this Congress when \nshe surpassed the length of service of Maine's legendary Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith, Senator Mikulski is synonymous with ``the special \nbond of trust which should exist between the governing and the \ngoverned.'' She has ``recognized injustice and acted boldly to quell it \n. . . giving a voice to the voiceless . . . power to the powerless.''\n  What Senator Margaret Chase Smith and Congresswoman Edith Nourse \nRogers exemplified as standard bearers in the last century for length \nof service, Senator Mikulski embodies in this century--that the \ncommitment to advancing the common good is bound neither by geographic \nregion nor political affiliation but, rather, by an undaunted desire to \nserve others.\n  A consummate role model and admired mentor, Senator Mikulski always \nstands as a shining example that the robust pursuit of policy and the \nwillingness to hear and consider dissenting views are not mutually \nexclusive. As I have often said, Senator Mikulski knows only one speed, \nand that is full speed ahead. But by the same token, she only knows one \nway to govern--through what she aptly referred to as the zone of \ncivility. That approach, so integral to making this institution work, \nis indisputably one of the hallmark measures of Senator Mikulski's \nlongstanding success in public life. Indeed, it is the blueprint for \ninteraction that she has imbued in all of us who are women serving in \nthe Senate. She has worked to establish a tone of respect that infuses \nour conversations, our collegiality, our collaboration. It is a \npersonal cause to Senator Mikulski that is exemplified by the monthly \ndinners for women Senators that she initiated along with the Senator \nfrom Texas Mrs. Hutchison, a tradition that has become a catalyst for \ncamaraderie and central to what Senator Mikulski calls our \n``unbreakable bond.''\n  There has been no greater friend for women who have come to serve in \nthe Senate, and I am sure it is a result of Senator Mikulski having \narrived here as the second woman to serve in the Senate, along with the \nSenator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, as she said at the time--and \nthat is why she was so willing to serve as a mentor for other women who \narrived in the Senate, because she was only one of two women who were \nserving in this institution. As she said, the Senate had a long \ntradition of every man for himself. She was determined, she said, that \nit would not be every woman for herself while she was in the Senate.\n  As my colleagues also well know, when it comes to having an ally in \nthe legislative foxhole, there is none more feisty, none more \nformidable, and certainly none better than Senator Barbara Mikulski. I \nhave witnessed her tenacity firsthand, having worked with her side by \nside over the decades, whether on matters of equity for women in the \nworkplace, ensuring gender-integrated training in the military, working \non cybersecurity, working on every other issue where we are bringing \njustice to those who have borne the brunt of injustice.\n  Nowhere has her leadership been more unmistakable, of course, or more \nmonumental than in the area of women's health. I well recall, when I \narrived in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979, I joined what was \nthen known as the Congresswomen's Caucus on Women's Issues, which is \nwhere I ultimately became the cochair for a better part of the decade. \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, at that time being in the House of \nRepresentatives, served in that caucus as well.\n  When I arrived in the House of Representatives in 1979, there were \nonly 16 women serving in that institution. That is why the \ncongresswomen's caucus was formed, to focus on those issues that \nmattered to women and to family and to children. We recognized that it \nwas our obligation and responsibility to work, to focus on those issues \nbecause otherwise they would languish on the back burner rather than \nbeing on the front burner. We also understood that if we did not focus \non these issues, if we did not advance these issues, no one else would. \nSo we began to tackle systematically many of the discriminatory laws or \ninequities that were embedded in Federal law that failed to recognize \nthe dual role women were playing, both at home as well as in the \nworkplace.\n  We began to work on these issues one by one because there were so \nmany issues across-the-board that were affecting women, where they were \nultimately bearing the burden and the consequences of these inequitable \nlaws. We did that with respect to pensions, for example, where women \ndiscovered that after their husbands died, their pensions had been \ncanceled.\n  We discovered it when it came to family and medical leave, which took \nus the better part of 7 years to enact that legislation. But, again, \nwomen were bearing the burden of taking care of their ailing parents or \ntheir children at home and paying the consequences in the workplace.\n  Then, of course, there was the issue we discovered of discriminatory \ntreatment in our clinical study trials. Regrettably, at the time our \nNational Institutes of Health were actually discriminating against \nwomen and minorities, excluding them from clinical study trials because \nit was too complicated to include women in these study trials because \nwe were biologically different. As a result, any of those treatments \nthat were developed as a result of those trials could not be applied to \nwomen. Ultimately, this could make the difference between life and \ndeath because the kinds of procedures and treatments that were derived \nfrom these clinical study trials could not be applied to women.\n  When we discovered that these inequities and this discriminatory \ntreatment existed, we set to work on how to redress this wrong. It is \nhard to believe there was a time in America where women and minorities \nwere systematically excluded from these trials that, as I said, had \nlifesaving implications. Who would have thought that women's health \nwould have been the missing page in America's medical textbooks or \nmerely an afterthought.\n  So I, as a cochair along with Congresswoman Pat Schroeder in the \nHouse, on behalf of the caucus, and, of course, then-Senator Barbara \nMikulski in the Senate teamed up in a close bipartisan, bicameral \ncollaboration to establish the groundbreaking Office of Research on \nWomen's Health at the National Institutes of Health so that never again \nwould women be overlooked when it came to key clinical study trials \nthat were underwritten by the Federal taxpayers and Federal funds. In \nfact, Senator Mikulski, as I well recall, launched the key panel of \nstakeholders at Bethesda to give this initiative critical national \nattention and momentum--as only she could--as well as fundamental \npolicy changes that ultimately resulted from that panel \nthat reverberate to this day, resulting as well in lifesaving medical \ndiscoveries for America's women.\n\n  That is the passion and power of Senator Mikulski that has led her to \nthis historic day. Barbara is not about legacy, she is about problem-\nsolving. As somebody described it, her ideology is grounded in the \npractical, and that is so true. It is not only the practical but giving \npower to the people and developing practical solutions in their \neveryday lives.\n  She is a guardian of the common good, a woman who redefines the word \n``trailblazer,'' a pioneer of public policy. Senator Mikulski continues \nto shape the landscape of our Nation for the better, with a force and a \nmight and a stature, one of the giants of public service, not just in \nour time but for all time.\n  On the occasion of Senator Mikulski's recordbreaking service, we \ncongratulate her, we salute her, and we are honored to be able to \nexpress a profound appreciation for her extraordinary and legendary \ntenure in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mrs. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ncelebrate Barbara Mikulski's service to this country. I had the honor \nof presiding for the last hour and heard the statements of so many of \nmy colleagues. I heard them talk about how, when she joined this \nChamber in 1986, Barbara Mikulski was the first woman elected to the \nSenate who was not preceded by a husband or a father,\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\nthe first woman elected to the statewide office to serve the State of \nMaryland, and only the 16th woman to have served in the Senate ever.\n  Today she is truly the dean of women Senators. She is a mentor and a \nfriend to the rest of us, and she has always set the bar high. This is \na woman who took on city hall as a young social worker in Baltimore--\nand won. This is a woman who has championed landmark legislation that \nhas touched the lives of millions on issues ranging from health care to \neducation to civil rights. She has shattered glass ceilings, not just \nin the Senate but in the Congress as a whole.\n  If that is not enough, she has even graced the glossy pages of Vogue \nmagazine. Most of you may not have seen the photos that were taken in \nfront of the Capitol Building with a number of other women leaders, \nincluding Meryl Streep, who was in town for a screening of her film \n``The Iron Lady.'' So I think it is fitting, to borrow a phrase from \nthe Iron Lady herself, Margaret Thatcher, who famously said, ``In \npolitics, if you want anything said, ask a man; if you want anything \ndone, ask a woman.''\n  I don't think my male colleagues who are here today will take offense \nat that one since anyone who has ever worked with Barbara Mikulski \nknows she is a force of nature. She may not be the tallest Member of \nthe Senate, but she is certainly the most tenacious. She is a tireless \nadvocate for the people of her State, and she has a fierce and enduring \nlove for those she represents. She knows where to pick her battles, and \nwe have seen her face some tough debates in the Senate over the past \nfew years. Whether it was working to take C-sections off lists of \npreexisting conditions at insurance companies or fighting to ensure \nequal pay for equal work for women or promoting better educational \nopportunities for children with special needs or ensuring that our \ntroops and families receive the benefits that they have earned and that \nthey deserve, she has never stopped working for fairness, justice, and \ndecency.\n  The daughter of a smalltown grocery store owner, she has made \nstrengthening the middle class the centerpiece of her economic agenda \nbecause, as she always puts it, the women in the Senate understand \nissues not just at the macro level but also at the macaroni-and-cheese \nlevel.\n  When Barbara Mikulski came to the Senate 26 years ago, she lit a \ntorch that has brightened the path for so many of us, for the 16 other \nwomen Senators who serve today and for all the future generations of \nwomen leaders who will lead our country forward. I am humbled to call \nher a colleague and a friend, and I am honored to celebrate her \nincredible service to our country today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are several of my colleagues here \nwho are continuing their tributes to Senator Mikulski. I have a \nstatement that was scheduled at 5 p.m. that will take all of 10 \nminutes, and then I will yield the floor at that point. I don't know if \nMembers who are on the floor want to establish a queue of who will \nfollow, but if anyone wants to make that unanimous consent request, I \nsee that Senator Carper and Senator Cantwell are here on this side, \nSenator Coats is on the other side. I don't know if Senator Sessions is \nplanning to speak after I have spoken on a substantive matter beyond \nthe UC request.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, although I wouldn't mind seizing the opportunity to \nspeak about Senator Mikulski for a minute, but otherwise, if the \nSenator has no----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to give a statement and make a \nUC request that I planned at 5 p.m. And if I could suggest I be \nfollowed by Senator Sessions, and then Senator Carper, Senator Coats--\n--\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator will yield on that, I don't want to \ninterrupt the tribute to Senator Mikulski, and I know the Senator has \nsome business he has arranged. I will give mine another time. You don't \nhave to include me in the queue. I don't want to spoil the party. The \ntribute is worthwhile, and I will find another time to do this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to make an admission. I have spoken \nabout Senator Mikulski earlier and this is a different issue. I suggest \nafter Senator Sessions that Senator Carper and Senator Cantwell follow. \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senators be recognized in the order I \nhave noted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Would the \nSenator wish to request that the nontribute-related portion of the \ndiscussion be put in a separate place in the Record?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is what I was about to ask the Chair, to have \npermission that my statement not related to Senator Mikulski be placed \nin a separate part of the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin and Mr. Sessions are printed in the Record \nunder ``Cameras in the Courtroom.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, although I do not have prepared remarks, \nI wish to join with my colleagues in making a few comments about \nSenator Mikulski.\n  Senator Mikulski is a great Senator. She is a delight to work with, a \nformidable adversary, and a formidable ally in any important debate. \nShe is someone whom all of us respect and admire. It surprises me she \nhas been at this business so long. It doesn't seem as though it is \npossible. She certainly hasn't lost her enthusiasm for the job and she \nhas played an important role in quite a number of issues with which the \ncountry has had to deal.\n  I remember her leadership on an important issue during the post-9/11 \ntime, when we were wrestling with how to deal with security for our \ncountry. She spoke firmly and strongly in favor of firm action to \ndefend America from attack.\n  Another issue I don't think has been mentioned but is exceedingly \nimportant--something I have observed her deal with and provide \nleadership on for some time--is space and NASA. She is one of the \nabsolutely most knowledgeable and experienced Members of this Senate \nand the entire Congress in dealing with the complexities and the needs \nof NASA and she is a champion and advocate for exploration of space. \nThis is an area where America has led the world, and for all her time \nin the Senate, she has been a champion of advocating that the United \nStates maintain this leadership because I think we share the view that \nAmerica is a nation of explorers. We are a nation that leads the world \nin exploring and it is part of our DNA. So I appreciate her leadership \nin that particular area, as I have watched her with great admiration in \nher activities.\n  I didn't realize this tribute would be going on this afternoon and I \ndidn't have prepared remarks, but I wish to join with my colleagues to \nsay how much I appreciate her efforts. We celebrate her great \naccomplishment in the Senate. I believe that as we go forward, we will \nfind that on issue after issue she will play a critical and a positive \nrole in making America a better place.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to follow my colleague from Alabama \nand speak for just a few minutes about our friend and colleague, \nSenator Mikulski, who celebrates her milestone through her public \nservice to the people of Maryland.\n  I asked my staff to go to the Web page for Senator Mikulski, her \nSenate office, and I came across one paragraph which I wish to read to \nmy colleagues, if I may. It says:\n\n       Barbara Mikulski has never forgotten her roots. Throughout \n     her career she has returned each night to her home State of \n     Baltimore, Maryland. From community activist to U.S. Senator, \n     she has never changed her view that all politics is indeed \n     local and that her job is to serve the people in their day-\n     to-day needs as well as prepare this country for the future.\n\n  Sometimes people have come to Congress over the years and they come \nunderstanding clearly that our job is to serve. Over time, somehow they \nlose that thought a little bit and it is less clear who is to be served \nand who is to be the servant. She has never forgotten who the servant \nis. She knows she came as a servant, and she will leave someday as a \nservant--hopefully, not anytime soon.\n  If we ask most people around here what are maybe one or two words \nthat best describe Barbara Mikulski, I think a lot of people would say \nshe is a fighter. Let me just say, if someone is\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nan advocate for a particular cause, she is the person one wants in the \nfoxhole with them. There is no better advocate, and there is no better \nor more able opponent on an issue. It is a lot better to have her on \nyour side than it is to have her against you.\n  I take the train home at night. I go through Baltimore on my way to \nWilmington, DE. Along the route, we go by a place called Aberdeen. \nSometimes the train stops there; sometimes it does not. We have seen \nAberdeen Proving Grounds literally consolidated from around the \ncountry. Much of the important research activity the Army does is at \nthe Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The person more than anybody else who has \nmade that possible is Barbara Mikulski. It is a vast facility, with \ntens of thousands of employees who I think are mostly civilian and a \ncampus of over 100,000 acres that does great work, helping to provide \nfor our defense against all kinds of attack, foreign and domestic. She \nis a great person to have on your side in leading that fight.\n  One of the other things I love about Barbara is her devotion to first \nresponders. There is a big national fire school in a town called \nGaithersburg, MD. She has helped make that place possible to not only \ntrain folks who are first responders for the people of Maryland, but \nthey train as well first responders for virtually every State in every \ncorner of this Nation. People will go to bed tonight knowing that if \nthere is a fire or a problem or an incident in their community, it will \nbe responded to, and they can thank Barbara Mikulski for helping to \nensure the folks trained there are ready to do that.\n  As much as anybody I know, she is a person who values service. \nAmeriCorps is an organization that encourages young people--really \npeople of all ages--to volunteer and to serve. Volunteers are the ages \nof our pages and a whole lot older and the ages of guys like me. We all \nhave an obligation to serve and to bring that spirit of service, \nwhether or not we are in public life.\n  I was struck by the fact that she often opened the store as a kid, \nbeginning a lot of her days as her dad opened the family grocery store, \nearly in the morning in east Baltimore. I was born in West Virginia in \na town called Beckley. I lived there for about the first 6 years or so \nof my life, but I would go back many summers, and I had the opportunity \nto work there for a supermarket, a mom-and-pop supermarket, with my own \ngrandfather who opened the store almost 6 days a week, and I had the \nopportunity to see him and his work and what he brought to that store \nevery day as the butcher. I think I know more about serving by working \nmy summers in that store than anything else I have ever done. I suspect \none of the reasons Barbara has adopted and retained the spirit of a \nservant is because of her childhood and growing up and seeing her own \nfamily, her own dad, in that particular store.\n  I mentioned my grandfather in West Virginia. His wife, my \ngrandmother, suffered from Alzheimer's disease. My grandmother's mother \nsuffered from Alzheimer's disease. My own mother suffered from \nAlzheimer's disease. I don't think there is anybody in this body who \nhas done more to lead the fight to ensure that this scourge of our \nsociety--and the scourge of people all over the world--is reined in and \novercome. When that day comes, people will stand and say: I did \nsomething about this. Nobody in this body I think can take more credit \nfor conquering Alzheimer's disease and dementia than Barbara Mikulski.\n  Finally, when people think of Barbara, they think of a fighter, an \nadvocate for voluntarism, and some of the other things I talked about. \nI don't know that many people think of her as an athlete, but I will \nsay that she is very a big advocate for leveling the playing field. She \nwants to make sure people not just in athletic endeavors have a level \nplaying field in which to compete, but she wants to make sure young \npeople coming from the most impoverished backgrounds have an \nopportunity and have a real shot at life to get a decent education as a \nchild, the chance to go to college and to increase their potential to \nnot just earn money and support their families but to live productive \nlives. Those are just some of the things I think about when I think of \nBarbara Mikulski.\n  I will close by saying she had been in the House I think for 6 years \nwhen I arrived in 1982, 1983, and for all the time we served there \ntogether, she was always very encouraging of me, very supportive of me \nas her Delmarva buddy, as we shared the Delmarva Peninsula. Even to \nthis day we work together to make sure we have a strong, vibrant \npoultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula. I like to say we are still \nDelmarva buddies as we look out for the mutual concerns of our \nrespective States.\n  With that having been said, let me yield back my time. I see Senator \nCantwell is ready to speak. My guess is, she is going to say some more \nthings about Barbara. But those are some things I am glad I had a \nchance to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I do rise to celebrate the remarkable \nachievements of my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski.\n  Last January we celebrated an obvious achievement of her becoming the \nlongest serving female Senator. And last Saturday that milestone \nentered another chapter, with her 12,858 days of serving the people of \nMaryland in Congress, which means she is now the longest serving female \nMember of Congress.\n  I know Barbara Mikulski started her career fighting for Fells Point, \na particular location in the Baltimore area that she thought deserved \nand needed to be protected, and that galvanized her to 35 years of \nservice, where she has been a trailblazer on so many issues.\n  Many people have talked about those today--about being the first \nwoman elected to statewide office in Maryland, the first Democratic \nwoman to serve in both Houses of Congress; the first Democratic woman \nto sit in a Senate leadership position, and the first Democratic woman \nto be elected to the Senate in her own right.\n  Throughout her career, she has faithfully provided a very strong \nvoice for the people of Maryland. But it is here in the Senate we have \nall gotten to see Barbara Mikulski, the dean of the women Senators, and \nto see her incredible work as a trailblazer on so many important \nissues.\n  She has been a tireless champion on issues from pay equity to \nincreasing access to college education, for women's health, for women's \nhealth care law, and time and time again she has proven she knows how \nto fight on the right side of the issues.\n  For the women of the Senate, she is an incredibly important ally. \nWhen it comes to each of us who comes to the U.S. Senate, to find our \nway and to make our own mark, Barbara Mikulski is the Senator who is \nalways there with you to make sure you can achieve what you want to for \nthe State you represent.\n  I know for me I am very excited--my colleague from Alabama was \nmentioning Senator Mikulski's love of NASA and space exploration--in \nthat I can say Senator Mikulski is certainly interested also in sci-fi, \nand I would call her a ``techie'' Senator because she certainly has \nshown a great deal of interest in technology and science.\n  As the Chair of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee, she was a key partner in the funding of key science and \ntechnology issues, and for us in the State of Washington, when we \nneeded a new Doppler radar technology system, she was there to help \nensure that those people who lived in coastal regions were going to \nhave the appropriate protections they needed for understanding \ninclement weather.\n  She also has helped in prioritizing efforts such as the cleanup of \nthe Chesapeake Bay in Maryland--something we in the Northwest relate to \nbecause we strive to have the same cleanup of Puget Sound.\n  We have worked together on important legislation, such as passing the \nLilly Ledbetter legislation.\n  But it is Barbara Mikulski--when it comes to protecting women's \naccess to health care or standing up to any attack on Medicare--who is \nthe most articulate, the most determined, the most persevering advocate \nto make sure women's issues and their cause are understood in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I was proud to stand with her when she went up against the House plan \nto defund critical women's health care access and there was a near \nshutdown of\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\ngovernment. As people tried to pressure Planned Parenthood, she was \nthere to make sure we continued important programs such as breast \ncancer screening.\n  So today I join my colleagues from the Senate to thank her for those \nyears of service in the U.S. Congress, both in the House and the \nSenate. While she may represent Maryland, we all want to claim that we \nare better off as a country having Barbara Mikulski in the U.S. Senate.\n  And to my colleagues--or to the young people who are here with us on \nthe Senate floor--to understand this moment and achievement, you have \nto understand that in the whole history of our country, there have only \nbeen 39 women Senators, and a good number of those women Senators only \nserved a few days or a few years. So the fact that somebody has \nachieved not just a seat in the U.S. Senate but a leadership position \nin the U.S. Senate is an incredible achievement.\n  We are glad she has represented a time when women have ascended to \nleadership in the U.S. Senate, where she is considered one of the wise \nMembers when it comes to strategy on so many policy issues.\n  We are better off as a body because Barbara Mikulski has served with \nus, and we are looking forward to many more years of wisdom and, \nhopefully, many more women Senators joining the ranks of Barbara \nMikulski in their tenure.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today also to pay tribute to my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski.\n  As everyone has said, this is a landmark, this is a milestone: the \nlongest serving woman Senator and Member of Congress in the history of \nCongress, serving more than 35 years.\n  As a relatively junior Member of this body, I love Barbara Mikulski. \nI love her because she calls me ``Franken.'' That is music to my ears. \nWe are in the caucus lunch, I may be in her way, and she says: Franken.\n  I am not only a relatively junior Senator, I actually kind of \nrecently was a comedian at one point. And she is really funny--Barbara. \nI remember the first time I saw her speak--it was years ago, years ago; \nI cannot remember what the event was--and I am going to try to quote \nher joke. It was her joke, remember, about herself. She talked about \nher first campaign effort. I think it was for city council or something \nlike that. She said: I knocked on 7,387 doors, and I walked a total of \n372 miles, and I didn't lose a pound.\n  So I love Barbara. And she is a force--a force--of nature. Being the \ndean of women here is not her most commanding title. Her most \ncommanding title is: a fighter. She is a fighter. When she commits \nherself to a cause, she is a true champion.\n  She is a true champion for America's seniors, preserving pensions; of \nMedicare, defending Medicare--boy, do not attack Medicare around \nBarbara Mikulski--and combating poverty. No one works harder for \nquality education, fighting to make sure every child has a quality \neducation, so that child can pursue the American dream. And she is \ncommitted to fulfilling our country's promises to our veterans, which \nis so important, and to increasing community service and voluntarism.\n\n  As anyone who has watched proceedings here in the Senate knows, \nBarbara Mikulski, as my colleague from Washington stated, is the \ngreatest champion in the body for women's health. Here is something \nthat is pretty amazing to understand. I want the pages to hear this. \nShe fought to include women in NIH clinical trials. Women were not \nincluded in the National Institutes of Health clinical trials until she \nmade sure they were. This is hard to believe, isn't it? But in your 16 \nyears of life, you--at 16, you cannot conceive of this. This is how \nbackward we were. Think of what she did. That is who we are talking \nabout today.\n  She has improved access for women to mammograms and cancer \nscreenings--for all women. She has fought for women to have their own \nsay over their own body and reproductive system. Basically what I am \nsaying is, when you have Barbara Mikulski on your side, you have a \nstrong voice in the U.S. Senate.\n  We have heard reference to her accomplishment on the Lilly Ledbetter \nFair Pay Act. When advocating for this bill, Senator Mikulski said:\n\n       Women earn just 77 cents for every dollar [their] male \n     counterparts make. Women of color get paid even less. The \n     Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act will empower women to fight for \n     fair pay by once again making employers accountable for pay \n     discrimination. I will fight on the Senate floor to get this \n     bill passed.\n\n  And the bill was passed. It was the first bill President Obama signed \nin office.\n  Senator Mikulski and I share a number of passions. One of them is \nearly childhood education. Increasing early childhood education--access \nto it--is one of my top priorities because we know over and over that \nthe benefits of early childhood education have been demonstrated. And \nBarbara  knows this.\n  I wanted to have a hearing on just the economic benefits of early \nchildhood education--just the economic benefits--because a child who \nhas a quality early childhood education is less likely to be a special \ned kid, is less likely to be left back a grade, has better health \noutcomes; a girl is less likely to get pregnant before she graduates \nfrom high school, a child is more likely to graduate high school, more \nlikely to go to college, more likely to graduate college, more likely \nto get a good-paying job and pay taxes, and much less likely to go to \nprison. It has been shown over and over that the cost-benefit is, for \nevery $1 spent, like $16 in return.\n  I wanted to get a hearing just on this. Because we were talking about \neducation, I thought this needed to be discussed, and we needed \nexperts, economists who were credible on this. So I went to Barbara  \nand she, of course, said: Oh, yeah. OK. Let's do it. She is Chair of \nthe Subcommittee on Children and Families. I thought that would be a \ngood place to do it, except I am not on that subcommittee. I am on the \nHELP Committee, which this is a subcommittee of, but I am not on that \nsubcommittee. She said: OK, that doesn't matter. You come anyway. And \nnot only that but: What witness do you want?\n  She let me pick a witness, Art Rolnick, an expert in early childhood \neducation--on the economics of it--who started out as an economist at \nthe Federal Reserve in Minneapolis and got into the economic benefits \nof it.\n  She is a true ally. She is someone who used her resources as \nchairwoman of a committee to make sure something you feel strongly \nabout will be aired, will be discussed.\n  You learn from Barbara  that what we do around here is not so much \nabout policy, it is about people. For her, it is about the people of \nMaryland. She goes to bat for them time and time and time again. It is \nabout kids. And it is about women, who often have to be both the \nbreadwinner and the caregiver, and who should have every right and \nevery opportunity at work and in society that men have.\n  As both a Member of the Senate and as a father of a wonderful \ndaughter, I am enormously grateful to Senator Mikulski for being a \ntremendous role model to women in this country, for having fought her \nway to the Senate, and for proving that legislating was not a man's \njob--or only a man's job--it is a man's job too.\n  This body is so much the richer for her, and Americans are so much \nbetter off as a result. But her work, our work is not over. Out of 100 \nSenators, there are still only 17 women. Our Nation is facing \ntremendously difficult challenges, and having more women like Senator \nMikulski in the room will help us solve those problems. I am glad she \nis here leading the way.\n  With that, I would like to thank Barbara  for her leadership, her \nfriendship, and for being such a fierce advocate. Congratulations, \nBarbara, on your achievements thus far and on this milestone. I look \nforward to many years fighting alongside you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise, along with so many colleagues, to \npay tribute to Senator Barbara Mikulski, an extraordinary woman and \nSenator, someone who has become the longest serving woman in the \nhistory of the\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\nSenate, indeed, in the history of the Congress. She surpassed, on \nJanuary 5, 2011, the record of Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith \nas the longest serving Senator. Just this Saturday, she became the \nlongest serving woman in the history of the Congress, surpassing the \ntenure of Edith Nourse Rogers, a Republican Congresswoman from \nMassachusetts, who served in the House from 1925 to 1960.\n  Senator Mikulski is the first female Democrat to be elected to the \nSenate in her own right in 1986. She is a woman of many firsts. She is \nindeed the dean of the Senate women--I would actually say a dean of the \nSenate, with her great energy, her great eloquence, and her great \npassion, particularly for those who are often overlooked in our \nsociety. She comes at it honestly. She was a social worker in \nBaltimore, helping at-risk children and educating seniors about \nMedicare before being elected to the House of Representatives.\n  She has taken that concern for the vulnerable and a particular \npassion for the State of Maryland forward every day she has served in \nthe House and Senate. She has served on numerous committees. She is a \nsubcommittee chairperson on the Appropriations Committee--Commerce-\nJustice-Science. She has devoted herself to those issues, and many \nmore. She serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence and has been a \nkey member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. She has left her mark on a broad range of programs that \ntouch each and every American family. She has been particularly active \nin women's health, ensuring that women were included in NIH clinical \ntrials, where in the past they were ignored.\n  Since one cannot ignore Barbara Mikulski--which is virtually \nimpossible--she made it a reality that they cannot ignore women in NIH \nclinical trials, requiring Federal standards for mammographies, \nensuring uninsured women have access to screenings and treatment for \nbreast and cervical cancer. She increased research dollars for \nAlzheimer's and enhanced the Older Americans Act.\n  She has been, since her first days in the House of Representatives, \nat the forefront in advocating for better health care and education \nparticularly for the most vulnerable among us. She has been a champion \nof national service, understanding that in a great country one has to \ncontribute as well as benefit.\n  She said one of the things she is most proud of--in her words--\n``strengthening the safety net for seniors by passing the Spousal Anti-\nImpoverishment Act. This important legislation helps keep seniors from \ngoing bankrupt while paying for a spouse's nursing home care.''\n  That is a fitting and representative example of her service. \nThroughout her service, she has maintained national priorities but has \nnever taken her eye off Maryland. She commutes every evening back to \nBaltimore. She works hard to ensure that the people in Maryland benefit \nbecause of her activities.\n  I also thank her for the kindness and help she has given me \npersonally--her concern, for example, with the fishing community in \nRhode Island, which is under her jurisdiction on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and in other ways. She has been terribly important and kind \nto us. She was instrumental in helping us to secure funding for the \nHOPE VI project in Newport, RI, which has created extraordinary \nbeneficial housing for a mix of incomes in Newport. It is one of the \nmost attractive as well as one of the most stable communities I think \nanyplace in the Nation. She has been there to help us constantly.\n  I could go on and on, as my colleagues have said. I simply want to \nsay at this special moment in Senator Mikulski's career, we thank her, \nadmire her, respect her, and she has set a great example for us. In the \ndays ahead, she will not only continue to inspire and sustain us, she \nwill continue to sustain and lead in her State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, some time ago, I was reading a book \nabout the beginnings of the interstate highway system in our country. I \ncame across a paragraph when the highway builders and the Federal \nGovernment were going to run the interstate highway through some stable \nmiddle-class, working-class neighborhoods of Baltimore. The highway \nadministration was greeted by an organizer who, on behalf of citizens \nof this neighborhood, said this is not the place to put this highway. \nShe was successful in convincing them that the highway should go \nelsewhere so it would not be disruptive of so many homes, well-\nestablished small businesses, and the cohesive community in that part \nof Baltimore. The woman who led that effort several decades ago was \nBarbara Mikulski. She was not yet on the city council. She was a \ncitizen who spoke for her neighbors and has continued to do that as a \nmember of the city council and then as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and for many years--3\\1/2\\ decades--of the Senate.\n  We heard Senator Reid and others earlier today talk about Senator \nMikulski being the first female Democrat to serve in both the House and \nSenate--to be elected to the Senate without succeeding a husband or a \nfather and first to chair an Appropriations subcommittee. Most \nimportant, she helped to blaze this path. In 1987, there were only two \nfemale Senators. One was the daughter of a Presidential nominee a \ngeneration earlier, and the other was Barbara Mikulski. Today, there \nare 17 female Members of the Senate. It doesn't look like America yet. \nThere is not anything close to the number of minority members as a \npercentage of the population, but I hope that changes. I think it will. \nIt doesn't come close to representing the gender makeup of our society. \nBut to go from 2 female Senators, when she first came, to 17 today--and \nif I can predict elections, which none of us can, and we certainly \ncannot try--I think there is a good chance there will be a number of \nadditional women in this body this time next year.\n  I wish to say a couple more things about Senator Mikulski on a less \nserious note. I have been privileged to serve on two committees with \nSenator Mikulski--one being the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. During the health care legislation, she was so helpful to so \nmany of the causes we care about and to justice in this country, and on \nthe Appropriations Committee, where she cuts a wide swathe of \ninvolvement for Maryland and this country, she champions women's health \nand many talked about this earlier. She cares so much about the \nNational Institutes of Health, not just because it is located in \nMaryland but because it matters so much for scientific research, for \ncuring a whole host of diseases and preventing diseases, and the number \nof jobs NIH creates, not just government jobs but the jobs that come \nout of commercialization of scientific research.\n  My State is one of the leaders; whether the jobs come out of \nCincinnati Children's Hospital, Southwest Hospital, and where Case \nWestern Reserve University is and its medical center around Cleveland, \nwe see that kind commercialization.\n  I often call her Coach B because she is someone who has been around \nhere a long time and is always willing to advise newer and younger \nMembers. She has been following, especially in my State, what is \nimportant, the issue of health care. My State has some of the leading \nhealth care institutions in America. Also, what she has done with the \nspace program--the only NASA facility north of the Mason-Dixon line is \nin Cleveland, with a satellite in Sandusky, NASA Glenn, named after \nformer Senator and astronaut, John Glenn. She has been one of the \nstrongest advocates for the space program, and science, technology, and \nR She has been particularly helpful to me as I fight for the kind of \nwork NASA Glenn does in Cleveland, and I am appreciative of her for \nthat.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Whitehouse pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2219 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\n                  Ohio's College Basketball Excellence\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a new record \nthat has been set. It has nothing to do with the number of votes the \nhighway bill garnered last week in the Senate, and it has nothing to do \nwith length of service of Senator Mikulski.\n  For the first time in history, this year one State has four teams in \nthe Sweet 16 of the NCAA Men's Division I basketball tournament: Ohio.\n  A special congratulations to the Ohio State University, in Columbus; \nthe University of Cincinnati, in Hamilton County; Ohio University, in \nAthens, OH; and Xavier University, also in Cincinnati, for their \noutstanding run so far and making our entire State proud.\n  I am hosting, for the fifth time, an annual Ohio College President's \nConference next week. We bring in 50 to 60 college presidents to meet \nwith each other and with me and we bring in people from the \nadministration, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate Members, \nwho lead on higher education issues. We bring 55 or 60 college \npresidents in from Ohio for a day and a half, and there are public and \nprivate institutions, 2-year community colleges, and 4-year colleges \nand universities. They learn best practices from one another. They \nbuild relationships that help all 55 or 60 of these college Presidents \nto do better.\n  Perhaps, we will talk more about college sports this year because of \nthese four Ohio teams that made the Sweet 16.\n  We also know another point of reference for Ohio this year was that \nMarch Madness started in Dayton, in what has become an important \ntradition to Miami Valley and our country. This weekend, before the \ngames started, Dayton's Oregon District hosted the First Four Festival, \nwhere 15,000 people crowded local restaurants and bars, listened to \nlive music, and watched games on big screens.\n  A few days later, President Obama and British Prime Minister David \nCameron came to the same city where the Dayton peace accords were \nnegotiated and joined the Dayton community and teams from Kentucky, \nMississippi, New York and Utah and their fans to watch the first rounds \nof the NCAA Division I men's tournament at the UD Arena. The UD--\nUniversity of Dayton--Arena now holds the national record for the \nnumber of NCAA basketball tournament games held in a single venue.\n  The business community in Dayton, one of the most active in the \ncountry--the Dayton Development Coalition--rallied together to make \nsure military families from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base were able \nto attend, and $3.5 million was pumped into the local economy, \nshowcasing the Miami Valley's world-class tourism infrastructure of \nhotels, parks, entertainment, and recreation.\n  We saw the same thing later in the week in the Arena District of \nColumbus, where the city hosted games on the opening weekend. Local \nColumbus leaders and businesses hosted teams from St. Louis, North \nCarolina, Michigan, New York, Tennessee, California, and Washington, \nDC, with their fans.\n  The city expected a $10 million impact on the local community, with \ntens of thousands of people staying at hotels, eating in restaurants, \nand enjoying one of the fastest growing cities in America, where, I \nmight add, the Presiding Officer once lived. We saw a boost in tourism \nin northern Ohio, where Bowling Green hosted the first and second \nrounds of the NCAA women's basketball tournament. Organizers in Bowling \nGreen said the games were more than about basketball, it was about \npeople from across the Nation coming to town and boosting the sales of \nsmall businesses.\n  All the excitement and economic activity goes to show that Ohio is a \ntremendous attraction of basketball tourism and basketball talent. As \nthe tournaments continue, and Ohio's teams continue to win, I look \nforward to working with our communities and our business leaders to \nfurther leverage our assets in tourism and recreation to help create \njobs throughout our State and to promote economic development.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmorning business on Thursday, March 22, the Senate resume consideration \nof H.R. 3606; that the time until 12:30 p.m. be equally divided between \nthe two leaders or their designees; that at 12:30 p.m., the postcloture \ntime be considered expired and the Senate proceed to votes on the \nfollowing: Reed No. 1931, Merkley No. 1844, as amended, if amended, and \npassage of H.R. 3606, as amended, if amended; that there be 2 minutes, \nequally divided in the usual form in between the votes; that upon \ndisposition of H.R. 3606, the Senate then proceed to the consideration \nof the House message to accompany S. 2038, the STOCK Act; that there be \n4 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form prior to the \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the \nHouse message to accompany S. 2038; that if cloture is invoked on the \nmotion to concur, that all postcloture time be yielded back, the motion \nto concur with an amendment be withdrawn, and the motion to concur be \nagreed to; that the motions to reconsider relative to the above items \nbe considered made and laid upon the table; and that all after the \nfirst vote be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, by this time next week, the Supreme Court \nwill have finished hearing oral arguments in the case challenging the \nconstitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \nHow important is this Supreme Court case on health care reform? Well, \nhealth care is such an important issue that Congress spent 1 year \ndrafting and debating a bill that the Court is going to consider next \nweek.\n  Health care has been a critical issue for so long in our country that \nin the last century, nine different Presidents have spent time, energy, \nand political capital fighting for reform. It is so important that the \nSupreme Court reserved 6 hours for oral argument over the course of 3 \ndays to consider the act's constitutionality. The last time the Court \ndedicated that kind of time to any one case was in 1966--if I am not \nmistaken, that was 46 years ago--when it considered Miranda v. Arizona. \nNot even the health care case is important enough for the Supreme Court \nto justify breaking its antiquated tradition of allowing cameras to \ntelevise the proceedings, so the American people are not going to have \na chance to see and hear these historic arguments for themselves as \nthey take place.\n  I cannot predict the outcome of the case, but I can tell you what to \nexpect just outside the doors of the Supreme Court. It is a scene we \nhave seen over and over again for decades. Thousands will gather \noutside the Court. Many are going to camp overnight, sleeping on the \nsidewalk in the hopes of getting about 1 of 200 seats available to the \npublic. The vast majority of those wanting to see the Supreme Court \nargument on one of the most important cases of our time will be told: \nNo, you are not allowed to come inside the Court. We don't have room \nfor you. In a democratic society that values transparency and \nparticipation, there cannot be any valid justification for such a \npowerful element of government to operate largely outside the view of \nthe American people.\n  For too long the American people have been prevented from observing \nopen sessions of the Supreme Court. Except for the privileged few, the \nVIPs, the members of the Supreme Court bar or the press, the most \npowerful Court in our land--some might argue in the world--is \ninaccessible to the public and shrouded in mystery.\n  I am pleased to stand in the Judiciary Committee with Senator \nGrassley, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, asking that \nthe Senate pass our bipartisan bill that would require televising open \nSupreme Court proceedings. With the benefit of modern technology, the \nSupreme Court proceedings can be televised using unobtrusive cameras \nand the Court's existing audio recording capability. Our bill respects \nthe constitutional rights of the parties before the Court and respects \nthe discretion of the Justices.\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\nThe Court can decline to televise any proceeding where the Justices \ndetermine by a majority vote that doing so would violate due process \nrights of one or more parties.\n  In our view--Senator Grassley and myself--this is a reasonable \napproach that balances the public's need for information and \ntransparency, the constitutional rights of those before the Court, and \nthe discretion of the Justices.\n  It is no secret that Senator Grassley and I have strong disagreements \nabout the actual law that is going to be considered by the Court. We \nhave taken to the floor many times to explain our positions. Despite \nour disagreement on the substance of the health care bill, Senator \nGrassley and I agree on a bipartisan basis to stand united in full \nsupport of S. 1945, which would finally bring transparency and open \naccess to Supreme Court proceedings.\n  We are not the only Members of this body who believe these \nproceedings would produce greater accountability. In past years the \nCameras in the Courtroom Act enjoyed bipartisan support. The last \nsponsor of the act before he left the Senate was Senator Arlen Specter \nof Pennsylvania. This version of the bill, very similar to his own, has \nthe support of Senators Cornyn, Klobuchar, Schumer, Blumenthal, \nGillibrand, Harkin, and Begich. As Senator Grassley would note, \nDemocrats and Republicans from both Chambers have written to the \nSupreme Court asking it to permit live televised broadcasts of the \nhealth care reform arguments.\n  In November, Senators Blumenthal, Schumer, and I wrote a letter to \nthe Chief Justice making a request to open the Supreme Court for this \nhistoric argument and let America hear the arguments made before the \nCourt and the questions asked by the Justices in open court. Chief \nJustice Roberts responded to our request last week, and it sounds as \nthough he sent the same letter to Senator Grassley. The Chief Justice \ninformed us that the Supreme Court has respectfully declined to \ntelevise the health care arguments, but that the Court would graciously \noffer an alternative.\n  Here is the alternative: The Court will post the audio recordings and \nunofficial transcripts to the Court's Web site a few hours after the \narguments are over. For that gesture, I guess we can congratulate the \nU.S. Supreme Court for entering the radio age. America entered the \nradio age 90 years ago. The Supreme Court is catching up with a delayed \nbroadcast-audio only. But I think America deserves better.\n  Decisions that affect our Nation should be accessible by the people \nwho are affected by those decisions and they should be produced in a \nway that Americans can both see and hear. The day of the fireside chat \nis gone. The day of radio transmissions exclusively is gone. \nTelevision--and increasingly even the Internet--is the dominant medium \nfor communicating messages and ideas in modern America. It is not too \nmuch to ask the third branch of government at the highest level to \nshare the arguments before the Court with the people of America. \nUnderstand, there will be hundreds of people present and watching this \nas it occurs. It is not confidential or private. It is only kept away \nfrom the rest of America because this Court doesn't want America to see \nthe proceedings.\n  The Supreme Court is an elite institution in our government. Every \nmember of the Supreme Court went to one of two Ivy league law schools. \nMost of the clerks before the Court come from one of seven law schools. \nNone of the current Justices has run for public office. None of the \ncurrent Justices has tried a death penalty case. And the lawyers who \nappear before the Supreme Court are part of a small and exclusive club. \nPerhaps this limited exposure is why many on the Court don't seem to \nfully appreciate the impact its decisions have on everyday America, and \nwhy the American people deserve to have more access to the Court's \npublic proceedings. Since the Supreme Court is the final word on \nconstitutionality, on issues that impact the lives of every American, \nthe American people should have full and free access to its open \nproceedings on television.\n\n  Let's be clear about one thing: Our bill only applies to court \nsessions that are already open to the public. Supreme Court Justices \nshould be able to consult with each other, review cases, and deliberate \nprivately. No one in this bill, or otherwise, is calling for those \nprivate deliberations to be televised. I believe that televising \nprivate deliberations or closed sessions of the Court would cause harm \nto our judicial system. Our bill does not require that and I would not \nsupport that. Open sessions of the Court, however, where members of the \npublic are already invited to observe are a different matter. They \nshould be televised in real time and widely available.\n  Some who oppose our bill say that the elite cadre of seasoned lawyers \nwith the rare opportunity to argue before the highest Court in the land \nwill grandstand in front of the cameras, risking their professional \nreputations and even their clients' cases. Some say that the Court's \nJustices, who have been subjected to the most rigorous vetting process \nknown to man and the most widely covered confirmation hearings, will \nshrink from the camera's glaring lens. I don't buy it. The experience \nof the State and Federal courts that have allowed the open proceedings \nto be televised proves these fears are unfounded.\n  While the Federal courts of appeals have not permitted cameras to \nbroadcast all appellate proceedings, there was a 3-year pilot project \nin 1990 that assessed the impact of cameras in the Federal courts. \nListen to what happened as a result of the pilot program. At the end of \nthe day 19 of the 20 judges most involved concluded that the presence \nof cameras in the Federal courts ``had no effect on the administration \nof justice.''\n  Don't take my word for it. Kenneth Starr, former Solicitor General \nand independent counsel, supports our bill and said this:\n\n       This fear seems groundless . . . The idea that cameras \n     would transform the [Supreme Court] into ``Judge Judy'' is \n     ludicrous.\n\n  For more than 30 years State courts have broadcast their proceedings \nand, in fact, what they found hasn't detracted at all from the pursuit \nof justice. Every State in our Nation permits all or part of the \nappellate court proceedings to be recorded for broadcast on television \nor streaming on the Internet. Expanding access to the Supreme Court by \ntelevising its proceedings should not be controversial. Public scrutiny \nof the Supreme Court proceedings produces greater accountability, \ntransparency, understanding, and access to the decision-making in \ngovernment. Congressional debates have been fully televised for more \nthan three decades.\n  There are people who follow the C SPAN broadcast religiously. I know. \nI meet them regularly. As I said in the Judiciary Committee, people \nwill come up to me and say: One of your colleagues looks a little bit \nunder the weather. Does he have the flu? Is he sick? By observing C \nSPAN or following the floor of the Senate and knowing each of us, they \nthink on a more personal basis. They hear these statements, they listen \nto the debates, and they feel better informed about their government. \nWouldn't the same apply across the street in the Supreme Court?\n  Opponents of our bill say the public will be misinformed because all \nthey see are brief clips of the Court's proceedings that could be \nmisconstrued. As I said, this argument sounds a lot like an editorial \nfrom a few years ago, and it said:\n\n       Keeping cameras out [of the Supreme Court] to prevent \n     people from getting the wrong idea is a little like removing \n     the paintings from an art museum out of fear that visitors \n     might not have the art history background to appreciate them.\n\n  In 1986, Chief Justice Burger wrote the following words in the \nSupreme Court's Press-Enterprise Company v. Superior Court opinion. \nThese words are as true today as they were in 1986:\n\n       [P]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility \n     from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to \n     accept what they are prohibited from observing.\n\n  The time has long since come for the Supreme Court--for the highest \nCourt in our land--to open its doors and allow the American people to \nfinally observe its proceedings.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1945\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this point I wish to make a unanimous \nconsent request relative to this bill that would open the Supreme Court \nproceedings to be televised.\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 319, S. 1945, a bill to permit the televising of Supreme \nCourt proceedings; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \ncongratulate my colleague Senator Durbin for his able articulation of \nhis view. This is a matter that the Senate and the Congress has \nconsidered for quite a number of years. It has not decided to take this \nstep to direct a coequal branch of government on how to conduct their \nbusiness, and I don't think we should. So I think it would be \ninappropriate to pass this on a UC without a full debate and discussion \nand a full vote on it.\n  So I would say that.\n  Also, I would note the Justices have opposed this policy. I think we \nhave a duty to respect the coequal branch of our government. They feel \nas though it would impact adversely the tenor and tone of the oral \narguments. The Justices would also have to feel a burden and explain \nwhy they are asking a question, perhaps citing a case by name that all \nthe lawyers would know but having to explain to nonlawyers now what is \non their minds as a part of their process of questioning. So I think \nthat is a factor.\n  I would also note it raises constitutional questions. Why would we \nwant to push to the limit and perhaps push over the limit and try to \ndictate to a coequal branch how to conduct the adjudicative process? \nNot the political process; we are the political branch. Theirs is the \nnonpolitical branch, where Justices are given lifetime tenure so as to \ninsulate them from pressure and to allow them to dispassionately decide \ncomplex issues. I would also note that in terms of what is said and how \nan argument goes, there is no difference, I suppose, between that and \nwhat goes on in chambers when the Justices meet in private and talk \nabout what issues are before the Court and how they should be decided.\n  What is important in the adjudicative branch? What is the criteria \nand the fundamental essence of a judicial proceeding? Ultimately, it is \nthe judgment. The judgment speaks. The arguments don't speak. The in \ncamera discussions don't speak. The judgment itself represents the \nopinion of the Court. It is the law and the defining process.\n  I appreciate very much the work of my esteemed colleague. I know he \nloves the law; we both do. He believes this would improve justice in \nAmerica. I can't conclude that to be correct. I believe Justices should \nbe given the responsibility to conduct their branch consistent with \ntheir best judgment of how do to it. Therefore, I object. I thank and \nrespect my colleague for his different opinion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 247, S. 671; \nthat the committee-reported amendment to S. 671 be agreed to, and the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding the \nJudiciary Committee staff has been working on a package of important \nJudiciary Committee bills, including the very bill Senator Sessions has \nasked unanimous consent to move to--a bill which I quite likely will \nsupport.\n  Would the Senator be willing to modify his request to include the \npassage of other bills which are part of that package and have \nsimilarly important elements to them in terms of keeping America safe? \nThey include the following: Calendar No. 246, S. 1792, the \nStrengthening Investigations of Sex Offenders and Missing Children Act; \nCalendar No. 233, S. 1793, the Investigative Assistance for Violent \nCrimes Act; and discharging the Judiciary Committee from further \nconsideration of S. 1696, the Dale Long Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits Improvements Act; agreeing to a substitute amendment which is \nat the desk, and passing the bill, as amended?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the suggestion by the \nSenator from Illinois, as I believe I will be able to support all those \nbills, but I have information that Senators on our side oppose or have \nobjections to two of them and would like to offer amendments or modify \nthem. So I am not able to agree on behalf of colleagues that all the \nbills would be passed as written.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, until the time comes--and I hope it is \nsoon--when we can reach an agreement on all four bills, I will object \nto moving one bill in the package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would note that the Presiding Officer \nis a cosponsor with myself of S. 1792, the Strengthening Investigations \nof Sex Offenders and Missing Children Act of 2011, and perhaps we will \nbe able to make that work sooner or later. I am sure we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1921-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

He was the premier sports writer in the United \nStates of America, covered every Super Bowl, every Masters, was at \nevery major heavyweight fight.\n  From the day he started on his Royal manual typewriter until the day \nhe died, he typed on that same manual typewriter that was over 60 years \nold. He was a brilliant writer, a compassionate individual, a great \nfriend, and someone I looked up to very much. He was a pacesetter. He \nactually got the only interview of Shoeless Joe Jackson ever done by a \nreporter. He did it because of his cunning ability to be in the right \nplace at the right time, and that twinkle in his eye that always made \nyou want to take to Furman Bisher.\n  So as on the floor of the Senate today I pay tribute to Furman and \nhis life, to all of his accomplishments in terms of the writing of \nsports in our State and around the world. To his family and loved ones, \nI extend my sympathy on behalf of not just myself but all of the \ncitizens of Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1921-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1921-S1922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRISH E3 VISA BILL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon I had the honor of \nattending the annual Speaker's Luncheon celebrating the long and \nenduring partnership between the Irish and American people. Among the \nguests of honor were the President and Vice President and Irish Prime \nMinister Enda Kenny. And this past Saturday, St. Patrick's Day, I \njoined Prime Minister Kenny, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn and Chicago \nMayor Rahm Emmanuel to march in Chicago's annual St. Patrick's Day \nparade. As one of the 40 million Americans of Irish descent, the chance \nto celebrate St. Patrick's Day with the Prime Minister of Ireland twice \nin 4 days is a rare joy.\n  At the parade on Saturday, Prime Minister Kenny hailed Chicago as \n``the most American of American cities.'' It is also the most Irish of \nAmerican cities, home to the largest population of Irish-Americans in \nthe United States. On St. Patrick's Day in Chicago, the river and the \nbeer both run green and it seems that everyone is Irish either by \nheritage or simply by osmosis.\n  There is good reason that Americans of all backgrounds embrace St. \nPatrick's Day with such enthusiasm. From our earliest days as a nation, \nAmerica and Ireland and America have been united by unbreakable bonds \nof friendship and family and by a shared commitment to liberty and \nfreedom.\n  In fact, there might not be a United States of America were it not \nfor the Irish. That is not just my opinion. That was the assessment of \nGeneral George Washington and of Britain's Lord\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\nMountjoy, who, in a speech to Parliament declared plainly, ``We have \nlost America through the Irish.''\n  The largest ethnic group to sign the Declaration of Independence were \nthose with Irish roots, Charles Dunlop of County Tyrone printed the \nfirst copies, and the first man to read it before Congress was Charles \nThomson of Derry, Secretary of the Continental Congress. When the \nContinental Congress was in desperate need of finances, supporters in \nDublin, Cork, and other Irish cities took up collections to help the \nstruggling new nation. Irish-born generals ranked among Washington's \nmost trusted officers and Irish soldiers formed the backbone of \nWashington's army. At Valley Forge, it is estimated that almost half \nthe army was Irish.\n  In the more than 2 centuries since then, America has been enriched \nimmeasurably by the contributions of the Irish and Irish-Americans in \nevery field and every walk of life.\n  Twenty American Presidents--nearly half--can trace their lineage to \nIreland, from George Washington to Barack Obama of the Kearneys of \nMoneygall. And the contributions go both ways. Just as the sons of Erin \nhelped make George Washington America's first President, it was a son \nof America, Brooklyn-born Eamonn deValera, who, in 1921, became the \nfirst president of a free Ireland.\n  In December, Senators Schumer, Leahy and I introduced an amendment \nthat recognizes the special relationship between the United States and \nIreland. Our Irish E3 visa amendment would allow a small number of \nIrish citizens--10,500 a year--to work in America for 2 years, pay \ntaxes and contribute to Social Security.\n  Our proposal is an amendment to the Fairness for High-Skilled \nImmigrants Act, which passed the House last November with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. Shortly after we introduced our amendment, my \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Kirk, and Senator Brown of \nMassachusetts introduced a similar measure.\n  Our proposal is a common-sense measure that would improve the \nfairness and efficiency of our immigration system and further \nstrengthen America's special relationship with Ireland, a nation to \nwhich we owe so much.\n  Our proposal has the support of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the \nIrish Lobby for Immigration Reform, Chicago Celts for Immigration \nReform headed by my friend Billy Lawless of Chicago, and many other \norganizations.\n  All 53 Democratic Senators--a solid majority of this Senate--have \nalso pledged their support for our proposal. Despite this broad support \ninside and outside of Congress, at this time there is an objection on \nthe Republican side to passing our bill.\n  We want to work with our Republican colleagues to break this impasse \nand create the Irish E3 visas this year. As Prime Minister Kenny has \nsaid, Ireland's economy will recover from its current difficulties. But \nwith Irish emigration higher than it has been in decades, it is in the \ninterests of both Ireland and America that we act now, without delay, \nto create a fair and legal way for Irish citizens to work temporarily \nin America.\n  Twenty-nine years ago, Speaker Tip O'Neill hosted the first St. \nPatrick's Day luncheon in Congress. His special guest at that first \nSpeaker's St. Patrick's Day Luncheon was another Irish American leader \nwho said, when he visited Ireland, ``Today I come back to you as a \ndescendant of people who were buried here in pauper's graves.''\n  That special guest was President Ronald Reagan and that first \nSpeaker's Luncheon was arranged to try to ease tensions between the two \nleaders, who embodied very different political traditions, but who \nshared a love of Ireland and of their Irish heritage.\n  The plan worked. While Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill never did see \neye-to-eye on politics, they formed a respectful relationship that \nenabled them to work together in America's interest. So I ask our \nRepublican friends: Let us walk in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan and \nTip O'Neill and work together to pass the Irish E3 visa bill this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1922-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1922-S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     60TH NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Pryor and myself, I \nask unanimous consent that the transcript of the 60th Annual National \nPrayer Breakfast be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Mark Pryor: Good morning. Thank you all for being \n     here. It's great to have you here. I want to thank all of you \n     for making your way to this very special event in the life of \n     our country and our world. We invited you, and you came, and \n     we appreciate it. When I say ``we'' I mean co-chair Jeff \n     Sessions of Alabama and many of the members of the U.S. \n     Congress who are the real life hosts of this breakfast this \n     morning. On behalf of all of us, the House and the Senate \n     members, we certainly want to say thank you for joining us \n     here this morning and thank you for praying and for building \n     friendships and to try to make this a better world.\n       Senator Jeff Sessions: As with all our Prayer Breakfasts \n     over the last six decades, we are gathering in the Spirit of \n     Jesus of Nazareth. He was open, curious, compassionate, \n     inclusive and humble--a good example for all of us in public \n     life and for all of us living anywhere for that matter. He \n     was loving, in a word, and that is the way to describe the \n     spirit in which we attempt to gather in today.\n       Senator Pryor: Let us just join together in the spirit of \n     reverent prayer: God of the universe and of each and every \n     one of us, we welcome your presence, your truth and your love \n     to our event. Bless us we pray with the change of heart and \n     change of mind we all need today. We love you and we want to \n     draw near to you this morning.\n       Senator Sessions: In the spirit of love, I pray that \n     everything we do and say from this head table and from around \n     each table would be pleasing to you. Thank you for the good \n     food and fellowship we enjoy at this breakfast and may your \n     Spirit fill this great hall, Amen.\n       Mark and I and many, many others have been working on, and \n     praying for, this remarkable breakfast for months now and we \n     are all excited to share it with you. I think we have all had \n     two different experiences of what can happen when we bring \n     faith into the world of government and business. Sometimes it \n     creates conflict and when we look at our planet's history, \n     even wars. But at other times, more often really, true faith \n     can be a reconciling force of amazing power, a power that can \n     make an entire society better. As Ambassador Andrew Young \n     said last night at the Southeastern dinner, the civil rights \n     movement, the non-violent movement that overcame bigotry and \n     hatred in a way that could not have been done any other way, \n     was done in the Spirit of Jesus.\n       We all have somewhat different religious histories. In my \n     faith walk as I studied the life of Jesus, it seems His \n     approach was always to see the people who are considered to \n     be outsiders, or who had withdrawn, He tried to bring them \n     all in. All those lepers, Samaritans and disabled people and \n     poor people and folks like the woman at the well--they had \n     been pushed out, or had withdrawn, but Jesus brought them in. \n     I think that is the kind of approach we want to embrace in \n     this breakfast and everything that flows out of it. We want \n     to bring everyone in and to be in harmony with God's will and \n     to share in God's love.\n       Senator Pryor: Senators have been meeting in a breakfast \n     group for over six decades now. As friends, we gather to pray \n     every Wednesday when the Senate is in session. To give you a \n     picture of how long that group has been in existence, the \n     Senate breakfast group has met about one time for every \n     person in this room. We come together to pray for each other \n     and work for the Senate and of course for the country. Once a \n     year we invite you all into the fellowship together to pray \n     for world leaders and especially for our President.\n       Some of you have heard that things can be better in \n     Congress and that is true. I think a good place to start \n     would be to remember just a few simple, yet powerful words. \n     Love one another as I have loved you. Forgive and you will be \n     forgiven. Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute \n     you. We don't need a constitutional amendment or some big \n     Congressional reform, we just need to start acting better and \n     Jesus gives us the place to start. It's simple but it's hard. \n     We need to love and pray for people who disagree with us. We \n     hope you will be loving and be praying for us and with us \n     this morning in this special time today and when you return \n     home.\n       I have a letter from a very special friend of ours and he \n     writes to the folks who are attending the National Prayer \n     Breakfast.\n       Letter from Rev. Billy Graham read by Senator Pryor:\n       I want to convey my personal greetings to each of you \n     assembled this morning for the National Prayer Breakfast. I \n     miss being with you all, having been a part of this annual \n     event sponsored by the House and Senate prayer group since \n     the very beginning, often as a speaker. Though age and health \n     prevent me from being there in person, I am with you in \n     spirit and you are in my heart.\n       I want to say a special word of encouragement to the many \n     friends meeting today from across the country and across the \n     world, especially President Obama and his wife Michelle and \n     Vice President Joseph\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\n     Biden and his wife Jill for whom I pray every day as the \n     Scriptures command us to do. The National Prayer Breakfast is \n     one of the most amazing gatherings as people from most of the \n     nations of the world, representing every race, color, creed, \n     religion and political affiliation, or none, come together in \n     the name of Jesus to focus on his teachings and follow his \n     example of how to live and love each other.\n       Throughout my ministry spanning more than 60 years, I have \n     tried to lift up the name of Jesus to audiences and \n     individuals in many of the countries you represent today \n     against the backdrop of polarization in our nation this \n     election year and the tensions across the globe due to war, \n     disease, poverty and other problems. I pray that foundation \n     of unity you embody around the person of Jesus may be an \n     example to the world and a catalyst for peace, freedom and \n     reconciliation as each of us discovers in our own hearts the \n     love and forgiveness He offers to those who seek and turn to \n     him in repentance and faith. May God richly bless your time \n     of fellowship and inspiration this morning. And may the Lord \n     give each of you a special sense of the Spirit as you pray \n     together and pray in Jesus' name, signed Billy Graham.\n       Senator Sessions: Jesus said that if we had faith as small \n     as a mustard seed, we could move mountains. We experience a \n     similar miracle when we hear the size of the voice that comes \n     out of the relatively small body of our singer, Jackie \n     Evancho. She is eleven. God has given her an extraordinary \n     gift and we are thrilled she is here to share it with us. \n     Please welcome Jackie Evancho.\n       Song ``To Believe'', sung by Miss Jackie Evancho\n       Senator Pryor: Wow, thank you Jackie. That was phenomenal. \n     Thank you so much. We have quite the head table here. We have \n     the runner up to America's Got Talent, the winner of the \n     Heisman Trophy, the winner of the Nobel Prize and the most \n     powerful woman in American history, so thank you all for \n     being here.\n       Senator Sessions: Pretty impressive but when we come before \n     God, all the fancy titles are brought down and the humble \n     regular people are raised up. We are all equally of value \n     before our Creator. Allow me to introduce some of our \n     presenters who will come to the podium when their turn \n     arises. As a Senator representing the national champion \n     Alabama--I never get tired of slipping that in--I get to \n     introduce the football player. We are proud to have a Baylor \n     Bear with us, Mr. Robert Griffin III, RG3, the winner of the \n     2011 Heisman Trophy. He excelled at finishing drives and \n     games so we have asked him to do our closing prayer.\n       We always honor our nation's military each year by asking \n     one of their own to be a part of the program. Today we are \n     proud to have Colonel Kelly Martin, an active duty Air Force \n     officer who serves in the operations directorate of the Joint \n     Staff at the Pentagon. During her career as a pilot, she did \n     countless in-flight refueling, so she knows a thing or two \n     about prayer. She will lead us in a prayer for American \n     national leaders.\n       Next is Congressman and Dr. Paul Broun from Georgia. Both \n     he and Congressman McIntyre lead the House breakfast group. \n     Every ship has an anchor and in our Senate breakfast prayer \n     group, Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii has been our anchor for \n     many years. We are going to miss him when he retires. We have \n     asked him to say our prayer for world leaders. I have not \n     known anyone, from Alabama or elsewhere, who has better lived \n     their life in the Spirit of Jesus than has Danny Akaka. \n     Danny, thank you for all you do to make the Senate and our \n     government and nation a better place.\n       We are also joined by our colleague, Dr. Tom Coburn who \n     passionately represents the people of Oklahoma and the \n     Senate. He will give us a reading from the Scriptures. If you \n     know Tom, you know that his faith impacts his life, and we \n     all know that. Next, I have the honor and privilege of \n     introducing my wife, Mrs. Mary Sessions, my partner for 42 \n     years who has enabled me to be able to serve, and has \n     provided us with three children and five grandchildren.\n       We are very grateful once again to welcome the First Lady \n     of the United States, Michelle Obama. None of us can even \n     imagine the burdens that you carry as the spouse and the \n     leader of our nation. We thank you and pray for you and honor \n     your work on the behalf of the health of our nation's \n     children and all Americans.\n       Senator Pryor: Mr. President, did you hear the little thing \n     about the national championship? This year it was Alabama, \n     last year it was Auburn, it never stops. You see what I have \n     to put up with?\n       What most people don't fully realize is that the government \n     is a team sport. We are all thankful to have our tireless and \n     passionate Vice President running all over the country and \n     all over the world to accomplish our country's most important \n     work, Vice President Joe Biden.\n       The next person I want to introduce is my wife, Jill Pryor, \n     the best person in the world.\n       You have already met Jackie Evancho. She is going to sing \n     one more song in a few minutes but I think after that she has \n     to leave here and go study for a spelling test. Sitting next \n     to her is her mother, the proudest mother in the room, Mrs. \n     Lisa Evancho. Thank you both for being here.\n       Shortly we are going to hear a greeting from our \n     counterparts who lead the House prayer breakfast group. They \n     make those of us at the head table feel extra safe because \n     one is a doctor and the other is a black belt in Tae Kwando. \n     One kind of tears you up and one tears you down, namely \n     Congressman MacIntyre of North Carolina and Congressman Broun \n     of Georgia. Thank you for being here.\n       One of the people in the room who needs no introduction is \n     Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. We thank her for her inspiring \n     service to the country and her support for the prayer \n     breakfast over the years. We look forward to the Scripture \n     that she is about to read. Madam Leader.\n       Representative Nancy Pelosi: Thank you very much to Senator \n     Pryor for the invitation to read from the Holy Scriptures \n     this morning. Let us all be grateful for the fellowship that \n     brings us all together with our President of the United \n     States and the First Lady, the Vice President--who said after \n     Jackie finished singing, ``now I know how the angels sound, \n     so beautiful''--the fellowship that brings us together as \n     colleagues, our international guests and of course most of \n     all our men and women in uniform who give us the opportunity \n     to exercise freely our faith.\n       I am honored for the opportunity to read from the Holy \n     Scriptures, from the Old Testament. When I was asked by \n     Senator Pryor to do so, I went right to Solomon. We all know \n     over the ages that King Solomon has been recognized for his \n     great wisdom, but it is really important to note that his \n     wisdom sprang from humility, and that must be our prayer. \n     Solomon's prayer is heralded in at least two books of the \n     Bible, the Second Book of Chronicles and the First Book of \n     Kings. A reading from the First Book of Kings:\n       God appeared to Solomon in a dream during the night. God \n     said, ``ask what you would like me to give to you.'' Solomon \n     replied, ``You showed most faithful love to your servant \n     David, my father. When he lived his life before you in \n     faithfulness and uprightness and in integrity of heart, you \n     have continued this most faithful love to him by allowing his \n     son to sit on the throne today. Now my God, you have made me \n     your servant king in succession to David, my father.\n       ``But I am a very young man, unskilled in leadership and \n     here is your servant surrounded by your people whom you have \n     chosen, of people so numerous that its number cannot be \n     counted or reckoned.'' So Solomon said, ``give your servant a \n     heart to understand how to govern your people, how to discern \n     between good and evil, for how could one otherwise govern \n     such a great people as yours?'' It pleased God that Solomon \n     should have asked for this. ``Since you have asked for \n     this,'' God said, ``and not asked for long life for yourself \n     or riches or vengeance upon your enemies, but have asked for \n     discerning judgment for yourself here and now, I do what you \n     ask. I give you wisdom and understanding as no one has ever \n     had before and no one will have after you.'' The whole world \n     sought audience with Solomon to know the wisdom God had put \n     in his heart.\n       May our message from this reading be that we have the \n     humility to ask God for what pleases him so that we can do \n     his work. Amen.\n       Representative Paul Broun: Good morning. I am Dr. Paul \n     Broun. I am a physician and a Representative from the 10th \n     Congressional District in Georgia, and a Republican. And this \n     is my friend, Mike McIntyre. As Senator Pryor just told you, \n     he is a black belt so I am going to be careful with what I am \n     going to say about him. He is a Democrat, a blue dog \n     Democrat, who represents North Carolina.\n       I am also a member of the Gideons, so if you didn't have a \n     Bible in your hotel room, please let me know and we will be \n     sure to get you one. In fact, I am a Gideon because it was a \n     Gideon Bible that led me to the Lord. I accepted Him as my \n     Lord and Savior some time ago. We thank you for coming to the \n     breakfast today, especially our honored guests from all \n     around the world. We are up here to bring greetings from our \n     weekly Congressional House breakfast group and to give you a \n     bit of a sense of what goes on there.\n       We pray, we study the Scriptures, we share our family \n     struggles and needs and our personal needs. We even try to \n     sing sometimes. We call it the best hour of the week because \n     it absolutely is. It is where Democrats and Republicans can \n     come together, put politics aside, put partisanship aside. \n     And we are just personal friends, brothers and sisters in \n     Christ. And we worship our God together.\n       Over 25 years ago Jesus Christ changed my life when I \n     accepted him as my personal Lord and Savior. He gave me not \n     only a personal peace but he gave me a purpose in my life to \n     serve him and to live for him. There is no rule that says I \n     have to check my faith when I go through the doors of the \n     House chambers. I could not do that if I wanted to. I am \n     always eager to talk about what God has done for me and in my \n     life and how he has changed me, how he saved me and made me a \n     child of God. I am thankful for our House group. The people \n     who founded the United States were people who prayed, they \n     knew the Scriptures. It is good for the whole nation to \n     follow their example in honoring the God that created each \n     and every one of us and his Son who died for us all.\n       Representative Mike McIntyre: Thank you Paul. I am Mike \n     McIntyre. Serving in Congress is a great privilege but it is \n     also a tremendous challenge. I am very thankful that I get to \n     meet with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come \n     together in our breakfast group where we can share heart to \n     heart.\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\n       Washington, D.C. usually focuses just on the surface, on \n     the labels and where you come from and who you are supposed \n     to be identified with. Our weekly group allows us to go \n     deeper and to build friendships. I also want to tell you \n     about a new tradition. During the first vote of each week on \n     Monday or Tuesday night, depending on when we go into \n     session, several House members step across the hall in room \n     219 and leave labels at the door and pray like Solomon of the \n     Old Testament for wisdom for that week so that we will make \n     the right decisions.\n       When I am back in my district, I often have people come up \n     to me and express concerns or complain about Washington, D.C. \n     Can you imagine that? They will go on for 30 minutes and \n     usually after I have listened carefully to all that they are \n     saying, I will say: ``Would you pray for us that we will make \n     the right decisions; if it's that important to you or to your \n     family or to your business or to your school or our country, \n     would you take the time to pray for us that we will make the \n     right decision?'' I have never had anybody refuse to do that \n     when I have asked them. Like Nehemiah in the Old Testament, \n     we want to build a wall of prayer around our nation's \n     capital. You can put a stone or a brick in that wall of \n     prayer if you would take five minutes each week to join us in \n     prayer, and you could choose the time. If you go to the \n     Congressional Prayer Caucus' website and say, ``You know \n     what, Mike, I will pray for you and for our President and all \n     our leaders at all levels of government.'' It is that \n     important. Because you see, the true source of power is not \n     found in the halls of Congress or in the Oval Office of the \n     West Wing or in the chambers of the Supreme Court. It is \n     found when we are on our knees before the throne of grace, \n     before all mighty God asking for his help. Would you please \n     join us in that effort? That is something you can do that \n     would go beyond today. I think you will agree that our \n     country is worth it. God bless you all and thank you very \n     much.\n       Colonel Kelly Martin, U.S.A.F.: Please join me now in a \n     prayer for our national leaders. Lord, it is with a humble \n     heart that we come before you today and ask for a special \n     measure of grace and wisdom to be given to the men and women \n     who lead our nation. For you know that it is the fear of the \n     Lord that is the beginning of wisdom and understanding. And \n     it is by your grace and love that you arm us with the \n     strength and guide our steps towards what is perfect. \n     Leadership is not easy and good leadership is rare and of \n     great value, but great leadership comes only from you. \n     Throughout our nation's history, you have blessed us with a \n     legacy of leaders who served with excellence and we are \n     grateful that this blessing continues today. Thank you for \n     each and every one of our leaders and their willingness to \n     serve our nation, its' people, and, ultimately, to serve you. \n     I ask that in the heat of battle, you give our leaders \n     clarity of mind and the courage to make right decisions \n     especially when it is not convenient or expedient. Give them \n     the faith to always seek you, a hope that will always sustain \n     them and, most importantly, give them a love that will unite \n     them. We ask that you bless our leaders, protect and watch \n     over them, give them a peace that passes understanding; bless \n     their families and continue to bless the United States of \n     America. I pray this in your Son's name, amen.\n       Senator Tom Coburn: Good morning. I have the privilege of \n     reading from the New Testament Scriptures. The passage that I \n     want to read today has to do with the most powerful force the \n     world has ever known, love. In this room, we have people from \n     well over 100 different countries, all colors, all aspects of \n     faith and maybe from a few different points of view.\n       Jesus said to him, ``you shall love the Lord your God with \n     all your heart, with all your soul and with all your mind.'' \n     This is the first and the greatest commandment and the second \n     is like it, that you should love your neighbor as yourself. \n     On these two commandments hang the law and the prophets. A \n     new commandment I give to you that you love one another as I \n     have loved you, that you also love one another. This is my \n     commandment to you that you love one another as I have loved \n     you, greater love has no one than this than to lay down ones \n     life for his friends.\n       The power of love is manifested in the subtleness and the \n     happiness of our heart because as we give love and \n     sacrificial love, that is the only way, our lives are truly \n     fulfilled, by giving away our life. We have great examples of \n     that in our military, in our leaders as they sacrifice their \n     life and time and families, but the fact is, we are commanded \n     to do that. May God bless the reading of his Word.\n       Senator Daniel Akaka: Let me add my aloha and welcome to \n     all of you gathered here at the 60th National Prayer \n     Breakfast. Let us pray. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, \n     heaven and earth are filled with your glory. We come to you \n     to pray for world leaders. Give them your wisdom to deal with \n     the challenging problems of our time; may your Spirit rest \n     upon them as they seek to empower people to lead quiet and \n     peaceful lives in all Godliness and honesty. Send out your \n     light and lead our world leaders with your truth. Bring them \n     through strife and warfare to lasting peace, uniting them for \n     the glory of your name. As they put aside selfish ambition, \n     make them instruments of your will to carry out your purposes \n     in our world. We pray this in your sovereign name, amen.\n       Senator Pryor: When we take the long view of history, it is \n     pretty clear that ideas are more powerful than money or guns \n     or even governments. So if we follow that logic, ideas about \n     God would be the most powerful of all. One of the most \n     precious resources of the community of faith are those women \n     and men who help us think deeply and clearly about God, about \n     truth and about responsibility. Eric Metaxas has been a \n     friend of this breakfast for many years, so let that be a \n     warning to all of you, if you come too often, we may ask you \n     to speak. He has written two New York Times best sellers, 30 \n     children's books, has been part of the Veggie Tale series, \n     and he has also debated the existence of God in academic \n     settings all over the world. I first became aware of him \n     through his book, ``Amazing Grace,'' about William \n     Wilberforce whose life makes a great guide book for anyone \n     who is serving in government. I just finished another book of \n     his, about another great public role model, ``Dietrich \n     Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy''. Ladies and \n     gentlemen, Eric Metaxas.\n       Mr. Eric Metaxas: Good morning to all of you, honored \n     guests from around the world, from this great nation, mostly \n     to our President and First Lady. What an honor to be here. \n     Now, I have to ask, I want to know how many people are here \n     if you don't mind, just indulge me, would you raise your hand \n     if you are here and I just want to get a quick . . . okay, \n     well that was four. All right, well they said four thousand.\n       Let me just say up front, I am not a morning person but it \n     is nonetheless an honor to speak at this august \n     extraordinarily early gathering. I know it is an august \n     gathering because they charged 175 dollars for breakfast. I \n     don't want to start out by being negative but I think there \n     may be some kind of money laundering thing kind of happening \n     here. I am speaking truth to power people, the price gauging, \n     it needs to stop. Even as a member of the elite one per cent, \n     I cannot afford this.\n       We joke, but I know who puts this event on. They are a \n     highly secret, indeed a nefarious organization. They call \n     themselves ``the family.'' You see, the family not only runs \n     this event, they run everything that is happening in the \n     world. We, and of course I mean the President and I most \n     specifically, are all their puppets. The President knows what \n     I mean. He cannot admit this publicly, obviously, but \n     appearing here this morning we are simply doing their \n     bidding. Every U.S. President has been elected by them except \n     for Warren G. Harding. No one knows how Warren Harding was \n     able to buck that trend but we know that he paid dearly for \n     it, most notably by being saddled with the name Warren G. \n     Harding.\n       I am not a politician so when I see a dais like this, I \n     immediately think of those wonderful Dean Martin roasts from \n     the 70's. That was my favorite show next to Sanford and Son. \n     I am being honest with you now and forgive me if I pretend \n     that I am up here with Ruth Buzzi, Bob Hope, Jimmy Stewart, \n     Red Buttons, Charlie Callas, Foster Brooks and Rich Little. I \n     am being honest, that is who I wish were up here. And to \n     those of you who are actually up here, I apologize from the \n     bottom of Don Rickles' heart, I am sorry.\n       Okay, it is a National Prayer Breakfast, maybe we should \n     get serious and say something about prayer . . . nah. Okay, \n     seriously though, what is prayer? The real question is what \n     is prayer? Prayer is real faith in God, it is not phony \n     religiosity. It is not, `oh wouldst thou who art sovereign of \n     the universe take this arcane verbiage as evidence that we \n     believe that thou art an old fashioned and unpleasant and \n     easily annoyed and even cranky deity, and that to get thy \n     magnificent attention and so as not to annoy thee, we must \n     needs employ wooden and archaic and religious sounding \n     language.'\n       That, my friends, is not prayer. That is, to use the \n     current terminology, a lot of pious baloney. Who said that, I \n     believe it was Nancy Pelosi? It was someone on the couch, but \n     I can't remember. But the point is, pious baloney is not \n     prayer, it is not faith in the God of Scripture. Imagine \n     talking to Jesus that way--he would almost laugh at you. \n     Imagine if we talked to him that way. Prayer is from the \n     heart. We don't try to fool God with phony religiosity. Adam \n     and Eve tried that with a fig leaf once that did not go so \n     well.\n       And this gets to my theme this morning--the difference \n     between religion or religiosity and real faith in God. We all \n     know people who go to church but who do not show the love of \n     Jesus. We know people who know Scripture but sometimes use it \n     as a weapon. Real prayer and real faith is not religious, it \n     is from the heart. It is honest, it is real. I have had the \n     privilege of writing about two men, Wilberforce and \n     Bonhoeffer, whose lives illustrate the difference between \n     what mere religiosity and actually knowing what serving God \n     is. Let me first quickly tell you personally how I came to \n     see the difference between these two utterly different \n     things.\n       First of all, I am the son of European immigrants who met \n     in an English class in New York City in 1956. And I thank the \n     Lord that my parents are in the room this morning. My dad is \n     Greek, hence my surname, Metaxas. My mom is German, hence my \n     deep love for Siegfried and Roy. Now, when you have one Greek \n     parent, you are raised Greek, forget about the German stuff. \n     Greeks believe that being Greek is the most important thing \n     in the world. Now I am 50 per cent Greek but I have always \n     tried to be more than 50 per cent Greek but I have never been \n     able to break the fifty per cent barrier, a little bit like \n     brother Mitt.\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\n       I grew up of course in the Greek Orthodox Church. I was an \n     altar boy and had a modicum of faith, a mostly nominal, \n     cultural faith. I thought of myself as a Christian but then I \n     went to Yale University. Of course, it is the dream come true \n     for every son of working class European immigrants. But the \n     reality is that Yale, and most of our other universities but \n     especially Yale, is a very secular place, aggressively \n     secular. What little modicum of faith I had was seriously \n     challenged. The idea of God really is ignored or even sneered \n     at. By the time I graduated I was quite sure that it was \n     wrong to be serious about the Bible or to take Jesus \n     seriously, that it was hopelessly parochial and divisive. I \n     was not sure what was supposed to replace it but I was \n     confused. I guess I was lost. I wanted to be a writer. I was \n     not terribly successful. I floundered and then I drifted, \n     then I floundered some more, then I drifted and floundered \n     together, which you think is easy.\n       Eventually things got so bad I moved back in with my \n     parents, which I do not recommend. I specifically do not \n     recommend moving in with my parents. I joke, but it was in \n     fact a very tough time for me. I am being serious now. I \n     suffered then, during that period, from real, genuine \n     depression. I still struggle with that. This was a very \n     painful, soul searching time in my life. I took a really \n     depressing job which my parents forced me to take, thank you \n     very much. And while I was at this job, this miserable job, \n     thank you mom and dad, I met a man of some faith. And he \n     begins to share his faith with me, this secular Yale \n     agnostic, and I was in enough pain that I was willing to \n     listen a little bit to what he had to say. He was an \n     Episcopalian and I figured it was safe--they don't really \n     believe that stuff anyway. So I said ``yeah, you can keep \n     talking.'' But he turned out to be one those Episcopalians \n     who actually believed this stuff and knew the Bible backwards \n     and forwards and I was really challenged. We would have a lot \n     of conversations.\n       I was not ready to accept what he was saying, not ready to \n     pray, to attend a Bible study, to go to church or to become a \n     weird born again Christian. But I was in enough pain to keep \n     listening. This friend of mine said to me that I should pray \n     that God would reveal himself to me--which seemed absurd \n     because I thought: I don't know if he's there so I don't \n     really want to pray to the oxygen in the room, to whom shall \n     I pray if he is not there? It is a conundrum you see. But \n     sometimes when you are in enough pain, and I was, you do \n     silly things--and I did pray. And I said, in my anguish, and \n     it was very real anguish. I said, ``God if you are there, \n     please reveal yourself to me; punch a hole through the \n     sheetrock, wave to me, say hello, show yourself to me.'' I \n     was desperate. Every now and again I would pray that prayer, \n     I would be jogging and I would pray that prayer, ``God help \n     me, I need help.'' It was an honest prayer. And prayers come \n     from a place of honesty, not religiosity. If you can say \n     ``help me Lord,'' God hears that prayer.\n       Then one night during this time, around my 25th birthday, I \n     had a dream. We don't have time to go into it this morning \n     but it was an amazing dream. If you want to hear the story of \n     this amazing dream you can go to my website: EricMetaxas.com. \n     It is an amazing thing and it changed my life. God came into \n     my life, Jesus came into my life, and it is all true except \n     the part about the UFO and the Sasquatch which I made up. But \n     seriously, watch that if you don't mind because it really \n     happened, it is not made up.\n       And when God came into my life overnight and He answered \n     that prayer, I wondered why hadn't I heard this before? Why \n     did I have to suffer not knowing? Why? I think part of the \n     reason is that I had rejected a phony religious idea of God. \n     Not God as he really is because when I encountered God as he \n     really is, I knew that is what my heart is longing for. That \n     is the answer. He is the answer to my pain and all my \n     questions. He is real and He loves me despite everything I \n     have done. He is not some moral code. He is not some energy \n     force. He is alive. He is a person. He knows everything about \n     me and about you. He knows my story; He knows your story, \n     every detail. He knows your deepest fears. He knows the \n     terrible selfish things you have done that have hurt others \n     and He still loves you. And He knows the hurt that others \n     have caused you. He knows us. He is alive. He is not a joy \n     killing bummer or some moralistic church lady. He is the most \n     wonderful person, capital ``P'', imaginable. In fact, his \n     name is Wonderful. Now, who would reject that?\n       So at that point, I realized everything I rejected about \n     God was actually not God. It was just dead religion. It was \n     phoniness. It was people who go to church and do not show the \n     love of Jesus. It was people who know the Bible and use it as \n     a weapon, people who do not practice what they preach, people \n     who are indifferent to the poor and suffering, people, who \n     use religion as a way to exclude others from their group, \n     people who use religion as a way to judge others. I had \n     rejected that, but guess what? Jesus had also rejected that. \n     He had railed against that and called people to real life and \n     to real faith. Jesus was and is the enemy of dead religion. \n     Jesus came to deliver us from that. He railed against the \n     religious leaders of his day because he knew that it was all \n     just a front, that in their hearts they were far from God his \n     Father. When he was tempted in the desert, who was the one \n     throwing Bible verses at him? Satan. That is a perfect \n     picture of dead religion. Using the words of God to do the \n     opposite of what God does. It is grotesque when you think \n     about it. It is demonic.\n       That summer as I came to faith, the guy who shared his \n     faith with me, Ed Tuttle, gave me a copy of ``The Cost of \n     Discipleship'' by Dietrich Bonhoeffer. And he asked me if I \n     had ever heard of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. I said, ``no.'' He \n     said, ``Bonhoeffer was a pastor who because of his faith in \n     Jesus stood up for the Jews of Europe.'' I was shocked. My \n     mother is German. She grew up during this period. Why had I \n     never heard this amazing story about Bonhoeffer before? I \n     remember thinking somebody really ought to write a book about \n     Bonhoeffer.\n       I was not interested in writing biographies. I am far too \n     self-centered to spend that much time focusing on someone \n     besides myself. I went on to have a strange career writing \n     children's books, I wrote humor for the New York Times, I \n     worked for Veggie Tales. And then I wanted to share my faith \n     and I wrote a book with the ridiculous title ``Everything You \n     Always Wanted to Know about God but Were Afraid to Ask''. \n     Actually now it's a trilogy, three books. And one day I found \n     myself being interviewed on CNN about this book and I was \n     expecting one of those tough questions like, how can a good \n     God allow evil and suffering? But instead, I got a softball \n     question. The host on CNN said to me, ``you know there is \n     something here about Wilberforce''--and I had two sentences \n     in the book about Wilberforce--``Can you talk about that?'' \n     Suddenly I am on CNN being asked to talk about Wilberforce. \n     All I knew about Wilberforce was in the book--that he was \n     someone who took the Bible so seriously that he changed the \n     world forever.\n       So I start talking about him briefly and next thing I know \n     a publisher calls me up and says ``there's a movie coming out \n     called `Amazing Grace'.'' And I was asked to write a book \n     about Wilberforce. Amazingly, I wrote a biography about \n     Wilberforce and everywhere I go talking about Wilberforce \n     people would say to me, ``who are you going to write about \n     next? Who are you going to write about next?'' Some people \n     asked me about ``whom will you next write?'' As a Yale \n     English major, I want to recommend the word whom. If English \n     is your first language, you may want to use the word whom. \n     You can get it free as an app on your iPhone, you just \n     download it. You use it as much as you want. ``Eric, about \n     whom will you next write?'' And I thought well, there is only \n     one person besides Wilberforce, only one about whom I would \n     write if I were to write a second biography. I remembered \n     Bonhoeffer and I did write that book. And I have to tell you, \n     nobody is more shocked by the reception of the book than I. \n     No one is more grateful to the Lord for the people who are \n     reading and talking about this book. I know that it was read \n     even by President George W. Bush who is intellectually \n     incurious as we have all read. He read the book. No pressure. \n     [Hands President Obama a book.] I just want to say no \n     pressure. I know you are very busy, Mr. President, but I know \n     sometimes you take plane rides and you have got time to kill, \n     so here. [Hands President Obama another book.] No pressure. \n     No pressure at all. Who am I to pressure you?\n       Nonetheless, the lives of both of these men illustrate the \n     difference between phony religiosity and really believing in \n     God in a way that is real--that changes your life, that must \n     change your life, and the lives of others. Wilberforce is \n     best known for leading the movement to end the slave trade. \n     Now, why did he take that on? Do you know why? I am here to \n     tell you it is not because he was just a churchgoer, because \n     there were plenty of churchgoers in England in the day of \n     Wilberforce. And everybody in that day seemed to have no \n     problem with the slave trade or slavery, people who went to \n     church. The reason Wilberforce fought so hard was because \n     around his 26th birthday, he encountered Jesus. England paid \n     lip service to religion in those days. Everybody said ``I am \n     a Christian, I am English, yeah, we are Christians.'' But \n     they really seemed to think--most of them--that the slave \n     trade was a fine thing. So keep in mind that when someone \n     says, ``I am a Christian'', it might mean absolutely nothing. \n     But for Wilberforce it became real. It was not about \n     Christianity, it was about the living God and serving Him. \n     And Wilberforce suddenly took the Bible seriously--that all \n     of us are created in the image of God. He took this idea \n     seriously--that it was our duty to care for the least of \n     these. And he said, ``Lord, I will obey.''\n       Now he fought politically, he fought hard and you know the \n     only people really fighting with him at this point were the \n     fanatical Christians. Did you know that? All the churchgoers, \n     all the religious people, they were not alongside him. Who \n     was alongside him in those days? The born again nuts, the \n     Quakers, the Methodists that people made fun of. They were in \n     the trenches because they knew they had no choice but to \n     regard the Africans as made in the image of God and worthy of \n     our love and respect. Everyone else was just going with the \n     flow, all the people who just went to church. As I say, they \n     got it wrong. They had not seen Jesus.\n       Wilberforce took these ideas, these foreign ideas, from the \n     Bible and brought them into culture. You can read about it, \n     and not just in my book, which the President may read. But \n     you can read about it. This is historical fact. This is not \n     my spin, this is true. Wilberforce, because he believed what \n     the Bible said and because he obeyed what God told him to do, \n     changed the world.\n       Today we argue about how to help the poor. Some say, ``Oh, \n     the public sector, government, is the answer.'' Others say, \n     ``The\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\n     private sector, free enterprise.'' But today, we argue about \n     how to help the poor, not whether to help the poor. Praise \n     the Lord. The idea to care for the poor, the idea that \n     slavery is wrong; these ideas are not normal human ideas. \n     These are Biblical ideas imported by Wilberforce at a crucial \n     time.\n       Human beings do not do the right thing apart from God's \n     intervention. We always do the phony religious thing. We go \n     with the flow. In Wilberforce's day going with the flow meant \n     supporting slavery, that Africans are not fully human. In \n     Bonhoeffer's world, in Nazi Germany, it meant supporting the \n     idea that Jews are not fully human. So whom do we say is not \n     fully human today? Who is expendable to us? My mother lived \n     through this. There are people in this room who lived through \n     this. I was in Germany last week; I met people who lived \n     through this period. It was an extraordinary thing to be \n     there, to meet people who were the sons of heroes fighting \n     against Hitler. This was a moment ago that this horror \n     happened.\n       Bonhoeffer was born in 1906 and he was born into an amazing \n     family. His father was the most famous psychiatrist in \n     Germany. This was a big, important amazing family. At 14, he \n     announces he wants to be a theologian. He got his doctorate \n     at age 21. Bonheoffer was a great theologian but he decided \n     in the midst of being a great theologian that he wanted to \n     get ordained as a Lutheran pastor. And then one day at age \n     24, he went to America to spend a year in New York City. And \n     he went to study at Union Theological Seminary. One Sunday a \n     fellow student named Frank Fisher, an African American from \n     Alabama, invited Dietrich Bonhoeffer to Harlem to a church \n     called Abyssinian Baptist Church. He said, ``why don't you \n     come with me?'' And Bonheoffer went with him and for the \n     first time in his life, in that church, he saw something that \n     was clearly not mere phony religion. He saw people worshiping \n     a living God. He saw people who understood suffering and \n     whose worship was real. Bonhoeffer said that in New York, in \n     America, he did not hear the gospel proclaimed. Think about \n     this, he visited many, many churches, yet he did not hear the \n     gospel proclaimed except, in his words, in the Negro \n     churches. That was the only place he saw the true gospel. He \n     saw true faith, living faith, people living it, preaching the \n     gospel of Jesus, living the gospel of Jesus. He saw this \n     among the suffering in Harlem and it changed his life.\n       When he got back to Germany, people could see that he was \n     different. He was not intellectually different, but his heart \n     had been changed. He began to speak publicly about the Bible \n     as the word of God, the living word of God through which God \n     who is alive wishes to speak to us. So, he understood from \n     the black church in Harlem the idea of a personal faith, that \n     God is alive and wishes to speak to you. And it had a \n     political component because it is now 1932, the Nazis are \n     rising. Bonhoeffer begins to say things that you would not \n     hear in Germany, even in the churches in those days. He spoke \n     of Jesus as the man for others. He said ``whoever does not \n     stand up for the Jews has no right to sing Gregorian chants, \n     God is not fooled.'' His whole life was about this idea that \n     you have to have a living relationship with God and that it \n     must lead you to action--that you must obey God, that you \n     will look different.\n       Now of course dead religion demonizes others, I just said \n     that, and apart from God's intervention, that is what we do. \n     So don't think that you won't do that. You will do that. We \n     are broken, fallen human beings so apart from God--that is \n     what we do. Do you think that you are better than the Germans \n     in that era? You are not. Not in God's eyes you're not. We \n     are the same. We are capable of the same horrible things. \n     Wilberforce somehow saw what the people in his day did not \n     see, and we celebrate him for it. Bonhoeffer saw what others \n     did not see, and we celebrate him for it. Now how did they \n     see what they saw? There is just one word that will answer \n     that, it is Jesus. He opens our eyes to his ideas which are \n     radical and which are different from our own. Personally, I \n     would say the same thing about the unborn. That apart from \n     God we cannot see that they are persons as well so those of \n     us who know the unborn to be human beings are commanded by \n     God to love those who do not yet see that.\n       We need to know that apart from God we would be on the \n     other side of that divide fighting for what we believe is \n     right. We cannot demonize our enemies. Today, if you believe \n     that abortion is wrong, you must treat those on the other \n     side with the love of Jesus. Today, if you have a Biblical \n     view of sexuality, you will be demonized by those on the \n     other side who will call you a bigot. Jesus commands us to \n     love those who call us bigots; to show them the love of \n     Jesus. If you want people to treat you with dignity, treat \n     them with dignity.\n       So finally, Jesus tells us that we must love our enemies. \n     That, my friends, is the real difference between dead \n     religion and a living faith in the God of the Scriptures, \n     whether we can love our enemies. Wilberforce had political \n     enemies but he knew that God had commanded him to treat them \n     with civility. He knew that he had been saved by grace. He \n     was not morally superior to the people on the other side of \n     the aisle. Martin Luther King told the people on the buses \n     that you must not fight back, that you must be willing to \n     turn the other cheek or get off the bus. Branch Rickey told \n     Jackie Robinson that if you want to win the battle, you need \n     to do as Jesus commanded and to be strong enough to not fight \n     back; that is how your enemies will know that there is \n     someone, capital ``S'', standing behind you, that it is not \n     just you.\n       So if you can see Jesus in your enemy, then you can know \n     that you are seeing with God's eyes and not your own. So, can \n     you love your enemy? If you cannot pray for those on the \n     other side, if you cannot actually feel the love of God for \n     your enemies, political and otherwise, my friends, that is a \n     sure sign that you are being merely religious. That you have \n     bought into a moral system but you do not know the God who \n     has forgiven you. Only God can give us that supernatural \n     agape love for those with whom we disagree. That is the test. \n     It is an impossible standard apart from the grace of God. We \n     all fail that test. But thank God for the grace of God. The \n     grace of God is real. God wants to shed it abroad in every \n     heart, not just on some, on every heart. It is the only thing \n     , the grace of a living God, that can bring left and right \n     together to do the right thing.\n       So can we humble ourselves enough to actually ask him in a \n     real prayer to show himself to us, to lead us to do what is \n     right? Can we do that for our country? For the world? This is \n     a Bonhoeffer moment. If we will humble ourselves, ask God, \n     cry out, Cri du coeur, cry from the heart, Lord lead us, will \n     you ask him to help you? The amazing grace of God is there \n     for everyone. You know Jesus is not just for so called \n     ``Christians'', Jesus is for everyone. The grace of God is \n     for everyone. I hope you know that.\n       When I was 21 years old, I worked at the Boston Opera House \n     and Garrison Keeler showed up and he gave a talk. And at the \n     end of his talk he asked the audience if they wanted to sing. \n     They didn't, but he made them anyway. He led them in a song \n     called ``Amazing Grace'' and that a capella rendition has \n     stuck with me my whole life. I thought maybe some day I will \n     get some people to do that, not today of course. But then I \n     thought you know, if the President can sing Al Green, then \n     maybe you can sing with him. So we are going to try this, if \n     it goes well I will leave with my head up. You ready? If you \n     don't know the lyrics, pretend that you do. I want to hear \n     harmonies.\n       All singing: Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a \n     wretch like me. I once was lost but now am found. Was blind \n     but now I see.\n       God Bless you.\n       Senator Sessions: Thank you Eric, you have indeed blessed \n     us. You got our attention and gave us spiritual food. Now it \n     is my great honor to introduce the President of the United \n     States. Mr. President, we thank you for your one hundred \n     percent support that you have given to this prayer breakfast; \n     being here every single year and when you were a member of \n     the Senate with us. Mr. President, I personally want to thank \n     you for the way you strive for the betterment of all \n     Americans. You give your life to that. It was Abraham Lincoln \n     who first used the phrase that we are a nation under God. If \n     we are going to be a nation under God, then we have to \n     recognize the precious worth of every single person. Thank \n     you for your leadership. Ladies and gentlemen, the President \n     of the United States, Barack Obama.\n       President Barack Obama: Well, good morning everybody. It is \n     good to be with so many friends united in prayer. And I begin \n     by giving all praise and honor to God for bringing us here \n     together today.\n       I want to thank our co-chairs, Mark and Jeff; to my dear \n     friend, the guy who always has my back, Vice President Biden. \n     All the members of Congress and my Cabinet who are here \n     today, all the distinguished guests who have traveled a long \n     way to be a part of this. I am not going to be as funny as \n     Eric but I am grateful that he shared his message with us. \n     Michelle and I feel truly blessed to be here.\n       This is my fourth year coming to this prayer breakfast as \n     President. As Jeff mentioned, before that I came as senator. \n     I have to say, it is easier coming as President. I don't have \n     to get here quite as early. But it has always been an \n     opportunity that I have cherished. And it is a chance to step \n     back for a moment, for us to come together as brothers and \n     sisters and seek God's face together. At a time when it is \n     easy to lose ourselves in the rush and clamor of our own \n     lives, or get caught up in the noise and rancor that too \n     often passes as politics today, these moments of prayer slow \n     us down. They humble us. They remind us that no matter how \n     much responsibility we have, how fancy our titles, how much \n     power we think we hold, we are imperfect vessels. We can all \n     benefit from turning to our Creator, listening to Him, \n     avoiding phony religiosity and listening to Him.\n       This is especially important right now, when we are facing \n     some big challenges as a nation. Our economy is making \n     progress as we recover from the worst crisis in three \n     generations, but far too many families are still struggling \n     to find work or make the mortgage, pay for college, or, in \n     some cases, even buy food. Our men and women in uniform have \n     made us safer and more secure, and we are eternally grateful \n     to them, but war and suffering and hardship still remain in \n     too many corners of the globe. And a lot of those men and \n     women who we celebrate on Veteran's Day and Memorial Day come \n     back and find that, when it comes to finding a job or getting \n     the kind of care that they need, we are not always there the \n     way that we need to be.\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\n       It is absolutely true that meeting these challenges \n     requires sound decision-making, requires smart policies. We \n     know that part of living in a pluralistic society means that \n     our personal religious beliefs alone cannot dictate our \n     response to every challenge we face.\n       But in my moments of prayer, I am reminded that faith and \n     values play an enormous role in motivating us to solve some \n     of our most urgent problems, in keeping us going when we \n     suffer setbacks, and opening our minds and our hearts to the \n     needs of others.\n       We cannot leave our values at the door. If we leave our \n     values at the door, we abandon much of the moral glue that \n     has held our nation together for centuries, and allowed us to \n     become somewhat more perfect a union. Frederick Douglass, \n     Abraham Lincoln, Jane Addams, Martin Luther King, Jr., \n     Dorothy Day, Abraham Heschel--the majority of great reformers \n     in American history did their work not just because it was \n     sound policy, or they had done good analysis, or understood \n     how to exercise good politics, but because their faith and \n     their values dictated it, and called for bold action--\n     sometimes in the face of indifference, sometimes in the face \n     of resistance.\n       This is no different today for millions of Americans, and \n     it is certainly not for me.\n       I wake up each morning and I say a brief prayer, and I \n     spend a little time in Scripture and devotion. And from time \n     to time, friends of mine, some of who are here today, friends \n     like Joel Hunter or T.D. Jakes, will come by the Oval Office, \n     or they will call on the phone, or they will send me an \n     email, and we will pray together, and they will pray for me \n     and my family, and for our country.\n       But I don't stop there. I would be remiss if I stopped \n     there; if my values were limited to personal moments of \n     prayer or private conversations with pastors or friends. So, \n     instead, I must try--imperfectly, but I must try--to make \n     sure those values motivate me as one leader of this great \n     nation.\n       And so when I talk about our financial institutions playing \n     by the same rules as folks on Main Street, when I talk about \n     making sure insurance companies are not discriminating \n     against those who are already sick, or making sure that \n     unscrupulous lenders are not taking advantage of the most \n     vulnerable among us, I do so because I genuinely believe it \n     will make the economy stronger for everybody. But I also do \n     it because I know that far too many neighbors in our country \n     have been hurt and treated unfairly over the last few years, \n     and I believe in God's command to ``love thy neighbor as \n     thyself.'' I know that a version of that Golden Rule is found \n     in every major religion and every set of beliefs--from \n     Hinduism to Islam to Judaism to the writings of Plato.\n       And when I talk about shared responsibility, it is because \n     I genuinely believe that in a time when many folks are \n     struggling, at a time when we have enormous deficits, it is \n     hard for me to ask seniors on a fixed income, or young people \n     with student loans, or middle-class families who can barely \n     pay the bills to shoulder the burden alone. And I think to \n     myself, if I am willing to give something up as someone who \n     has been extraordinarily blessed, and give up some of the tax \n     breaks that I enjoy, I actually think that is going to make \n     economic sense.\n       But for me as a Christian, it also coincides with Jesus's \n     teaching that ``for unto whom much is given, much shall be \n     required.'' It mirrors the Islamic belief that those who have \n     been blessed have an obligation to use those blessings to \n     help others, or the Jewish doctrine of moderation and \n     consideration for others.\n       When I talk about giving every American a fair shot at \n     opportunity, it is because I believe that when a young person \n     can afford a college education or someone who has been \n     unemployed suddenly has a chance to retrain for a job and \n     regain that sense of dignity and pride, and contributing to \n     the community as well as supporting their families--that \n     helps us all prosper.\n       It means maybe that research lab on the cusp of a \n     lifesaving discovery, or the company looking for skilled \n     workers is going to do a little bit better, and we will all \n     do better as a consequence. It makes economic sense. But part \n     of that belief comes from my faith in the idea that I am my \n     brother's keeper and I am my sister's keeper; that as a \n     country, we rise and fall together. I am not an island. I am \n     not alone in my success. I succeed because others succeed \n     with me.\n       And when I decide to stand up for foreign aid, or prevent \n     atrocities in places like Uganda, or take on issues like \n     human trafficking, it is not just about strengthening \n     alliances, or promoting democratic values, or projecting \n     American leadership around the world, although it does all \n     those things and it will make us safer and more secure. It is \n     also about the Biblical call to care for the least of these--\n     for the poor, for those at the margins of our society.\n       To answer the responsibility we are given in Proverbs to \n     ``speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the \n     rights of all who are destitute.'' And for others, it may \n     reflect the Jewish belief that the highest form of charity is \n     to do our part to help others to stand on their own.\n       Treating others as you want to be treated; requiring much \n     from those who have been given so much; living by the \n     principle that we are our brother's keeper; caring for the \n     poor and those in need. These values are old. They can be \n     found in many denominations and many faiths, among many \n     believers and among many non-believers. And they are values \n     that have always made this country great--when we live up to \n     them; when we don't just give lip service to them; when we \n     don't just talk about them one day a year. And they are the \n     ones that have defined my own faith journey.\n       And today, with as many challenges as we face, these are \n     the values I believe we are going to have to return to in the \n     hope that God will buttress our efforts.\n       Now, we can earnestly seek to see these values lived out in \n     our politics and our policies, and we can earnestly disagree \n     on the best way to achieve these values. In the words of C.S. \n     Lewis, ``Christianity has not, and does not profess to have a \n     detailed political program. It is meant for all men at all \n     times, and the particular program which suited one place or \n     time would not suit another.''\n       Our goal should not be to declare our policies as Biblical. \n     It is God who is infallible, not us. Michelle reminds me of \n     this often. So instead, it is our hope that people of \n     goodwill can pursue their values and common ground and the \n     common good as best they know how, with respect for each \n     other. And I have to say that sometimes we talk about \n     respect, but we don't act with respect towards each other \n     during the course of these debates.\n       But each and every day, for many in this room, the Biblical \n     injunctions are not just words, they are also deeds--every \n     single day, in different ways, so many of you are living out \n     your faith in service to others.\n       Just last month, it was inspiring to see thousands of young \n     Christians filling the Georgia Dome at the Passion \n     Conference, to worship the God who sets the captives free and \n     work to end modern slavery. Since we have expanded and \n     strengthened the White House faith-based initiative, we have \n     partnered with Catholic Charities to help Americans who were \n     struggling with poverty, worked with organizations like World \n     Vision and American Jewish World Service and Islamic Relief \n     to bring hope to those suffering around the world.\n       Colleges across the country have answered our Interfaith \n     Campus Challenge, and students are joined together across \n     religious lines in service to others. From promoting \n     responsible fatherhood to strengthening adoption, from \n     helping people find jobs to serving our veterans, we are \n     linking arms with faith-based groups all across the country.\n       I think we all understand that these values cannot truly \n     find voice in our politics and our policies unless they find \n     a place in our hearts. The Bible teaches us to ``be doers of \n     the word and not merely hearers.'' We are required to have a \n     living, breathing, active faith in our own lives. And each of \n     us is called on to give something of ourselves for the \n     betterment of others--and to live the truth of our faith not \n     just with words, but with deeds.\n       So even as we join the great debates of our age--how we \n     best put people back to work, how we ensure opportunity for \n     every child, the role of government in protecting this \n     extraordinary planet that God has made for us, how we lessen \n     the occasions of war--even as we debate these great issues, \n     we must be reminded of the difference that we can make each \n     day in our small interactions, in our personal lives.\n       As a loving husband, or a supportive parent, or a good \n     neighbor, or a helpful colleague--in each of these roles, we \n     help bring His kingdom to Earth. And as important as \n     government policy may be in shaping our world, we are \n     reminded that it is the cumulative acts of kindness and \n     courage and charity and love, It is the respect that we show \n     each other and the generosity that we share with each other \n     that in our every day lives will somehow sustain us during \n     these challenging times. John tells us that, ``If anyone has \n     material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no \n     pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? Dear \n     children, let us not love with words or tongue but with \n     actions and in truth.''\n       Mark read a letter from Billy Graham, and it took me back \n     to one of the great honors of my life, which was visiting \n     Reverend Graham at his mountaintop retreat in North Carolina, \n     when I was on vacation with my family in a hotel not far \n     away.\n       And I can still remember winding up the path, up a mountain \n     to his home. Ninety-one years old at the time, facing various \n     health challenges, he welcomed me as he would welcome a \n     family member or a close friend. This man who had prayed \n     great prayers that inspired a nation, this man who seemed \n     larger than life, greeted me and was as kind and as gentle as \n     could be.\n       And we had a wonderful conversation. Before I left, \n     Reverend Graham started to pray for me, as he had prayed for \n     so many Presidents before me. And when he finished praying, I \n     felt the urge to pray for him. I didn't really know what to \n     say. What do you pray for when it comes to the man who has \n     prayed for so many? But like that verse in Romans, the Holy \n     Spirit interceded when I didn't know quite what to say.\n       And so I prayed--briefly, but I prayed from the heart. I \n     don't have the intellectual capacity or the lung capacity of \n     some of my great preacher friends here who have prayed for a \n     long time. But I prayed. And we ended with an embrace and a \n     warm good-bye.\n       And I thought about that moment all the way down the \n     mountain, and I have thought about it in the many days since. \n     Because I thought about my own spiritual journey--growing up \n     in a household that was not particularly religious; going \n     through my own\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\n     period of doubt and confusion, finding Christ when I was not \n     even looking for him so many years ago; possessing so many \n     shortcomings that have been overcome by the simple grace of \n     God. And the fact that I would ever be on top of a mountain, \n     saying a prayer for Billy Graham--a man whose faith had \n     changed the world and that had sustained him through triumphs \n     and tragedies, and movements and milestones--that simple fact \n     humbled me to my core.\n       I have fallen on my knees with great regularity since that \n     moment--asking God for guidance not just in my personal life \n     and my Christian walk, but in the life of this nation and in \n     the values that hold us together and keep us strong. I know \n     that He will guide us. He always has and He always will. And \n     I pray his richest blessings on each of you in the days \n     ahead.\n       Thank you very much.\n       Senator Pryor: Thank you, Mr. President, for sharing your \n     heart and your faith with us. You have a room full of people \n     here who are praying for you and your family. God bless the \n     President of the United States of America.\n       Speaking of powerful people, let's hear one more time from \n     Jackie Evancho.\n       ``The Lord's Prayer'' sung by Miss Jackie Evancho.\n       Senator Sessions: Thank you, Jackie, and may God's \n     blessings continue with you. My thanks to the President, \n     Eric, all our speakers up here this morning You have given us \n     a lot to think about. Now it is our job to ponder these \n     things in our hearts and to turn those good ideas into \n     action.\n       Senator Pryor: Being a part of this National Prayer \n     Breakfast is a great privilege and now it becomes a great \n     responsibility. I believe God is counting on you and me to \n     love and pray where we are. Let's complain a lot less and \n     let's pray and love a lot more so God can use us to make a \n     better world. And now to close us in prayer is Robert Griffin \n     III of Baylor University.\n       Mr. Robert Griffin, III: Before I close in prayer, I would \n     just like to say, ``Sic em, Bears.'' And to the President, if \n     you ever get a little tired of running the country or \n     anything like that, a little bored, I would love to play you \n     in basketball. It would be a friendly competition because I \n     wouldn't want anyone to feel like I was trying to hurt you or \n     anything, so I wouldn't dunk on you at all. This has been a \n     really long breakfast. The longest I have ever been a part \n     of. I guess everyone up here got the memo except for me \n     because both of my cups are empty because I drank them. No \n     one else drank anything and I really have to use the \n     bathroom. So will go ahead and close this out so we can all \n     go ahead and do that.\n       If you could bow your heads, please. Father God, we thank \n     you for this day as a day you have made and we rejoice and we \n     are glad in it. Today has truly been a great day, many great \n     speakers and a lovely singer who has blessed all of our \n     hearts and brought many to tears. Father God, in Jesus' name, \n     we thank you that we could sit up here and thank you for so \n     many different things and be here all day. But most of all, \n     we thank you above all for having the ability to make a \n     difference in everyone's lives and giving us the power to go \n     out and change the world. And we thank you for your love, \n     your grace and your mercy and as we leave today, we thank you \n     that we take those qualities that can show the world not only \n     with our words but with our actions. In Jesus' name we pray, \n     Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1928-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONVICTION OF DHARUN RAVI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, a jury in New Jersey convicted \nDharun Ravi for violations of New Jersey criminal laws against bias \nintimidation and invasion of privacy. Mr. Ravi had used a Webcam to spy \non and then publicize an intimate encounter between his college \nroommate, Tyler Clementi, and another man.

It is incumbent on every segment of society to do \nwhat we can to stop bullying in schools and in our communities. As \nTyler Clementi's father said after the jury verdict was announced:\n\n       To our college, high school and even middle school \n     youngsters, I would say this: You're going to meet a lot of \n     people in your lifetime. Some of these people you may not \n     like. But just because you don't like them does not mean you \n     have to work against them.\n\n  I can only imagine the Clementi family's grief and suffering over \ntheir loss. I applaud the efforts they are making to raise awareness \nabout the real dangers of bullying on American campuses.\n  The Senate is also taking steps to address the growing problem of \nbullying. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Casey's Safe \nSchools Improvement Act, which requires schools to establish bullying \nprohibition policies and would help educators identify and address any \nconduct based on a student's actual or perceived race, color, religion, \ngender, disability, or sexual orientation. Another bill that I support \nis the Student Non-Discrimination Act introduced by Senator Franken, \nwhich would define harassment as a form of discrimination in our public \nschools. Both bills have more than 35 cosponsors and deserve full \nconsideration by the Senate. It has been well documented that students \nwho are paralyzed by fear of bullying cannot effectively learn. \nCongress should help ensure that States and schools have the tools they \nneed to prevent or punish bullying in any form. We must do more to \nensure that all students are protected and can thrive in their schools.\n  In the aftermath of Dharun Ravi's conviction in New Jersey, there has \nbeen some commentary on hate crimes laws generally. Some have wondered \nwhether hate crimes laws criminalize thoughts or beliefs and have the \neffect of chilling free speech. Others have expressed confusion whether \nMr. Ravi could have been prosecuted under our recently passed Federal \nhate crimes law.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, let me clarify the \nscope of Federal hate crimes statutes. First, the Matthew Shepard and \nJames Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act protects the constitutional \nright of every individual to have her own thoughts and beliefs and \nexpress them in a lawful manner. The law does not prohibit or punish \nspeech, expression, or association in any way--even hate speech. The \nConstitution does not permit us in Congress to prohibit the expression \nof an idea simply because we disagree with it.\n  The Matthew Shepard Act punishes physical violence, not speech. The \nlaw requires the defendant to have caused or attempted to cause bodily \ninjury to the victim while being motivated by the victim's sexual \norientation or another defined characteristic. Importantly, the \ndefendant in a Federal hate crimes case must have acted willfully. In \nother words, the defendant must have voluntarily and intentionally \ncaused bodily injury to the victim. From what we know of the Ravi case, \nthe defendant could not have been prosecuted under the Matthew Shepard \nAct because Mr. Ravi did not willfully cause bodily injury to Tyler \nClementi, nor did he willfully cause the victim to take his own life.\n  We know that the consequences of bias-motivated violence extend \nbeyond the victim. Hate crimes instill fear in those who have no \nconnection to the victim other than a shared characteristic such as \nrace, religion, national origin, gender, disability, or sexual \norientation. Preventing such consequences is the reason I offered the \nMatthew Shepard Act as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill \nmore than 2 years ago. The law has already resulted in several Federal \ncriminal convictions. For example, two Arkansas men were convicted \nafter they targeted five Hispanic victims at a gas station and rammed \ntheir car off the road causing serious injuries. Two other men in New \nMexico were convicted under this statute for branding a disabled Navajo \nman with a swastika while writing the words ``KKK'' and ``white power'' \non his body.\n  The Ravi prosecution was brought under New Jersey's laws, which are \ndifferent from our Federal hate crimes laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1928-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1928-S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL ROBERT F. WILLARD\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a distinguished \nnaval officer and a true patriot. Having just passed the torch of \ncommand for U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Robert F. Willard will hang \nup one last time the uniform he first donned almost four decades ago. \nOn the eve of his retirement, it is fitting to memorialize in the \nannals of this chamber Admiral Willard's years of selfless service to \nour Nation.\n  A Los Angeles native, Admiral Willard graduated from the United \nStates Naval Academy and was commissioned in 1973. After he completed \nflight training and qualified as a naval aviator, he served in F 14 \nfighter squadrons operating off of the aircraft carriers USS \nConstellation, USS Ranger, and USS Kitty Hawk. Admiral Willard's \nproficiency in the cockpit led to his assignment to Navy Fighter \nWeapons School, more commonly known as\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\nTOPGUN, where he served as the operations and executive officer. Many \nmay not know that Admiral Willard was the aerial coordinator for the \n1986 movie Top Gun and also appeared in it as a flight instructor. \nAdmiral Willard later commanded the famous Screaming Eagles Fighter \nSquadron operating off of the USS Carl Vinson.\n  In 1992, following his successful completion of nuclear power \ntraining, Admiral Willard rejoined the USS Carl Vinson as its executive \nofficer. He went on to command the amphibious flagship USS Tripoli and \nthe aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. As a flag officer, Admiral \nWillard twice served on the Joint Staff, was deputy and chief of staff \nfor U.S. Pacific Fleet, commanded Carrier Group Five embarked upon the \nUSS Kitty Hawk, and commanded Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, Japan. In \nMarch 2005, Admiral Willard became the 34th Vice Chief of Naval \nOperations, and in May 2007, he became Commander of the United States \nPacific Fleet.\n  On October 19, 2009, Admiral Willard was appointed as Commander, U.S. \nPacific Command. He assumed command when much of our focus was still on \nthe Middle East and North Africa, and rightly so. Conflicts there, \nhowever, in no way diminished the importance of the Asia-Pacific, where \nstrategically important events unfolded during Admiral Willard's \ncommand. As the United States rebalances its national security strategy \nand realigns its forces with a greater focus on the Asia-Pacific, \nAdmiral Willard's leadership over the last 2 years has laid a critical \nfoundation for our security and that of our allies, now and in years to \ncome.\n  Pacific Command is personally resonant with me. Between 1968 and \n1972, my father held the position, then known as Commander-in-Chief, \nPacific Command, that Admiral Willard has just relinquished. The \nrunning joke between Admiral Willard and me has been that he was living \nin my father's old house. And so, of all the praise and accolades I \ncould bestow on Admiral Willard for his service to our Nation, the best \nand most appropriate would be: the command undertaken by my father and \nother great men has been admirably served by the leadership of Admiral \nWillard.\n  Admiral Willard has always paid tribute to his spouse of 38 years \nDonna, who has been a tireless advocate for the men and women of the \ncommands in which she and her husband have served, and a wonderful \nambassador for the United States and the Navy. And so I extend a \ngrateful Nation's thanks to the Willards and their children Jennifer, \nBryan, and Mark for their exceptional service, best wishes for the next \nchapter in their life, and fair winds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1929-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, for 50 years, the United States Senate \nYouth Program, USSYP, has selected 2 remarkable high school students \nfrom each State, the District of Columbia, and the Department of \nDefense Education Activity program to visit our Nation's capital for an \ninspiring week-long immersion in the workings of the Federal government \nand a mirror into public service. The students that participate in the \nUSSYP have gone on to dedicate their lives to our country, including \nSenator Susan Collins, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and former \npresidential advisor Karl Rove.\n  Started in 1962 through the adoption of S. Res. 324, this program is \nas crucial now as it was when it was first created. The USSYP \nacknowledges our country's need to encourage inspired and proactive \nyouth. It takes a stand against complacency and apathy when it comes to \nlearning, gives students a chance to see firsthand the hard work and \ndedication of appointed and elected officials, and sustains and \nheightens their passion for helping others after the program is \nfinished. It also aims to instill a true understanding of the \ndemocratic process ``and the vital importance of democratic decision \nmaking not only for America but for people around the world'' (S. Res. \n324), creating a cadre of young ambassadors who promote representative \ngovernment in their own communities.\n  I wish to recognize the partners of the USSYP, most especially the \nHearst Foundations, and my Senate colleagues who participated in \nWashington Week a few weeks ago. I thank the Hearst Foundations for \ntheir generous offer to fund this program as long as the Senate keeps \nit alive. Also, I express my gratitude for nonprofit organizations that \nare innovatively addressing the deficit of civic knowledge and public \nresponsibility in our Nation's students. For example, iCivics, a \nproject started by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, aims to use video games \nand other web-based tools to engage students and teach them about our \ngovernment on all levels, including the importance of participation as \na citizen, the power of a vote, the checks and balances of our three \nbranches, and our founding documents. We must continue to remain \ninvested in the knowledge and ideals our future generations bring \nforth.\n  The USSYP understands the importance of fostering the genuine \ninterest in public service held by our Nation's youth, and only selects \nhigh schoolers to participate who have demonstrated a commitment to \ntheir student government or local civic organizations. I hope the \nUSSYP's strong 50 years can serve as a model for similar programs--\nespecially to reach those who may not have the support or resources to \ndefine or act on their passion for public service. The USSYP has \ncreated an alumni fund to assist delegates, who are entering college or \nthe work force in a low-paying, public service capacity, by providing \nscholarships. This great first step provides support to our young \nconstituents who are striving to realize their dreams, but are worried \nabout the costs involved.\n  I enjoyed meeting with the Connecticut delegates during the annual \nSenate reception during Washington Week and appreciated our thoughtful \ndialogue. Their visit has left me inspired and hopeful about our \ncountry's future.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in recognizing the importance of \nthe United States Senate Youth program for the next 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1929-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1929-S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               JACKSON'S SUGAR HOUSE AND VEGETABLE STAND\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, each year as winter makes way for \nspring, across my home state of Maine you will see maple trees lined \nwith metal buckets poised to collect delectable maple syrup. Maine is \nthe third largest producer of maple syrup in America, and last year \nexperienced a 14 percent increase, generating a remarkable 360,000 \ngallons. As maple sugar season commences and Maine looks forward to \ncelebrating the time-honored Maple Sugar Sunday, I rise to commend \nJackson's Sugar House & Vegetable Stand located in Oxford, ME.\n  Often times a small request sparks a marvelous business enterprise. \nFor Roger Jackson, owner of Jackson's Sugar House & Vegetable Stand, \nhis passion for maple syrup was reignited a few years ago when his \ngranddaughter sought help for a school project on how to make the sweet \nliquid. Although Roger had been producing maple syrup on and off since \nhe was 6 years old, his granddaughter's question renewed his love for \nthis New England staple. And the results have been incredibly sweet.\n  As a veteran in maple syrup production, Roger is familiar with the \ntrials and tribulations that go along with this endeavor. While it is \noften hard to turn a profit as a small producer, the smiles on his \ncustomers' faces truly make it all worthwhile. Further, compared to \nwhen Roger was a child, improvements in technology have certainly \nenhanced and eased the process of turning sap into maple sugar. For \nexample, today Jackson's Sugar House uses a stainless steel \nevaporator--equipment that enables them to easily remove water and \nensure better control over the quality of their product. This \nevaporation process is a vast improvement over Roger's childhood maple \nmaking experiences involving boiling sap over an open flame.\n  Roger's expertise in maple syrup has certainly not gone unnoticed. He \nwas recently appointed by the Maine Department of Agriculture \nCommissioner, Walter Whitcomb, to the Maine\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\nMaple Task Force Study Group to represent producers of maple sugar \nproducts with 1,000 or fewer taps. This Task Force was created in May \nof 2011, as part of the State's legislation ``To Study the Promotion \nand Expansion of the Maine Maple Sugar Industry.'' Roger's \nparticipation on the task force has been instrumental in ensuring that \nthe needs of small producers and mom and pop sugarhouse operations are \nvigorously advocated.\n  Maple syrup and all maple sugar products are certainly among the \nsweetest commodities produced in Maine. Thanks to the proficiency and \nresolve of individuals such as Roger Jackson, Maine continues to \nproduce the highest quality maple products. I am proud to extend my \ncongratulations to Roger Jackson and everyone at Jackson's Sugar House \n& Vegetable Stand for their dedication to excellence, and offer my best \nwishes for their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1930-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RACHEL BRISTOL\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize someone \nwho has spent the last 30 years in the front ranks of the fight against \nhunger in my State.\n  Rachel Bristol, president and CEO of the Oregon Food Bank, has \ndevoted her life to making sure that Oregonians in need are able to put \nnutritious food on the table. She has spent every minute of every day \nof her career doing everything in her power to eliminate hunger.\n  As Rachel retires, she leaves behind a legacy of determination and \nhard work that has guided the Oregon Food Bank and seen it expand into \na professional organization that reflects her vision of what a \ncommunity should do to help those in need.\n  Last year alone, the Oregon Food Bank Network distributed more than \n81 million pounds of food. I am proud to say that I have stood beside \nthe food bank's employees and volunteers and packaged my share of \npancake mix or other food. So, I know firsthand how dedicated they are \nin making sure that no one goes to bed hungry.\n  Whether we call it hunger, food insecurity or something else, what we \nare really talking about is the tragedy of having hungry families in \nthe richest country in the world.\n  Rachel saw that inequity and spent her life doing something about it. \nBecause of that fewer people in Oregon went hungry because she gave \nthem a place to go--a place to look to--for basic nutritious food to \nput on their table.\n  Because of Rachel Bristol, the food bank is a better organization and \nOregon is a better community.\n  While she may be retiring, something tells me that the fight against \nhunger will always be a part of who she is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1930-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1930-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1930-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:42 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 665.

A bill to create jobs in the United States by increasing \nUnited States exports to Africa by at least 200 percent in real dollar \nvalue within 10 years, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing American Jobs \n     Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Export growth helps United States business grow and \n     create American jobs. In 2010, 60 percent of American exports \n     came from small- and medium-sized businesses.\n       (2) On January 31, 2011, the President mandated an \n     executive review across agencies to determine where the \n     United States Government could become more competitive and \n     helpful to business, including help with promoting exports.\n       (3) Several United States Government agencies are involved \n     in export promotion. Coordination of the efforts of these \n     agencies through the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee \n     lacks sufficient strategic implementation and accountability.\n       (4) Many other countries have trade promotion programs that \n     aggressively compete against United States exports in Africa \n     and around the world. For example, in 2010, medium- and long-\n     term official export credit general volumes from the Group of \n     7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the \n     United Kingdom, and the United States) totaled \n     $65,400,000,000. Germany provided the largest level of \n     support at $22,500,000,000, followed by France at \n     $17,400,000,000 and the United States at $13,000,000,000. \n     Official export credit support by emerging market economies \n     such as Brazil, China, and India are significant as well.\n       (5) Between 2008 and 2010, China alone provided more than \n     $110,000,000,000 in loans to the developing world, and, in \n     2009, China surpassed the United States as the leading trade \n     partner of African countries. The Export-Import Bank of the \n     United States substantially increased lending to United \n     States businesses focused on Africa from $400,000,000 in 2009 \n     to an anticipated $1,000,000,000 in 2011, but the Export-\n     Import Bank of China dwarfed this effort with an estimated \n     $12,000,000,000 worth of financing.\n       (6) Other countries such as India, Turkey, Russia, and \n     Brazil are also aggressively seeking markets in Africa using \n     their national export banks to provide concessional \n     assistance.\n       (7) The Chinese practice of concessional financing runs \n     contrary to the principles of the Organization of Economic \n     Co-operation and Development related to open market rates, \n     undermines naturally competitive rates, and can allow \n     governments in Africa to overlook the troubling record on \n     labor practices, human rights, and environmental impact.\n       (8) The African continent is undergoing a period of rapid \n     growth and middle class development, as seen from major \n     indicators such as Internet use and clean water access. In \n     2000, only 6.7 percent of the population of Africa had access \n     to the Internet. In 2009, 27.1 percent of the population had \n     Internet access. Seventy-eight percent of Africa's rural \n     population now has access to clean water.\n       (9) Economists have designated Africa as the ``next \n     frontier market'', with profitability and growth rates among \n     many African firms exceeding global averages in recent years. \n     Countries in Africa have a collective spending power of \n     almost $9,000,000,000 and a gross domestic product of \n     $1,600,000,000,000, which are projected to double in the next \n     10 years.\n       (10) Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to have the fastest \n     growing economies in the world over the next 5 years, with 7 \n     of the 10 fastest growing economies located in sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n       (11) When countries such as China assist with large-scale \n     government projects, they\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\n     also gain an upper hand in relations with African leaders and \n     access to valuable commodities such as oil and copper, \n     typically without regard to environmental, human rights, \n     labor, or governance standards.\n       (12) Unless the United States can offer competitive \n     financing for its firms in Africa, it will be deprived of \n     opportunities to participate in African efforts to close the \n     continent's significant infrastructure gap that amounts to an \n     estimated $100,000,000,000.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create jobs in \n     the United States by expanding programs that will result in \n     increasing United States exports to Africa by 200 percent in \n     real dollar value within 10 years.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to restore \nintegrity to and strengthen payment limitation rules for commodity \npayments and benefits; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rural America \nPreservation Act of 2012. I appreciate Senators Johnson of South \nDakota, Enzi, Brown of Ohio, Gillibrand, Harkin, and Nelson of Nebraska \nfor joining on this bill, and in this effort.\n  As the Senate Agriculture Committee continues working on the next \nFarm Bill, one thing seems to be clear. The title one safety-net is \ngoing to look quite different than current programs. It appears the \ndirect payment program may be done away with entirely. Some of my \ncolleagues and agriculture groups have proposed a variety of new ideas \nas possible replacements to the current commodity title.\n  No matter what commodity program we create, my bill sets the marker \non payment limitations. I introduced a similar payment limits bill last \nyear, but this bill should better address whatever type of safety-net \nprogram we adopt going forward. The premise remains the same. We need \nfirm payment limit. We need to close loopholes.\n  I support having a safety-net for farmers. This nation enjoys a safe \nand abundant food supply. Certainly a lot of that can be attributed to \nthe ingenuity and hard work of the American farmer. But the farm \nsafety-net helps small and medium-size farmers get through tough times \nthat are out of their control.\n  We need an effective safety-net to assist farmers. But equally \nimportant is for Congress to develop a defensible safety-net. I will \ncontinue to work with my Agriculture committee colleagues to figure out \nwhat type of program will be most effective.\n  But we already know the steps that need to be taken to make it more \ndefensible. Defensible means setting firm caps on the farm payments any \none farmer can receive. The current approach does not have any overall \ncap. There is nothing wrong with farmers growing their operations. But \nbig farmers shouldn't be using taxpayer dollars\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\nto get even bigger. When the largest 10 percent of farmers receive 70 \npercent of farm payments, something is wrong. There comes a point where \nsome farms reach levels that allow them to weather the tough financial \ntimes on their own. Smaller farms do not have the same luxury, but they \nplay a pivotal role in producing this nation's food.\n  If you want to witness how farm payments to big farmers creates a \nbarrier for small and beginning farmers, look at land prices. The \ncurrent system puts upward pressure on land prices making it more \ndifficult for small and beginning farmers to buy ground. This is not \nunique to Iowa. This upward pressure on land prices is occurring in \nmany other states.\n  This bill proposes an overall cap of $250,000 for a married couple. \nIn my State, many people would say this is still too high. But I \nrecognize that agriculture can look different around the country, and \nso this is a compromise. Strong payment limits will ensure farm \npayments are helping those who payments were originally created for, \nthe small and medium-size farmers.\n  Having an overall cap is more defensible from a Federal budget \nstandpoint as well. This Nation needs to make tough decisions regarding \nall government programs. We need to find savings across the board. \nSetting strict caps on all commodity programs should be a no-brainer as \nwe look to find savings and increase accountability in farm programs. \nHaving a defensible safety-net also means closing loopholes in the \ncurrent law.\n  For all the rhetoric that comes out of Washington, D.C. about \neliminating fraud, waste, and abuse, making sure non-farmers don't game \nthe system is a common sense step to take. It's simple, if you are not \na farmer, you shouldn't get a farm payment. The bill I introduced last \nyear, and this bill, has language that closes the loopholes.\n  After I introduced the bill last year, we received some questions \nregarding the language from two camps of people. The first camp of \npeople I would say were critical because they don't want the loopholes \nclosed. They would have us turn a blind eye to the fact people game the \nsystem. They would have us turn a blind eye to the fact we have \nnonfarmers who claim to help ``manage'' the farm by participating in \none or two conference calls a year. To those people, I cannot satisfy \nyour concerns. I will not turn a blind eye to abuses. These are \nloopholes that need to be closed.\n  To the other camp of people, who have provided constructive feedback, \nI would say, we have listened. The revisions we made addressed the \nissues raised. We have improved the language closing the loopholes. \nThis bill provides a tangible, workable, and fair approach. Closing \nthese loopholes is the right thing to do for the American taxpayer. It \nis the right thing to do for the American farmer.\n  Hard caps on farm payments and closing loopholes should be supported \nby anyone who wants an effective and defensible farm safety-net. As the \nSenate Agriculture Committee heads toward a mark-up of the Farm Bill, I \ninvite my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2217\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the United States Fire Administration, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as a co-chair of the Congressional Fire \nCaucus, I am pleased to join Senator Lieberman in introducing \nlegislation to reauthorize the U.S. Fire Administration. We appreciate \nSenators McCain, Carper and Scott Brown becoming cosponsors of this \nbill. The Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International \nAssociation of Fire Fighters, the International Association of Fire \nChiefs, and the National Volunteer Fire Council back this measure. I am \nproud to have their support.\n  Reauthorization of the U.S. Fire Administration means that first \nresponders around the country will get the essential training, \neducation, and research they need to help prevent fire-related deaths \nand protect their communities from disasters of all kinds--man-made and \nnatural.\n  Since its creation in 1974, the Fire Administration and its Fire \nAcademy have helped prevent fires, protect property, and save lives \namong firefighters and the public. Today, the Fire Administration is \nalso integrated into our national, all-hazards preparations against \nnatural disasters and terrorist attacks.\n  America's firefighters play a vital role in the security of our \nnation and it is important that, as a nation and a Congress, we support \nthem. We can do so by reauthorizing the United States Fire \nAdministration. Whether it is in response to a terrorist attack, a \nwildland fire, or a house fire the community, America has come to rely \non firefighters. America's firefighters--whether career or volunteer--\nalways answer the call.\n  In a report released in September, the United States Fire \nAdministration found that, over the past 10 years, the overall number \nof fires reported in the United States has declined by 18 percent. \nDuring this same time period, there was also a 20 percent decline in \ncivilian deaths and a 22 percent drop in civilian injuries. We can be \nproud of this progress.\n  According to the report, however, ``although America's fire death \nrate is improving, it continues to be higher than more than half of the \nindustrialized countries of the world.'' Sadly, during this same time \nperiod, there has been an average of 3,570 deaths and nearly 18,300 \ninjuries per year. The Fire Administration must work tirelessly to \nimprove these statistics, which represent loss and pain to American \nfamilies.\n  We must also continue to educate and train current and future \ngenerations of firefighters. The USFA plays an important role in the \nprofessional development of fire services personnel through the \nNational Fire Academy, by providing courses in Fire Prevention \nManagement, Hazardous Materials, Incident Management, and Arson, as \nwell as many other critical courses.\n  My home State of Maine is keenly aware of the dangers of fire and the \nimportance of effective fire services. According to the Maine \nDepartment of Public Safety, nearly 50 Mainers died in fires every year \nthrough the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. The average for the past decade is \n17 per year, and 2011 sadly produced 23 fire-related deaths, up from \nonly nine in 2010--both are too many.\n  With the continued work of the U.S. Fire Administration and the \nvaliant efforts of our brave fire services personnel, I believe we can \nmake further progress in lowering the number of fire related deaths in \nour nation.\n  I ask that my colleagues support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Franken, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Bennet, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. \n        Wyden, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Begich, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Leahy, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \n        Reed, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Coons, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Webb, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Casey, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2219. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nprovide for additional disclosure requirements for corporations, labor \norganizations, Super PACs and other entities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce the \nDISCLOSE Act of 2012, and we are informally closing DISCLOSE 2.0 in \nrecognition of the original bill that Senator Schumer worked so hard to \nget passed a few years ago.\n  The Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal \nElection Commission opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate and \nspecial interest money in elections, bringing about an era where \ncorporations and other wealthy interests can drown out the voices of \nvoters in our political system.\n  Worse still, much of this spending is anonymous so the public does \nnot even know who is spending millions to influence our elections. Here \nis how my home State newspaper, the Providence Journal, explained the \nCitizens United decision:\n\n       The ruling will mean that, more than ever, big-spending \n     economic interests will determine who gets elected. More \n     money will especially pour into relentless attack campaigns. \n     Free speech for most individuals will suffer because their \n     voices will count for even less than they do now. They will \n     simply be drowned out by the big money.\n\n  I think events have proven the Providence Journal correct. Senator \nJohn McCain recently described these events. He said:\n\n       I predicted when the United States Supreme Court, with \n     their absolute ignorance of what happens in politics, struck \n     down [the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law], that there \n     would be a flood of money into campaigns, not transparency, \n     unaccounted for, and this is exactly what is happening.\n\n  If we look at the 2006 and 2010 congressional elections where there \nwas not a Presidential race going on after Citizens United in 2010, \nthere was a fourfold increase in expenditures from super PACs and other \noutside groups compared to what occurred in 2006, with nearly three-\nquarters of that political advertising coming from sources that were \nprohibited from spending money in 2006--three-quarters of it.\n  Also, in 2010, those 501(c)(4) and (c)(6) organizations spent more \nthan $135 million in unlimited and secret contributions. Anonymous \nspending rose\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\nfrom 1 percent of outside spending in 2006 to 47 percent of outside \nspending in 2010. Nearly half of the money spent through these outside \norganizations is anonymous and secret.\n  If we look at the 2012 race that we are in right now, a Presidential \nrace, and compare it to the last Presidential race, we are already \nseeing similar ominous signs about the influence of money. The Federal \nElection Commission predicts that over $11 billion will be spent on the \n2012 elections, about double what was spent in 2008.\n  Super PACs, mostly linked to individual candidates, spent about $100 \nmillion through the Super Tuesday contest in the Republican \nPresidential primary, again, about twice what was spent over the same \nperiod in 2008. In the two weeks leading up to Super Tuesday, outside \nPACs that supported the Republican Presidential candidates spent three \ntimes as much as the candidates themselves.\n  Our campaign finance system is broken. Immediate action is required \nto fix it. Americans of all political stripes, whatever their \npersuasion, are disgusted by the influence of unlimited anonymous \ncorporate cash in our elections and by campaigns that succeed or fail \ndepending on how many billionaires the candidates have in their \npockets.\n  Editorial boards across the country decry this new pollution of our \npolitics. Republicans, such as former Governors Mike Huckabee and Tom \nRidge, have concluded that super PACs are, in Mr. Huckabee's words, \n``one of the worst things that ever happened in American politics.''\n  Seven in ten Americans, including a majority of both Republicans and \nDemocrats, believe super PACS should be illegal. Countless Rhode \nIslanders are fed up with the influence of corporate money in \nelections. I hear them at my community dinners; I read their mail. \nCharles in Little Compton wrote to me,\n\n       [I]t is wrong that someone who shouts louder or further, in \n     this instance solely because they have more money, should \n     drown out another person . . . [C]orporations have no problem \n     getting their views aired.\n\n  Hope-Whitney in Bristol wrote,\n\n       [J]ust the idea that a corporation is considered an \n     individual in regards to politics goes against everything \n     American to me. . . . [T]hey have become the Emperors as they \n     have the financial ability to be heard everywhere. . . . I'd \n     be willing to bet that a majority of their own employees do \n     not agree with their political representation.\n\n  Elizabeth in Wakefield wrote:\n\n       Big business should not control our elections. It is bad \n     enough that they deeply influence our politicians through \n     lobbyists.\n\n  But because of a 5-to-4 decision by the conservative Justices in \nCitizens United, Congress cannot prohibit super PACs from drowning out \nthe voices of ordinary Americans in our elections. That leaves us with \none weapon left in the fight against the overwhelming tidal wave of \nmoney from special interests. That weapon is disclosure, daylight, \ninformation.\n  Today, along with 34 other Senators, I am introducing legislation \nthat will shine a bright light on these powerful shadowy interests. \nWith this legislation, every citizen will know who is spending these \ngreat sums of money to get their candidate elected. I am delivering \nthis speech at a time that Senator Bennet, the distinguished junior \nSenator from Colorado is presiding. I am very conscious and aware as I \ndeliver it of the immense amount of work that he has put in in the \nprocess of preparing this legislation, working on a strategy for going \nforward, working with our leadership to commence that strategy.\n  I am grateful to him and the other Senators I will mention later. For \nnow I will give the Presiding Officer the lead. In 2010, under Senator \nSchumer's leadership and guidance, we came within one vote of passing \nhis original DISCLOSE Act. Since then, the problem of anonymous and \nunaccountable corporate money has become dramatically worse, and \nAmericans are losing faith in our political system as a result.\n  More and more people believe their government responds only to \nwealthy and powerful corporate interests. As they see their jobs \ndisappear and their wages stagnate, and bailouts and special deals for \nthe big guys, they lose faith that their elected officials are \nlistening to them. For our democracy to remain strong, this trend \ncannot continue. We must redouble our efforts and pass the DISCLOSE Act \nof 2012.\n  The bill we are introducing today has been trimmed down so it just \ndoes two simple things: One, if you are an organization such as a \ncorporation, a super PAC or a 401(c)(4) group spending money in an \nelection campaign in support of or in opposition to a candidate, you \nhave to tell the public where that money came from and what you are \nspending it on in a timely manner. That should not be a controversial \nidea to anyone, at least to anyone who is not seeking special \ninfluence.\n  If you are a top executive or a major donor of an organization \nspending millions of dollars on campaign ads, you have to take \nresponsibility for those ads by having your name on the ad, and in the \ncase of an executive appearing in the ad yourself. That is it. Two \nsimple provisions. Disclosure and a disclaimer. These are reasonable \nprovisions that should have wide support from Democrats and Republicans \nalike.\n  The DISCLOSE Act of 2012, the DISCLOSE 2.0 Act, trims down the \noriginal DISCLOSE Act in another way. We have raised the threshold for \ndonations that require disclosure from $600 to $10,000. It may sound as \nthough $10,000 is a ridiculously high threshold, as though that is an \nawful lot of money, but when we look at what is happening in these \nsuper PACs, $10,000 in this particular world is no big deal.\n  Ninety-three percent of money raised by super PACs in 2010 and 2011 \nthat can be traced to specific donors came in contributions of $10,000 \nor more. So we will catch probably 93 percent of the money in this \nreporting provision, while leaving smaller donations and dues payments \nto membership organizations private.\n  The act also does not require the disclosure of nonpolitical \ndonations, affiliate transfers, business investments, and other \ntransfers of money that have nothing to do with electioneering.\n  At the same time, however, the bill also contains strong provisions \nto prevent the use of dummy organizations or shell corporations to hide \ntheir donations from public view. The way this bill is drafted, if \nsomebody sets up a phony organization to take a contribution and, in \nturn, make that contribution to another phony organization and, in \nturn, make that contribution to another phony organization, before it \nfinally lands in a super PAC that is benefiting a candidate, we will be \nable to trace that series of transactions.\n  So it is a good law, a simpler law, an effective law. It only goes \nafter high-dollar givers. Passing it would prove to the American people \nthat Congress is committed to fairness, that we are committed to \nequality, and that we are committed to the fundamental principle of a \ngovernment ``of the people, by the people, and for the people.''\n  In closing, I thank Senator Schumer for his exemplary leadership and \ndetermination on this vitally important issue, as well as Senators \nMichael Bennet, Al Franken, Jeff Merkley, Jeanne Shaheen, and Tom \nUdall, all of whom have worked very closely on this legislation. I also \nthank the act's other cosponsors--all 35--who, similar to myself, \nunderstand that the legitimacy of our democratic process and the \nintegrity of our democratic elections are at stake.\n  I look forward to working with any of my colleagues in the Senate who \nbelieve the voices of American citizens should be defended, and I hope \nall will join me in supporting this critical piece of legislation to \nrestore integrity to our elections.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I join with Senator Whitehouse, \nSenator Schumer and many other Senate Democrats as we renew our efforts \nto curtail some of the worst abuses now allowed because of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Citizens United. The Democracy Is Strengthened by \nCasting Light On Spending in Elections, DISCLOSE, Act of 2012 will help \nto restore transparency in the campaign finance laws gutted by the \nnarrow, conservative, activist majority of the Supreme Court in \nCitizens United.\n  Two years ago, with the stroke of a pen, five Supreme Court justices \noverturned a century of law designed to protect our elections from \ncorporate spending. They ran roughshod over longstanding precedent to \nstrike down key provisions of our bipartisan campaign finance laws, and \nruled that corporations are no longer prohibited from\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\ndirect spending in political campaigns. I was troubled at the time and \nremain troubled today that in that case, the Supreme Court extended to \ncorporations the same First Amendment rights in the political process \nthat are guaranteed by the Constitution to individual Americans.\n  Corporations are not the same as individual Americans. Corporations \ndo not have the same rights, the same morals or the same interests. \nCorporations cannot vote in our democracy. They are artificial legal \nconstructs meant to facilitate business. The Founders understood this. \nAmericans across the country have long understood this. A narrow \nmajority on the Supreme Court apparently did not.\n  When I cosponsored the first DISCLOSE Act after the Supreme Court's \ndecision in 2010, I hoped Republicans would join with Democrats to \nmitigate the impact of the Citizens United decision. I hoped that \nSenate Republicans who had once championed the bipartisan McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance law would work with us to help ensure that \ncorporations could not abuse their newfound constitutional rights.\n  Regrettably, Senate Republicans filibustered that DISCLOSE Act, \npreventing the Senate from even debating the measure, let alone having \nan up-or-down vote in the Senate. By preventing even debate on the \nDISCLOSE Act, Senate Republicans ensured the ability of wealthy \ncorporations to dominate all mediums of advertising and to drown out \nthe voices of individuals, as we have seen and will continue to see in \nour elections.\n  By blocking the DISCLOSE Act, Senate Republicans ensured that the \nflood of corporate money flowing into campaigns from undisclosed and \nunaccountable sources since the Citizens United decision would \ncontinue. The risks we feared at the time of the decision, the risks \nthat drove Congress to pass bipartisan laws based on longstanding \nprecedent, have been apparent in the elections since. The American \npeople have seen the sudden and dramatic effects in the Republican \nprimary elections this year and in the 2010 mid-term elections. Instead \nof hearing the voices of voters, we see a barrage of negative \nadvertisements from so-called Super PAC's. This comes as no surprise to \nthe many of us in Congress and around the country who worried at the \ntime of the Citizens United decision that it turns the idea of \ngovernment of, by and for the people on its head. We worried that the \ndecision created new rights for Wall Street at the expense of the \npeople on Main Street. We worried that powerful corporate megaphones \nwould drown out the voices and interests of individual Americans. It is \nclear those concerns were justified.\n  By reintroducing the DISCLOSE Act, we continue to try to fight the \neffects of corporate influence unleashed by Citizens United. The \nDISCLOSE Act of 2012 is focused on restoring transparency and \naccountability to campaign finance laws by ensuring that all Americans \nknow who is paying for campaign ads. This is a critical step toward \nrestoring the ability of American voters to be able to speak, be heard \nand to hear competing voices, and not be overwhelmed by corporate \ninfluence and driven out of the governing process. I hope that \nRepublicans who have seen the impact of waves of unaccountable \ncorporate campaign spending will not renew their obstruction of this \nimportant legislation. Even Senator McCain, a lead co-author of the \nMcCain-Feingold Act, has conceded that Super PAC's are ``disgraceful.''\n  Vermont is a small state. It is easy to imagine the wave of corporate \nmoney that has been spent on elections around the country lead to \ncorporate interests flooding the airwaves with election ads, and \ntransforming even local elections there or in other small States. It \nwould not take more than a tiny fraction of corporate money to outspend \nall of our local candidates combined. If a local city council or zoning \nboard is considering an issue of corporate interest, why would those \ncorporate interests not try to drown out the views of Vermont's \nhardworking citizens? I know that the people of Vermont, like all \nAmericans, take seriously their civic duty to choose wisely on Election \nDay. Like all Vermonters, I cherish the voters' role in the democratic \nprocess and am a staunch believer in the First Amendment. Vermont \nrefused to ratify the Constitution until the adoption of the Bill of \nRights in 1791. The rights of Vermonters and all Americans to speak to \neach other and to be heard should not be undercut by corporate \nspending. I hope all Senators, Republican or Democratic, will support \nthe DISCLOSE Act of 2012 and help us take an important step to ensure \nthe ability of every American to be heard and participate in free and \nfair elections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1940-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 401--EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR FOREIGN SERVICE AND \nCIVIL SERVICE PROFESSIONALS WHO REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES AROUND THE \n                                 GLOBE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 401\n\n       Whereas the United States Foreign Service was established \n     by Congress in 1924 to professionalize the country's \n     diplomatic and consular services and advance freedom, \n     democracy, and security for the benefit of the people of the \n     United States and the international community;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development was established in 1961 to support the foreign \n     policy goals of the United States through economic, \n     development, and humanitarian assistance;\n       Whereas the Department of State and the United States \n     Agency for International Development together employ more \n     than 27,000 United States nationals in the Foreign Service \n     and Civil Service dedicated to promoting United States \n     interests around the world;\n       Whereas Foreign Service personnel deploy to Asia, Africa, \n     the Americas, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and \n     Southeast Asia on a permanent, rotating basis to defend and \n     promote United States priorities abroad;\n       Whereas many Foreign Service employees spend months or \n     years away from families and loved ones on assignment to \n     dangerous or inhospitable posts where family members are not \n     permitted;\n       Whereas numerous Department of State and United States \n     Agency for International Development employees have lost \n     their lives while serving abroad;\n       Whereas strong and purposeful United States diplomacy and \n     development, carried out by a diverse, professionally \n     educated, and well-trained force of Foreign Service and Civil \n     Service professionals, are the most cost-effective means to \n     protect and advance United States interests abroad;\n       Whereas the promotion of commercial engagement by United \n     States businesses in foreign markets and targeted \n     international development projects support economic \n     prosperity, job creation, and opportunities for United States \n     business and industry;\n       Whereas United States diplomats are often the first line of \n     defense against international conflict and transnational \n     security threats;\n       Whereas Foreign Service and Civil Service professionals \n     have worked to support the members of the United States Armed \n     Forces involved in critical national security missions and \n     military engagements in dangerous and unstable regions;\n       Whereas Foreign Service and Civil Service professionals \n     administer emergency assistance in crisis situations; and\n       Whereas the contributions of Foreign Service and Civil \n     Service professionals to the global advancement of \n     international understanding, American ideals, and the \n     promotion of freedom and democracy around the world should be \n     commended: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and gives special appreciation to the \n     Foreign Service and Civil Service personnel of the Department \n     of State, the United States Agency for International \n     Development, and other United States Government agencies that \n     promote and protect United State priorities abroad; and\n       (2) owes a debt of gratitude to these individuals, and \n     their families, who put public service and pride in their \n     country ahead of comfort, convenience, and even safety in \n     service to the United States and the global community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1940-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1940-S1942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 402--CONDEMNING JOSEPH KONY AND THE LORD'S RESISTANCE \n ARMY FOR COMMITTING CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND MASS ATROCITIES, AND \n    SUPPORTING ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND \n    GOVERNMENTS IN CENTRAL AFRICA TO REMOVE JOSEPH KONY AND LORD'S \n            RESISTANCE ARMY COMMANDERS FROM THE BATTLEFIELD\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \nHatch, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Murray,\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\nMr. Whitehouse, Mr. Tester, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Franken, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Moran, Mr. Graham, Mr. Levin, \nMs. Collins, Mr. Isakson, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. Begich, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \nCoats, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Blunt) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 402\n\n       Whereas the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) wreaked havoc in \n     northern Uganda for two decades, during which time the World \n     Bank estimates that they abducted some 66,000 youth of all \n     ages and sexes and forced them to serve as child soldiers and \n     sex slaves and commit terrible acts;\n       Whereas, under increasing pressure, Joseph Kony ordered the \n     Lord's Resistance Army in 2005 and 2006 to withdraw from \n     Uganda and to move west into the border region of the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \n     Republic, and what would become South Sudan;\n       Whereas, since September 2008, Joseph Kony has directed the \n     Lord's Resistance Army to commit systematic, large-scale \n     attacks against innocent civilians in the Democratic Republic \n     of Congo, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of \n     South Sudan that have destabilized the region and resulted in \n     the deliberate killing of at least 2,400 civilians from the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, \n     and the Republic of South Sudan, many of whom were targeted \n     in schools and churches; the rape and brutal mutilation of an \n     unknown number of men, women, and children; the abduction of \n     over 3,400 civilians, including at least 1,500 children, many \n     of them forced to become child soldiers or sex slaves; and \n     the displacement of more than 465,000 civilians from their \n     homes, many of whom do not have access to essential \n     humanitarian assistance;\n       Whereas insecurity caused by the Lord's Resistance Army has \n     undermined efforts by the governments in the region, with the \n     assistance of the United States and the international \n     community, to consolidate peace and stability in each of the \n     countries affected, particularly the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo and the Republic of South Sudan;\n       Whereas, since December 2001, the Department of State has \n     included the Lord's Resistance Army on its ``Terrorist \n     Exclusion List'' and in August 2008, Lord's Resistance Army \n     leader Joseph Kony was designated a ``Specially Designated \n     Global Terrorist'' by President George W. Bush pursuant to \n     Executive Order 13224;\n       Whereas, on October 6, 2005, the International Criminal \n     Court issued arrest warrants against Joseph Kony and four of \n     his top commanders for war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity, yet they remain at large;\n       Whereas, in May 2010, Congress passed and President Barack \n     Obama signed into law the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament \n     and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009 (Public Law 111 \n     172), which made it the policy of the United States to work \n     with regional governments toward a comprehensive and lasting \n     resolution to the conflict in northern Uganda and other \n     affected areas by providing political, economic, military, \n     and intelligence support for viable multilateral efforts to \n     protect civilians from the Lord's Resistance Army, to \n     apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and his top commanders from \n     the battlefield, and to disarm and demobilize the remaining \n     Lord's Resistance Army fighters;\n       Whereas, on November 24, 2010, as mandated by the Lord's \n     Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act \n     of 2009, President Obama issued the Strategy to Support the \n     Disarmament of the Lord's Resistance Army, which provides a \n     comprehensive strategy for supporting regional efforts to \n     mitigate and eliminate the threat to civilians and regional \n     stability posed by the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       Whereas, on October 14, 2011, President Obama notified \n     Congress that he had authorized approximately 100 combat-\n     equipped members of the Armed Forces to deploy to central \n     Africa to provide assistance to regional forces that are \n     working toward the removal of Joseph Kony and senior \n     leadership of the Lord's Resistance Army from the \n     battlefield;\n       Whereas the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2012 (Public Law 112 81) authorized the Secretary of \n     Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to \n     provide logistic support, supplies, and services for foreign \n     forces participating in operations to mitigate and eliminate \n     the threat of the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       Whereas the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public \n     Law 112 74) directed the President to support increased peace \n     and security efforts in areas affected by the Lord's \n     Resistance Army, including programs to improve physical \n     access, telecommunications infrastructure, and early-warning \n     mechanisms and to support the disarmament, demobilization, \n     and reintegration of former Lord's Resistance Army \n     combatants, especially child soldiers;\n       Whereas the United Nations and African Union, acting with \n     encouragement and support from the United States Government, \n     have renewed their efforts to help governments in the region \n     address the threat posed by the Lord's Resistance Army, and \n     on November 22, 2011, the African Union designated the Lord's \n     Resistance Army as a terrorist group and authorized a new \n     initiative to help strengthen the coordination among the \n     affected governments in the fight against the Lord's \n     Resistance Army; and\n       Whereas targeted United States assistance and leadership \n     can help prevent further mass atrocities and curtail \n     humanitarian suffering in central Africa: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army for \n     committing crimes against humanity and mass atrocities, and \n     supports ongoing efforts by the United States and countries \n     in central Africa to remove Joseph Kony and Lord's Resistance \n     Army commanders from the battlefield;\n       (2) commends continued efforts by the Governments of \n     Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of \n     South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and other counties \n     in the region, as well as the African Union and United \n     Nations, to end the threat posed by the Lord's Resistance \n     Army;\n       (3) welcomes the ongoing efforts of the United States \n     Government to implement a comprehensive strategy to counter \n     the Lord's Resistance Army, pursuant to the Lord's Resistence \n     Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009, \n     and to assist governments in the region to bring Joseph Kony \n     to justice and end atrocities perpetuated by the Lord's \n     Resistance Army;\n       (4) calls on the President to keep Congress fully informed \n     of the efforts of the United States Government and to work \n     closely with Congress to identify and address critical gaps \n     and enhance United States support for the regional effort to \n     counter the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       (5) commends the Department of Defense, United States \n     Africa Command (U.S. AFRICOM), and members of the United \n     States Armed Forces currently deployed to serve as advisors \n     to the national militaries in the region seeking to protect \n     local communities and pursuing Joseph Kony and top Lord's \n     Resistance Army commanders;\n       (6) supports continued efforts by the Secretary of State \n     and representatives of the United States to work with partner \n     nations and the international community--\n       (A) to strengthen the capabilities of regional military \n     forces deployed to protect civilians and pursue commanders of \n     the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       (B) to enhance cooperation and cross-border coordination \n     among regional governments;\n       (C) to promote increased contributions from donor nations \n     for regional security and civilian efforts to address the \n     Lord's Resistance Army; and\n       (D) to enhance overall efforts to increase civilian \n     protection and provide assistance to populations affected by \n     the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       (7) calls on the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development, and the heads of other government \n     agencies to utilize existing funds for ongoing programs--\n       (A) to enhance mobility, intelligence, and logistical \n     capabilities for partner forces engaged in efforts to protect \n     civilians and apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and his top \n     commanders from the battlefield;\n       (B) to expand physical access and telecommunications \n     infrastructure to facilitate the timely flow of information \n     and access for humanitarian and protection actors;\n       (C) to support programs to encourage and help non-indicted \n     Lord's Resistance Army commanders, fighters, abductees, and \n     associated noncombatants to safely defect from the group, \n     including through radio and community programs; and\n       (D) to rehabilitate children and youth affected by war, \n     which are tailored to address the specific trauma and \n     physical and mental abuse they may face as a result of \n     indoctrination by the Lord's Resistance Army, and serve to \n     reconnect these children and youth with their families and \n     communities;\n       (8) calls for the President to place restrictions on any \n     individuals or governments found to be providing training, \n     supplies, financing, or support of any kind to Joseph Kony or \n     the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       (9) urges that civilian protection continue to be \n     prioritized in areas affected by the Lord's Resistance Army \n     and that steps be taken to inform potentially vulnerable \n     communities about known Lord's Resistance Army movements and \n     threats;\n       (10) welcomes the recent defections of men, women, and \n     children from the ranks of the Lord's Resistance Army, and \n     calls on governments in the region and the international \n     community to continue to support safe return, demobilization, \n     rehabilitation, and reintegration efforts; and\n       (11) urges the Governments of Uganda, the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo, the Republic of South Sudan, the Republic \n     of Sudan, and the Central African Republic to work together \n     to address the ongoing threat posed by the Lord's Resistance \n     Army.\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1942-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 403--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND \n LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN UNITED STATES V.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 403, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 403) to authorize testimony, document \n     production, and legal representation in United States v. \n     Richard F. ``Dickie'' Scruggs.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution concerns testimony, document \nproduction, and representation in a criminal matter pending in the \nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. \nIn this post-conviction proceeding, the defendant, Richard F. \n``Dickie'' Scruggs, is seeking to have his honest-services fraud \nconviction vacated based on the Supreme Court's intervening decision in \nthe case of United States v. Skilling.\n  The criminal conviction, which resulted from a guilty plea, involved \nthe defendant's scheme to bribe a State judge by agreeing to ask \nSenator Lott to consider the State judge's application to fill a \nfederal judicial vacancy. The defense is seeking testimony from a \nformer staffer of Senator Lott about a brief phone conversation between \nthe Senator and the State judge. Neither Senator Lott nor anyone on his \nstaff was aware of the defendant's scheme.\n  The defense is also seeking testimony and document production from a \nstaffer of Senator Cochran about contacts with Senator Cochran's office \nby or on behalf of the State judge in his efforts to obtain a federal \njudgeship.\n  Both Senators Lott and Cochran would like to assist by providing \nrelevant evidence from their staff in this proceeding. This resolution \nwould accordingly authorize Senator Lott's and Cochran's employees, and \nany other Senate employee from whom evidence may be necessary, to \nprovide evidence in this action, with representation by the Senate \nLegal Counsel.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 403) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 403\n\n       Whereas, in the case of United States vs. Richard F. \n     ``Dickie'' Scruggs, Case No. 3:09 CR 00002 GHD SAA, pending \n     in the United States District Court for the Northern District \n     of Mississippi, the defense has served a subpoena for \n     testimony on Hugh Gamble, a former employee of Senator Trent \n     Lott, and\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n     a subpoena for testimony and document production on Brad \n     Davis, an employee of Senator Thad Cochran;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C.

Mr. President, I have been able to listen a bit to the \nwonderful tributes over the last few hours to Senator Mikulski. We all \nknow of her wonderful service all these years, the record that is being \nshattered--a very special record.\n  As I listened to some of the comments, I was struck that tributes \nusually come in the Senate when one of our colleagues is leaving office \nor sometimes one of our colleagues passes away. And what I am struck by \nthis afternoon is how glad I am and colleagues on both sides of the \naisle are that Senator Mikulski is very much alive, and next week and \nnext month and in the years ahead she is going to continue to bring \nthis kind of wellspring of conscience and energy and passion and \nexpertise to the Senate.\n  I am going to have more to say in terms of a lengthier speech, but \nshe and I have had a special relationship for almost three decades. We \nserved together in the other body on the Energy and Commerce Committee. \nWe would often show up at meetings together, and this is still a \ntradition that continues now because we both have the honor of serving \non the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Senator Mikulski and I \nwould walk in together, and she would smile and say: Now the long and \nshort of it are arriving. And I guess that is true in a literal sense, \nbut while Senator Mikulski may be modest in stature, she has one very \nlarge record on behalf of the public interest, and I am especially \ngrateful for all she has done for people without power and people \nwithout clout.\n  When we think about what has so angered the American people--and I \nhave heard the Senator from Colorado, the Presiding Officer, talk about \nthis--it is that people feel so disconnected from government; that you \ncan have a community meeting in Oregon or Colorado or Maryland or some \nother part of the country, and somehow there is this sense what goes on \nin Washington really has nothing to do with people in their home \ncommunity.\n  Senator Mikulski doesn't practice public service that way. Senator \nMikulski has always felt, since the days when she was a community \norganizer and they were dealing with those community problems and where \nare you going to locate a freeway or something of that nature, that \npublic service and community service were always about being connected \nto people. She understood right away what people may say at a townhall \nmeeting now in Colorado or Oregon about government being removed from \ntheir lives, and for decades she has practiced a very different kind of \npublic service. She did it when she was a community organizer, she did \nit in the House of Representatives, and she continues to do it today.\n  Very often when we take the subway to a vote and I ask her what she \nhas done over the weekend, she will talk about families. She knows I \nwas codirector of the Gray Panthers for many years before I was elected \nto Congress, so we will talk about aging issues. And everybody knows \nwhat she has done in the aging field and her interest in fighting \nAlzheimer's. So it always comes back to people, and that connection she \nbrings to public service that is so lacking from what Americans see is \nthe big problem in government today, that much of what goes on here is \nsimply disconnected from their lives.\n  What I see in Barbara Mikulski is the real measure of what we want in \na public servant. We want someone who is conscientious, we want someone \nwho is smart, we want someone who has good values and someone who \nalways tries to be a coalition builder.\n  I have watched Senator Mikulski in lots of instances. We had one just \nrecently where Senator Mikulski was trying to find a balance on a \ndifficult and contentious issue between industry and the environment, \nand I watched how she was trying to listen to both sides. Maryland has \nsome communities where they have older plants, and if she can't take \nsteps to protect those plants and have the workers keep their jobs, a \nlot of people are going to hurt, and Senator Mikulski always tries to \nkeep that from happening. She has also said clean air and the \nenvironmental\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nlaws are important. And that last quality of trying to bring people \ntogether, which I have heard the Senator from Colorado talk about, is \nwhat Senator Mikulski's public service career has been all about.\n  So tonight and through the day we have heard colleagues pay tribute. \nI made mention of the fact that so often I hear these tributes when a \ncolleague is leaving the Senate. I would like to close these brief \nremarks by saying that I am especially grateful that the cause of good \ngovernment is enhanced by the fact that Senator Mikulski is very much \nalive. This is not a tribute to someone who is leaving office, this is \na tribute to someone who is going to be here next week, next month, and \nthe years ahead, continuing to shatter those records as she advocates \nfor people who don't have big lobbies, who don't have lots of political \nclout and can't go out and hire PR firms and well-paid and well-\ntailored advocates to walk the halls of the Senate. She is there for \nthose people who don't have a voice. She has been there for those \npeople ever since she was a community organizer in those early days in \nBaltimore.\n  When I think about trying to give public service a good name, I think \nabout Barbara Mikulski--our wonderful friend, Senator Barbara Mikulski, \nthe senior Senator from the State of Maryland. We thank her for giving \npublic service a good name. We thank her for taking on the battles and \nthe fights she has in the past. And we are all especially grateful that \nat the end of this tribute she will be back at her post a few seats \nfrom me, standing for those values and standing for those causes that \nare so important to the well-being of this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I may be the last speaker of the day, \nbut I did not want to leave the Chamber or the building without taking \na moment to come to the floor, as so many of our colleagues did today, \nto honor one of our own, one of our favorites. Not only is she a \nfavorite to us but I am certain beyond the shadow of a doubt that she \nis one of the favorite Senators ever to represent the State of \nMaryland. She is respected, she is beloved, and she is admired by \nmillions of her constituents from Maryland, but I can promise you that \nis true of constituents in Louisiana, potentially in your home State, \nMadam President, and throughout the world.\n  Last Saturday our friend and colleague Senator Barbara Mikulski of \nMaryland became the longest serving woman in the history of the \nCongress. I can only say that we have come a long way since the first \nwoman was appointed, as I recall back in the 1920s. She was only \nallowed to serve 1 day and was not going to be given a paycheck but \ninsisted that she be paid for her service. I think she might have been \npaid $1 for her service.\n  Of course, the record of that 1 day on the floor speaks for itself. \nWe have come a long way since that day. But Barbara Mikulski was first \nelected to the House in 1976, and then to the Senate 10 years later. \nWhen she first entered this Chamber, there was only one other woman \nhere, her friend and her good, strong, supportive colleague, Nancy \nKassebaum, a Republican from Kansas. So a Democrat from Maryland and a \nRepublican from Kansas, but the two of them were quite a team and \nBarbara Mikulski speaks fondly of her days with Senator Nancy \nKassebaum. Today there are 17 of us and proudly we continue that \ntradition of respect and bipartisanship set in large measure by two of \nthe women we greatly admire.\n  The late Representative Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts, who \nserved from 1925 to 1960, had previously held the record for the \nlongest serving woman in Congress. Breaking this record is only one of \nthe many milestones Senator Mikulski has accomplished during her tenure \nin the Senate. But, as she would so quickly say, it is not how long you \nserve but how well you serve. It is not the length of your service, as \nshe said to us so many times, but the quality of your service. We could \nnot have a better role model--in terms of effectiveness, strength, \ntenacity, courage, boldness--than in our own Senator Barbara Mikulski.\n  She was the first female Democrat, the first in the history of our \ncountry, to serve in both Chambers of Congress, the first female \nDemocrat to be elected to the Senate without succeeding a husband or a \nfather, and the first female to chair an Appropriations Committee.\n  I serve on the Appropriations Committee. It is one of the most \npowerful committees in our Congress. When I think about the fact that \nit took over 225 years for a woman to get the gavel on just one of the \n14 subcommittees--that number has changed over the decades--but if you \nthink about it, from the beginning of our country's history, those \nearly days through the expansion out West, through the Civil War, post-\nCivil War history, the early part of the 1900s, World War I, World War \nII--never did a woman hold a gavel to write one budget for one \ncommittee in the entire country, until Barbara Mikulski received one of \nthose gavels.\n  I can tell you from personal experience serving with her on that \ncommittee, our country is a better place--in health, in welfare, our \nspace program, our science and technology programs--because Barbara \nMikulski has used that gavel not to promote herself but to promote the \npeople she serves and the principles for which she fights.\n  She is well respected for her wisdom, for her tenacity and her \nstrength. She is respected by female and male peers who serve with her. \nAs most of my female colleagues in the Senate have also experienced, \nSenator Mikulski took me under her wing when I was first sworn in as a \nSenator. She extended her hand to help me in every way possible, to \nhelp me find my footing here as a Senator and to navigate through the \nintricacies of the Senate process. She was never too busy to hold out a \nhelping hand or for a pat on the shoulder. She was always willing to \ngive that extra advice and, I might say, was always willing to suggest \nthat you might have made a mistake--try it a little different way the \nnext time--not one to mince words, but as a good Big Sister would take \nus under her wing and help us out as any good Big Sister would do.\n  In addition to that wonderful, helpful, and thoughtful gesture that \nshe shared with me and so many, she has been an inspiration to many \nwomen, particularly young women who have looked up to her, trying to \nfollow in her footsteps.\n  I can only say that this Senate and this Congress--the people of \nMaryland, the people of our country and women throughout the world--\nhave been blessed by her leadership.\n  What has touched me the most about watching her is the fearlessness \nin which she serves. She does not back down. She knows herself, she is \ncomfortable in her own skin, and she doesn't try to be someone she is \nnot. She is very proud of her Polish-American background, always proud \nto talk about the bakery her parents owned, her immigrant background, \nand always so willing to share from her heart as well as her mind some \nof what she believes.\n  She has been nothing but an inspiration to me and to many. I am so \nglad I could come to the floor today, I am so glad. I think almost \nevery one of our colleagues has made it to the floor to honor her. When \nGod made Barbara Mikulski, he threw away the mold. I don't think there \nwill ever be one like her. There most certainly isn't anyone in \npolitics today who is like her. That is good, to be unique in that way. \nShe will be long remembered. I hope she will serve here for many \nwonderful years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/21/senate-section/article/S1946-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
