Madam President, no one can count the number of times this \nChamber has heard calls for compromise. That call has come from \nSenators of good faith, from Senators on both sides. Indeed, it is the \nvery essence of the legislative branch, which was purposefully designed \nto run on consensus by our Founding Fathers.\n  As Senators we search for the right arguments, and the right \nincentives that will help us strike the right balance--a balance that \nwill let the Senate and the country move forward. But there has been no \nstronger argument for bipartisanship than the series of budget votes \nover the past few days.\n  Last week, the Senate voted on two proposals--one written by \nRepublicans and one written by Democrats. Some Republicans voted \nagainst the Republican bill and some Democrats voted against the \nDemocratic bill. In the end, neither passed.\n  Yesterday, the House voted on another Republican proposal. Again, \nsome Republicans voted against their own party's plan--a lot of them \ndid--and some Democrats voted for the\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\nother party's plan. This time, it passed--but only because it had \nbipartisan support. We don't know what will happen when that same \nquestion comes before the Senate this week, but we know we won't see a \nstrictly party-line vote.\n  The lesson is obvious: Neither party can pass a bill without the \nother party, and neither Chamber can send that bill to the President \nwithout the other Chamber. Therefore, if you're looking for a case \nstudy on why cooperation is necessary, that is as clear as it comes.\n  It is just as obvious that we cannot meet in the middle if one side \nrefuses to give any ground. Both parties and both Houses must be \nwilling to work together. We cannot negotiate without a partner on the \nother side of the table. We will not find a solution in stubbornness.\n  I will repeat the request I have made since the beginning of the \nbudget debate. It is a request for reasonableness. It is the same call \nfor compromise and consensus that has always kept this diverse Nation \nmoving forward. It is the same appeal made by one of the great Senators \nin the history of this country--a Senator whose seat the Republican \nleader now holds. Kentucky's Henry Clay said:\n\n       All legislation is founded upon the principle of mutual \n     concession.\n\n  If the Senate and House cannot pass a long-term budget that keeps the \ncountry open for business, another reality will be made very plain for \nthe American people to see. It will be crystal clear which party was \nwilling to work toward a common goal and which party lacked the courage \nto compromise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1710-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I take this time to reflect with my \ncolleagues and say that we celebrate today the 1-year anniversary of \nthe passage of the Affordable Care Act, and to reflect how much \nhappened to improve health care in America since the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We have reason to celebrate. If you are a senior in the Medicare \nProgram, and you now know that you can see your primary care doctor \nevery year for an annual wellness exam, and that wellness exam will now \nbe covered under Medicare, and you will have an opportunity to meet \nwith your doctor and take charge of your own health, you have a reason \nto celebrate passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n  If you are a senior who happens to fall within the coverage gap under \nthe prescription drug benefits in Medicare, the so-called doughnut \nhole, and you have been forced at times to leave prescriptions on the \ncounter of a drugstore because you could not afford to pay the cost of \nthe prescription, and you now know that there is coverage in Medicare \nif you fall within that gap--for last year, 3.2 million seniors who \nfell within the gap received a $250 check. This year, the seniors who \nfall within this coverage gap will receive a 50-percent discount on \ntheir brandname drugs. Next year, their benefit will be worth as much \nas $2,400 and, by 2020, we will close the gap entirely, all as a result \nof the passage of the Affordable Care Act. So you have reason to \ncelebrate that Congress finally got the job done.\n  If you are an American family, like many, and you celebrate your \nchild's graduation from college, only to find that your child could no \nlonger be covered under your health insurance policy because of the age \nrestriction, and now you learn that Congress has changed that age to \n26, so you can keep your youngster under your family insurance program, \nand that child now has health insurance, and you are one of 1.2 million \npeople who benefit from this provision that was in the Affordable Care \nAct, you have reason to celebrate the passage of the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  If you are a small business owner who can now afford to cover your \nemployees because of the small business tax credit that was included in \nthe Affordable Care Act--4 million eligible institutions will be \neligible for that tax credit, and soon you will be able to get \ncompetitive rates. Small businesses today pay 20 percent more for the \nsame coverage large companies have. Congress took action last year to \neliminate that disparity. If you are one of those small business owners \nnow benefiting from that tax credit or who will benefit from more \ncompetitive rates and better choice, you have reason to celebrate the \npassage of the Affordable Care Act.\n  If you happen to be a consumer of health insurance, as almost all of \nus are, and you want value for your premium dollar, you now know that \nwith passage of the Affordable Care Act, the lion's share of your \nhealth premiums must go for health benefits, reining in the excessive \nadministrative costs of private insurance companies, and you know now \nthat Congress has taken action to prevent the abusive practices of \nprivate insurance companies, you have reason to celebrate the passage \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  If you happen to be the woman in Maryland, who was hiking in the \nmountains of West Virginia and fell off a cliff, was unconscious, and \nwas flown to the closest emergency room to receive care and was denied \ncoverage because she did not call ahead for preauthorization, you have \na reason to celebrate the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Yes, insurance companies have denied coverage for emergency care \nbecause of requirements for preauthorization or have denied coverage \nbecause the ultimate diagnosis did not meet their standard for \nreimbursement, even though your symptoms indicated you should seek \nemergency care. I started working on that issue in 1995, known as the \nprudent layperson's standards for requiring insurance companies to \nreimburse their policyholders for visits to emergency rooms, where \ntheir symptoms indicated they should go to the emergency room.\n  In 1997, Medicare and Medicaid were changed in order to provide for \nthe prudent layperson's standard for reimbursement. Now all insurance \ncompanies must comply with that standard because of the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  If you are a parent who has a child who has asthma or you have been \ntold that the insurance company won't provide full coverage because of \nyour child's preexisting condition, and now you can get full coverage \nfor your child, you too have a reason to celebrate the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  If you are an adult and have been told you cannot get insurance \nbecause of a preexisting condition, such as high blood pressure, or you \nhappen to be like a couple from Montgomery County, MD, who had to get \ntwo separate insurance policies because of preexisting conditions, \npaying two separate premiums and two separate deductibles, and now you \nknow you can get one insurance plan that will cover your family, you \nhave a reason to celebrate, because that too was corrected by the \nAffordable Care Act that was passed by Congress 1 year ago.\n  If you happen to be a taxpayer who is concerned about the fiscal \nsoundness of Medicare or the budget deficit, you too have a reason to \ncelebrate enactment of the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable \nCare Act extended the solvency of the Medicare system by 12 years, \nputting it on a safer basis, making it less vulnerable for our budget.\n  The enactment of the Affordable Care Act reduced the Federal budget \ndeficit by over $100 billion during the first 10 years, and over $1.5 \ntrillion during the first 20 years. This is because, quite frankly, \nthis bill manages illness much more cost effectively. It uses health \ninformation technology more effectively and it invests in wellness, and \nit brings down the cost. That is not what this\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\nSenator is saying has been established; it is what the CBO has told us \nwill bring in savings on our budget deficit. Taxpayers have a reason to \ncelebrate the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  There is one other reason to celebrate the year's anniversary of the \nenactment of this legislation. Let me give one more example. A couple \nof weeks ago I was at the Greater Baden Health Center located about 7 \nor 8 miles from where we are today. They are doing something about the \ninfant mortality rate in our community. We have too high of an infant \nmortality rate because of low birth weight babies. Some do not survive \nand become part of our infant mortality numbers in America where we are \nmuch higher than we should be. Others survive and have complications \nthat need to be addressed by our health care system, making it \nchallenging for the infant and expensive for our society.\n  At the Greater Baden Health Center, they are doing something about \nthat situation. They are expanding their qualified health center to \ninclude prenatal care so pregnant women can get the type of attention \nthey need to have healthy babies. That money comes from the Affordable \nCare Act because of the expansion of our qualified health centers.\n  We all celebrate what we are able to accomplish. It will keep our \nchildren healthier and save us money and have less use of the emergency \nrooms by expanding care at our qualified centers.\n  Madam President, if you are concerned about health disparities in \nAmerica--and you have reason to be--minorities are two times more \nlikely to suffer from diabetes and 33 percent more likely to die from \nheart disease. In the African-American community, the infant mortality \nrate is 2.3 times higher than the White community. When we look at the \nnumber of people who have access to health care and health insurance, \nthe minority population represents one-third. Yet they are one-half of \nthe people who do not have health insurance.\n  I think we all agree that we need to do something about that \nsituation. That is not right in our sense of fairness. But let me give \none more reason it will save us money.\n  A study done at Johns Hopkins University and the University of \nMaryland points out that we can save $260 billion in excess direct \nmedical care costs if we can deal with the minority health disparities. \nWe had done something about that in the Affordable Care Act. An \namendment that I was proud to offer established the Institute for \nMinority Health and Health Disparities within the National Institutes \nof Health. We have developed minority health and disparity offices in \neach of our agencies that deal with health care to do something about \nhealth disparities in America. We can all celebrate that we are able to \nmove that forward in the Affordable Care Act.\n  We should all take pride that America at long last, after decades of \nunsuccessful attempts, has acted. Health care is a right, not a \nprivilege. As our dear friend, the late Senator Kennedy, said: We no \nlonger have a sick care system. We have taken action to include all \nunder health care in America.\n  I understand the Republicans in the House want to repeal each and \nevery one of these improvements and accomplishments. They offer no hope \nof taking up these issues in a serious manner during this Congress. \nSpeaking on behalf of our seniors, speaking on behalf of our small \nbusiness owners, speaking on behalf of the consumers of health \ninsurance in America, speaking on behalf of what is right, as far as \ncovering and making sure everyone has access to affordable care, we do \nnot want to see that happen. We do not want to move backwards. We have \nreason to celebrate the accomplishments of moving forward with health \ncare. We want to move forward, not back, and continue to build on an \nAmerican health care system that provides affordable quality care to \nall Americans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1711-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the rising cost of gasoline has \nbecome a major source of concern for most Americans. With prices in \nmost States moving closer and closer to $4 a gallon, and already higher \nin some areas, America has a right to know where the President and \nDemocrats in Congress stand on the issue.\n  Let me begin this morning with a simple observation that it is no \naccident gas prices are skyrocketing at a time when Democrats control \ntwo-thirds of official Washington. It is no secret Democratic leaders \nin Washington do not particularly care for this issue. Ask them about \ngas prices and chances are they will tell you about some car they plan \nto build and have ready for production about 25 years down the road. \nSuggest we tap some of our domestic sources of oil and they will give \nyou 101 reasons we cannot and how that is not a real solution anyway \nbecause it will take too long to get it out of the ground.\n  We have been having that particular argument for decades now--\nliterally for decades. Then they have the audacity to step in front of \nthe cameras and tell us they are all for reducing our dependence on \nforeign sources of oil. With what--windmills?\n  It is time to be serious about a serious problem. The fact is, there \nis no reason in the world we cannot invest in future technologies at \nthe same time we are tapping into the resources we already have right \nhere at home and creating jobs while we do it. But Democrats do not \nseem to like that idea. They would rather force a change in behavior \nnow than giving struggling American families the relief they need from \nthe rising gas prices.\n  Do not listen to what they say on the issue, watch what they do. Here \nis what they have done.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Obama administration has delayed, revoked, \nsuspended, or canceled an enormous range of development opportunities.\n  One month after the President took office, his administration \ncanceled 77 oil and gas leases in Utah. Once the review was complete, \nthe administration refused to reinstate even a single one.\n  A month after that, the administration shortened lease terms for \noffshore oil and gas production and raised fees for permit \napplications.\n  Last January, it announced new restrictions for onshore oil and gas \nexploration in the mountain West.\n  Last February, it denied a permit to build a bridge needed to access \nan oil-producing field in Alaska, after the Environmental Protection \nAgency designated a nearby river an aquatic resource of national \nimportance.\n  Last April, the administration suspended 61 oil and gas leases in \nMontana that were issued in 2008 and then announced that all oil and \ngas leases in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota would be delayed \nindefinitely.\n  Last May, the President announced a 6-month moratorium on deepwater \ndrilling--a moratorium that has been repeatedly struck down in the \ncourts.\n  The list of actions such as these go on and on, and that is to say \nnothing of the proposed new Environmental Protection Agency regulations \non energy that would either cause oil refineries to pass along their \nresulting new production costs to consumers at the pump or drive them \nand their jobs overseas.\n  Let there be no doubt, the efforts of the White House are costing \njobs and putting even more pressure on gas prices. Paying lipservice to \nthe public's concerns will not solve the problem. Unlocking our own \nsources of energy at home would help immensely.\n  Just to give an idea of the kind of resources we have right here at \nhome, consider that just one 2,000-acre section of the nonwilderness \nsections of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, along with the Chukchi \nand Beaufort Seas, have enough recoverable oil to replace crude imports \nfrom the Persian Gulf for nearly 65 years--65 years.\n  The problem is not that we need to look elsewhere for energy. The \nproblem\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\nis that Democrats in Washington will not let us use it. The problem is \nthat even with gas prices on the rise, they want to tax it even more.\n  Let's make this simple. I am going to propose just two concrete \npractical things we can do in Washington to give the American people \nsome relief, create jobs, and help us be less dependent on foreign \nsources of oil, two ideas that would have wide bipartisan support. \nLet's increase American energy production, and let's block any new \nregulations that will drive up the production costs for energy. These \nare two ideas that will create jobs and alleviate the increasing \npressure on gas prices.\n  Let's leave the ideology aside and do some practical good for \nAmericans who are struggling out there. Let's increase American \nproduction of energy with American jobs and stop the job-stifling \nregulations.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we are all facing the challenge of \ngasoline prices adding a new burden to family budgeting as well as \nsmall businesses and large businesses alike. It couldn't come at a \nworse time, in light of our recession and unemployment. But it is \nimportant for us to put into perspective where we are and how we should \nresolve this issue.\n  When we look at the entire known reserves of oil and gas in the \nworld--in the entire world--the United States has 3 percent--3 \npercent--and each year the United States consumes 25 percent of the \nenergy that is used in the world. So when I hear my colleagues on the \nother side come to the floor and say we can drill our way out of this, \nI say to them: That is unrealistic and doesn't reflect the reality of \nwhat we face today.\n  Yes, we should have responsible drilling for oil and gas. We should \nbe sensitive to the environment to avoid the kind of hazards and \naccidents we saw in the Gulf of Mexico, to protect that part of America \nand part of the world we believe should be preserved for future \ngenerations. But the notion if we could start drilling more our \nproblems would go away is not only naive, it is wrong--flatout wrong.\n  We heard the chants of ``drill, baby, drill'' a year and a half ago \nin the course of a Presidential campaign. It is not the answer to \nAmerica's energy policy, ever. We still import $1 billion worth of oil \na day into the United States. It is an indication of our dependence on \nforeign oil that any interruption in the Middle East or from other \nsources is going to raise our prices.\n  What should we do about it? Several things. First, on the immediate \nagenda, we should look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The \nPresident has to decide--and said Friday he was considering--on \nreleasing oil we have saved in this reserve to bring down prices and \nkeep the economy moving forward. I support that. I hope the President \nwill do that.\n  Secondly, we have to look at ways that the current oil pricing is \nbeing gamed by some financiers and speculators. From my point of view, \nthis is something that needs to be not only examined but stopped. This \nspeculation in oil prices runs up prices way too high, way too fast.\n  Third, take a look at the oil companies themselves. The top five oil \ncompanies are extremely profitable and, in the midst of crises, they \nmake even more money. That is the reality.\n  Then, we need to step back and look at our national energy policy. \nHow do we encourage the use of more efficient cars and trucks? Well, we \ndon't do it by entertaining the amendment by the Republican leader in \nthe Senate. He says the Environmental Protection Agency should step \nback from even encouraging the kind of fuel efficiency in cars and \ntrucks which reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce pollution \nin the atmosphere. That is a step backward to the past. It is a \nrejection of basic science.\n  So when the Republican leader comes to the floor and gives his \nprescription for today's energy challenge in America, I would say to \nhim: The patient is not going to get well, Senator, with your \nprescription. We have to have a coordinated energy policy moving toward \nfuel efficiency, reducing the use of energy, and still fueling our \neconomy with renewable and sustainable sources of energy that don't \npollute the atmosphere.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, who was giving us a speech this morning \nabout energy, actually has an amendment he is preparing for the floor \nwhich removes the right of the Environmental Protection Agency to even \ndeal with greenhouse gas emissions as they affect climate change and \nthe world we live in. That is a stick-your-head-in-the-sand approach to \nan issue which future generations will look back on and say: What were \nthey thinking; that they would ignore the reality of climate change in \nthe world and the reality of what pollution is doing to our lungs, our \nhealth, our future. It is a reality that is being rejected by the \nRepublican side of the aisle.\n  Madam President, I ask how much time is remaining in morning \nbusiness?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Four minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1712-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1712-S1713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANNIVERSARY OF HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is the 1-year anniversary of the \nPresident's signing of health care reform, and I am happy to stand and \nsay it represents one of the most important pieces of legislation in \ndecades. For too long, we let our Nation's health care crisis grow and \nignored it. People who said let the market work its will, have to be \nhonest about what the market did. The market started excluding people \nwho had preexisting conditions--and who among us doesn't? The market \nstarted charging higher and higher prices for health insurance. The \nmarket, unfortunately, was uncontrollable.\n  We tried to deal with it, to bring pricing under control and deal \nwith the realities families face across America. When I was in the most \nheated debate about the health care bill with tea party devotees in \nfront of my office in Springfield, I told them: Let me tell you about \nsome of the people in Illinois I have met. At some point, the tea party \npeople said: Stop telling stories, Durbin. We don't want to hear any \nmore stories. Of course, they don't because those stories are the \nreason we did this. Those stories represent real lives.\n  Let me tell one of those stories, representing a family who comes \nfrom East Peoria, IL. This is Jill and Ric Lathrop. They have two sons, \nSam and Nat. One of them has a Superman t-shirt on. They are 12 and 14 \nyears old and they have severe hemophilia. It is a rare and costly \nmedical condition.\n  Thanks to the twice-weekly injections of blood clotting replacement \nfactor they receive, the boys are able to live happy and healthy \nlives--and they look pretty darn good in that picture. That lifesaving \nmedication costs roughly $250,000 per child, per year.\n  For years, the family has lived in fear they would reach the lifetime \nlimit of their insurance plan. That was a reality. Many of these plans \nhad a ceiling that paid no more beyond a certain amount. Well, it \nhappened to them in 2005. The hospital where Ric works as an MRI \ntechnician instituted a $2 million lifetime cap on benefits. For most \nfamilies, that wouldn't even be an issue, but for the Lathrops, who \nknow their annual medical expenses will always total hundreds of \nthousands of dollars to keep their boys alive, that was devastating.\n  Rather than waiting for their benefits to run out, the Lathrops moved \nto Peoria, where Ric found a job that provided insurance without \nlifetime limits. He moved his family and found a job to get an \ninsurance policy that would keep their boys alive. When the open \nenrollment period for their health insurance plan rolled around, they \nwaited on edge to see if their insurance would, once again, institute \nan annual or lifetime limit on care that would force them to move again \nto ensure adequate coverage for their sons.\n  Thanks to the bill we passed last year, insurance companies can no\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\nlonger place lifetime limits on care. Think about what that means to \nthis family who picked up and moved and looked for a new job to get \nhealth insurance to keep their boys alive. Is that what America should \nbe? I think not.\n  Let me be very blunt about this. As good as this law was, it was not \nperfect. There are things that need to be addressed, examined, and \nchanged. I have said before, and say again, the only perfect law was \nwritten on stone tablets and carried down a mountain by ``Senator \nMoses.'' Everybody else has been trying and hasn't quite hit that \nstandard. So let's be humble about this and be open to change. But \nlet's not repeal this, as the Republicans have called for time and \nagain. Let's not say to the Lathrop family: Sorry. You are on your own \nif another lifetime limit comes along that may literally endanger the \nlives of these two beautiful little blue-eyed boys.\n  That is what this debate is about. It is a story about a real family. \nThat is why the other side hates to hear these stories, because the \nstories literally explain why stepping backward in time and repealing \nhealth care is exactly the wrong course for America.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we are just about 1 year to the day \nfrom the day the President signed into law the health care law that is \ngoing to have an impact on all the people of this country. Here we are, \n1 year later and we know a lot more about this law and people all \naround the country know a lot more about this law.\n  I spent part of the weekend visiting folks in Buffalo, WY, attending \nthe Buffalo health fair. A health fair is a place in the community \nwhere people get together and get their blood tested ahead of time. It \nis very inexpensive. It is based on prevention and early detection--\nissues this health care law was supposed to address but has failed \nmiserably at. At the health fair, I talked to people who were getting \ntheir blood results back, checking their cholesterol, checking their \nblood sugars to see about diabetes, checking their thyroid levels, and \nas these people were getting their blood tested--and many people, \nprobably half the population of Buffalo, turned out to have their blood \ntested--they started asking me questions about the health care law, the \nkind of questions any American would be concerned about: Am I going to \nlose my freedoms? Am I still going to be able to keep my doctor? Will \nit truly get the cost of care down?\n  Regrettably, this health care law, now 1 year since it has been \nsigned, turns out to actually be bad for patients, bad for providers--\nthe nurses and the doctors who take care of those patients--and bad for \nthe taxpayers, the people left footing the bill because we know a lot \nmore now, 1 year after the law was passed, than we did when it was \npassed.\n  People remember this as the law that was crammed through the Senate \nin the dead of night, written behind closed doors, and all the unseemly \nbargains that were cut to convince Senators to vote for it, getting by \non the barest number of votes. There were things such as the cornhusker \nkickback, the Louisiana purchase--the sort of things that offended \npeople all across this country. So people are upset with this health \ncare law, No. 1, in the way it was passed: In spite of the fact the \nPresident promised it would be seen on C-SPAN, all the discussions were \nheld behind closed doors and despite the fact that many Americans never \nhad a chance to read this 2,700-page law.\n  When the President made his initial speech about what he was aiming \nto accomplish in health care reform, I said that would be great. I am \nan orthopedic surgeon, practiced medicine for 25 years, and I think we \nneed to do the sorts of things the President initially addressed. \nUnfortunately, the health care law went in the opposite direction. When \npeople worked their way through the 2,700-page bill, they found that \ninstead of lowering the cost of care, the cost of their care was going \nto go up; instead of allowing people to keep the doctor they wanted, \nthey were going to, unfortunately, have to change that situation. That \nis why I have been coming to the floor week after week with a doctor's \nsecond opinion about this health care law.\n  So here we are, 1 year later. We know the cost of health care is \ngoing up. The President said health care premiums would be lower for \nfamilies by $2,500. No family has seen that--or none that I know of; \ncertainly none I have talked to in Wyoming, not one. Instead, people \nhave seen the cost of their health insurance going up, not down.\n  The President said he was never going to raise taxes. It turns out, \nin fact, there are a lot of tax increases as part of this health care \nlaw. Even the 1099 form Senator Johanns has championed on the part of \nsmall businesses around the country, the efforts to remove these \nonerous obligations on our small businesses, have nothing to do with \nhealth care. That got crammed into this bill in the dead of night so \nthose who support the bill can claim it was going to lower the cost. \nEven the Congressional Budget Office admits costs are going up, not \ndown, and this is absolutely impacting jobs.\n  The President promised there would be efforts for small businesses to \nhave some advantages and some tax credits and some help, but what we \nfound out is that if you have a small business with 10 employees and \nthat number climbs to 11, you are going to lose some of those benefits. \nIf you are paying your employees an average of over $25,000 a year and \nyou want to give them a raise, you start losing some of the benefits. \nSo in spite of the fact the President had 4 million postcards sent out \nto small business owners, very few of them have been able to take \nadvantage of what was promised to them.\n  Now here we are where additional waivers are being given. We are at a \npoint where over 2.5 million Americans have been given waivers from \nparticipating in the health care law. Interestingly enough, these are \nthe very people, for the most part--a significant number--who lobbied \nfor the bill. Once they found out what was in it, they said no, I don't \nwant this to apply to me. Now we see that the State of Maine, the \nentire State of Maine, has been given a waiver.\n  I come to the floor today, a year after this has passed into law, and \nI say everybody in the country ought to be able to get a waiver and opt \nout of this health care law, opt out completely. These are decisions \nthat should be made at the State level, at the local level. \nWashington's ``one size fits all'' has hardly ever worked for anything \nand it surely does not work for health care.\n  In Wyoming, at the Wyoming Health Fair in Buffalo, as I visited with \npeople and talked to them, do you know what they are worried about? \nThey are worried about losing their freedoms, losing their choice, \nlosing their doctor, losing the health care plan they like. In spite of \nthe President's promises, we know that about 80 percent of people who \nget their health insurance through small businesses are not going to be \nable to keep the health care they like. Why? Because of government \nmandates. Government has said we know what is best for you. You do not, \nwe do. The government says: We know what is best for your family. \nGovernment doesn't know what is best. These ought to be local \ndecisions. That is why Senator Lindsey Graham and I and a number of \nother cosponsors have introduced legislation to allow States to opt out \nof this health care law, opt out of the individual mandate, the \nrequirement that forces Americans to buy government-approved insurance.\n  Let States make that decision if people in their own State need to \nlive under those laws. Let States decide if the employers, the people \nwho are the job creators in our communities, if they have to supply \ngovernment-approved insurance to the people who live there. Let people \nmake decisions at the local level.\n  You can lift any newspaper and look at what the Medicaid mandates are \ndoing to our States and the budgets of the States. States such as \nWyoming, where we balance our budgets every\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\nyear and live within our means, are being crushed by these Medicaid \nmandates. But it is not just small States such as Wyoming, in terms of \npopulation--California, New York, States all across the country are \nsaying to this body: Let us out, let us opt out. We cannot live under \nthese mandates.\n  The President's solution is to cram more people onto Medicaid, a \nprogram that doesn't work, where many doctors will not see these \npatients, where the reimbursements are so low hospitals say we cannot \nafford to see these patients because of the impact it will have. Even \nthe actuaries, the people who look at this in the fair and appropriate \nway to look at the numbers, say 15 percent of the hospitals in this \ncountry 10 years from now may not be able to be open because of the way \nthis health care law is going. That is not going to provide more \naccess. It is providing less access.\n  Why have seniors rejected this so overwhelmingly? Seniors have looked \nat this and they see $500 billion in Medicare cuts, in things such as \nMedicare Advantage. There is an advantage to being in that program. \nThat is why one out of four seniors has set up that program and chosen \nthat program. It is because they want choice.\n  This health care law is one that is taking choice out of the hands of \nthe American families, taking freedom out of the hands of the American \nfamilies. Something I continue to hear from the people in Wyoming and \nacross the country: We need to repeal and replace with commonsense \nsolutions to allow people to buy insurance across State lines, make it \nlegal to do that; to allow small businesses to pool their resources; to \ngive incentives to individuals who go to something like the Wyoming \nHealth Fair; and work on prevention and early detection of problems. \nGive those people the opportunity to make individual choices. Expand \nhealth savings accounts. Those are the sorts of things we can deal with \nin a responsible way to help American families get the care they want \nfrom the doctor they need at a price they can afford.\n  That is all the American people are asking for: the care they need \nfrom the doctor they want at a price they can afford. They are not \ngetting it under this health care law. It has now been enacted for a \nfull year. The American people know the truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to also speak about the \nhealth care bill.\n  The first anniversary of a new law should be a time to celebrate good \npolicy, one would think. The mood surrounding the new health care law \nis much different. One year later, Americans are demanding as loudly as \never that we repeal it. That is not surprising, considering the almost \nconstant flow of bad news, broken promises, higher costs, and sky-\nrocketing health insurance premiums.\n  We did not need a year of bad news and broken promises to know this \nnew law was bad policy. It was fraught with problems even before it hit \nthe Senate floor. Many of us pointed out the inevitable problems within \nthis legislation. We warned how this law was predicated on faulty \naccounting that would exacerbate our current and future fiscal \nproblems.\n  It is simply irresponsible and short-sighted to argue that \nlegislation will reduce the debt when it is filled with budget \ngimmicks. But that is exactly what Congress did when passing this \nlegislation, and we are paying the price.\n  The administration now admits that the funding elements of this law \ndo not add up. For example, in testimony before the Finance Committee, \nHHS Secretary Sebelius described the newly created CLASS Act \nentitlement as ``totally unsustainable.'' Furthermore, in recent \ncongressional testimony, Secretary Sebelius was asked whether the \nMedicare cuts in the law are used to save Medicare or pay for the \nhealth care law. Remarkably, she responded ``both.'' Even a young child \nknows you can't spend a dollar on a new toy and then spend that exact \nsame dollar to buy an ice cream cone. It is wonderland accounting and \neven the administration's own Medicare actuary seems to agree. He said \nthe Medicare reductions in the law ``cannot be simultaneously used to \nfinance other Federal outlays (such as the coverage expansions . . . ) \nand to extend the trust fund.''\n  Double-counting this money is completely illogical and the American \npeople can see through the smoke-screen long ago. But the fiscal \nproblems with this legislation are not even the half of it. As a former \nGovernor, I shared my concern that putting 16 million people into the \nbroken Medicaid Program is a fatal flaw of this law. Medicaid \nbeneficiaries already have a huge problem finding doctors to treat \nthem. Nationwide, 40 percent of doctors will not see a Medicaid \npatient.\n  The Medicaid expansion is like giving someone a free bus ticket, and \nthen taking the bus away.\n  But instead of addressing this problem, the law exacerbates the \nproblem by doubling the number of people on the broken system--\nMedicaid. If you have an airplane that is already overweight, you \nwouldn't decide to double the number of passengers to solve the \nproblem, yet that is exactly what the law prescribes.\n  But even if you overlook the access nightmares created by this \nexpansion, our States simply cannot afford it. States are already \nstruggling to pay their bills and now we are heaping more obligations \non them. As a former Governor it breaks my heart we are making those \nproblems even greater.\n  That is why cash-strapped States are begging us for relief from the \ncrushing Medicaid mandate headed their way.\n  One didn't have to be a fortune teller to predict the budgetary panic \nspreading from State capitol to State capitol.\n  And for what benefit? One year later, many of the promises that were \nused to sell this law have been debunked. For example, remember the \nPresident saying ``if you like your plan, you can keep it''? Turns out, \nthat's not exactly true. Again, the administration's own Medicare \nactuary concluded that the President's promise is ``not true in all \ncases.'' Turns out truth seems to be more the exception than the rule \nwith this law. One of the administration's own estimates projects as \nmany as 80 percent of small businesses being forced to give up their \ncurrent coverage within the next 2 years.\n  Remember the President promising that he would not sign into law any \nlegislation that did not bring down the cost curve?\n  In June 2009, President Obama claimed that any health care \nlegislation must control costs. He said, ``If any bill arrives from \nCongress that is not controlling costs, that's not a bill I can \nsupport. It's going to have to control costs.'' One is left to wonder \nwhy the President signed this law since his own actuaries estimated it \nwould increase Federal health care spending by $310 million.\n  Earlier this year, the Medicare actuary provided a moment of sad \ntruth. He testified that President Obama's promise that the health care \nlaw would lower costs was ``false, more so than true.'' That is so \nastonishing that I will repeat it again--the administration's own \nexperts said the President's promise was false, more so than true. That \nis astonishing.\n  Remember how the President promised that the health care law would \nbring down the cost of insurance premiums? As a presidential candidate, \nPresident Obama promised no fewer than 20 times that he would cut \npremiums by $2,500 for the average family by the end of the first term. \nYet the average employee's health insurance premium has risen by nearly \n$1,100 per family since President Obama took office. A recent New York \nTimes article highlighted this missed opportunity:\n\n       Groups of 20 or more workers have been experiencing premium \n     increases of around 20 percent, insurance agents say, while \n     smaller groups are seeing increases of 40 percent to 60 \n     percent or more.\n\n  Finally, the first year of implementing this law provides clear \nevidence that the administration does not think this health care bill \nis good for everyone. The administration has now granted over one \nthousand waivers to certain States, employers, unions, and insurance \ncompanies, allowing them to be exempt from several of the law's new \nmandates.\n  The plans approved for waivers cover nearly 3 million individuals. If \nthe law is so popular and so beneficial, why are we exempting almost 3 \nmillion people while the other 300 million have to live with its higher \npremiums and mandates? This and many other questions\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\nhave yet to be answered by the administration.\n  However, the President's recent budget request does outline his game \nplan to advance this flawed policy. The current strategy seems to be \nspending more taxpayer dollars to continue to try to convince a \nskeptical public that the health care law is good policy; and if they \ndon't agree, use an enforcement hammer to ensure compliance.\n  Buried within the President's budget is a request for a 315 percent \nincrease for the public affairs office at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. One of the primary tasks of the Public Affairs Office \nis to sell the health care reform law to the American people. \nFurthermore, they also requested a whopping 1,270 new Internal Revenue \nService agents to implement the law and to enforce its individual \nmandate and other related provisions.\n  While Speaker Pelosi may have advocated passing the bill so that we \ncould learn what is in it, many Americans were not so naive. They \nunderstand that you can't spend the same dollar twice. They understand \nthat if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. They know \nwhen someone shows up from the government offering a carrot, there is \nprobably a stick not far behind.\n  Last year, a real opportunity to craft health care policy on a \nbipartisan basis was squandered. That missed opportunity will continue \nto haunt us.\n  Unfortunately, I worry that the second year under the oppressive \nprovisions of this law will be no better than the last. It is \nregrettable that we have reached this point, having known so many of \nthese problems existed before this law passed. But of course we were \nwarned.\n  So, I will use the occasion of the solemn first anniversary to \nredouble my efforts to right the wrong.\n  We will work to wipe this misguided law from the books to protect the \nrights of Americans to choose their doctor, select their insurance, and \ntrust in their own good judgment. Many are committed to the cause. I \nbelieve it will happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1715-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We cut \nthis budget a year ago, we are cutting it this year, and we will be \nback for further cuts next year.\n  My amendment says that as Congress pursues comprehensive debt \nreduction while conducting major military action on two fronts, all in \nthe midst of a fragile economic recovery, Congress still should not be \nexempt from the pain. Fiscal restraint starts at home and with our own \nbudget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I rise to agree with my colleague from \nNebraska, to support his amendment, and to congratulate him for his \nnewfound enthusiasm for this idea.\n  Actually, on January 10, the House of Representatives passed a rule \nto reduce its spending by 5 percent. This measure was passed on a \nrollcall vote of 410 to 13. Soon thereafter, I was the first Senator to \ncall on my colleagues in the Senate to cut their office expenditures by \n5 percent. This small but symbolic step could save the taxpayers over \n$20 million.\n  On February 4, some 6 weeks ago, I requested unanimous consent to \ntake up a sense-of-the-Senate resolution I authored, urging all \nSenators to take such action. Unfortunately, at that time and since \nthen, there has been an objection from the other side of the aisle to \nthis unanimous consent request.\n  My effort was bipartisan. I was joined by 14 of my colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and I thank them.\n  We now have an agreement to take up my sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nby unanimous consent later in the day so as to expedite and refine \nenactment of the provisions of the Nelson amendment. Based on that \nunderstanding----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WICKER. I commend the Senator from Nebraska for coming to this \nidea somewhat late. But I support his amendment nonetheless.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is there any time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no time remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 41 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Sessions\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The amendment (No. 182) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this bipartisan amendment is supported by \nme; Chair Landrieu; Senator Kerry, the former chair of the committee; \nSenator Coburn; and Senator Webb.\n  This amendment is based on a report that was conducted by the Small \nBusiness Committee back in 2008, when Senator Kerry was chair of the \ncommittee, and we both requested an investigation into the National \nVeterans Business Development Corporation, also known as TVC, and found \negregious mismanagement. TVC was engaged in mismanagement, misuse of \ntaxpayer money, and did not abide by its statutory obligations.\n  Our committee issued a very detailed report explaining how they \nmisused hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. In light of \nour investigation and subsequent efforts, they do not receive any \nfederal appropriations now.\n  But we want to remove them from statute so they do not have any \nFederal linkage, any Federal charter, or any ability to use the \nauspices of the Federal Government for any activities in the future.\n  So I urge support of this amendment and note that both the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars and the American Legion supported discontinuing the \nfunding for this organization, after our report was released.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I will speak for just a moment, if I \ncould.\n  I know people in Washington and people in America do not believe we \ncan actually eliminate a program. We are getting ready to eliminate one \nnow in a bipartisan fashion to cut funding and to cut a program that \nhas not worked. I just want to underline that we most certainly can do \nthat in a bipartisan way. That is what this vote is about.\n  I do not believe there is any opposition, so I yield back the \nremaining time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The motion to reconsider is \nconsidered made and laid on the table.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the distinguished Republican leader for 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Appropriations\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I say to my friend and leader and to all \nmy colleagues, it is of deep concern to the Secretary of Defense and to \nthis Member, and I am sure many other Members, that we are defending \nthis Nation on a 2-week-to-2-week basis, and it is harming our ability \nto defend this Nation's national security. I know we are probably now \ngoing to go into another 3-week continuing resolution.\n  Is it the intention of the Republican leader, along with myself and \nothers, that we will not do another continuing resolution unless we \ntake up a Defense appropriations bill for the year? We can't do this to \nthe men and women who are serving--deprive them of the equipment, the \ntraining, and wherewithal--when we are in two wars. It is vital, in my \nview, that we not allow another continuing resolution without \naddressing the Defense appropriations bill for, hopefully, what should \nbe the remainder of the year.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Arizona, he is entirely \ncorrect. I don't intend, myself, to support another continuing \nresolution. It does not contain the full-year Defense appropriations \nbill. I think everybody understands the urgency of that. My friend from \nArizona, our leader on these issues, has been very clear and articulate \nabout it. I can say with total confidence that the House and Senate are \nnot going to be passing another continuing resolution without the \nfunding for the Defense Department for the remainder of this fiscal \nyear.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Republican leader, and I thank my colleague \nfrom Louisiana. I hope this message is transmitted to our friends and \ncolleagues on the other side of the Capitol; that they should not send \nover another CR without funding the Defense Department for the rest of \nthe year.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend, I believe his position is \nshared by the leadership of our party in the House, and I think there \nis no chance we will not complete work on the Defense appropriations \nbill in the next few weeks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, before I get into the business before \nus, which is SBIR and STTR reauthorization, a very important small \nbusiness program, let me just add a few thoughts to the colloquy of the \nSenator from Arizona and the minority leader. I would most certainly \nsupport that view, and there may be others on the Democratic side who \nfeel that way as well. As chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nCommittee, let me be very clear that I don't think we should go to \nanother short-term CR without a full-year appropriation of Homeland \nSecurity. Not only is the Defense Department appropriations bill \nabsolutely essential to the well-being of this Nation, but so is the \nHomeland Security budget. They have complete jurisdiction over Customs \nand Immigration, over safety and security at our ports and our airports \nand train stations. We most certainly can't let our guard down as it \npertains to our overseas operations, but we absolutely cannot let our \nguard down as it pertains to our safety here at home.\n  I hope both Republican and Democratic leadership, as we find our way \nthrough this complicated and difficult appropriations process, will \nremember Defense and Homeland Security.\n  I see Senator Cornyn on the floor. I know he is going to call up, \nwith no objection from me, his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 216\n\n  Before that, I ask unanimous consent to call up Casey amendment No. \n216 to be put in the pending column. Senator Casey will be here shortly \nto discuss his amendment, and then we will go in just a minute to \nSenator Cornyn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for Mr. Casey, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 216.\n\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require contractors to notify small business concerns that \n   have been included in offers relating to contracts let by Federal \n                               agencies)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. SUBCONTRACTOR NOTIFICATIONS.\n\n       Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(13) Notification Requirement.--\n       ``(A) In general.--An offeror with respect to a contract \n     let by a Federal agency that is to be awarded pursuant to the \n     negotiated method of procurement that intends to identify a \n     small business concern as a potential subcontractor in the \n     offer relating to the contract shall--\n       ``(i) notify the small business concern that the offeror \n     intends to identify the small business concern as a potential \n     subcontractor in the offer; and\n       ``(14) Reporting by Subcontractors.--The Administrator \n     shall establish a reporting mechanism that allows a \n     subcontractor to report fraudulent activity by a contractor \n     with respect to a subcontracting plan submitted to a \n     procurement authority under paragraph (4)(B).''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Our intention is for Senator Casey to have an \nopportunity when he comes to the floor.\n  Before Senator Cornyn speaks, for just one moment I wish to add a few \ncomments about what happened this morning. We did get two amendment \nvotes on the bill. Those were the first two amendments, the Nelson of \nNebraska amendment, and then Senator Snowe and I offered an amendment. \nWe have approximately six other amendments pending not yet scheduled \nfor a vote. Most of them were discussed at some length yesterday on the \nfloor, the most notable Senator McConnell's amendment, which Senator \nBoxer and others strongly opposed.\n  I wish to say one thing, as respectfully as I can, in response to a \ncomment Senator Wicker made regarding the Nelson amendment. He said \nsomething along the lines that Senator Nelson had found some new--how \ndid he say it--new-found enthusiasm for cutting the budget. In defense \nof Senator Nelson, I wish to say his enthusiasm is most certainly not \nnew found. He has been a leader on our side in cutting the agencies and \ndepartments respectfully and appropriately under his jurisdiction. He \nhas been the lead sponsor of legislation for a long time that has cut \nlegislative spending. I might say it is very difficult with his bill \nbecause he also has had to absorb $22 million in additional expenses \nrelated to the operation of the Visitor Center which all of our \nconstituents enjoy and support. So he has absorbed that into his \noperating budget and still managed to cut.\n  I know Senator Wicker is relatively new to the Senate, but I do wish \nto remind him and others that Senator Nelson has been a leader in that \nfield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 186\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a bipartisan commission for the purpose of \n   improving oversight and eliminating wasteful government spending)\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 186 and ask for its immediate consideration, and I ask \nunanimous consent that any pending amendments be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 186.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, March 15, 2010, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this is a very important amendment, \nwhich addresses the three critical issues that face our country today: \ntoo many people out of work, the Federal Government engaged in runaway \nspending, and our unsustainable national debt. This actually comes from \na portion of President Barack Obama's fiscal commission report, which \npointed out a Texas program that had been in place since 1977 and its \nimpact on providing oversight and review of wasteful or no longer \nneeded programs for spending.\n  That is what this amendment does. It establishes a bipartisan U.S. \nAuthorization and Sunset Commission.\n  Actually, it would be composed of eight Members of Congress, who \nwould go through programs that have spending associated with them but \nhave not been authorized by the Congress, and who review redundancies \nand duplicative programs such as those pointed out most significantly \nby the General Accounting Office within the last week to 10 days.\n  As I said, this is modeled after the sunset process that my State \ninstituted in 1977, which has been enormously successful. It has \neliminated more than 50 different State agencies and saved taxpayers in \nthe hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Vitter, Enzi, DeMint, Rubio, \nPaul, Ensign, Ayotte, and Risch be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This is what the President's own fiscal commission has \nsaid about such a concept. I know Members of the Senate and the \npolitical parties are divided about many things, but this is something \nthat should be noncontroversial and should be bipartisan. I hope my \ncolleagues will listen briefly and consider cosponsoring and joining us \nin passing this important amendment establishing this sunset \ncommission. Again, this is what the President's own fiscal commission \nsaid about this concept:\n\n       Such a committee has been recommended many times, and has \n     found bipartisan support. The original and arguably most \n     effective committee exists at the State level in Texas. The \n     legislature created a sunset commission in 1977 to eliminate \n     waste and inefficiency in government agencies. Estimates from \n     reviews conducted between 1982 and 2009 showed 27-year \n     savings of over $780 million, compared with expenditures of \n     $28.6 million. Based on the estimated savings achieved, for \n     every dollar spent on the sunset process, the State received \n     $27 in return.\n\n  We all know the challenges we face in Washington when it comes to \nproper oversight. Once programs are created--even so-called temporary \nprograms--they tend to take on a life of their own. Indeed, I think \nthat must be what Ronald Reagan was talking about in one of my favorite \nquotations, when he said that ``the closest thing to eternal life here \non earth is a temporary government program.''\n  We all know what happens once a program is created. A constituency is \ncreated, and they come in and ask for a cost of living or other \nincrease, and they grow and grow, and there is no one--I am not \ncriticizing the standing committees, but there is not adequate time or \nopportunity given to looking at these programs to see whether they are \nstill needed or whether their budgets are justified. So you see these \nprograms growing and Federal spending growing and no real time and \neffort given to cutting out wasteful spending and eliminating programs \nthat have not been authorized or which are duplicative or redundant, as \npointed out by the GAO.\n  My hope is that when we soon have a chance to vote on this amendment, \nwe can all answer this important call. I think in the process we can \nask the single most important question Congress can ask when it comes \nto spending and programs, which is: Is this program still needed?\n  A sunset commission would help us do our job of oversight and \naccountability. It would help rein in runaway Federal spending and, \nhopefully, along with growth in the private sector and investments by \nthe job creators and entrepreneurs, help us get past where we are now, \nwhere we have not only runaway spending but unsustainable debt, and a \nprivate sector sitting on the sidelines not creating new jobs the way \nwe need them to do it.\n  I yield the floor and thank the manager.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question on his amendment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Most of the programs I am familiar with at the Federal \nlevel have built-in sunsets, because they have limited authorization.\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\nHow does the Senator's amendment either override that or undercut that? \nWhy is his amendment necessary?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am glad to respond to the question. As \nthe Senator knows, many programs that are currently up and running are \noperating on the basis of an appropriation without an authorization by \nthe committee of jurisdiction, and that is part of what the sunset \ncommission would look at because, frankly, it hasn't been authorized, \nthe kind of oversight that is needed in order to scrub the numbers and \nmake sure the program is still necessary and the spending is \nappropriate doesn't happen.\n  This also is designed specifically to deal with what the GAO pointed \nout in the last 7 to 10 days, where we have dozens of programs designed \nto do exactly the same thing. In other words, rather than making sure \nthat existing programs work, we tend to layer those on over time, \nforgetting that those existing programs are even there. So this would \nbe designed primarily to do two things: one, to deal with programs \nwhere there is spending because there has been an appropriation made \nbut no authorization; and it would also deal with that duplication.\n  If, in fact, Congress comes back and authorizes the program, that is \none way they could respond to the report of the commission.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. I will comment, and I know the \nSenator wants to genuinely root out the waste and duplication. I only \nsay that for programs that are operating under appropriations only. The \nSenator will know that that authorization is only intact for 1 year \nunder the general rules. When you appropriate money, it is only for 1 \nyear at a time. It can only be extended by an act of this body every \nyear. On the authorizing programs, to my knowledge--and I will get the \ncommittee to check on that--Homeland Security has jurisdiction over \ngovernment operations. It is my understanding that every authorized \nprogram has a length of time and that each committee here is \nresponsible for their own oversight.\n  If the Senator is suggesting that committees either can't, or don't, \ndo their work and we need an extra commission, we will consider that. I \nunderstand what the Senator is trying to do. I will have the Homeland \nSecurity team look at it on our side and we will respond.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I don't think anybody believes the way things are \noperating now is appropriate. What this does is it seeks to bring a new \nset of eyes, particularly regarding the spending levels in programs--\nwhether they are necessary. As the President's own fiscal commission \npointed out, this is not a partisan issue. We know with that kind of \nincreased scrutiny, we can begin to cut out duplicative and unnecessary \nspending and prioritize those that are important, such as homeland \nsecurity.\n  Part of the problem we have is that the spending levels we have now \nmake it almost impossible for us to decide what our priorities are and \nfund those because everything seems to be a priority. Well, everything \ncan't be a priority, everything cannot be essential. This is a \ncommonsense approach, based on an effective State model, that would \nallow Congress to do its job better and deal with the most important \nissues that face the country today, which is runaway spending and \nunsustainable debt, and too high unemployment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Hopefully, as we go through the day, we will have a discussion on \nthat amendment and others. I will try to give a recap. My ranking \nmember is on the floor, and we wish to proceed today as we did \nyesterday, fairly orderly. We have made progress. We got two amendments \nvoted on already. There are now several amendments pending. I want to \nask this for clarification. We have Johanns 161, Vitter 178, McConnell \n183, Casey 216, and Cornyn 186. Those are all pending, but no time has \nbeen established for a vote. Can I ask the Chair to confirm that?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Can I also ask the Chair this: We have filed and \ndiscussed Hutchison 197, Paul 199, and Sanders 207, which are not \npending but have been discussed on the floor. Does that list exist at \nthe desk?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Those amendments have been filed \nand will need to be offered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me say again how pleased I am that only a handful \nof amendments out of the 68 that are pending actually pertain directly \nto the programs we are getting ready, hopefully, to authorize. \nActually, out of the 68 amendments pending, only 14 are related to this \nparticular program, and 3 others to the Small Business Administration \nitself. I want to believe that is because Senator Snowe and I have \ntried hard to take all Members' views into consideration as we have \nmoved the bill through the process. As I said, yesterday, we worked on \nreauthorization of this important program--the largest Federal research \nprogram for small business in the country, the largest program--we have \nworked on this reauthorization for 6 years. So in the last three \nCongresses this bill has been debated, both in committee and on the \nfloor, in the House and in the Senate. It has been modified many \ndifferent times to accommodate different views.\n  The great news is that the bill is still strong, very focused. It \nprovides an additional percentage of funding for small business so they \ncan actually have access to the research and development dollars like \nbig businesses, which often have better access. It gives an open door \nand an opportunity for small businesses--for some of our best patents, \nour best inventors, our strongest risk takers, which are often very \nsmall startups. We want to encourage that, because the country is \nfighting its way--and I mean that--out of this recession. It is not \neasy, and it will not happen automatically. It will happen by what \nactions the Federal Government takes, State governments, and local \ngovernments, creating atmospheres so the private sector can grow. This \nbill helps to improve that atmosphere. That is why we are talking about \nthis.\n  Many people have come to the floor and said: Why aren't we talking \nabout closing the deficit? We are talking about reducing the deficit \nand debt, because one of the ways we do that is by creating private-\nsector jobs. This bill is one of the bills filed in this Congress--I am \nnot saying it is the top or the absolute best, but I can promise you \nthat it is one of the best bills that is filed that will have a direct \nand immediate impact on job creation in America. That is why Senator \nSnowe and I are spending our time talking about it because it is a jobs \nbill. It is also a deficit closing bill. It is also a debt reduction \nbill. It is also a great bill that is going to help level the playing \nfield between large and small companies and say to some of those risk \ntakers out there who look at Washington and shake their head and say, \nWhat is going on, doesn't anyone pay attention to us, yes, we are \npaying attention, we know you are out there. We know if we can provide \nopen-door access to Federal Government research and development \ndollars, we can have literally hundreds of companies grow and expand.\n\n  One example I gave yesterday--and I will give many more today--is \nQualcomm, unknown 35 years ago. It started in Dr. Jacobs' den. It \nreceived early funding through this program, SBIR. They received \nmultiple grants. You can get multiple grants as your technology \nimproves and it shows promise. Of course, it showed promise. At a \npoint, they were recognized by the venture capital community and \ninvestors came in. History has shown now that company employs 17,500 \npeople and last year their local San Diego-based company paid taxes to \nlocal governments in California and around the country of $1 billion. \nThat covers half the cost of this entire program--one company.\n  That is why Senator Snowe and I have spent so much time on this \nreauthorization and why she has been fighting for this program for \nactually almost 20 years, since she was a Member of Congress. This \nprogram is one that works. We have tweaked it. We have improved it. We \nare extending our authorizations from 4 years to 8 years to give \ncertainty.\n  Those are some of the comments I wanted to make about the bill. We \nhave, as I said, 68 amendments that have been filed. I ask Members, if \nthey are interested in getting their amendments pending, to come to the \nfloor to see what we can do to work that out. I\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\nam not sure we will get to final passage of the bill this week, but we \nwant to do as much work on the bill as we can so when we get back, it \nwill hopefully be the first order of business. We will see. Maybe there \nwill be a breakthrough in the next 2 or 3 days and we can get it done \nbefore we leave. That would send a positive signal. We are working with \nthe leadership to see if that can be done. If not, we will continue to \nwork this week to get as many amendments offered and pending and some \nvotes today and tomorrow.\n  I see the ranking member on the floor. I wish to turn the time over \nto her now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I certainly concur in the comments that \nhave been made by the Chair of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nLandrieu, who has exhibited tremendous leadership in bringing these \ninitiatives to the floor for reauthorization. It has been a long \njourney for these programs, reaching the point of reauthorizing them \nfor the first time since 2008. In the intervening years, the programs \nhave had to rely on multiple extensions to continue to operate.\n  These programs are of indisputable value to the growth in America \nwhen it comes to innovation and invention on the part of small \nbusinesses. They undeniably have been critically effective. When they \nhave had access to venture capital and research and development dollars \nthat are available in more than 11 agencies across the government, \nincluding the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, \nthe Department of Energy, to name a few, they have provided invaluable \nsupport to the entrepreneurial spirit that is so critical to this \ncountry.\n  As the Chair indicated, it is the small businesses in America, the \none segment of the economy that undeniably creates the kinds of jobs \nthat are so important to this country. In fact, they create two-thirds \nof all the net new jobs. We have to do everything we can to make sure \nthat they are getting access to the kind of capital and support and the \nresearch and development dollars that are available at the national \nlevel.\n  These two programs, were created back in 1982. As the Chair \nindicated, I was an original cosponsor of that legislation when I was \nserving in the House of Representatives because we knew it could \nultimately be a great catalyst for innovative and technological ideas \nin America. It has provided it, without question.\n  The National Academy of Sciences study of the SBIR Program--which is \na landmark study--called the program sound in concept and effective in \npractice. Just over 20 percent of companies they surveyed were founded \npartly or entirely because of the SBIR program. Over two-thirds of the \nrespondents said that the SBIR projects would not have taken place \nwithout the funding. Each year, over one-third of firms awarded SBIR \nfunds participate in the program for the first time.\n  Again, it is encouraging innovation across a broad spectrum of \nbusinesses and creating additional competition among suppliers for the \nFederal Government's procurement agencies. We see that it produces over \nand over again the benefits, the jobs, the creativity.\n  The Chair spoke about Qualcomm. That is true. We saw the Sonicare \ntoothbrush. In May, we had a company called Tex Tech that developed \narmor for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. If we can give the \ninfusion of these dollars--dollars already being expended by Federal \nagencies but redirected to small businesses and making sure that they \nare getting a fair share of the Federal pie--then they can put that \nmoney to good use in creating the kinds of jobs and the inventions that \nare so important to moving this country forward in the 21st century.\n  I am very pleased we are at this point. Hopefully, we will be able to \nget this legislation through and signed into law because it is critical \nto venture capital investments. It is a prominent source of investment \nin biotechnology research and development. As we know, it takes 10 to \n15 years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars to bring a drug to \nmarket and to complete the testing of the drug process along the way \ncosts millions of dollars. The biotechnology companies are able to \ncommercialize their technologies with this kind of backing from these \nprograms and money that is being expended at the Federal level in these \nkey agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. Such \ninvestments in biotechnology and medical device industries totaled more \nthan $1 billion in 2007.\n  Again, it is a demonstration of the kind of value and results we \nachieve through this program without providing additional Federal \nappropriations. It is not as if we are spending more money on a new \nprogram. We are not. What we are saying is that with the research and \ndevelopment dollars that are already being appropriated within the \nFederal agencies, we are asking that they set aside more than $2.5 \nbillion in Federal research and development to fund our Nation's \nsmallest firms because they are the ones that are most likely to create \nthe jobs and to commercialize their products. They have demonstrated \ntime and again, year after year, at an all-time high, that the \ninnovations coming out of small businesses are directly through these \ntwo programs. Their inventions reach the marketplace. They \ncommercialize them.\n  Qualcomm, 25 years ago started with a $1.5 million grant from the \nSBIR Program. They had less than a dozen employees. Currently, they \nhave more than 17,000 employees in their company, and are a \nmultibillion dollar Fortune 500 company. Again, it is an example how \nthis program can work.\n  The Information Technology Innovation Foundation indicated in its \nreport recently that 25 percent of the top 100 innovations came from \nsmall businesses funded through the SBIR Program, and stated further \nthat it is a powerful indication that this program has become a key \nforce in the innovation economy of the United States.\n  If there were ever a time that we should be supporting these programs \nand promptly and expeditiously, it is here and now. We saw last month \nwhere we created 200,000 jobs. But the month prior was 36,000 jobs. In \norder to reach prerecession levels of unemployment, it would take eight \nconsecutive years of creating jobs at a rate of 200,000 a month in \norder to achieve the prerecession levels of unemployment of 5 percent.\n  That is an indication of how far we need to go to create jobs in this \neconomy, and it is creating the anxiety, the apprehension, the fear all \nacross this country because people are struggling to find jobs or to \nkeep the ones they have. This would go a long way to benefitting the \nsector of the economy that does create the jobs, and that is, of \ncourse, small businesses.\n  Again, I hope that we can move quickly to get this legislation \nenacted and signed into law and create the kinds of jobs people in this \ncountry undeniably deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, at this time, Senator Casey, whose \namendment is pending, wishes to speak a few minutes. I know at 12 \no'clock, under a unanimous consent agreement, we will have a speech \nfrom the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 p.m., Senator Portman be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes as in morning business for the purpose \nof giving his maiden speech.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, first, I thank Senator Landrieu for her \nleadership on these many issues and especially on this critically \nimportant legislation to small businesses and for allowing me for a few \nminutes to talk about the amendment I have submitted. It is amendment \nNo. 216. It addresses a crucial issue that affects subcontractors, \nparticularly subcontractors who are minority owned or women-owned firms \nin the United States of America.\n  When I was the auditor general of Pennsylvania, we audited a similar \nprogram at the State level and found all kinds of problems, all kinds \nof abuses when prime contractors do not do what they are supposed to \ndo. In many instances, prime contractors will routinely list a \nminority-owned firm or women-owned firm to make their application in a \ncompetitive process\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\nwithout informing the named subcontractor. It puts that subcontractor \nat a disadvantage. Once the contract is awarded, the business is not \ngiven to the named subcontractor.\n  The purpose of this amendment is very simple. It will ensure that all \nsubcontractors are aware of their inclusion in Federal procurement bids \nby prime contractors and establish a system in which those \nsubcontractors can report any fraudulent activity. It is a simple but \ncritically important remedy to part of this problem. We have more work \nto do on this issue, but it will give subcontractors the ability to \nmore fairly and more fully participate in contracting. That is the \nleast we should be doing at a time when so many small businesses are \nstruggling to survive and to thrive.\n  I am grateful Senator Landrieu gave me this opportunity. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I do intend to \nsupport his amendment. It is an excellent one. Hopefully, we can get a \nvote on it sometime today or tomorrow.\n  At this time, pursuant to a unanimous consent agreement, we will hear \na speech from the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                  Fighting for Connecticut's Interests\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the people of Connecticut sent me here \nto fight for their interests and today I rise to amplify their voices \nand share their concerns in my first remarks from the floor of the \nUnited States Senate.\n  I know these voices firsthand from listening day after day, year \nafter year, traveling the State to be with people and to see people \nwhere they live and work, and recently on a 2-week listening tour as \none of my first actions as a Member of the Senate.\n  What I am hearing is people are still hurting, still struggling, \ntrying to stay in their homes, make ends meet, find jobs, and keep \ntheir families together. They feel rightly that Washington is not \nlistening, Washington is not heeding their voices or responding with \nthe right action or results.\n  The people of Connecticut are clear about their priorities. They want \nto be back at work with good jobs and a growing economy and \nresponsible, smart cuts in government spending to reduce our debt and \ndeficit. They want to know that Washington is listening to them and \nthat their leaders are fighting for them, standing up and speaking out \nagainst powerful special interests and predatory wrongdoing. And that \nis the kind of listener and leader they sent me here to be.\n\n  In the northeast corner of my State, known as the ``Quiet Corner,'' \nthe president of Nutmeg Container Corporation, Charlie Pious, tells me \nhe is hoping to hire more workers, but he has difficulty finding people \nwith the skills he needs.\n  Not far away, in Putnam, at a meeting at the Putnam Bank with \nchairman Thomas Borner, one after another small business leaders tell \nme they could create more jobs with more certainty and consistency in \ngovernment action.\n  In Hartford, our State's capital, we celebrate a Jobs Corps \ngraduating class--kids who dropped out and came back through training \nand determination.\n  In Bridgeport, unemployed, older workers are crowding the WorkPlace, \na highly successful job training center. There and all around the \nstate, people simply want work.\n  At the Fuel Cell Energy Corporation in Torrington, R. Daniel Brdar, \nthe president of this cutting-edge green energy manufacturer, plans to \nexpand his workforce, but he needs to know that he can continue to \ncount on the renewable energy tax credit and workers with the right \nskills.\n  In Waterbury, at a meeting hosted by Joe Vrabley, president of \nAtlantic Steel, small business manufacturers described again and again \nhow they are facing unfair competition from companies in countries \nbreaking the rules.\n  At Crescent Manufacturing in Burlington, Steve Wilson demonstrates \nthe destructive consequences of Chinese currency manipulation, when \nthey effectively devalue their money and subsidize their exports so the \nprices of their products undercut Connecticut-made goods and jobs.\n  The people of Connecticut don't need Washington to tell them what is \nwrong; they need help making it right. They want job creation to be the \npriority in Washington, just as it is in Connecticut. They are \nfrustrated because Washington seems beholden not to them but to some of \nthe financial gamblers who made the economy their own personal casino \nand put millions of Americans out of work and out of their homes.\n  On Main Street, small businesses struggle to get started and ongoing \nbusinesses face roadblocks when they try to grow. They can't get \ncapital, credit, or loans. They can't find workers with the skills they \nneed. They face unfair trade practices from foreign governments \npromoting the products of their manufacturers.\n  Taxpayers are angry for good reason, not just for themselves but for \ntheir children and the growing danger to the American dream, the great \nfear they will be the first generation to leave the next a lesser \nAmerica and trillions in unpaid bills.\n  A new report from the Government Accountability Office documents what \nwe instinctively have known: Waste and duplication in government costs \ntaxpayers billions of dollars every year--early estimates say between \n$100 billion and $200 billion. And experts say we could save tens of \nbillions of dollars by aggressively prosecuting health care waste and \nabuse, just as we saved millions of dollars going after health care \nfraud when I was attorney general.\n  The people of Connecticut--indeed, of America--will not tolerate and \nshould not tolerate billions in waste and duplication. It must be cut. \nThat is where we should focus, not on the thoughtless slashing of \nessential services that provide a safety net for our most vulnerable \ncitizens. When we cut, let's be smart about it.\n  The people of Connecticut are sick of the special breaks and tax \nloopholes that have been protected for far too long--tax breaks to \ncompanies that send jobs overseas; subsidies to huge oil and gas \ninterests, some of them the most profitable companies in the history of \nthe planet; and giveaways to giant agribusinesses, many given tax \ndollars not to grow anything.\n  Shutting down those loopholes and special breaks and sweetheart deals \nwill take a fight, but the people of Connecticut and the country are \nready for that fight, and so am I. And we must fight. That fight will \nrequire support for the prosecutors and enforcers who prevent and go \nafter waste, abuse, and lawbreaking. Cutting enforcement funds may make \nappealing political sound bites until we realize that real-world \nlawlessness has real-world consequences. Consistent, vigorous \nenforcement is critical. Good cops on the beat make a difference.\n  These steps--responsible cuts in spending, clear rules, and \nconsistent, rigorous enforcement--are absolutely necessary to help our \neconomy grow again, but they alone are not enough to create jobs. \nWashington must provide tools and remove obstacles to the people and \nsmall businesses that are the real job creators. We have to make ``Made \nin Connecticut'' and ``Made in America'' mean something again. We must \ninvest more, we must make more, and we must invent more right here in \nthe United States.\n  Step No. 1, we must invest more. We must invest in infrastructure and \neducation--in roads, transmission lines, and airports, in everything \nfrom our grade schools to our community colleges and job-training \nprograms. In New Haven, as just one example, cutting-edge \nbiotechnologies are taking root and growing thanks to the Downtown \nCrossing project, where a new building and road rebuilding are \nnecessary for dynamic growth. Instead of thoughtless threats to slash \nDowntown Crossing transportation grants, we should be encouraging this \npromising development.\n  In the coming weeks, I will introduce new legislation that will help \nsmall businesses to set aside money to invest and reinvest in their \nbusiness.\n  Step 2, making more, which means more manufacturing and fair trade, \nand strengthening ``Buy American'' requirements to ensure that our tax \ndollars are creating jobs here not abroad. Chinese currency \nmanipulation is costing us jobs and undermining our businesses, and it \nmust be stopped. And we need stronger enforcement of laws to prevent \nforeign export subsidies and intellectual property theft.\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n  Third, we must invent more. The renewable energy tax credits and \nother incentives which encourage businesses to create and produce green \nenergy solutions should be made permanent. The R tax credit, which \ncreates incentives for businesses to invest in research, should be \nextended indefinitely and expanded.\n  The people of Connecticut want bipartisan efforts to achieve job \ncreation and economic growth. They want partnerships among business, \nlabor, and education. They want bipartisan efforts to help our veterans \nso that after those veterans serve our country, they return to a \npaycheck instead of an unemployment line. That is why, in coming weeks, \nI will introduce a bill to help secure job opportunities for our \nveterans and provide training, health care, higher education, and more.\n  As I travel across the State of Connecticut, I listen to people like \nthe Squatritos of Carla's Pasta. Their business is in South Windsor. An \nimmigrant from Italy, Carla Squatrito started making pasta in her \nkitchen and grew it into a successful small business. This year, thanks \nto smart, targeted tax incentives, Carla's financial recipe includes \ninvesting in a fuel cell from the Fuel Cell Energy Corporation in \nTorrington to provide a low-cost source for most of her company's \nelectricity needs. This cleaner, greener energy source will lower their \nenergy bills and allow them to hire more workers and create more \nConnecticut jobs.\n  The people of Connecticut sent me here to fight for them--to fight \nfor jobs and justice, to fight against a Capitol that caters to \npowerful special interests. The best moments of my career have been \nwhen we fought and won battles for ordinary people--for Skylar Austin \nand others when their health insurance companies wrongly denied them \nmedically necessary, sometimes lifesaving treatment; for businesspeople \nsuch as Kathy Platt when General Motors sought wrongfully and unfairly \nto shut down her car dealership, Alderman Motors; or Terry, a marine, \nlike many veterans, who returned from Iraq or other military service \nonly to be denied proper treatment from our own government. I am here \nbecause the people of Connecticut know me as a fighter, and in the \nchallenging time, again, I will fulfill that trust by listening to them \nand working for them and fighting for them.\n  As we gather today, young Americans are serving and sacrificing at \nhome and abroad. Like all of you, I am grateful to them every day, and \nto all the veterans who have served and sacrificed before them, for \ngiving us the freedoms we enjoy every day, including the extraordinary \nopportunity to speak today in this historic Chamber and participate in \nthe greatest democracy in the greatest Nation the world has ever known.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Senators to \ncome to the floor, I would like to put a couple other quotes or \ncomments from very well-respected organizations about the importance of \nthis bill into the record. I, again, appreciate the 84 Members of the \nSenate who voted yes to bring this bill to the floor because those 84 \nMembers of the Senate understand we cannot close budget gaps and reduce \ndeficits without growing the economy. Those 84 Members understand that \nin order to grow the economy, helping government create the atmosphere \nfor the private sector to grow is absolutely imperative. If we would \nspend a little less hot air time around here and a little more on \nilluminating discussion, the benefits of programs such as this would be \nclear. It is actually a Federal program, but it is a Federal program \nthat establishes a partnership with the private sector that is exciting \nand that works and that helps to create jobs.\n  The Biodistrict in New Orleans, which was newly formed after Katrina, \nsent a document to the office that said, in reference to the temporary \nextensions of this program:\n\n       These repeated, temporary extensions have wreaked havoc on \n     agencies' ability to make strategic decisions in regard to \n     the programs.\n\n  The Small Business Technology Council says:\n\n       Not only does this program spur technological innovation \n     and entrepreneurship, it helps create high-tech jobs, and \n     does so without increasing Federal spending.\n\n  The National Small Business Association, another strong supporter, \nsaid:\n\n       The uncertain future of the program has deterred potential \n     participants and investors.\n\n  We do not want to deter anyone. We do not want to discourage anyone \nfrom making that investment or taking that step to create the next \nbusiness that could create not just a handful of jobs but dozens, \nhundreds, and potentially thousands. That is why President Obama is \ntalking about--and I support his efforts--the need to outinnovate and \noutcompete, to fight our way out of this recession.\n  This bill of Senator Snowe and mine might be a relatively small bill \nfrom a small agency, but it packs a lot of power and potential to \ncreate the jobs that people--in your home State of Minnesota, in my \nhome State of Louisiana, in Maine, and other places--want to see us \ncreating, with virtually no additional cost to the Federal Government. \nWe are simply setting aside a slightly larger portion of research and \ndevelopment moneys already budgeted for cutting-edge research and \ndevelopment and targeting those to small businesses that have proven \nthemselves to produce excellent innovations, technology, and in fact \nhave a disproportionate share of high-impact patents.\n  The National Venture Capital Association says:\n\n       At a time when our country needs to build new businesses, \n     the venture capital industry believes the best use of \n     government dollars is to leverage public/private \n     partnerships. . . .\n\n  That is what this does. I know there are a few people around this \nplace who do not think the Federal Government can do anything right. I \nam not one of them. I actually think the Federal Government can do lots \nof things right. Yes, we make mistakes; yes, there is money wasted; \nyes, there is duplication; and, yes, sometimes there is even fraud. But \nprograms such as this need to be reauthorized. We have been debating \nnow for 6 years whether this program should be authorized.\n  If it takes us 6 years to reauthorize one of the best programs in the \nFederal Government, I wonder how long it is going to take us to \nreauthorize some of those that are not as well run and to give us the \nopportunity to make them run better instead of just running around, \nthrowing up our hands, saying nothing works, nothing ever works, \neverything in Washington is broken. This program is not broken, and it \ndeserves to be reauthorized.\n  According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       The SBIR program serves as an important avenue by which \n     agencies harness the creativity and ingenuity of small \n     business to meet specific research and development needs of \n     the Federal Government.\n\n  Might I say, they may be the today needs of the Federal Government; \nsuch as we need a way to cool our tanks in Afghanistan and Iraq because \nour tanks are operating in temperatures that are excessive. That was a \nreal need of the Defense Department. They sent out, basically, an SOS: \nCan anybody come up with a better way?\n  Not only did we come up with a better way in a radiator out of \ntechnology we actually developed in Louisiana, but as you know, these \ntechnologies do not stay in the Department of Defense. Once they go out \nto be used in our tanks, helping keep our war fighters safe and helping \nwin the wars we send them to fight, this technology can now be \ndeployed, potentially, in the racing car industry or in Detroit or some \nof our other car manufacturing. While it is launched by Federal \nscientists and inventors and people who are good employees and good, \nsolid Americans who are looking for a better way, it finds its way out \ninto the general public for all of our benefit.\n  Let me give two more quotes. I see the Senator from Kentucky. The \nBioTechnology Industry Organization says:\n\n       This bill represents a balanced approach to ensure that \n     America's most innovative small businesses can access \n     existing incentives to grow jobs by commercializing new \n     discoveries.\n\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\n\n  Finally, from the University of California, the CONNECT group says:\n\n       Because acquiring funding through traditional lending \n     sources continues to prove difficult in today's tight credit \n     market, SBIR/STTR grants provide tech start-up companies \n     another viable chance to compete for early-stage funding.\n\n  Yes, there are many venture capitalists out there. There are always \nvery savvy inventors looking for the next best thing. But before the \nnext best things are invented, there has to be somebody betting on the \nhuman capital in our Federal agencies, the human capital in our \nacademic institutions, and the human capital in small businesses that \ntake the risks and believe they can invent that next best thing.\n  This financing is early. It is high risk. Not every SBIR grant works. \nBut according to the man who gave us the review of this program, if \nevery one of these inventions works, we are not running the program \ncorrectly. This program is early, before it is clear whether it is \ngoing to work, a chance to get it to work. But the upside is so great \nwhen one or more does work, and we have hundreds of companies that have \nsort of broken out.\n  I see the Senator from Kentucky. I will rest my discussion. I do want \nto put some other things in the Record, but to keep the debate moving \nforward, this would be a good time for him to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 199\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up my amendment, No. 199.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 199.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To cut $200,000,000,000 in spending in fiscal year 2011)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n              TITLE ___--CUT FEDERAL SPENDING ACT OF 2011\n\n     SEC. __01.

This amendment would cost $200 billion in spending. Earlier \nthis morning we voted, nearly unanimously in this body, to cut 5 \npercent from our legislative budget. Similar to so much in Washington, \nit sounds good. I voted for it. But 5 percent of our legislative budget \nwill be a few million dollars. We have a deficit this year of $1.65 \ntrillion. We are awash in debt. It is America's No. 1 problem. Even the \nadministration has said our national debt is our No. 1 threat to our \nnational security at this point. We have to get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  Voting to cut our own budget by 5 percent is wonderful. It is a first \nstep. It is about $1 million--a couple million dollars. It will not put \na dent in the overall problem.\n  If we were truly concerned as a body about our deficit, we could cut \nthe entire budget by 5 percent. It has gone up by 25 percent in the \nlast couple years.\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\nIf we were to cut our entire budget by 5 percent, it would be about \n$200 billion. That is what I am proposing, a $200 billion cut in \nspending.\n  Are we bold enough? Will we do it? If we do not do it, what happens? \nMy fear is, if we do not have significant cuts in Federal spending, \nthat ultimately in the next few years we could have a debt crisis. This \namendment will give us a chance, will give the Members of this body a \nchance to say: Are we serious? Are we serious about addressing the debt \nproblem or do we only want to do token things such as cutting our \nlegislative budget 5 percent?\n  It is a good start, but it is not enough. This was actually only a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, so we didn't cut our budget by 5 \npercent. We said we might be in favor of that. This would be a real \ncut, $200 billion.\n  I hope the Senate will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask the Senate set aside the pending \namendment so I can call up amendment No. 207.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 207\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 207.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a point of order against any efforts to reduce \nbenefits paid to Social Security recipients, raise the retirement age, \n  or create private retirement accounts under title II of the Social \n                             Security Act)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                TITLE VI--SOCIAL SECURITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n     SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Social Security Protection \n     Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Social Security is the most successful and reliable \n     social program in our Nation's history.\n       (2) For 75 years, through good times and bad, Social \n     Security has reliably kept millions of senior citizens, \n     individuals with disabilities, and children out of poverty.\n       (3) Before President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social \n     Security Act into law on August 14, 1935, approximately half \n     of the senior citizens in the United States lived in poverty; \n     less than 10 percent of seniors live in poverty today.\n       (4) Social Security has succeeded in protecting working \n     Americans and their families from devastating drops in \n     household income due to lost wages resulting from retirement, \n     disability, or the death of a spouse or parent.\n       (5) More than 53,000,000 Americans receive Social Security \n     benefits, including 36,500,000 retirees and their spouses, \n     9,200,000 veterans, 8,200,000 disabled individuals and their \n     spouses, 4,500,000 surviving spouses of deceased workers, and \n     4,300,000 dependent children.\n       (6) Social Security has never contributed to the Federal \n     budget deficit or the national debt, and benefit cuts should \n     not be proposed as a solution to reducing the Federal budget \n     deficit.\n       (7) Social Security is not in a crisis or going bankrupt, \n     as the Social Security Trust Funds have been running \n     surpluses for the last quarter of a century.\n       (8) According to the Social Security Administration, the \n     Social Security Trust Funds currently maintain a \n     $2,600,000,000,000 surplus that is project to grow to \n     $4,200,000,000,000 by 2023.\n       (9) According to the Social Security Administration, even \n     if no changes are made to the Social Security program, full \n     benefits will be available to every recipient until 2037, \n     with enough funding remaining after that date to pay about 78 \n     percent of promised benefits.\n       (10) According to the Social Security Administration, \n     ``money flowing into the [Social Security] trust funds is \n     invested in U.S. Government securities .  .  . the \n     investments held by the trust funds are backed by the full \n     faith and credit of the U.S. Government. The Government has \n     always repaid Social Security, with interest.''.\n       (11) All workers who contribute into Social Security \n     through the 12.4 percent payroll tax, which is divided \n     equally between employees and employers on income up to \n     $106,800, deserve to have a dignified and secure retirement.\n       (12) Social Security provides the majority of income for \n     two-thirds of the elderly population in the United States, \n     with approximately one-third of elderly individuals receiving \n     nearly all of their income from Social Security.\n       (13) Overall, Social Security benefits for retirees \n     currently average a modest $14,000 a year, with the average \n     for women receiving benefits being less than $12,000 per \n     year.\n       (14) Nearly 1 out of every 4 adult Social Security \n     beneficiaries has served in the United States military.\n       (15) Social Security is not solely a retirement program, as \n     it also serves as a disability insurance program for American \n     workers who become permanently disabled and unable to work.\n       (16) The Social Security Disability Insurance program is a \n     critical lifeline for millions of American workers, as a 20-\n     year-old worker faces a 30 percent chance of becoming \n     disabled before reaching retirement age.\n       (17) Proposals to privatize the Social Security program \n     would jeopardize the security of millions of Americans by \n     subjecting them to the ups-and-downs of the volatile stock \n     market as the source of their retirement benefits.\n       (18) Raising the retirement age would jeopardize the \n     retirement future of millions of American workers, \n     particularly those in physically demanding jobs as well as \n     lower-income women, African-Americans, and Latinos, all of \n     whom have a much lower life expectancy than wealthier \n     Americans.\n       (19) Social Security benefits have already been cut by 13 \n     percent, as the Normal Retirement Age was raised in 1983 from \n     65 years of age to 67 years of age by 2022.\n       (20) According to the Social Security Administration, \n     raising the retirement age for future retirees would reduce \n     benefits by 6 to 7 percent for each year that the Normal \n     Retirement Age is raised.\n       (21) Reducing cost-of-living adjustments for current or \n     future Social Security beneficiaries would force millions of \n     such individuals to choose between heating their homes, \n     putting food on the table, or paying for their prescription \n     drugs.\n       (22) Social Security is a promise that this Nation cannot \n     afford to break.\n\n     SEC. 603. LIMITATION ON CHANGES TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   PROGRAM FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, it shall not be in order in the Senate or the House of \n     Representatives to consider, for purposes of the old-age, \n     survivors, and disability insurance benefits program \n     established under title II of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 401 et seq.), any legislation that--\n       (1) increases the retirement age (as defined in section \n     216(l)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 416(l)(1))) \n     or the early retirement age (as defined in section 216(l)(2) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 416(l)(2))) for \n     individuals receiving benefits under title II of the Social \n     Security Act on or after the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) reduces cost-of-living increases for individuals \n     receiving benefits under title II of the Social Security Act \n     on or after the date of enactment of this Act, as determined \n     under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     415(i));\n       (3) reduces benefit payment amounts for individuals \n     receiving benefits under title II of the Social Security Act \n     on or after the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (4) creates private retirement accounts for any of the \n     benefits individuals receive under title II of the Social \n     Security Act on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Waiver or Suspension.--\n       (1) In the senate.--The provisions of this section may be \n     waived or suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative \n     vote of two-thirds of the Members, present and voting.\n       (2) In the house.--The provisions of this section may be \n     waived or suspended in the House of Representatives only by a \n     rule or order proposing only to waive such provisions by an \n     affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members, present and \n     voting.\n       (c) Point of Order Protection.--In the House of \n     Representatives, it shall not be in order to consider a rule \n     or order that waives the application of paragraph (2) of \n     subsection (b).\n       (d) Motion to Suspend.--It shall not be in order for the \n     Speaker to entertain a motion to suspend the application of \n     this section under clause 1 of rule XV of the Rules of the \n     House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment is identical to the Social \nSecurity Protection Act I introduced yesterday with Senators Mikulski, \nBoxer, Sherrod Brown, Blumenthal, Stabenow, Akaka, Whitehouse, Begich, \nand Lautenberg.\n  This legislation has the strong support of the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare, the American Federation of \nFederal Employees, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Military \nOrder of the Purple Heart, and the Jewish Veterans of America, among \nothers.\n  Social Security is the most successful and reliable Federal program \nin our Nation's history. For 75 years, through good times and bad, when \nthe economy was strong and when the economy was weak, Social Security \nhas paid out\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\nevery nickel owed to every eligible American. While we take that for \ngranted, that, in fact, is an extraordinary accomplishment. It is all \ndone at very modest administrative costs.\n  Social Security has been enormously successful in accomplishing \nexactly what its founders hoped to accomplish. Before President \nRoosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law in August of 1935, \napproximately half our senior citizens lived in poverty. Before Social \nSecurity, about half our seniors lived in poverty. Today, fewer than 10 \npercent of seniors live in poverty. That number is too great, but it is \na significant improvement over what occurred before the establishment \nof Social Security.\n  What we should be very clear about, given the volatility of today's \neconomy--there is a great deal of anxiety among the American people \nabout whether they are going to be able to retire with dignity. At a \ntime when millions of Americans have seen the value of their private \nretirement plans plummet, at a time when major corporations have \nsignificantly cut back on the defined benefit pension plans and 401(k) \ncontributions, it makes no sense to me that anybody in this Chamber \nwould contemplate dismantling the one retirement program that has been \nthere for 75 years and has worked for 75 years.\n  There was an interesting article in USA Today yesterday. These are \njust a couple facts they threw out in yesterday's USA Today. The \npercentage of workers who are not at all confident about saving enough \nmoney for a comfortable retirement reached 27 percent in 2011 compared \nwith 22 percent just last year--a significant increase in a 1-year \nperiod. When combined with those who said they are ``not too \nconfident,'' the total reaches 50 percent of workers. So we are in a \nsituation, according to USA Today, where almost 50 percent of American \nworkers lack confidence about whether they are going to have enough \nmoney to retire with dignity. There is another point that the article \nmade. This is what they say:\n\n       Quite a few workers virtually have no savings or \n     investments. In 2011, 29 percent said they have less than \n     $1,000.\n\n  Well, you are not going to go too far in your retirement with less \nthan $1,000.\n\n       56 percent said that their savings and investments, \n     excluding their home value, totals less than $25,000.\n\n  The bottom line is, for a variety of reasons, A, the Wall Street \ncollapse of a few years ago, the fact that wages for millions of \nworkers have not kept up with inflation, a significant part of our \nolder workforce today is extremely worried about what will happen to \nthem when they retire.\n  Within that context, why there are people in the Congress who would \nwant to start dismantling the one program that has, without fail, been \nthere for 75 years, makes no sense to me at all. Let me also make \nanother point. I think it is important to make this point 24 hours a \nday because we hear so much misinformation coming to us from pundits, \nfrom the media, and from Members of Congress. So let me be very clear.\n  This country has a very serious national debt problem and a very \nserious deficit problem. We just heard about that, a $1.6 trillion \ndeficit. That is serious business. In my view, Congress has to be \naggressive to address that issue. But here is the point. Social \nSecurity has not contributed one nickel to the Federal deficit or the \nnational debt--not one penny.\n  So when you hear people say we have a serious deficit problem, \ntherefore we have to cut benefits in Social Security or raise the \nretirement age, what they are saying makes no sense at all. These are \ntwo very separate issues.\n  In fact, Social Security currently has a $2.6 trillion surplus. Let \nme repeat that. Social Security has a $2.6 trillion surplus. That is \nprojected to grow to $4.2 trillion in 2023. In 1983, when we look back \na little bit, it turns out that Social Security did face a crisis. At \nthat point, in 1983, if the Congress and then-President Reagan had not \nacted, Social Security was projected to run out of necessary funding in \n6 months--6 months. That is a crisis.\n  As a result of the discussions and negotiations and a committee put \ntogether by the President, Tip O'Neill, et cetera, a resolution was \nreached to that problem. The Congress overwhelmingly voted for it. \nToday is not 1983. Today the Social Security Administration has \nestimated that Social Security will be able to pay out 100 percent of \npromised benefits to every eligible recipient for the next 26 years.\n  This country does face a whole lot of crises: Unemployment is off the \nwall; childhood poverty is too high; we have serious deficit problems; \ntwo wars; we are worried about global warming. We have a lot of \nproblems. But it seems to me to be totally absurd that people would \nsay: Oh, my goodness, we have to cut Social Security because it can \nonly pay out benefits for the next 26 years.\n  Go to Minnesota and say to a business person: If you could pay out \nall that you owe for the next 26 years, do you think it is a crisis? \nPeople would be shaking their heads.\n  I should point out that after those 26 years, if nothing is done--and \nI think something should be done--Social Security will be able to fund \nabout 78 percent of promised benefits. So it seems to me that given the \nenormous importance of Social Security not only to the elderly but to \npeople with disabilities, to people who are widows and orphans who have \nlost the income that a bread winner had brought into the family, we \nhave to do everything we can to protect Social Security.\n  We have to make it very clear that Social Security is strong, can pay \nout every benefit for 26 years, that has not contributed one nickel to \nthe deficit. And that is the amendment that I will be bringing up as \nsoon as I possibly can.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I sure would.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Would the Senator explain--I think he knows because he \nis quite an expert on this program. I agree 100 percent with the views \nhe just expressed. What is the basic average Social Security income \nthat a person might receive? I understand it is somewhere between \n$7,000 and $10,000.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I think it is a hair higher than that. I think it is \nabout $14,000 a year. But the point is, I would say to the Senator from \nLouisiana, there are millions of seniors for whom that is either all or \nalmost all of their income. That is it. That is it. In this day and \nage, that is the average. So your point is, there are people certainly \nbelow the average.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The reason I ask the Senator that is because it is \nstriking to me that some Members from the other side of the aisle will \ncome and argue that programs like this should be slated for cuts and \nreductions, and yet failed to vote favorably to raise slightly the \nincome tax on families making over $1 million a year in annual income. \nI, frankly, Senator, do not understand that. I am not sure people \nlistening to this understand it.\n  Could you enlighten us?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Here is the story. I agree with you. I find it hard to \nunderstand that there are people who get up here--and we hear the \nspeeches every day. They say we have a serious deficit crisis. It is \nunfair to leave that burden to our kids and our grandkids. We agree \nwith that.\n  We say, OK, let's address the deficit crisis. But let's do it in a \nway that is not on the backs of the sick, the elderly, the children, \nthe most vulnerable people in the country. So what this Senator is \npointing out is that in the last number of years what we have seen is \nthat the people on top have been doing very well--the top 1 percent now \nearns about 23 percent of all income, which is more than the bottom 50 \npercent. The effective tax rate for the very wealthiest people in this \ncountry is about 16 percent, which is the lowest in recent history. We \nhave given huge amounts of tax breaks in recent years to these very \nsame people.\n  So what I think the Senator from Louisiana is saying, and I agree \nwith her, is, if we are going to go forward with deficit reduction, \nwhich you and I agree we should, let's do it in a way that calls for \nshared sacrifices.\n  The Senator from Louisiana knows that H.R. 1, the Republican House-\npassed bill, would throw over 200,000 kids off of Head Start. Millions \nof students who are trying to get through college would either get \nlower Pell grants or no Pell grants at all.\n  It is an attack, a devastating attack, a cruel attack, against some \nof the most vulnerable people in this country. They are cutting back on \nthe Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\nInfants, and Children. There are low-income women now, who are trying \nto make sure they do not give birth to low-weight babies--cut back on \ntheir program. But when we say, well, maybe billionaires--who are doing \nphenomenally well--might be asked to pay a little bit more in taxes, \noh, my word. We will have none of that at all.\n  So the issue is shared sacrifice. Do not balance the budget on the \nbacks of the weak and the vulnerable.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Vermont for that eloquent and \nvery accurate description of the situation we are in. I see the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma here for an amendment. We want to keep these amendments \nbeing discussed. So I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for joining us.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, so the chairman knows, my planned time to \nintroduce these amendments is 3:30. That is what they have given me \ntime on. I did want to engage in some of the comments of the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  As someone who was on the deficit commission and looking at that, the \nfirst presumption was making Social Security solvent was our goal, \nmaking it solvent for 75 years. The flaw in the argument given by my \ncolleague from Vermont is the assumption that the IOU at the Treasury \nfor Social Security is good.\n  It is good as long as people will loan us money. It is not any good \nif they will not. So when people say, why fix Social Security? We can \nfix Social Security by taking the very haircut from the people the \nSenator from Vermont just described and markedly lessening the \nbenefits, even though they continue to pay into Social Security, that \nthey will receive, the billionaires and the millionaires. We can do \nthat. But if, in fact, we do not send a signal to the international \nfinancial community that on the largest expenditure we have, that we \nare going to make it solvent, then we will not be in the market and \navailable and have the ability to borrow the $2.8 trillion.\n  Now, one other thing on which I would disagree: The Social Security \ntrust fund trustees say Social Security is running a net deficit this \nlast year and will run one this year and for every year forward in \nterms of what comes in versus what goes out. There is no question I \nwant to keep our commitments. Nobody is talking about eliminating \nbenefits except to the very rich in this country in terms of Social \nSecurity. As a matter of fact, the deficit commission raised the \nbenefits in Social Security for the poorest in this country. So we \nactually did the opposite of what the Senator claims that Republicans \nmight want to do.\n  What we have to do is to make sure Social Security is viable for the \nfuture. And having looked at every aspect of Social Security, I can \ntell you if we are not able to borrow the $2.6 trillion, the benefits \nwill not be there. The money has been stolen. There is no trust fund. \nThere is no money there. If you read what the head of the OMB said in \n1999, he said it is not there.\n  So what is really happening in Social Security? Congresses, under \nboth Republican and Democratic control, both Republican and Democratic \nPresidencies, have stolen money from Social Security and spent it. The \nmoney is gone. It has been used for another purpose.\n  So there are two ways of solving this: One is to make Social Security \nthe priority and not fund anything but that until we get it paid back \nor we can actually refund that $2.6 trillion by going to the debt \nmarket, to which we will go every year from now forward under the \npresent plan on Social Security. The rate of taxes between now and 2035 \nthat will be taxed will rise from $106,000 or, I think, $107,000 to \n$168,000 between now and then. That is a 60-percent increase in the \ntaxes on the wealthy that is planned and programmed right now.\n  Even with that, Social Security will run a deficit every year, every \nyear now forward. Even with the $2.8 trillion, it still is in a \nnegative cashflow. So to deny the fact, if we do not want to fix Social \nSecurity, then what we are saying is we do not want to fix it for our \nchildren's children or our children.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to finish my point. It is not about taking \nsomething away, except from the very wealthy, the fix from the deficit \ncommission. That is what it did. We also added back. When you reach \n80--and a lot of people may be running out of their combination of what \ntheir retirement was plus their Social Security--we give another little \nbump.\n  So what the deficit commission did was significantly increase the \nviability for Social Security for the next 75 years. The Social \nSecurity trustees know we have to do this. Everybody knows we have to \ndo this. The question is, Does this Congress owe that $2.8 trillion \nback to Social Security? Yes. But where do we get the money to repay \nit?\n  Unless we can calm down the international financial markets, where we \nmake major changes not just in Social Security but in discretionary \nspending--$50 billion out of the Pentagon, modifying Medicare, where we \nget the fraud waste and abuse out of Medicare--unless we do those \nthings, we are not going to be able to borrow the money.\n  One final fact and then I will yield back to my chairman because I \nhave a meeting to go to. So far, in the last 5 months, who do you think \nhas bought our bonds to finance the deficit? We ran a $223 billion \ndeficit in the month of February.\n  Who bought them? Was it the Chinese? Who was the biggest buyer? The \nFederal Reserve bought 70 percent of the bonds we put on the market. \nWhat are they doing? They are debasing our currency and creating future \ninflation which will hurt the very people who are going to be on Social \nSecurity because the cost of living index will never truly keep up with \nthe real cost of inflation.\n  All of us have received letters from constituents wondering why there \nwas no COLA. We know why there was no COLA. When we look at food and \ntransportation costs and what they have done in the last 3 years, that \nis what is important to seniors--their health care costs, housing \ncosts, food costs. Yet we have a COLA system that does not recognize \nthat we may get into a period of hyperinflation because the Federal \nReserve is buying the bonds because nobody else will buy them. Right \nnow, 30 percent are bought in the market.\n  Final point. The largest bond trader in the world, PIMCO, last week \nsold every U.S. Government bond they had. They expect the price of the \nbonds to go down because they expect the interest rates to go up. What \nhappens to us if we don't fix Social Security? If the interest rates \nare going to be a lot higher on our debt and if they are a lot higher \nand we owe $14 trillion for every 1 percent increase in the cost of \nborrowing that we have, it adds to our deficit $140 billion.\n  I am honored Senator Sanders is adamant about making sure we keep our \ncommitments. But in terms of cashflow, it isn't there. We have to \naddress that. That is the only way we create confidence for the \ninternational financial community to say: You have a solvent program \nfor 75 years--the largest segment of our expenditures--and we are going \nto loan you money. If we don't do that, interest costs are going to be \nhigher, and we are going to pay for it anyway. Right now, we are almost \nto the point where these decisions will not be controlled by us. I \nwould rather us be in a situation of control.\n  This is not a partisan issue. There isn't one Senator who wants to \ntake money away from needy seniors. This is about making changes far \ndown the road that will affect people 30, 40, 50 years from now. It \nmakes sense to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me make a few points, if I may.\n  Is the Senator leaving?\n  Mr. COBURN. I have to.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I did wish to make a few points.\n  No. 1, the Senator from Oklahoma gave his understanding about what \nthe debt commission would do to Social Security. I do not agree with \nhis characterization. In point of fact, what the debt commission does \ndo is cut retirement benefits by more than 35 percent for young workers \nentering the workforce today. Today's 20-year-old workers who retire at \nage 65 would see their benefits cut by 17 percent if their wages \naverage $43,000 over their working lives, by 30 percent if their wages\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\naverage $69,000 over their working lives, and by 36 percent if their \nwages average $107,000 over their working lives, according to the \nSocial Security Chief Actuary. The proposed cuts would apply to \nretirees, disabled workers and their families, children who have lost \nparents, widows, and widowers. It is not accurate to say that the debt \ncommission left unscathed workers--quite the contrary. There are \ndevastating cuts to young workers.\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma wants to make sure Social Security is \nfinancially solvent for the next 75 years--and I want to see that as \nwell--there is an easy and fair way to do it. It is a way that doesn't \nrequire slashing benefits for younger workers. When Barack Obama ran \nfor President, he had a pretty good idea. I hope he still has that \nidea. What he said is that it is important to understand that right now \nsomebody making $1 million a year pays the same amount of money into \nthe Social Security trust fund as somebody who makes $106,000. If we \nlift that cap, start at $250,000, ask those people to contribute into \nthe Social Security trust fund, we will go a very long way to solving \nthe financial solvency of Social Security. I think we should do that. \nThat is certainly not what the deficit reduction commission \nrecommended.\n  We keep hearing that the Social Security trust fund has a pile of \nworthless IOUs. The fact is, Social Security invests the surplus money \nit receives from workers, from the payroll tax, into U.S. Government \nbonds, the same bonds China or anybody else purchases. These bonds are \nbacked by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. And in our \nentire history--and many of us want to make sure this continues--the \nU.S. Government has never defaulted on its debt obligations.\n  The point is, to say these are worthless IOUs is not dissimilar to \nsaying: Guess what. Because we have a deep deficit and a deep national \ndebt, we don't have any money to fund equipment for soldiers who are in \nthe field in Afghanistan or Iraq. They are just worthless IOUs, and we \ncan't fund them.\n  That is, of course, nonsense.\n  Do we have to address the deficit crisis? Yes, we do. But my friend \nfrom Oklahoma did not respond to the issue of why, if he and his \nfriends are so concerned about our deficit crisis, they vote year after \nyear for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the \nwealthiest people or why they want to repeal the estate tax, which will \nprovide $1 trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this has been a very interesting debate. \nIt really gets to the heart of the larger amendment on Capitol Hill and \nin the minds of all Americans. How are we going to close this budget \ndeficit, annual deficit, and how are we going to substantially reduce \nthe national debt?\n  I am pleased this discussion is taking place on this bill because the \nintention of this legislation is to close that gap by creating jobs. \nSome Senators actually believe we can accomplish that by cutting \ndiscretionary spending alone.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul, was arguing along that line, \nthat if we just accept his amendment, which I will strongly object to, \nand cut $200 billion out of the discretionary side of the budget, that \nwill get us in the direction we need to go. All that will do is eat the \nseed corn this country needs to invest in important things such as \ninfrastructure and education to secure the future for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I remind Senators that since 1982, military discretionary spending \nhas never dropped below 5.5 percent in any given year. The Paul \namendment, if adopted--and I doubt it will be--would propose a 50-\npercent reduction in the discretionary funding of Education, Energy, \nHousing and Urban Development. It is a drastic cut that would not \nsupport a foundation for growth and expansion.\n  Having said that, the other offensive thing to that approach is that \nthere never seems to be a discussion of a reduction of the military \nbudget when it comes to waste, fraud, and abuse. There are billions of \ndollars, hundreds of millions of dollars documented in the Defense \nDepartment by the Secretary of Defense himself that people object to in \ntrying to get to a balanced budget. Then we have Members who are trying \nto use the Social Security situation to argue for their point that the \nroof is falling in, the world is collapsing, and we have to cut back on \nSocial Security.\n  I wish to add to what Senator Sanders said and clarify something. I \nrespect Senator Coburn. No Member has worked harder on the issue of \ndeficits and debt reduction. I do not agree with all the things he \nsuggests, but I most certainly recognize effort when I see it. Senator \nCoburn has most certainly put in the effort. When he says the Social \nSecurity Program is running a deficit in terms of money in and money \nout, he is correct. But, as Senator Sanders pointed out, the reason is \nbecause the Federal Government used the surplus over the last 15 or 20 \nyears to fund other operations of government. But the Social Security \nProgram itself is intact. When that money is paid back, it will have a \nsurplus. Using the fact that it is running an annual deficit to argue \nfor either cutting benefits to Social Security or cutting benefits from \neducation or from health to pay for Social Security is not a legitimate \nargument. Again, Social Security is intact. It is actually running a \nsurplus. They would have a surplus right now in the account if the \nmoney had been left there.\n  It continues to amaze me that even in this discussion, we never, ever \nhear from the other side a willingness to raise $50 billion, if we are \ntrying to get to $100 billion in cuts--and some people want to get to \n200, but we would like to close the gap by anywhere from $10 to $100 \nbillion--if we want to get 50 of that billion by raising the income tax \non people who make over $1 million, we could get halfway to $100 \nbillion by doing that. But we never hear that. We just hear: Cut Social \nSecurity benefits, cut education, cut health care, cut Pell grants, cut \nhomeland security.\n  I know we have to cut back on spending. I know we have to get our \ndeficit under control. I know our debt is too high. But we are not \ngoing to achieve the goal of fiscal responsibility by cutting \ndiscretionary spending on the domestic side, which means cutting Head \nStart, Pell grants, and education, and adamantly refusing to raise the \nincome tax for people who make over $1 million.\n  This is going to be a very interesting debate over the next couple of \nweeks. It will not be settled on the SBIR bill, but it will be settled \nsometime in the next couple of weeks in this Congress. I, for one, look \nforward to the debate. I believe the American people need to have an \nopen and honest debate about what is actually going on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe there is a pending amendment, \nwhich hopefully we will vote on, called the McConnell amendment. It \nbasically takes away from the Environmental Protection Agency the \nauthority to regulate greenhouse gases. The Environmental Protection \nAgency gets this power from a Supreme Court decision that said they had \nthe authority to do so. That decision was about 2 or 3 years ago. It \ncame about 16 or 17 years after the 1990 Clean Air Act was passed. \nThose of us who were around here and debated and worked on the Clean \nAir Act of 1990 don't remember any discussion about EPA under that \nlegislation having the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, but \nobviously the Supreme Court read the law differently than we intended.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency was told it could regulate \ngreenhouse gases. The Environmental Protection Agency did not have to \ndo that, but I suppose they are like regulators, generally. Some ask: \nWhy do cows moo? Why do pigs squeal? And why do regulators regulate? \nBecause regulators know how to regulate, and that is all they know how \nto do. So they are going to issue a regulation if they think they have \nthe authority.\n  The situation is this: If we don't take away the authority--and in a \nsense overturn the Supreme Court case--EPA is going to put us in a \nposition of being economically uncompetitive with the rest of the \nworld, particularly in manufacturing.\n  When you increase the cost of energy by anywhere from $1,800, under \none\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\nstudy, to $3,000, under another study, per household, you are very \ndramatically increasing the cost of manufacturing. If we are worried \nabout too many manufacturing jobs going overseas--and we if would let \nthe EPA follow through with what they want to do, increasing the cost \nof energy--we will lose all our manufacturing overseas.\n  I have not checked the record, but my guess is a lot of my colleagues \nwho are fighting the McConnell amendment and think it is not the right \nthing to do are the very same people who are very chagrined because \njobs are going overseas and are blaming American industry.\n  Well, if we are going to pass a law that increases the cost of energy \nin this country, we are not going to have a level playing field with \nour competitors overseas. That is why I have always said, if we want to \nregulate CO2, we need to do it by international agreement. \nBecause if China is not on the same level playing field as we are, then \nwe are going to lose our manufacturing to China and other countries.\n  It happens that China puts more CO2 in the air than we do. \nTake China and Brazil and India and Indonesia, and they put a lot more \nCO2 into the air than the United States does. Yet somehow \nEPA is of the view that the United States acting alone can solve the \nglobal warming problem? Well, even the EPA Director has testified \nbefore committees of Congress that if the rest of the world does not do \nit, we are not going to make a dent in CO2 just by the \nUnited States doing it.\n  But the argument goes that the United States ought to show political \nleadership in this global economy we have, and if the United States \nwould do something about CO2, the rest of the world would \nfollow along. But China has already said they are not going to follow \nalong. Even Japan, which signed on to the Kyoto treaty, said they would \nnot be involved in extending the Kyoto treaty beyond 2012.\n  If the United States did it by itself, under the guise of being a \nworld leader and setting an example, and the rest of the world did not \ndo it, Uncle Sam would soon become ``Uncle Sucker,'' and we would find \nour manufacturing fleeing the United States to places where they do not \nhave regulation on CO2, where energy expenses are not as \nhigh, and we would lose the jobs accordingly. In a sense, then, those \npeople who have complained for decades about American manufacturing \nmoving overseas would destine the United States to lose more of it.\n  I do not understand how people who are concerned about losing jobs \noverseas could be fighting the McConnell amendment. Because if we want \nto preserve jobs in America, our industry has to be competitive with \nthe rest of the world. So I hope the McConnell amendment will be \nadopted, and I hope there will be some consistency in the reasoning of \npeople who are concerned about the movement of jobs overseas, that it \nis intellectually dishonest to support EPA adopting regulations that \nare going to make America uncompetitive.\n  There is nothing wrong with seeking a solution to the CO2 \nproblem. There is nothing wrong with working on the issue of global \nwarming. But it ought to be a level playing field for American industry \nso we can be competitive with the rest of the world and not lose our \nindustry, not lose our manufacturing overseas, and not lose the jobs \nthat are connected with it.\n  But it often is the case that when either the courts or the Congress \ndelegates broad powers to the executive branch agencies, it seems like \nwe give them an inch and they take a mile.\n  There are plenty of other examples as well--and I will go into some \nof them in just a moment--of EPA having some authority and moving very \ndramatically beyond what Congress intended in a way that does not meet \nthe commonsense test.\n  The work of EPA on CO2 is a perfect example of this kind \nof overreach. First of all, they did not have to do it just because the \nSupreme Court said they could do it. But like regulators, they want to \nregulate, and they are moving ahead.\n  I suppose they are moving ahead also because, in 2009, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a bill regulating CO2--a bill that \nwould have made the United States very uncompetitive, as I have stated \nthe EPA will--but the Senate declined to take it up. I think this \nadministration is intent upon getting the job done, and so they go to \nEPA to issue a rule because Congress will not pass the legislation it \nwants.\n  It is so typical of so many things this administration is doing; that \nbecause Congress will not pass a law they want, they see what they can \ndo by regulation. So they are setting out to accomplish a lot of change \nin public policy that Congress declines to endorse, but they are going \nto act anyway. If they claim the authority to do it, they will probably \nget away with it and avoid the will of the people, the will of the \npeople expressed through the Congress of the United States. So if \nCongress decides to not do something, can the administration ignore the \nwill of the people? Yes, they can, if they want to, but they should \nnot, in my judgment.\n  It brings me to not only the McConnell amendment but a lot of other \nthings we should be doing around here to prevent this outrageous \noverreach by not only the Environmental Protection Agency but by a lot \nof other agencies as well.\n  Because when the EPA and other agencies promulgate rules that go \nbeyond the intent of Congress--and never could have passed Congress--it \nundermines our system of checks and balances. The American people can \nhold their member of Congress accountable for passing laws they do not \nlike. However, when unelected bureaucrats implement policies with the \nforce of law that they would not have been able to get through the \nCongress--and that is without direct accountability when a regulator \nacts instead of Congress acting--something is very wrong, and it is \nagainst the will of the people.\n  I think it is time for Congress to reassert its constitutional role. \nWe try to do this from time to time in a process called the \nCongressional Review Act. I recall last June the Senator from Alaska, \nMs. Murkowski, proposed doing that on these very rules affecting \nCO2. We did not get a majority vote, so it did not happen. \nMaybe in the new Congress such an attempt would get a majority vote.\n  We cannot apply that Congressional Review Act again to those same \nrules, so that brings about the McConnell amendment I am speaking \nabout--to take away the authority of EPA to do it. But perhaps we can \nuse the congressional Review Act on a lot of other issues yet that \nregulators are regulating maybe against the will of the people, and I \nhope we will.\n  But there is one measure Senator Paul has suggested and I ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 231.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. He uses the acronym REINS, but it is called the \nRegulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act. Basically, what \nit does--and I applaud Senator Paul for his amendment, and I will \nsurely vote for it--and that is, when we delegate authority to agencies \nin the executive branch of government to write regulations, and if \nthose regulations are considered ``major rules,'' then they would have \nto be submitted to the Congress for our approval before they can go \ninto effect and then would also have to be signed by the President \nbefore they would go into effect.\n  It seems to me that is a natural extension of Congress's authority \nunder the Constitution to legislate and to be the only branch of \ngovernment that can legislate. It seems to me to be a very adequate \ncheck on out-of-control bureaucracy, that they can only do those things \nCongress intended they do in the legislation they pass.\n  I would extend my remarks on something a little bit unrelated to the \nMcConnell amendment but still to the overreach of the Environmental \nProtection Agency; this is, in regard to some of their regulations on \nagriculture. When it comes to their regulation of agriculture, instead \nof EPA standing for Environmental Protection Agency, I think it stands \nfor ``End Production Agriculture.'' That is not their intent. But in \nthis city of Washington--and I describe it sometimes as an island \nsurrounded by reality--it is evidence of not enough common sense being \nput into the thought process of issuing regulations. I could give \nseveral examples, but I may just give a few.\n  Before I give those examples, I wish to compliment EPA on one thing. \nA\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\nyear or two ago, when one of their subdivision heads testified before \nCongress--and the issue was agriculture, and she said she had never \nbeen on a family farm, in the 20-some years they had been working in \nthe EPA and yet dealing with agriculture issues--I invited her to a \nfamily farm and she came and showed a great deal of interest. We had a \nvery thorough tour of some facilities in research, agriculture, and \nbiofuels industries within our State. They were very thankful we did \nit. I believe it has helped their consideration of the impact that \nmaybe some of their regulation writing has on agriculture.\n  But, still, I am not totally convinced. So I would use one or two \nexamples of regulation that is out of control. One of them would deal \nwith what I call the fugitive dust issue.\n  ``Fugitive dust'' is a term EPA uses to regulate what they call \nparticulate matter. The theory behind fugitive dust rules is that if \nyou are making dust that is harmful, then you have to keep it within \nyour property line. So let's see the reality of that.\n  You are farming. The wind is blowing, and you have to work in the \nfields. The wind is blowing so hard that you cannot keep the dust, when \nyou are tilling the fields, within your property line.\n  Well, are you supposed to not farm? Are you supposed to not raise \nfood? Are you supposed to not be concerned about the production of food \nthat is so necessary to our national defense and the social cohesion of \nour society? Because we are only nine meals away from a revolution. If \nyou go nine meals without eating, and you do not have prospects of it, \nare we going to have revolts such as they have in other countries \nbecause they do not have enough food? No, we have a stable supply of \nfood in this country, so we do not have to worry about it. But suppose \nwe did have to worry about it. Well, there is more to farming than just \nthe prosperity of rural America. There is the national defense and \nsocial cohesion, and all those issues.\n  But the point is, they are thinking about issuing a rule--in fact, \nthey started a process, 2 or 3 years ago, of issuing a rule maybe a \nyear or two from now--hopefully, they will decide not to--that says you \nhave to keep the dust within your property line. I wonder, when I talk \nabout the common sense that is lacking in this big city--not only in \nEPA, but in a lot of agencies--do they realize only God determines when \nthe wind blows? Do they realize only God determines when soybeans have \n13 percent moisture in September or October, and at 13 percent moisture \nyou have to harvest them and you only have about 2 or 3 days of ideal \nweather to harvest them? When you combine soybeans, dust happens; and \nif dust happens and you can't keep it within your property lines, you \nare going to violate the EPA regulation. What are you supposed to do, \nshut down and let a whole year's supply of food stay in the field? No. \nGood business practices would say when beans get to 13 percent \nmoisture, whether the wind is blowing or not, you are going to take \nyour combine out into the field and not worry about the dust. Does \nsomebody at EPA think John Deere and Caterpillar and New Holland and \nall of those companies are thinking about: Well, we have this problem \nwith EPA; we have to do something about the dust and we have to control \nit coming out of our combines? Or, when our tillage equipment goes \nacross the field we have to consider the dust that comes up from \ntilling the field? Well, we have asked these manufacturers. They don't \nhave any solutions to these problems. I think they probably think it is \nridiculous, after 6,000 years of agriculture throughout our society, \nthat it is an issue. But there are people down at EPA who think it is \nan issue. So I use fugitive dust as one example as to whether they \nrealize what they are doing to production agriculture.\n\n  Another one would be spilled milk. Milk has fat in it. So now they \nare saying if dairy farmers have above-the-ground tanks to store their \nmilk, they are the same as above-the-ground oil tanks and they are \ngoing to have the same regulation applied to them as applied to \npetroleum. The compliance requirements on this have been delayed \npending action on an exemption, so maybe this won't go through. But \nthink how ridiculous it is that people at the Environmental Protection \nAgency are saying if you are a dairy farmer and you happen to spill a \nlittle milk, you have to follow the same environmental requirements as \nan oil company if they spill oil with respect to the cleanup. But that \nis where we are on these sorts of rules.\n  I have other examples such as Atrazine, and the potential application \nof Chesapeake Bay requirements to the rest of the country. But I hope \nwe will take a look at this McConnell amendment that speaks to carbon \ndioxide plus the examples I have given of the harm EPA regulations will \ndo to family farming and stop to think about it. We have to find ways \nto stop EPA from doing things that don't make common sense. I think a \nstart would be to vote for the McConnell amendment, and I am going to \nvote for it.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 o'clock \nI be given 5 minutes to speak, and the Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, speak immediately after me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Federal Budget Debate\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the current \ndebate over the Federal budget. Yesterday, we had a very telling and \ntroubling vote in the House of Representatives. On the 3-week \ncontinuing resolution needed to avoid a government shutdown on March \n18, Speaker Boehner was forced to rely on votes from House Democrats in \norder to pass a measure he himself had negotiated. The reason was that \nconservative Republicans abandoned their party leadership in droves out \nof anger that the measure lacks special interest add-ons dealing with \nideological issues, such as abortion, global warming, and net \nneutrality.\n  In all, 54 conservative Republicans rejected the measure, even though \nit was necessary to avert a shutdown and even though it included $6 \nbillion in cuts to domestic discretionary spending.\n  This is a bad omen. This was not supposed to happen. Last week, the \nSenate held two test votes--one on H.R. 1 and one on a Democratic \nalternative. We knew that neither one would have the votes to pass, but \nwe held the votes anyway. And, sure enough, they both went down. The \npurpose of those votes was to make it clear that both sides' opening \nbids in this debate were nonstarters and thus pave the way for a \nserious, good-faith compromise. But, unfortunately, an intense \nideological tail continues to wag the dog over in the House of \nRepresentatives. Speaker Boehner had hoped after H.R. 1 failed in the \nSenate that it would convince his conservatives of the need to \ncompromise. Instead, those conservatives have only dug in further. Not \nonly will they not budge off $61 billion in extreme cuts on the long-\nterm measure and special-interest add-ons, but they also won't support \nany more stopgaps to avert a shutdown. So Speaker Boehner is now caught \nbetween a shutdown and a hard place.\n\n  The Speaker has said all along he wants to avoid a shutdown at all \ncosts, and I believe him. He is a good man. The problem is, a large \npercentage of those in his party don't feel the same way. They think \n``compromise'' is a dirty word. They think taking any steps to avert a \nshutdown would mean being the first to blink. And don't take my word \nfor it. Here is what some in the other Chamber are saying: Conservative \nHouse Member Mike Pence said passing a 3-week bill to keep the \ngovernment running would ``only delay a\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\nconfrontation that must come. I say, let it come now. It's time to take \na stand.'' That is what Congressman Pence said. Michelle Bachmann said, \n``If a Member votes for the continuing resolution, that vote \neffectively says, `I am choosing not to fight.' ''\n  Outside forces on the far right are also cheerleading a shutdown. Tea \nParty Nation, for example, has called on Republicans to oppose any more \nbudget measures unless they repeal health care and do away with family \nplanning.\n  The tea party element in the House is digging in its heels. That is \nputting the Speaker in a real bind. His need to avoid a shutdown is in \nconflict with his political desire to keep his tea party base happy.\n  I don't envy the position the Speaker is in, but he is going to have \nto make a choice one way or the other. There are two choices but only \none of them is responsible. The Republican leadership can cater to the \ntea party element and, as Mike Pence has suggested, ``pick a fight'' \nthat will inevitably cause a shutdown on April 8 or the leadership can \nabandon the tea party in these negotiations and forge a consensus among \nmore moderate Republicans and a group of Democrats. I think we all know \nwhat the right answer is. Speaker Boehner wouldn't have been able to \npass this short-term measure without Democratic votes, and he won't be \nable to pass a long-term one without Democratic votes either. It is \nclear that there is no path to compromise that goes through the tea \nparty. We urge Speaker Boehner to push ahead without them. We are ready \nto work with him if he is willing to buck the extreme elements in his \nparty.\n  Throughout this debate, Democrats have repeatedly shown a willingness \nto negotiate, a willingness to meet Republicans somewhere in the \nmiddle. Yet the rank-and-file of the House GOP has been utterly \nunrelenting. They have wrapped their arms around the discredited, \nreckless approach advanced by H.R. 1, and they won't let go. Worse, the \nlast few days have taught us that spending cuts alone will not bring a \ncompromise.\n  The new demand from the far right is that we go along with all their \nextraneous riders. They do not belong on a budget bill, but they were \nshoehorned onto H.R. 1 anyhow. Now these hardliners in the House want \nthem in any deal. These measures are like a heavy anchor bogging down \nthe budget.\n  In recent days, a number of rightwing interest groups, such as the \nFamily Research Council, began encouraging Republicans to vote against \nany budget measure that doesn't contain some of these controversial \npolicy measures. That is why a compromise has been so hard to come by \non the budget. It is because hard-right Republicans want more than \nspending cuts; they want to impose their entire social agenda on the \nback of a must-pass budget. Those on the right are entitled to their \npolicy positions, but there is a time and a place to debate these \nissues and, Mr. President, this ain't it.\n  If this debate were only about spending cuts, we could possibly come \nto an agreement before too long, but we will have a hard time coming to \nan agreement with those on the far right threatening the budget as an \nopportunity to enact a far-ranging social agenda.\n  The tea party lawmakers are putting a drag on the progress of these \nbudget talks. Many Republicans in the House recognize the \nunreasonableness of the hardliners. Kevin McCarthy was reported to have \ngotten into a ``tense exchange'' with Mr. Pence, one of the lead \ndefectors. Republican Mike Simpson acknowledged it was ``unexpected'' \nto have so many defections yesterday. Steve LaTourette of Ohio said \npassing the 3-week stopgap was ``exactly what people expect us to do--\nfind cuts and continue to talk.'' And Michael Grimm, from my home State \nof New York, said the tea party lawmakers were ``a big mistake.'' This \nshows there are enough commonsense conservatives in the House to go \nalong with reasonable Democrats that Speaker Boehner can find a way \naround the tea party. In order to avoid a dead end on these budget \ntalks, he should abandon the tea party and work to find a bipartisan \nconsensus. It is the only way out of this bind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 197\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 197.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No objection, Mr. President, but may I ask--I see \nSenator Murray on the floor and Senator Stabenow is on the floor, so I \nask unanimous consent that after Senator Hutchison from Texas, we \nrecognize Senator Murray for 7 minutes and Senator Stabenow for 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Texas so modify her \nrequest to allow the others to speak after her?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I do, Mr. President. I would like to have my \namendment called up, then speak, and then I am happy to have the \nunanimous consent so that they know the order following me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. May I request of the Senator how long she intends to \nspeak?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. For 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is granted.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 197.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To delay the implementation of the health reform law in the \n   United States until there is final resolution in pending lawsuits)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 504. EFFECTIVE DATE OF PPACA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and the Health Care and \n     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), \n     including the amendments made by such Acts, that are not in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act shall not be in \n     effect until the date on which final judgment is entered in \n     all cases challenging the constitutionality of the \n     requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage under \n     section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that are \n     pending before a Federal court on the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Promulgation of Regulations.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Federal Government shall not promulgate \n     regulations under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act (Public Law 111-148) or the Health Care and Education \n     Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), including \n     the amendments made by such Acts, or otherwise prepare to \n     implement such Acts (or amendments made by such Acts), until \n     the date on which final judgment is entered in all cases \n     challenging the constitutionality of the requirement to \n     maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that are pending before a \n     Federal court on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do wish to thank the Senator from \nLouisiana, who is managing the bill for her side, for allowing us to go \nforward with amendments. I think that is very important, and I do have \nan amendment that I think will help our small businesses and our States \nthroughout the country. The cosponsors to amendment No. 197 are \nSenators Hatch, Kyl, Barrasso, Burr, Johanns, Murkowski, Cochran, \nMoran, and Ensign.\n  We are approaching the 1-year anniversary of health care reform \nbecoming law, and it is important to highlight the reality of what this \nbill has done to every American family, every patient, every doctor, \nhealth care provider, and every small business in this country.\n  One year later, the skyrocketing cost of health care is still the No. \n1 concern among our Nation's job creators. Just today, my office heard \nfrom a small business in Corpus Christi, TX, that has 34 employees. \nThis company has now gotten the bids for renewal of the policies they \nhad before, and the cheapest option for their health insurance \nrepresents a 44-percent increase from last year's cost. They have until \nApril 1 to decide whether to continue to offer their employees health \ninsurance and to try to figure out how they are going to compensate for \nthat increase in cost. But this isn't the first small business I have \nheard from that is telling me the same thing--that their premiums are \ncoming up for renewal, they\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\nare getting bids, they are trying to get the best bid they possibly \ncan, and the costs are skyrocketing.\n  These price increases have not happened in a vacuum. They are the \nresult of the 2,000-page, $2.6 trillion health care bill signed into \nlaw 1 year ago. One year after that bill was signed, small businesses \nare facing unprecedented premium increases. Their policies are being \ncanceled as insurers close up shop because of new Federal regulations.\n  The reality of the small business tax credits touted by the \nadministration are really just an empty promise that a majority of \nsmall businesses will never see. In fact, the Obama administration \nestimated that by 2013 as many as 80 percent of small businesses will \nnot even be offering their current health care plan anymore due to the \nnew Federal regulations and mandates and the increasing costs, leaving \nthe promise our President made--if you like what you have, you can keep \nit--as a distant memory.\n  A former Director of the Congressional Budget Office has warned that \nhealth reform includes strong incentives for employers and employees to \ndrop employer-sponsored health insurance for as many as 35 million \nAmericans.\n  A recent employer survey conducted by the National Business Group on \nHealth reports that 81 percent of employers have experienced increased \nadministrative burdens because of health reform. This same survey also \nreported that because of the increased cost from health reform, 68 \npercent of employers are increasing the contributions required for \ndependent insurance coverage. The Congressional Budget Office agrees \nand has reported that these increased burdens and mandates on employers \nwill result in fewer jobs, as well as a shift from full-time to part-\ntime jobs in our country. The Congressional Research Service adds that \nlower wages will also become a reality because of the new employer \nmandates.\n  The only good news our small businesses have gotten recently on this \nhealth care reform bill is from the courts. Two Federal courts have \nfound the law unconstitutional--one in Virginia and one in Florida. In \nJanuary, the Florida judge voided the entire law because the \nConstitution doesn't allow Congress to force individuals, small \nbusinesses, or families to purchase anything just because you live in \nthis country. That is why I am offering an amendment to S. 493, the \nsmall business innovation bill, that would delay any further \nimplementation of health reform until the Supreme Court rules whether \nthe law is actually a valid law.\n  Included within the 2,000 pages of the law are provisions that harm \nsmall businesses, their employees, and families. The health reform law \ncontains $500 billion in new taxes, cuts nearly $500 billion from \nMedicare to fund the new government entitlement, and puts the Federal \nGovernment between patients and their doctors. Health reform requires \nindividuals and businesses to buy government-approved health care or \nhave IRS agents knocking at their door. If business owners want to grow \ntheir business and hire new employees, health reform says: If you have \nover 50 employees, there will be costly new Federal regulations with \nwhich you have to comply. Small businesses across the country that now \nhave 48 or 49 employees are facing a Federal mandate that discourages \nthem from hiring more people. And this is occurring during one of the \nhighest unemployment rates in our country's history.\n  We need to get government off the backs of small businesses, our job \ncreators, and stop putting up miles of redtape that restrict \ninnovation. This bill is the perfect place to do it.\n  My amendment would pause further implementation of this law so that \nwe don't spend millions of our taxpayer dollars and our small business \ndollars implementing a bill that ultimately could be struck down by the \nhighest Court in the land in a case that has already said the law is \nunconstitutional. It is making its way to the Supreme Court as we \nspeak.\n\n  In addition to the effects on the individuals and small businesses of \nour country, State legislators and Governors across our country are \nalso making very tough decisions needed to close nearly $125 billion in \nbudget shortfalls. They too are having to meet the Federal mandates of \nhealth care reform. Their Medicaid systems are being drastically \nimpacted.\n  Some States are saying, because of the Florida judge's ruling, they \nare not going to go further in implementing the law. They do not want \nto spend the millions if the law is going to be declared \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court. On the other hand, we are \nputting them in the position of taking a chance because there are fines \nif they do not implement the law in a timely way, according to the law \nthat was passed. If they do not implement it, while the court has said \nthe law is unconstitutional, they could pay, on the other end, by \nhaving fines because they did not implement it.\n  My home State of Texas is going forward with implementation, but they \nare facing a $27 billion shortfall in their budget. Yet they are \nspending money that may be money down a rat hole to implement a law \nthat may not be a valid law.\n  Today we could take one Federal mandate off the list. Today we can \nmake it easier for job creators to create jobs. The least we can do for \nthe businesses and States and families in our country is to delay the \nburden, the mandates, the regulations and taxes until the highest Court \nin the land rules on whether it is a valid law.\n  This amendment would not affect any of the law that has already been \nimplemented. We are not doing something that is retroactive at all. But \nwhen this bill passes, everything going forward would be halted until \nthe Supreme Court has ruled on whether, in fact, the health care law \nthat was passed last year is a valid law. I ask my colleagues to join \nme in taking this heavy burden from our employers and our States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Louisiana, \nMs. Landrieu, for her tremendous work on the bill in front of us today, \nthe small business bill. It is so important that we keep focusing on \nwhat is most important right now for families and small business owners \nacross the country; that is, to continue working to create jobs and \nboost the economy. That is exactly what this bill is all about.\n  Last month our economy added over 200,000 private sector jobs, and \nthe unemployment rate fell to the lowest in 2 years. We have a long way \nto go, but I am confident we have turned the corner and we are now \nbeginning to move in the right direction. But we have to continue to \nmake progress. That is exactly why I strongly support this long-term \nreauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research Program, \nwhich supports research and development efforts by small businesses \nthat will help them grow and create jobs.\n  That is why I will continue working with all of our colleagues to \nmake sure we pass a budget for this year that cuts spending responsibly \nwhile continuing to invest in programs that create jobs and boost our \neconomy.\n  The Small Business Innovation Research Program, or SBIR, is a \nbipartisan bill that has been successfully creating jobs since it was \nsigned into law by President Reagan in 1982. The resources this program \nhas provided to small businesses over the years have led to new \nproducts, new ideas, and new innovations. In fact, small business tech \nfirms that receive SBIR grants produce 38 percent of our country's \ntaxes, they employ 40 percent of America's scientists and engineers, \nand they have produced many of the most important innovations that have \ndriven our economy forward.\n  This program has been especially important in my home State of \nWashington, for over 200,000 grants have been awarded to small \nbusinesses totaling close to $700 million. One company that received \nthe support of the Small Business Innovation Research Program is \nInfinia, in the Tri-Cities area of my State. Infinia was founded in \n1985 as an R firm, but they have been able now to successfully \ntransition to commercial production and have emerged as a leader in our \nState's clean-tech industry.\n  With support from SBIR's other programs, Infinia has been able to \ndevelop their products and grow from 30 employees to over 150. These \nare good family-wage jobs in that community. This is such a great \nexample of what\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\nsmall businesses can do with just a little bit of support.\n  There are thousands of companies across the country with similar \nstories that have received a critical boost from SBIR. Unfortunately, \nthe Small Business Innovation Research Program has been operating now \nunder a short-term authorization over the last several years, and that \ncreates uncertainty and makes planning very difficult for companies \nthat do want to participate in this program.\n  I hope we support this long-term legislation that will help our \ninnovative small businesses develop their products and expand and \ncreate jobs and we do not continue to see all these extraneous measures \nadded onto it that will stop us from getting it passed in the Senate \nand moving to a place that can help create jobs and grow our economy.\n  I also want to mention another issue we are going to be discussing on \nthe floor because it is directly connected to Senate Democrats' efforts \nto get workers back on the job; that is, the need to pass a long-term \nbudget bill to keep the government open through the end of this fiscal \nyear.\n  I am disappointed that the same Republicans who came into office \nsaying they were going to focus on the economy have now put forward a \nvery damaging and short-sighted budget proposal that would literally \ndestroy hundreds of thousands of jobs and devastate our workers and \nsmall businesses and undermine our fragile economic recovery.\n  I am disappointed that at a time when our middle-class families still \nneed some support to get back on their feet, Republicans have proposed \nthis very highly politicized slash-and-burn budget that is going to \npull the rug out from under these families at a critical time.\n  I am disappointed that while on this side, Senate Democrats have put \nforward some ideas to make responsible and prudent budget cuts that \nwill allow us to continue to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build \nour competitors, that we need to do, we are seeing a Republican budget \nproposal that is going to hack away at the investments that strengthen \nour ability to compete right now and improve the quality of life for \nall of our families in this country.\n  The proposal they put forward would slash programs such as Head \nStart. It would decimate housing and economic development. It would \neliminate community health centers that the Presiding Officer has \nworked so hard to put in place. It would cut off critical investments \nfor our workers and our infrastructure.\n  Independent analysts have said their plan would destroy up to 700,000 \nAmerican jobs. That includes 15,000 in my home State. That is a hit we \ncannot take right now. It would be devastating.\n  Senate Democrats are trying to put forward a proposal that goes in a \nvery different direction. We will cut spending billions of dollars, but \nwe will do it in a responsible and measured way to protect our middle-\nclass families and not kill jobs and continue making the investments we \nneed to compete and win in the 21th-century economy.\n  Unfortunately, as we all know, we were not able to pass that proposal \nlast week. Now, unfortunately, we are back to passing a short-term \nfunding bill just to keep the government from shutting down. I have to \ntell you, weekly spending bills are no way to run the government. I am \nhopeful that moderate Republicans will say no to the extreme members of \ntheir party and come to the table to work with us to pass a responsible \nlong-term budget that will help us create jobs and invest in middle-\nclass families and workers across the country. That is what this is all \nabout: creating jobs, getting our economy back on track, and setting \nour country up for continued success and prosperity now and in the \nfuture. That is exactly why this debate is so important, and it is also \nwhy having the Small Business Research Investment Program is so \ncritical.\n  I urge my colleagues today to support this reauthorization, to \nsupport small businesses and investment in innovation and growth. I \nhope we can get rid of these extraneous matters for all of us to come \ntogether and do something that helps create jobs and gets our economy \nback on track rather than diving into all the political debates of the \npast and offering all the amendments we can think of in order to slow \nit down.\n  This bill is important, and I hope we can move it forward to final \npassage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nSmall Business Innovation Research Act. I congratulate and thank our \ndistinguished chair, the Senator from Louisiana, for her leadership and \nadvocacy for small business. I was pleased to join with her as we \nworked very hard last fall to pass the Small Business Jobs Act to \ncreate more capital for small businesses to be able to grow and thrive \nand start a new business, expand their business. The eight different \ntax cuts that were in that proposal as well are beginning to take \neffect and help our small businesses.\n  This particular bill in front of us is one more opportunity for us to \npartner with small businesses that are on the cutting edge of \ninnovation and new ideas. We just passed a patent change to update our \npatent laws last week. I am proud the one satellite patent office in \nthe country is in Detroit because we are the heart of innovation and \nnew technology. We need to make sure small businesses are able to \ncompete successfully and have the partnership knowledge they need to \ncreate these innovations. That is what this legislation does.\n  We know small businesses create two-thirds of all new jobs in \nAmerica. Our top priority should be working with them to create an \nenvironment so small businesses can thrive and create jobs. I have to \nsay, even in our wonderful automobile industry, which is roaring back, \nthe majority of our jobs are in the small- and medium-size suppliers. \nIt is very much about small business and medium-size businesses.\n  This particular program was first created by President Reagan in \n1982, and it has helped literally tens of thousands of small businesses \ncreate jobs--new ideas, new innovations in our economy. We have led the \nway in a variety of military and communication and health care \ninnovations. It has been extremely successful. In fact, small business \ntech firms have participated in SBIR producing 38 percent of our \npatents. Thirty-eight percent of America's patents have come from small \nbusinesses involved in the tech sector partnering with the Federal \nGovernment on new innovative opportunities--13 times more patents than \ncoming from large businesses.\n  This is a big deal. This is very much about out-innovating in a \nglobal economy so we can compete globally and create jobs. Our small \nbusinesses in the tech sector employ about 40 percent of our scientists \nand engineers. They produced 25 percent of our Nation's crucial \ninnovations over the last three decades. Unfortunately, this important \npartnership has been allowed to nearly lapse, and it had to be \nreauthorized 10 different times in the last 3 years--over and over \nagain, for just a few months at a time. It is impossible for small \nbusinesses to plan for the future and be able to create those \ninnovative investments and partnerships without a long-term view.\n  We have in front of us a bill that would reauthorize this important \npartnership for the next 8 years and give some opportunity to plan a \nlittle bit more long term, which I think is also critical.\n  We have many outstanding small businesses that are partnering right \nnow with our universities and with our Federal agencies to create jobs \nand innovations. One of those outstanding entities is Cybernet Systems \nin Ann Arbor, a leader in research and development in the medical and \ndefense fields. They are one of the largest small business innovative \nresearch contract winners. Because of their success they have now added \nup to 60 employees, and they have had 30 patents as a result of the \nSBIR Program.\n  Another important entity is Niowave in Lansing, MI, a high-tech \nbusiness specializing in superconducting particle accelerators. They \nhave been doubling their staff, and talking to them today, tripling \ntheir workforce because of new innovations they have created, they have \nnow been nominated for the National SBIR business of the year.\n  Finally, an important part of our economy in Michigan--and nationally \nas we look to alternatives to bring down gas prices by having better \ncompetition for alternatives, alternative\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\nenergy through battery policy and electric vehicles--has been aided by \nthe small business program in front of us today.\n  As an example, A123 Systems is a company that has received SBIR \nsupport. I was very pleased in September of last year to join with them \nwhen they opened the largest lithium ion battery manufacturing plant in \nNorth America, in Livonia, MI, and they are now creating 400 jobs.\n  I could go on and on. I will not in the interest of time. But \nfocusing on small business, focusing on innovation, new technologies, \nwill create jobs, allow us to out-compete in a global economy, and \nallow us to grow our economy. We in Michigan are very proud to be \nhelping to lead the way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I know Senator Portman is here on the floor, and under \na previous order will be recognized in a few minutes. But before that, \nfor clarification purposes on the previous agreement, I want to state \nthat the next first-degree amendment in order after Senator Hutchison, \nwho spoke a minute ago, will be from the Democratic side.\n  As a recap, there are, I think, seven amendments pending. We are \nhoping to get some votes on those amendments that are pending later \nthis afternoon, potentially in the morning. If there are other \namendments Senators have to offer, come down to floor. We want to \nlimit, of course, what we can. It is very important for us to move this \nbill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                            twin challenges\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate being given the time to make \na few remarks as a new Senator from Ohio. To be in the Senate, \nrepresenting the people of Ohio, is a great honor and solemn \nresponsibility, particularly at this critical time in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  And it is actually not an honor I expected to have. After \nrepresenting southern Ohio in the U.S. House for 12 years, and serving \nin the Bush administration, I returned home to Cincinnati, OH, 4 years \nago. Although we had kept our home in Cincinnati, and raised our kids \nthere, I had commuted for 15 years, and it was time to be home with \nthree teenagers, my amazing wife Jane, and other family members \nincluding my dad, one of my true heroes.\n  At that time, my predecessor, Senator George Voinovich, was serving \nwith distinction here, and had said he intended to run for reelection. \nI was happy to be back in the private sector, involved in two small \nfamily businesses, practicing law, teaching at the Ohio State \nUniversity and enjoying being a dad, including getting to coach my \ndaughter's soccer teams. But I was also watching with apprehension the \nworsening economy and the way the administration and Congress were \nresponding.\n  When George Voinovich announced he would not seek reelection to the \nSenate, I made the decision to run because I was so concerned with the \ndirection of my State and our country. I saw the bottom falling out of \nthe Ohio economy. And I saw firsthand the pain that comes with layoffs \nand downsizing.\n  Like others, I was frustrated that while Ohio small businesses and \nfamilies were making the tough decisions to deal with a deepening \nrecession, the Federal Government seemed immune, and out of touch. \nInstead of cutting expenses and figuring out how to do more with less, \nand focusing on private sector job growth, the Obama administration and \nCongress responded with a big government approach. Unfortunately, the \n$800 billion stimulus package had less to do with creating private \nsector jobs than growing the size and scope of government.\n  And, in the midst of all this, I saw a new national health care bill \nworking its way through the system that would substantially increase \nthe Federal Government role and lock in place the unsustainable costs \nand inefficiency of our health care system, making health care even \nmore expensive for families and small businesses and making it harder \nto deal with the exploding costs of health care in the Federal budget.\n  And I saw record deficits building up to dangerous levels of debt \nthat further threatened our economy.\n  These issues, these deep concerns over jobs and the direction of our \neconomy and fiscal crisis we face as a nation are my focus now in the \nSenate. And I am not alone. Whether Republican, Democrat, or \nIndependent, I believe Ohioans understand that our State and our \ncountry are in trouble, and it is going to take real change and all of \nus working together across party lines to set things right.\n  I believe the twin challenges of our time are how to revive the \nAmerican economic miracle, and how to stop the reckless overspending by \ngovernment that threatens to extinguish the American dream. And one \naffects the other. Without a growing economy and more jobs we cannot \nhope to reverse the dangerous trend of record deficits and deepening \ndebt.\n  And without getting our spending under control, we can not get our \neconomy moving. It is not one or the other.\n  These two goals are not inconsistent; in fact, they are reinforcing. \nWith the fiscal time bomb on our doorstep and all the uncertainty it \ncreates, we will never see the kind of strong recovery we hope for. We \nhave to do both.\n  In addition to taking steps to get our fiscal house in order, we \nrevive the American economic miracle by moving aggressively to create \nthe climate for job growth, for innovation, invention, and \nentrepreneurship. We need an environment that encourages risk-taking \nand private investment, which economists will tell you is the biggest \nchallenge we face in this weak recovery. The current economic climate \nencouraged by Washington is one of uncertainty and apprehension. I have \nseen it all over Ohio.\n  Last fall, I visited an independent trucking company, Wooster \nTrucking, based in Wayne County, OH. Paul Williams, the owner, pulled \ntogether a dozen or so local small business owners from the area for a \nroundtable discussion, one of the many I have had in the last couple \nyears. Struggling in a tough economy, these small businesses all \nwondered the same thing: why has Washington made it harder on them to \ngrow and create jobs, not easier? They talked about the threat of new \nEPA regulations that will drive up energy costs. Depending on their \nbusiness, they were worried about other specific Federal regulations or \nmandates in trucking, manufacturing and banking that would drive up \ntheir compliance make them less competitive.\n  They talked about the threat of higher income taxes coming, which \ncreates uncertainty at a time when the opposite is needed to \nincentivize businesses to invest and grow. Like the vast majority of \nsmall businesses, most of those businesses around the table that day \npay their taxes as individuals not corporations. The temporary \nextension of tax rates and capital gains and death taxes, with the very \nreal possibility of higher taxes soon reduces their incentive to invest \nand create the jobs we need.\n  Every single small business owner around the table talked about \nhealth care. All of them said the same thing. They said, since the \nhealth care bill passed, their health care costs are going up more, not \nless, and how that was increasing their cost of doing business and \nhurting their ability to create jobs. They talked about premium \nincreases of 10 to 25 percent, eating away any profit and chance to \nexpand even after cutting other expenses.\n  At one of the 80 factory visits I have made in the past 2 years, \nBruce Beeghley, an impressive small business entrepreneur in northeast \nOhio, told me his orders were picking up but he was not hiring. He was \npaying overtime instead of hiring permanent workers for the long-term \nbecause of the embedded and increasing cost of health care.\n  And our education system and Federal worker retraining system is \nfailing us in Ohio: Around the State, high-tech companies have told me \nthey cannot find the skilled workers they need. This is wrong: At a \ntime of soaring unemployment, there is a skills gap in America. There \nare high-skilled, high-wage jobs available but our schools are not \nproducing a sufficient supply of well-trained American workers.\n  You cannot be out there talking to workers and management without \nseeing these issues. But I have heard it closer to home. In fact, I am \nthe product of small family business. My dad,\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\nBill Portman, who we lost at age 88 last year, was one of those small \nbusiness risk takers. He took a big risk when I was a kid. At age 40, \nhe left a job. He had a good job with a big company as a salesman. He \nhad health care coverage and retirement benefits. He gave it all up to \nstart his own business, Portman Equipment Company, with five other guys \nand my mom as bookkeeper.\n  He could not get a loan and his family did not have the money and the \nbank would not lend him money, so he borrowed money from my mom's \nuncle. The company lost money over the first few years, but they kept \nit alive through hard work, ingenuity, and sacrifice. My brother took \nthe reins later and took it to a new level. By the time my dad retired \nthe company employed almost 300 people, 300 families.\n  We all worked there, and when I was growing up, the discussion around \nthe kitchen table was often about how government--taxes, rules, and \nregulations--affected Portman Equipment and other Ohio small \nbusinesses. My dad is among my heroes because of his hard work and \nsacrifice. Because with my mom they built something of value. I have \nseen it done, and I know the role government can play and should not \nplay in helping to create jobs and opportunities.\n  About a year ago, I asked my dad if he would take the same risk \ntoday. He said, ``I don't know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there \n. . . That is a word I hear a lot from small business owners all over \nOhio. That is why a lot of job creators, or potential job creators are \nstaying on the sidelines, and keeping their cash on the sidelines, and \nkeeping their cash on the sidelines rather than investing in plant, \nequipment, and people.\n  Leadership is needed to create a positive climate which spurs job \ngrowth, drives opportunity and restores the American dream. Leadership \nis needed to get a handle on our serious fiscal issues. Instead, we are \ndebating at the margins. You will see it play out on the floor of the \nSenate this week. We are locked in a fierce partisan debate about less \nthan 1 percent of Federal outlays, actual federal spending, for this \nfiscal year. And we are not even addressing the biggest and fastest \ngrowing part of the budget, which is the important, but, unsustainable, \nentitlement programs.\n  In fact, as American families have tightened their belts over the \npast couple of years and businesses have had to do more with less, the \nFederal Government has taken the opposite path, spending more, growing \nbigger, and becoming more involved in our private economy and our \nlives.\n  Over the past 2 years, Paul Williams at that trucking company in \nWooster I told you about had to cut expenses to stay afloat. They had \nto sell some of their trucks and let folks go. Here in Washington \nduring that same time, the U.S. Government, though going deeper into \ndebt, borrowing more money, brought on more government employees, and \ngrew in size. During these same 2 years, Washington spent 27 percent \nmore in its so-called domestic discretionary spending that is being \ndebated this week. And that does not count the stimulus bill and other \none-time spending, which gave us staggering 80 percent increase in this \ntype of spending in 2 short years.\n  This historic failure to control spending, directly affects all of us \nbecause it affects our economy and the ability to create jobs. It \npushes up interest rates, affecting car loans, mortgages, and student \nloans, and crowds out private investment, and leaves us with three bad \nchoices, far higher taxes, even more borrowing, or both.\n  This will surprise no one, but recently, a group of 47 respected \nbusiness economists agreed that the greatest threat to our economy was \nour debt and deficits.\n  Restoring fiscal restraint is critical to creating the certainty that \nemployers and entrepreneurs need to create jobs across Ohio and our \ncountry. It is truly dangerous because left unchecked, these mounting \ndebts are likely to lead to the kind of debt crisis we have seen in \nGreece and other countries.\n  The government spending more than it takes in hurts our economy today \nand mortgages the future for our children and grandchildren. Think \nabout this: every child born in America today automatically, through no \nfault of their own, inherits $45,000 in U.S. debt.\n  People are looking for a better way. People are looking for \nleadership from Washington that takes on those challenges that Ohio's \nbusinesses and workers face. The status quo is not working. There is an \nurgency about this that the American people get, even while many in \nWashington seem to be in denial. We must rise to the challenge and work \ntogether across party lines to meet our economic and fiscal problems \nhead-on by aggressively putting in place pro-growth measures and \nspending restraint, and we must do it now.\n  We must think and act differently to compete and win in the global \neconomy, regain America's place in the world and give working families \nthe hope of a better tomorrow. We can no longer rest on our laurels, no \nlonger afford the luxury of living with a substandard education system \nthat does not produce young people with the 21st century skills they \nneed to succeed. We cannot afford a bureaucratic regulatory regime and \na hopelessly complicated Tax Code that favors social engineering over \nsound business decisions. We can no longer sit back while our \ndependence on imported oil charts our destiny rather than American \ntechnology and innovation.\n  And we cannot compete and win if our health care system is so \ninefficient that its costs are double the rest of the developed world \nwhile outcomes are unsatisfactory, especially for those millions of \nAmerican families without coverage. This is wrong for the small \nbusinesses at the roundtable I talked about earlier who are trying to \nprovide health care and yet stay afloat. And it is wrong for working \nfamilies whose rising costs are eating away at their opportunity to \nmove up the ladder.\n  To revive the American economic miracle, we need to revolutionize the \nway we think about all the major institutions of our economy. We need \nstructural reform of our regulatory system, energy policy, tax code, \nworker retraining and education, health care delivery, our trade policy \nand legal system. And of course, we must fix our broken budgeting \nprocess that has us so deeply in debt.\n  These challenges are not insurmountable. I know because we are \nAmericans and we have done this before. We waged a World War that \nrequired more resources and sacrifices than anything we face today, and \nwe have come out stronger. We survived a Civil War, a Great Depression, \nand a Cold War to emerge as the beacon of hope and opportunity for the \nrest of the world.\n  There is a long line of distinguished Senators from Ohio who were \npart of these historic times, including Warren G. Harding and William \nHenry Harrison.\n  One famous predecessor is John Glenn, an American hero who, along \nwith his wife, Annie, I have been honored to know and work with over \nthe years. And immediately follow Senator George Voinovich--one of the \nvery finest public servants our State has ever known. Jane and I are \ngrateful to George and Janet for their support and friendship, and for \nthe extraordinary legacy they leave.\n  And there is another former Ohio Senator whose desk I requested and \nspeak from today: Robert A. Taft, a fellow Cincinnatian, who actually \nworked at the same law firm where I was a partner before being elected \nto Congress. Like me, he also served in the executive branch. Unlike \nme, he was first in his class in high school, college and law school \nand was said to have had ``the best mind in Washington.'' Democrats \njoked that ``he had the best mind in Washington until he made it up.'' \nHe was a principled and effective Republican leader. In fact, when his \npeers commissioned a review of the top five U.S. Senators in history, \nhe was selected to be among them. That is why he is one of only five \nSenators to have a portrait in the President's Room off the Senate \nfloor. He was a featured ``Profile in Courage'' in John Kennedy's book; \non his memorial across Constitution Avenue it is written that it \n``stands as a tribute to the honesty, indomitable courage and high \nprinciples of free governments symbolized by his life.''\n  It is always dangerous to predict how a former Senator would react to \ntoday's predicaments. But I am confident that were Robert A. Taft among \nus today, he would rise in full-throated\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\nsupport of addressing the twin challenges we have talked about today. \nHis honesty would force him to admit that our economic systems are not \nup to the global competition of the 21st century, his courage would \nforce him to insist we address our budget woes, including entitlements, \nand his love of liberty would compel him to fight for solutions to our \neconomic challenges that promote free markets and the power and dignity \nof the individual over the heavy hand of government.\n  As we have discussed, there is a lot of hard work to do. In my role, \nI hope to be worthy of this great and temporary privilege. I will rely \non my faith, my family, and the good people of Ohio. I will work \nconstructively with my colleagues to achieve results, including working \nwith the senior Senator from Ohio, Sherrod Brown, and others across the \naisle. I will work every day to try to earn the confidence and trust \nthe people of Ohio have placed in me. As we go forward together, may \nGod bless Ohio and this great Nation and help guide us in our shared \ncommitment to a better future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Ohio, I have \nlistened with great interest to his first speech in the Senate. I was \nparticularly interested in his reference to Robert A. Taft, whose \nportrait is in the Republican leader's office and has been there for \nsome time. In fact, the place that is currently the office of the \nRepublican leader became the office of the Republican leader about the \ntime Senator Taft, in that all-too-brief period, was majority leader. \nHe was actually only in that position for about 8 months before he \npassed away, but he left an incredible impression in this town, which \nthe junior Senator from Ohio pointed out.\n  Listening to the new Senator from Ohio, he is entirely able to fill \nthe shoes of those who have come before representing the great State of \nOhio in the Senate. He made reference to some of them. I predict by the \ntime the Senator from Ohio leaves this body, he will be widely referred \nto in the same category.\n  I thank him for his important first contribution in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I join the Republican leader in \ncongratulating Senator Portman on his first speech on the Senate floor. \nI remember those days some 4 years ago when I had the honor of doing \nthat. I know how close Rob and Jane are and their children. I have seen \nthem often over the last year, and I know the sacrifice and difficulty \nof leaving home, as he points out. I know he feels that way about his \nfamily. I look forward to this relationship. I look forward to what we \nhave been working to do, especially on manufacturing, on jobs. Senator \nPortman has visited some 80 manufacturing plants in the last 3 years. \nHe sees what I see on the shop floors. If we keep these jobs in the \nUnited States--much of the innovation is done on the shop floor--we \nwill continue to lead the world in innovation and continue to lead the \nworld in job creation. That is the importance of working with small- \nand medium-size and large manufacturing companies.\n  I also would add that Senator Portman already understands Ohio is the \nhome of two major Federal installations, NASA Glenn in Cleveland and, \nin the part of the State I live in, Wright Patterson Air Force Base \nnear Dayton. In the part of the State Senator Portman lives in, there \nis the Battelle Memorial Institute, in Columbus, which, while not a \nFederal agency per se, serves much of the Federal Government by running \nthe country's energy labs. There is synergism among those three, \ncoupled with Ohio State and Case Western. I met today with President \nWilliams of the University of Cincinnati, Senator Portman's hometown. \nThe kind of synergism that comes out of this and innovation and high-\nend manufacturing and all the kinds of things that he and Senator \nPortman and I will do together in job creation, whether it is USEC in \nsouthern Ohio or the solar industry in Toledo or the auto industry in \nthe north or the aerospace industry in the southwest and throughout the \nState, this kind of work will absolutely matter to put people back to \nwork and create the kinds of good-paying industrial jobs and good-\npaying other jobs Ohioans aspire to, to create a strong, vibrant middle \nclass.\n  I congratulate Senator Portman.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to thank all of my colleagues for \nreally helping us to focus on this debate yesterday and today. We \nstarted discussing the reauthorization of the SBIR and STTR Programs \nwithin the Small Business Administration. Senator Snowe has been on the \nfloor most of the day yesterday and part of the day today as we have \nmanaged this bill.\n  As I have said many times, this particular program is the Federal \nGovernment's largest research program for small business. It was \nstarted in 1982 by a bipartisan group of Senators and House Members who \nbelieved small businesses in America had something to contribute in the \ntechnological and scientific advances in this country, and they were \nright. They said the Federal Government spends billions of dollars \nevery year on research and development, and yet some of our most \npromising small businesses--maybe independent scientists or researchers \nor engineers or inventors of all different backgrounds and \npersuasions--could not really get in the front door of the Department \nof Defense or NIH. In those days, people only wanted to see people from \nbig companies.\n  Well, not only was that not allowing small business an opportunity, \nbut it was shortchanging the taxpayers because what taxpayers want is \nthe best technology. It does not matter to them whether it comes from a \nsmall shop down the street operating on the second floor above a \ndoughnut shop--like my father got started many years ago--or whether it \ncomes from the back office of IBM. They just want the best, and they \ndeserve it. This program delivers it. So this is about innovation and \njobs.\n  One thing I want to stress again: Several people have come down to \nthe floor and said, why aren't we--I guess meaning Democrats--focused \nlike a laser on closing the budget gap?\n  Let me say that this is an effort to close the budget gap and to \nreduce the debt and to close the annual deficit because that can be \ndone by cutting discretionary spending, cutting defense spending, where \nit is wasteful and not effective, raising revenues where it is \nappropriate--particularly for those making over $1 million a year would \nbe a good place to start--and most importantly or equally important to \nall of the above is creating an atmosphere so the private sector can \nget about the business of creating jobs. That is what this program \ndoes. That is why Senator Snowe and I are on the floor. That is why our \ncommittee voted this bill out 18 to 1. We know it is important. \nInnovation creates jobs.\n  I want to show you just three examples, as we are waiting for \nSenators to come to the floor to talk about their amendments. I want to \nshare one story. This is from Connecticut.\n  Might I say that over the 20-plus years of this program, there have \nbeen small businesses in every State that have benefited either through \ngrants or through contracts. The Department of Defense has about $1 \nbillion of their research and development set aside for this purpose. \nOther departments call them grants. The Department of Defense actually \nenters into contracts with small businesses.\n  I am not sure if this example came out of the Department of Defense. \nIt is not noted on the chart. But one of our agencies thought it might \nbe important to create a device to safely transport toxic chemicals.\n  I am from Louisiana. We have a tremendous and are proud of our \nindustrial base in petrochemicals. Some things we produce are really \nsafe. Some things we produce are quite dangerous but necessary to \nundergird our economy. So the transport of these toxic\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\nchemicals--to do it safely--is important.\n  So one of the agencies--and I do not have exactly which one--\nidentified a company in Connecticut that might be able to come up with \nsome such device. They did. That particular company, which is now ATMI, \npaid more than 10 times in taxes now that that invention has been \ncommercialized, as we can see here on this chart. But what people \nreally need to know is that this company paid more than 10 times in \ntaxes than what they received from the program. This is just one \nexample.\n  ATMI went from 40 employees to employing 800 people worldwide. I am \nhoping their company is still located in Danbury, CT, and I am hoping \nmost of these 800 people are working in America. There is no \nrequirement in this particular program for that to occur, and we would \nnot want to have that requirement because we are producing technology \nand innovation for America and for the world, and our people will \nbenefit from it. But let's hope that is the case. That is just one \nexample.\n  A second example comes from Ann Arbor, MI. Senator Stabenow was on \nthe floor earlier today, and I thank her so very much. She was a very \nstrong supporter of our very important small business jobs and \ninnovation bill in the last Congress. I am pleased the leadership has \ngiven our committee an opportunity to be on the floor with another \nimportant bill so early in this Congress.\n  I think Leader Reid knows and feels strongly--as strongly as I do--\nthat there are more ways to cut a deficit than the one being trumpeted \non the other side of this Capitol, and it is not even a way because it \nwill not work. All we hear from the other Chamber is cut discretionary \nspending and you will get there. A, we will not get there, and B, we \nare going to shoot off both feet in the process of trying to go down \nthat road because it is a road to a dead end.\n  You cannot get to where we want to go the way some people are \narguing. We can get to reducing our deficit, eliminating our debt, by \ndoing all four of the things I mentioned, and one of them is creating \njobs and doing it in the private sector.\n  This is a Cybernet ammo sorter, as shown on this chart. This did come \nfrom the Defense Department. When people ask, how can you save millions \nof dollars, well, this particular invention has saved the government \nhundreds of millions of dollars in defense costs over 5 years. It \nstarted in Michigan. Now it is expanding to Florida. That will make \nSenator Nelson very happy. It was initially implemented at one of our \ncamps in Kuwait. It was in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. It is \nnow also in use at Fort Irwin, the National Training Center in the \nMojave Desert, where troops train before deployment. It sorts \nammunition in a way that saves our troops many manhours and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  So there is another way to cut spending besides just slashing and \nburning some of the best programs in the world, literally. Some of the \nbest programs in the world have been left on the chopping block--not \njust in America, in the world, have been left on the chopping block--on \nthe House of Representatives floor.\n  I might suggest that they think outside the box and they think of \nother ways to reduce spending, which is investing in smart investments \nthat streamline operations, that create efficiencies and save taxpayers \nmoney and create jobs at the same time; thus, companies can pay in more \ntaxes at the local, State, and Federal levels, and we continue to get \nspending under control and reduce our deficit.\n  So that is Cybernet's Automated Tactical Ammunition Classification \nSystem. Leave it to the Department of Defense to make up such a name.\n  As shown on this chart, this is Beacon Interactive Systems' TurboWork \nout of Cambridge, MA. This company created technology to help sailors \nkeep the fleet safe through streamlined and uniformed maintenance. It \nwill be going now into all 250 ships in the Navy, and 460,000 sailors \nwill use this technology developed out of the SBIR Program every day to \nprotect and preserve our warships. In its first full year of \nimplementation, the software should give a 300-percent return on the \ninitial SBIR investment.\n\n  The Presiding Officer knows this because he has been a very strong \nadvocate nationally--not just in the State of Oregon--for small \nbusiness. The Presiding Officer knows that with a little investment at \nthe right time, there can be a tremendous upside, and that is what we \nare seeing here with this program.\n  Our initial grants are only $150,000. People might say, geez, what \ncan you do with $150,000? Well, $150,000 given to the scientist or the \nengineer or the inventor at the right time can help provide that half-\nyear or year of research and development necessary to grow and to \nmobilize the technologies to develop it into something that could work. \nThen phase II comes in with the potential: If it looks inviting and \nexciting and interesting to the agency, they might award such a grantee \nanother $150,000 for phase II, and then it can go up to $1.5 million. \nThat is the way these companies or these ideas grow.\n  At some point, this program ceases to be necessary because what \nhappens is it either becomes clear to the people managing it that this \nidea has failed, the technology is not going to work and the grant is \nsimply shut down or the contract comes to end, then, yes, that money \nwill be lost. But what often happens, although not in every case, is \nthat technology goes to such a phase that it becomes so promising that \nventure capitalists step in, as they should, and other investors step \nin and take that company way up. That is what happened to Qualcomm. \nTwenty years ago nobody ever heard of them. They got a small grant from \nthis program and they were one of the winners. We were winners too, not \njust the company, because now they employ 17,800 people operating in \nmore than 30 countries worldwide. They paid in taxes in 1 year half of \nthe cost of this entire program.\n  As the doctor who researched this program said to us in our hearing--\nwe have five new members of our committee from the Republican side and \nSenator Snowe and I wanted to give them a chance to understand this \nbill. I am proud to say all but one supported it coming out of \ncommittee when they understood--of course, some of them had served in \nthe House before and were familiar with this. But when they understood \nthat this has been one of the most successful programs, and when it was \nreviewed by--I think it was Dr. Wessner who gave us a review of the \nprogram, he said, Let me tell you, Senator: If every single grant \nproduces a company, you are running the wrong kind of program. Because \nthis is a high-risk effort, but it is a risk that over time has paid \noff tremendously to the taxpayer and will continue if it continues to \nrun in that fashion.\n  We have tightened up fraud and abuse statutes in this bill. We have \nput in more oversight, which Senator Snowe and I thought was important, \nnot to heavily burden the program but to make sure the people in our \nDepartments, whether it is in Defense or NIH or the NASA program, are \nutilizing this program to the extent and with the spirit Congress \nintends. So we have made some adjustments, some perfections through \nsome adjustments and modifications, and we think we have made this \nprogram hopefully even stronger.\n  Not every grant that is given will result in jobs, and it will be \nfolded. But when it works, it works, and we are so benefited as a \nnation. In fact, there was also testimony given before our committee \nthat countries all over the world are trying to model some of their \nprograms after this one. They keep asking: How is it in America you \nhave such an innovative spirit? How is it you start so many small \nbusinesses, and many of them--not all--succeed? What is it?\n  It is a number of things. It is our own nature and spirit. It is also \nbecause people have traditionally had a variety of accesses to capital, \nwhether it is equity in their homes or a savings account or a banking \nsystem that is for the most part very honest and transparent. We have \nhad some difficulties in the past few years with some of the antics on \nWall Street that caused people to catch their breath. Generally, \ncompared to many other countries in the world, our people have access \nto those things--private property they own. In many countries people \ncan't even own private property. They can't even get a clear title to \nproperty, so how can they borrow against it to start a business? They \ndon't.\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\n  There are many things that go into this miracle we call the American \neconomy, and this is a big part of it. The Federal Government doesn't \ndo it all. But I am hoping, as people consider this debate, every State \nin the Union will create a similar program. Some of them already have. \nI will try to provide to all the Members here a list of what their \nindividual States have done. Because if we think about it, the large \ncities, whether it be New York or San Francisco or Detroit or Chicago--\nif every city government would think about setting aside a small \nportion of some of their research and development money to push out the \nsmall businesses that aren't obvious sometimes to Wall Street and New \nYork or they are not obvious to Pennsylvania Avenue and Washington or \nthey are not exactly located in the Silicon Valley in California, but \nthere are budding entrepreneurs and Americans with great ideas and \ngreat drive and great determination--I am hoping our government can be \nsmarter. I would like the Federal Government to be as smart as it can \npossibly be, and I am hoping our State governments will look at this \nprogram as a model and, potentially, cities.\n  I can tell my colleagues one thing I am very excited about. I haven't \ntalked with them about it specifically, but I have spoken at some \nlength to the Goldman Sachs executives, and I wish to speak for a \nminute about a program I am very impressed with. It is not something we \nare doing. It is something they are doing, but I think it is worth \nmentioning here.\n  Goldman Sachs has decided to try to create 10,000 new small \nbusinesses in America--not new small businesses. They are trying to \ngrow 10,000 small businesses in America. They have a very strategic \nplan and one I am watching very closely for a number of reasons. One, \ntheir model is scaleable and other companies could potentially do it \nand maybe we could model some kind of Federal program, if theirs is \nsuccessful.\n  Secondly, I am watching it closely because one of the cities they \nchose for their pilot is the City of New Orleans, the city I represent. \nMy brother serves as mayor there now. He is very engaged with the \nleadership there, because New Orleans has become a hotbed of \ninnovation. When I hear President Obama talking about out-competing and \nout-innovating, that is not going to happen on Pennsylvania Avenue or \nright down on the intersection of M and Wisconsin in Georgetown. It is \ngoing to happen on Canal Street and in the lower ninth ward in New \nOrleans east, in Gentilly, and places all over the world.\n  Goldman Sachs is saying, All right, Mr. Mayor, you get the city \nleadership and one of the community colleges to get the training. We \njointly choose these entrepreneurs that have promise--they are already \nestablished and they have proven they can run a business and they can \nturn a profit, but they are stagnating. They are smaller. They have the \npotential to be larger, but they are not. What is it that is causing \nthis? Maybe lack of knowledge, lack of capital. Our Delgado Community \nCollege--and I am very proud of Delgado. It is one of the finest \ncommunity colleges in the country. Delgado stepped up and said, Let us \nput them through the training. When they succeed and successfully exit \nthe training--and I believe it is a 6-month to 9-month program--at the \nother end, Goldman Sachs gives them a check for X amount of money. I am \nnot sure if it is $25,000 or $100,000 or $200,000. I will get that into \nthe Record so we can be clear. But they give them a check so they have \nthe capital and know-how and then they have the support of some of the \nnonprofits in the area to help them grow.\n  Think about that. If that is something only one company is doing, \nthink about what companies such as Chevron--and I see them \nadvertising--what they are doing to help small business. I think about \nother companies. American Express with their Plum card, if I am \ncorrect, talks about what they are doing. I am not promoting these \ncompanies, but they are examples of programs that are out there \nsupporting small business. The Federal Government can do its part as \nwell, and we have an obligation. We can't do everything, but we most \ncertainly can do our part, as many large companies around the country \nand the world are also thinking about what they can do to help grow \nsmall businesses in their area. That is just one example.\n\n  We are going to watch the success of some of these programs in the \nprivate sector, and then we will get some of their best ideas and \npotentially even strengthen our partnership. But this is a partnership \nbetween the Federal Government and private small businesses throughout \nour country.\n  Let me switch for a minute to mention a couple of the organizations \nthat are supporting this program. I don't see anyone on the floor at \nthis time to speak, so let me read into the Record again some of the \ncomments we have received from very strong organizations.\n  The Small Business Technology Council says:\n\n       Not only does this SBIR program spur technological \n     innovation and entrepreneurship, it helps create high-tech \n     jobs and does so without increasing the Federal deficit.\n\n  The National Small Business Association says:\n\n       The uncertain future of this program--\n\n  and as I said, for 6 years it has been operating on short-term \narrangements: 3 months here, 2 months there. For 6 years, nobody has \nhad any idea, either from the private sector, from some of the best \nlabs, from our agencies, whether this program would be there next week. \nThat is unconscionable. That is why Senator Snowe and I have fought so \nhard to get this program authorized.\n  I see Senator Coburn on the floor, the Senator from Oklahoma, and I \nwish to thank him, because as a result of his good compromising efforts \nwith us last Congress we will be able to authorize this program for 8 \nyears, as the Senator will know, because he has been a strong advocate \nfor good management and streamlining. Programs such as this need \ncertainty. The labs, our agencies need to know. We are looking out 2 \nyears or 3 years for this new technology, but if there is a company out \nhere we think could provide it to us, we need to know. So this 8-year \nauthorization is important. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, because \nsome programs are only authorized for 4 years or 5 years. But we feel \nbecause we have been in limbo for 6 years, it would be a good idea to \nget an 8-year authorization.\n  One more comment for 30 seconds and I will yield the floor. I wish to \nread into the Record the letters of support from a short list of \ncompanies, and as additional ones come in we will read into the Record \ntheir support:\n  The Bay Area Innovation Alliance has sent their support. The Bio \nDistrict of New Orleans, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, \nConnect of California, the National Defense Industrial Association, the \nNew England Innovation Alliance, the National Small Business \nAssociation, the National Venture Capital Association, the Small \nBusiness Association of New England--and I wish to thank Senator \nShaheen particularly for her support--Small Businesses of California, \nSmall Business Technology Council, V-Labs, Inc./American Chemical \nSociety, and the United States Chamber of Commerce, to name a few.\n  Let's keep this debate moving forward. We have had a number of \namendments today. I see Senator Coburn on the floor.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairwoman for her kind words. It is \nnecessary that we move this bill, I agree. I am thankful to Senator \nLandrieu and the ranking member for the movement on some of the \ncommitments they made to me on programs that don't work within the \nsmall business area.\n  I have multiple amendments, but in due deference to the chairwoman, I \nwill not call those up. I am going to call up two. I wish to explain \nboth of them.\n  Amendment No. 184. Everybody was excited about the GAO report that \nlooked at the first third of the Federal Government in terms of all the \nduplication. We don't know the extent of that duplication, and we are \ngoing to have to do some hard work to winnow out a lot of savings, but \nthere are a lot of savings. People don't agree with me on my estimate, \nbut nobody knows these programs better than I do. I have been studying \nthem for 6 years. There is at least $100 billion where we can\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\nsave the American taxpayers and actually do a better job through \nredesigning the programs and eliminating the bureaucracies that make \nthem less than effective.\n  So one of the things we need to do to help GAO is have the agencies \nreport to OMB and to us on a yearly basis on their programs. There are \nat least 2,100 programs that we know of in the Federal Government. When \nGAO looks at this, it is very difficult for them to ferret it all out. \nWe only have one agency that publishes a list of their programs every \nyear, and that is the Department of Education. The book is very thick, \nand it lists all their programs. That will make it much easier for GAO \nto do the next third.\n  This is a simple amendment that requires every department of the \nCabinet to fulfill to OMB, within a short period of time, all their \nprograms and also report to us. When that happens that will make GAO \nmuch more effective in how it brings to us this next group of \nduplications. So it is a straightforward amendment. I hope it can be \naccepted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 184\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 184 \nand make it pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. There is no objection. But before we do that, I ask the \nSenator a question. I actually like this amendment, No. 184. The \nSenator spoke with me about this previously. It has some merit. I thank \nthe Senator for being cooperative.\n  If he could identify his other number, I would like to suggest that \nif we can get a Democratic amendment slid in between these, we might \ncall up his two and the Democratic one.\n  Mr. COBURN. The other amendment is No. 220.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Would the Senator mind explaining that amendment, and I \nwill make sure it is cleared on our side and we will see what we can \ndo.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I understand my first amendment is up and \npending; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 184.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide a list of programs administered by every Federal \n                         department and agency)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REQUIREMENT TO IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Each fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency \n     shall--\n       (1) identify and describe every program administered by the \n     agency, including the mission, goals, purpose, budget, and \n     statutory authority of each program;\n       (2) report the list and description of programs to the \n     Office of Management and Budget, Congress, and the U.S. \n     Government Accountability Office; and\n       (3) post the list and description of programs on the \n     agency's public website.\n       (b) Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     shall prescribe regulations to implement this section.\n       (c) This section shall be implemented beginning in the \n     first full fiscal year occurring after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 220\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will discuss amendment No. 220 now. Is \nthe chairman's intention that I defer calling up that amendment right \nnow?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I may not have an objection. We are trying to get it \ncleared on our side. If the Senator will explain it, we can get back to \nhim in short order.\n  Mr. COBURN. Amendment No. 220 is about making sure we don't send good \nmoney after bad. When you go to the pump today to buy gasoline that is \nblended with ethanol, you pay, as a taxpayer, $1.78. As a taxpayer, you \npay that before you ever pay the $3.51 we are paying per gallon, \nthrough incentives, tax credits, and rebates for ethanol and blending.\n  This doesn't take away incentives on corn-based ethanol. It says that \nbecause we already have a mandate that says 15 billion gallons of \nethanol must be available and put through the system this year, no \nlonger is there a necessity to have a blender's credit to the tune of \n$6 billion a year. So what this does is two things: One, it takes away \nan incentive that is no longer needed because we have already mandated \nthe ethanol will be there. But it saves us $6 billion that we are \npaying to firms that are going to do the business whether we pay it or \nnot.\n  So it is silly to continue to spend $6 billion of American taxpayer \nmoney of which almost $3 billion of it will be borrowed money from \neither the Federal Reserve or from the Chinese to incentivize something \nthat is already mandated to happen.\n  If we look at ethanol, it is two-thirds as efficient when blended as \ngasoline. It gets poorer mileage, and there is no savings in terms of \ncarbon output or pollution. So we are incentivizing the use of a fuel \nthat goes against what most people would like to do environmentally. It \ncauses us to markedly increase the cost of food, which we are seeing in \nour country and around the world today, and we are incentivizing \nsomething that is going to happen anyway.\n  So it is a straightforward amendment. It says on the blender's tax \ncredit we are no longer going to give a credit for something on which \nwe already have a market--we are going to do without it. Some will say \nthat is a tax increase. But when we send $6 billion to a small segment \nof American industry, and it is not going to impact their sales at all, \nwhat is the purpose for having tax credits? If we use tax credits or \nexpenditures to expand the economy and it is not doing that, why would \nwe continue to do it?\n  As part of the President's deficit commission, we looked at that and \nsaid it is a no-brainer. There is no reason we would incent something \nthat is already mandated by law and has to happen. I know it is a \ncontroversial subject for a lot of my colleagues from farm States. But \nthe fact is, worldwide sophistication and food preference has markedly \nincreased. This is creating an enormous pressure in taking food stocks \nout of the human food chain and putting it into the energy chain. So we \nare not stopping that. There are still all the other credits available, \nincentives and mandates. But we are saying we should not spend $6 \nbillion of American taxpayer money that we don't have--by the way, we \ndo not have it--for something they are going to do anyway.\n  The other point I make is that we are now a net exporter of ethanol. \nA lot of people don't recognize that. Through November 2010, we \nexported 397 million gallons of ethanol. That is almost 1 billion \ngallons since 2005. Not counting the blender's credit but all the other \ncredits, we are supporting that to the tune of $1.20 a gallon.\n  Now we are subsidizing the consumption of ethanol in Europe to the \ntune of $1.20 a gallon. That makes no sense when, in fact, we have \nsignificant energy needs ourselves.\n  My hope is that we will consider this amendment and that we will vote \non it. I recognize it is going to be a close vote. My count is at 55, \nand I know we have to get 60. I want the other 45 Members of our body \nto go and explain to their constituents why we are sending $6 billion \nto something that is going to happen anyway. It is a gift. That is all \nit is. We don't have $6 billion to spend that way.\n  The other point I will make is that with the trouble we are in, we \nare not going to get out of it by cutting $200 billion at a time. We \nare going to get out of it $6 billion at a time. Senator Begich and I \nfound $1 billion in the FAA bill from earmarks that are tied up. So if \nwe do it $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion, or \n$6 billion at a time, pretty soon it will add up and we will take \npressure off our country in terms of funding our debt.\n  The ultimate course has to be to convince the world that we get it, \nthat we can't continue to borrow 40 percent of our expenditures in the \nworld financial market and expect them to continue to loan us money. It \nis very straightforward.\n  My corn farmers in Oklahoma don't like it, and I understand that. It \nis about doing the right thing for our country. Now is the time to do \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the \nSenator from Oklahoma. We have been able to\n\n[[Page S1738]]\n\nget his amendment No. 184 pending in the list of seven others, which \ngives us eight pending but not yet set for a vote. If he would allow me \nto get back to him about whether I will be able to clear that, I would \nappreciate it. Senator Snowe is not on the floor, and we need to \nconsult with her.\n  The number of the Senator's other amendment is 220. I will let him \nknow within the hour about that.\n  Senator Shaheen is here. I appreciate her letting me say--and she \nwill ask to be recognized--that she has been an outstanding member of \nour Small Business Committee. She most certainly was the job creator in \nchief in New Hampshire and has brought a tremendous amount of expertise \nto the Senate. I am very pleased to have her input on many of these \nbills that come out of our committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, for those nice words and also for her leadership. We are all \nindebted to Senator Landrieu and Ranking Member Snowe for their \nleadership of the Small Business Committee and in bringing forward this \nlegislation before us, the small business innovation research program.\n  They worked very hard in the last session of Congress to get this \nbill through the Senate, and it would have passed then except the House \nadjourned before taking it up. I am thrilled that we are getting back \nto it this early in this session.\n  I think most of us recognize that our future economic prosperity \ndepends on whether this country continues to be a leader in science and \ninnovation. We can't compete with India, China, and other Third World \ncountries for low-wage manufacturing jobs. That is not our future. \nAmerica's future is to be the global leader in science and technology. \nAmerica makes the best, most innovative products and services. That \ningenuity and excellence is our chief economic strength as a nation.\n  As a former small business owner, I understand it is the private \nsector and business, and not government, that is responsible for most \nof the job creation in this country. But I also understand that \ngovernment has a critical role to play in fostering the positive \nbusiness climate that we need in this country to remain competitive. I \nbelieve there are a few things we can do through policy to unleash the \ninnovative spirit that is so alive and well throughout this country, \nand particularly in my State of New Hampshire.\n\n  One of those policy initiatives that we can do that is essential in \nmaintaining the creative dominance that has allowed us to lead the \nworld in innovation is to enact a long-term reauthorization of the \nSmall Business Innovation Research Program or the SBIR Program.\n  SBIR is not just a typical grant program. Under the SBIR Program, a \nsmall business is able to compete for research that Federal agencies \nneed to accomplish their mission--agencies such as the Department of \nDefense. Small businesses employ about one-third of America's \nscientists and engineers and produce more patents than large businesses \nand universities. Yet small business receives only about 4 percent of \nFederal research and development dollars.\n  SBIR ensures that small business gets a tiny fraction of the existing \nFederal research dollars. Just in the last few weeks, I visited three \nNew Hampshire companies that are doing cutting edge research because of \nthe SBIR Program. Those three are Airex in Somersworth, Spire \nSemiconductor in Hudson, and Active Shock in Manchester. The research \nthey have done under the SBIR Program has allowed them to develop new \nproducts, to add customers, and hire new workers--in other words, \ncreate jobs. All three have done essential research for the Department \nof Defense.\n  Airex, for example, has developed a state-of-the-art program to \nmanufacture critical components for our Nation's strategic missiles. \nThis SBIR award positioned them perfectly to compete and win a contract \nto manufacture motors for use in military programs and to commercialize \ntheir research. They have been able to expand from a workforce of 10 \nto, currently, 25 workers since they got that SBIR award, and they are \ncontinuing to grow.\n  In Hanover, we have a company called Creare that is a poster child \nfor the economic benefit that can be reaped through the SBIR Program. \nSenator Landrieu has talked on the floor about Qualcomm in San Diego. \nWe should put Creare in Hanover, NH, in the same category as Qualcomm.\n  Creare can trace more than $670 million of revenues they have earned \nbecause of the SBIR Program, its spinoffs, and technology licensees for \nthe commercialization of its SBIR projects.\n  Many New Hampshire small businesses have successfully competed for \nSBIR funding in the 28 years since the program has been in existence. \nAll across New Hampshire, small businesses that otherwise would not be \nable to compete for Federal R funding have won competitive SBIR \ngrants that advance technology and science and create good jobs--what \nwe all want to happen right now in this economy.\n  In just the last 2 years, New Hampshire firms have won 80 SBIR \nawards, and, in fact, despite its small size, New Hampshire is ranked \n22nd in the country for the total grants awarded through the Department \nof Defense under the SBIR Program.\n  As a Senator from New Hampshire, I take particular pride in the SBIR \nProgram because it was New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman who, back in \n1982, sponsored the Small Business Innovation Development Act which \nestablished the SBIR Program.\n  SBIR has a proven track record and its cost, as Chair Landrieu has \nsaid so often on the floor, is minimal. CBO estimates that implementing \nthis bill would cost only $150 million over the next 5 years, and most \nof that minimal cost would have zero impact on the budget. That is \nbecause what this bill does is establish a 3-year pilot program that \nauthorizes participating agencies to use the same dollars they set \naside anyway for SBIR research to pay for administrative costs. That \nmeans we will not be using general operating funds to pay for \nadministrative costs, and this bill imposes no mandates on business and \nimposes no costs on State and local governments.\n  We need to address the long-term deficit and debt in this country. \nOur colleague from Oklahoma just spoke very eloquently to the need to \ndo that and what it is going to take. We all know that. But the best \nway we can start dealing with the debt and deficit is through more \nrobust economic growth. Objecting to the SBIR Program, as some have \ndone, on the grounds that we should be focusing on the deficit alone \nmakes no sense at all because the jobs created by the SBIR Program will \nlower the deficit.\n  Just like stopgap budgeting is bad for business, so are stopgap \nextensions of the SBIR Program. Unfortunately, SBIR has been operating \nunder short-term extensions--10 of them--since 2008. Short-term \nextensions are a problem because, as I hear and I know we all hear \nregularly from businesses--they need certainty in planning. This bill \nreauthorizes the SBIR Program for 8 years. It is a reasonable period of \ntime, and it will allow small businesses and Federal agencies to \neffectively plan their research.\n  I know we have heard from some quarters and it has become fashionable \non the part of some people to say that this country's best days are \nbehind us. But I do not believe that for one moment. As I have traveled \naround New Hampshire, I see cutting-edge innovators who are creating \njobs. We in the Senate know what needs to be done. We just need the \nwill to do it.\n  I urge all our colleagues to join Senator Landrieu, Ranking Member \nSnowe, and the Small Business Committee in voting to reauthorize and \nstrengthen the SBIR Program.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Frank Buckles\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we are waiting 10 or 15 minutes for \nSenators to come to the floor to speak\n\n[[Page S1739]]\n\nabout the bill. Senator Snowe, myself, and others have fairly described \nit for hours today and yesterday. I thought I would take a minute to \npay honor to a gentleman, the last U.S. veteran of World War I, who was \nlaid to rest in Arlington Cemetery just yesterday and to put into the \nCongressional Record an article. I would like to read as much of it as \nI am able before the other Members come because it struck me as \nsomething important. It is a beautifully written article in the Post \nthis morning. I hope many people got to see it. I am hoping many of our \nMembers are able to read it. I learned some things I had actually no \nidea about, which will become apparent as I read this short article. It \nwas beautifully written by Paul Duggan.\n  I thought I would take a minute to read it into the Record. This is \nthe last U.S. veteran of World War I so, of course, it was not just any \nordinary funeral--not that any funeral is ordinary. It was extremely \nspecial to our country and to the world. President Obama was in \nattendance. Vice President Joe Biden was in attendance. I would like to \nread as much of it as I can:\n\n       A lowly corporal of long ago was buried Tuesday at \n     Arlington National Cemetery, ushered to his grave with all \n     the Army's Old Guard solemn pomp.\n       Frank Woodruff Buckles lived to be 110, the last of nearly \n     5 million U.S. veterans of a dimly remembered war--a \n     generation now laid to rest.\n       In a late-day chill, after hundreds of strangers had paid \n     their respects in public viewings since the weekend, soldiers \n     carried the former doughboy's flag-draped coffin partway up a \n     knoll and set it on polished rails above his plot, a stone's \n     toss from the grave of his old supreme commander, Gen. John \n     J. ``Blackjack'' Pershing.\n       A chaplain commended his soul to God; rifle volleys \n     cracked; a bugler sounded taps below the gentle rise. With \n     flags at half-staff throughout the U.S. military and \n     government, it was a fine send-off for the country's last \n     known veteran of World War I, who died peacefully Feb. 27 in \n     his West Virginia farmhouse.\n       Yet the hallowed ritual at grave No. 34-581 was not a \n     farewell to one man alone. A reverent crowd of the powerful \n     and the ordinary--President Obama and Vice President Biden, \n     laborers and store clerks, heads bowed--came to salute \n     Buckles's deceased generation, the vanished millions soldiers \n     and sailors he came to symbolize in the end.\n       Who were they? Not the troops of ``the Greatest \n     Generation,'' so celebrated these days, but the unheralded \n     ones of 1917 and 1918, who came home to pats on the back and \n     little else in an era before the country embraced and \n     rewarded its veterans. Their 20th-century narrative, poignant \n     and meaningful, is seldom recalled.\n       ``I know my father would want me to be here,'' said Mike \n     Oliver, 73, a retiree from Alexandria, leaning on a cane near \n     the cemetery's amphitheater hours before the burial. Inside, \n     a hushed procession of visitors filed past Buckles's closed \n     coffin in the chapel.\n       ``I'm here for Mr. Buckles, and I'm here for what he \n     represents,'' Oliver said. On his left lapel, he wore a tiny \n     gold pin, the insignia of his long-dead father's infantry \n     division in World War I, the Army's 80th. ``I'm here to say \n     goodbye to my dad,'' he said.\n       Buckles, who fibbed his way into the Army at 16, was a \n     rear-echelon ambulance driver in war-ravaged France, miles \n     behind the battlefront. More than 116,000 Americans died, \n     about half in the fighting, most of the rest from illnesses, \n     in the nation's 19-month long engagement in a conflict that \n     scorched Europe for four years.\n       Now the veterans who survived are all gone. What's left is \n     remembrance--the collective story of 4.7 million lives, an \n     obituary for a generation.\n       Arriving stateside in 1918 and 1919, many of them, scarred \n     in mind and limb, they were met by postwar recession and \n     joblessness.\n       A lot of veterans thought that they were owed a boost, that \n     they ought to be compensated for the good civilian wages they \n     had missed. But--\n\n  Unfortunately, my words--\n\n     lawmakers, year after year, said no.\n       ``Oh, the YMCA did give me a one-month free membership,'' \n     Buckles recalled when he was a very old fellow. Except for \n     the $60 most veterans got from the government when they \n     mustered out, the YMCA gift was ``the only consideration I \n     ever saw given to a soldier after the war,'' the last \n     doughboy said.\n       What he and other veterans finally received, in 1924, were \n     bonus certificates redeemable for cash in 1945. And Congress \n     had to override a veto to secure even that.\n       With the 1920s roaring by then, the young veterans tucked \n     away their certificates and went about their lives. Buckles \n     became a purser on merchant ships, traveling the globe.\n       Then the Depression hit, and their generation's legacy took \n     on another aspect, one of activism that helped propel a \n     reshaping of the nation's social landscape.\n       Thousands of ruined veterans were left with nothing of \n     value but the promise of eventual bonuses. In 1932, while \n     Buckles was at sea, a ragtag army of ex-servicemen descended \n     on Washington with their wives and kids to lobby for early \n     redemption of the certificates, and a disaster ensued that \n     would long reverberate.\n\n  This is the part I had no idea about, and I think it is important to \nrecall it, to remember it:\n\n       Living for weeks in a sprawling shantytown on mud flats in \n     the Anacostia and in tents and hovels near the U.S. Capitol, \n     the dirt poor ``Bonus Army,'' numbering more than 20,000, \n     defied orders to disperse. So the White House unleashed the \n     military.\n       Infantrymen, saber-wielding cavalry troops and a half-dozen \n     tanks swept along the avenues below the Capitol, routing the \n     veterans and their families in a melee of blood and tear gas. \n     Then soldiers cleared out the Anacostia shacks and set them \n     ablaze.\n       Two veterans died, and hundreds were injured. Four years \n     later, after a Florida hurricane killed 259 destitute \n     veterans at a makeshift federal work camp, political support \n     finally tipped for the bonuses, and the generation that \n     fought World War I finally got a substantial benefit.\n       ``I think mine was $800,'' Buckles said of his bonus, equal \n     of $12,000 today. He said he gave it to his father, an \n     Oklahoma Dust Bowl farmer barely hanging on.\n       The Bonus Army debacle weighed on Congress and the \n     Roosevelt administration during World War II. With 16 million \n     Americans in uniform--more than three times the World War I \n     total--policymakers feared massive unrest if the new veterans \n     got the same shabby treatment that Buckles' generation had \n     received.\n       The result, in 1944, was the GI Bill, widely viewed as the \n     most far-reaching social program in U.S. history.\n\n  I underscore that to say widely viewed as the most far-reaching \nsocial program in world history.\n\n       It made college and homeownership possible for the great \n     wave of returning World War II veterans, when such \n     opportunities were considered luxuries, and spurred a vast, \n     decades-long expansion of America's middle class.\n       Unfortunately for the veterans of Buckles's era, the bill \n     wasn't retroactive.\n       Tuesday's hours-long viewing in the amphitheater chapel was \n     a consolation. Buckles's family and members of West \n     Virginia's congressional delegation had wanted him to lie in \n     honor in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\n  They wanted him to lie in honor here, but it was not to be \npermissible.\n\n       So the people of Arlington came to say goodbye.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       A generation's end.\n       When Murial Sue Kerr met Buckles--\n\n  This was his wife--\n\n     in the 1970s, she was a secretary at the Alexandria \n     headquarters of Veterans of World War I of the USA, which had \n     a large office staff at the time, scores of chapters across \n     the country and a quarter-million members out of 750,000 \n     surviving veterans of the war.\n       ``The commander,'' Kerr calls Buckles, who got that title \n     in 2008 when the only other living member, a Florida man, \n     passed away.\n       The group was formed in 1948 after millions of World War II \n     veterans swelled the ranks of the American Legion and similar \n     organizations.\n\n  It goes on to quote Kerr:\n\n       ``The World War II guys had business loans, home loans, \n     education, all kinds of things,'' she said. ``My World War I \n     guys? Nothing. So they said, `Okay . . . we'll go start our \n     own bunch.' ''\n       Which included Buckles, who had been captured by the \n     Japanese while working in Manila at the outbreak of \n     hostilities in the Pacific. Although he spent World War II in \n     an enemy prison camp, he was a civilian, so the GI Bill \n     didn't extend to him.\n       In 1974, when Kerr was hired, most of the men were \n     retirees.\n\n  She said:\n\n       ``Every year they'd come to Washington, bus loads of them, \n     and testify before Congress,'' she recalled. They wanted \n     money for eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures. ``And a little \n     pension,'' she said. ``Good ol' H.R. 1918--it was a bill they \n     were always putting in to give them $50 a month. But, of \n     course, it never, ever passed.''\n       Just lot of memoirs now--the lobbying, the quarterly \n     magazine, the big annual conventions in Hot Springs and \n     Daytona Beach. Time ran out for all but the heartiest of the \n     Veterans of World War I of the USA, and they died fast. By \n     1993, when the office shut for good, Kerr, then in her 40s, \n     was the only staff member left.\n       And occasionally she got phone calls from some of the few \n     remaining members, whose frail voices broke her heart.\n       ``The typical sad things you'll hear from the elderly,'' \n     she said. ``I had one of my guys, he was absolutely in tears. \n     He was from Nevada, and his new nurse wouldn't cut the crust \n     off of his sandwich.''\n       They were buried with honors Tuesday as scores of somber \n     onlookers crowded the hillside, a distant generation borne to \n     the grave with the last old veteran, who was cared for \n     lovingly by his family to the end.\n       In the waning afternoon, the soldiers of the burial detail \n     strode in formation up the avenue from the grand marble \n     amphitheater to Section 34 of the cemetery, escorting the \n     horse-drawn caisson with Buckles's metal coffin, the \n     procession slow and deliberate, like the march of time.\n\n[[Page S1740]]\n\n       After the prayer and the echoes of the bugle and the rifles \n     had faded, the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. Peter W. \n     Chiarelli, knelt before Buckles's daughter, seated by the \n     grave, and handed her a tri-folded American flag. He \n     whispered words of comfort, then stood and walked away.\n       No more doughboys now.\n       So long. Rest in peace.\n\n  Madam President, I thought this was an article worth entering into \nthe Record. I am pleased I had the time today, before Senators came to \nthe floor, to actually read it into the Record so that we could pause \nto remember this week the burial of the last veteran of World War I and \nwhat an obligation we have to our veterans today and the kind of \ndetermination that we must continue to foster to honor them for the \nsacrifices they make, whether it was this generation, which we in large \nmeasure failed to do, the veterans of World War II, the veterans of \nVietnam and Korea, of course, Desert Storm, our veterans from Iraq and \nfrom Afghanistan who are currently fighting those battles. It helps us \nto remember that the important work we do here--the bills passing, \nparticularly bills that provide these kinds of fair and equitable \nbenefits--is most certainly something the Federal Government must \ncontinue to keep as one of its highest priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 229\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Madam President, I wish to thank Senator Landrieu and \nSenator Snowe for their efforts to get this bill to the floor, to \nhandle these\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n\namendments, and to show the leadership we need to try to really focus \non and emphasize small business.\n  I am convinced that if we are going to get the full economic recovery \nwe all want to see, the private sector--and especially small business--\nis going to have to drive that recovery. That brings me to the \namendment that I have filed today and that I have called up.\n  In 2007, there were roughly 25,000 veteran-owned small businesses in \nmy State. So you can do the math on that. There are probably 2 million \naround the country or more--maybe 3 million veteran-owned small \nbusinesses around the country.\n  In 2007, the SBA created the Patriot Express Pilot Loan Initiative \nfor members of the military community. That is part of the 7(a) \nprogram. My amendment would move that Patriot Express loan program from \na pilot program to a fully authorized one, and this would ensure that \nveterans and members of the military community continue to have the \nability to access capital when starting a new business or even when \noperating an existing one.\n  The Patriot Express pilot program has been a very successful program, \nissuing close to 7,000 loans valued at $560 million and increasing \nveteran participation in the SBA programs. The amendment would make the \nPatriot Express loan program available to all members of the military \ncommunity, including Active and non-Active members, veterans, spouses \nand children, widows and widowers of servicemembers. It would increase \nthe maximum loan amount from $500,000 to $1 million. It would guarantee \nrates would be 85 percent for loans of $500,000 or less and 80 percent \nfor loans over $500,000 up to $1 million. It would also reduce the fees \nimposed by the SBA for all veterans to 75 percent of the fees otherwise \napplicable under the 7(a) and express programs.\n  This is a way we can really help our men and women in uniform. And \none of the reasons I think this particular pilot program has been a \nsuccess is because obviously these folks are hard-working, they are \ndisciplined, they are well trained, and they are serious because of \nwhat they have been through for our country. But also one of the \nreasons I think this is compelling is that they have given years of \ntheir lives to military service. If they are in the Reserve or National \nGuard, these can be very disruptive years. It is hard for them to get \nanything going and in some cases hard to maintain a job over a period \nof years because they are being deployed, they are back and forth doing \nthe training and fulfilling the requirements the country has required \nof them. So it is a very disruptive time during what otherwise would be \npotentially strong earning years where they could be really building \ntheir businesses.\n  So this pilot program has been very effective and successful in \nproviding access to capital, speeding the process along for our men and \nwomen in uniform, and we want to encourage small business ownership, we \nwant to encourage that innovation, and I think this is a great way to \ndo it. Again, this is a program that has been on the books, has proven \nto be successful, and we certainly hope we can move it from a pilot \nprogram to a fully authorized program.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I really appreciate the Senator coming \nto the floor, and I thank him for his help in advancing this bill and \nsupporting many of the proposals.\n  The ranking member is not on the floor, so until we run this through \nthe other side for review, I am not sure we will be able to support it. \nBut we are looking at it now, and I thank the Senator for offering it.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we are currently, it is my \nunderstanding, on my amendment No. 183 to S. 493, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not the pending amendment at this \ntime.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment \naside for the purpose of considering amendment No. 183.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I notice we did not have any speakers \nhere so I thought I would come down. We do have a bill in consideration \nright now, in process for a vote. It is my understanding there will be \na vote on amendment No. 183 in the next perhaps hour or so, maybe in a \nfew minutes.\n  Let me give a little background on what happened on this, where we \nare today. Back in the early 1990s we had the Kyoto treaty that was up \nfor consideration. That was during the Clinton administration. The \nKyoto treaty was one we looked at and studied here in this Senate. One \nof the concerns about it was it was assuming we have catastrophic \nglobal warming that was due to manmade gases, anthropogenic gases--\nmethane. That assumption everybody thought probably was right, because \neverybody said it was--until such time as we thought what the cost \nwould be if at that time we would have ratified the Kyoto treaty and \nlived by its emissions restrictions. The cost would be somewhere \nbetween $300 and $400 billion. That actually came from the Wharton \nSchool.\n  We looked at that and thought we better look at that pretty closely. \nOver some debate we decided, if this treaty came back--which President \nClinton signed but had to come to the Senate for ratification--if it \ncame to the Senate for ratification we would not ratify any treaty that \nhad either one of two things--No. 1, would be devastating to our \neconomy and, No. 2, it would not treat developing countries the same as \ndeveloped countries.\n  As it turned out, it did both. It is one that only affected the \ndeveloped countries and, of course, with the reports we had on the \ncost, it would be very expensive. But that was back in the 1990s.\n  Starting around the year 2000 and specifically 2003, this was called \nto our attention at that time. I say to you, Madam President, I was the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee that had \njurisdiction. We looked at this and evaluated the science that was \nbehind it as well as we could. The science on which this is predicated \ncame from the United Nations. Actually, in 1988 the IPCC, the \nInternational Panel on Climate Change, was formed. This came in the \nUnited Nations and the science behind it was pretty much confined to \nrecommendations from the IPCC.\n  We started getting phone calls from well-respected scientists all \nover the country and these scientists would say to us that the IPCC is \na closed society. They would not let anyone in to offer their judgment \nunless they agreed that in fact anthropogenic gases were causing \ncatastrophic global warming.\n  These scientists started piling up until, I believe it was around \n2003, we had a couple of hundred of them. I remember standing at this \npodium and talking on the floor about all the scientists who disagreed \nwith the science of the IPCC. At that time I made a statement that \nbecame quite an irritant to a lot of people when I said: The notion \nthat we are having catastrophic global warming due to anthropogenic \ngases could be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American \npeople.\n  I remember going to one of the meetings. Every year the United \nNations throws a big party. We just had our 15th, I would add. Everyone \nremembers a year ago it was Copenhagen. This year it was Cancun. Back \nthen, in 2003, it happened to be in Milan, Italy. I was kind of \ndetested by everyone there because everyone else there was saying we \nhave to do something about this catastrophe that was about to hit us.\n  As the years went by we had bills. We had the bill in 2003, the bill \nin 2005, the bill in 2007, in 2009, the last one was the Markey-\nWaxman--Waxman-Markey bill. Each time those who were behind this, \nseeking to pass some kind of cap-and-trade bill, were fewer every time \nwe voted. The last count there were a total of 30 Members of the Senate \nwho would say they would vote for the last cap-and-trade bill.\n  The interesting thing about the bill coming up now is that they were \nunable to pass it legislatively, which is what we should be doing. We \nshould be\n\n[[Page S1742]]\n\nhandling this through legislation. We tried. We considered it and it \nwent through the process and it failed. Now they are trying to do it \nthrough regulations. It has been speculated that the cost to the \nAmerican people would be even greater if done through the Environmental \nProtection Agency than if it were done legislatively.\n  It was not long ago we had a hearing. I have a great deal of respect \nfor President Obama's Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, \nLisa Jackson. She testified before our committee live on TV, and I \nasked the question. I said if we were to pass this--it might have been \nthe Waxman-Markey bill--it doesn't matter, they are all the same. Cap-\nand-trade is cap-and-trade--it would have cost between $300 and $400 \nbillion if we ratified Kyoto and the same would be true of any of the \nfive or six cap-and-trade bills we have defeated since then.\n  But I said let's say we pass this and have it signed into law. Would \nthis reduce CO2 emissions? That is the whole idea. \nCO2 emissions were supposed to be causing all this. I was \nvery proud of her, because it took a lot of courage to give the \nresponse she did. She said in response: No, it wouldn't, because it \nwould only affect the United States of America.\n  Then I would take it one step further. What would happen if we have \ncap-and-trade--whether it is by legislation or by regulation, it \ndoesn't matter--what they are going to do is regulate everything that \nis out there in our society. As I say, the cost would be between $300 \nand $400 billion.\n  What I do, since I am not as smart as the rest of them around here, \nwhen I hear the billions and trillions of dollars, I try to see what \ndoes this cost my people in Oklahoma. I did the math, and in Oklahoma, \nif we take the total number of people who have filed tax returns, and \ndivide it into the amount of taxes this would cost, it would be about \n$3,100 per family in my State of Oklahoma.\n  What do you get if you get it? You get something even the EPA \nDirector said is not going to lower worldwide CO2 emissions, \nso you don't get anything for it.\n  The big vote coming up in a few minutes is on a bill I have \nintroduced, and we have now introduced this as an amendment to this \nsmall business bill, that would say to the EPA: You no longer have \njurisdiction--which they should not have, and I questioned that they \nhave it in the first place--over the regulation of CO2.\n  There is a lot of talk about the Clean Air Act. I was a very strong \nsupporter of the Clean Air Act. Several people who take a different \nposition from me on the vote that is coming up talk about the Clean Air \nAct and all the wonderful things it has done--and I agree. It has. So I \nfeel strongly about it. We have cleaner air now than we have had in a \nlong period of time. The thing is, it was designed to take care of six \nknown pollutants. CO2 was not one, it was not a pollutant. \nThe Court said you do not have to count it as a pollutant but if you \nwant to you can do it. So it was optional to the Environmental \nProtection Agency and to the government of our country.\n  They elected to do that. In order to do that they have to have an \nendangerment finding. An endangerment finding is something that says \nCO2 is an endangerment to public health. When the same \nadministrator, Administrator Jackson, was before our committee--and \nthis was right before Copenhagen; this would have been a year ago last \nDecember--I can remember making a statement to her, again in the same \npublic meeting: Madam Administrator, I have a feeling when I leave for \nCopenhagen tomorrow you are going to have an endangerment finding.\n\n  I could see a few smiles. I said: If that happens, it has to be based \non some science, doesn't it?\n  She said yes, it does.\n  What science do you base it on?\n  Well, primarily the IPCC.\n  Primarily--this was right before all the Climategate stuff came out, \nwhere they saw that they were falsifying science. All the things we \nfound during the mid-1990s about scientists coming in, they were \ncorrect after all and they had been cooking the science on this thing. \nSo that is another problem we have that we are faced with.\n  The way to solve the problem, and I think many of my Democratic \nfriends--many of them said they agree this should be a matter of the \nlegislature and not a matter of the EPA making these decisions. This \nmorning I quoted some of them. I have it right here.\n  Senator Baucus, a Democratic Senator, said:\n\n       I mentioned I do not want the EPA writing these \n     regulations. I think it is too much power in the hands of one \n     single agency, but rather climate change should be a matter \n     essentially left to Congress.\n\n  I agree with that and it was left to Congress. We considered five or \nsix bills on this.\n  Senator Ben Nelson, another Democrat from Nebraska, said:\n\n       Controlling the levels of carbon emissions is the job of \n     Congress. We don't need EPA looking over Congress' shoulder \n     telling us we are not moving fast enough.\n\n  I agree with him. In addition to that, we have eight other Democratic \nSenators who said essentially the same thing, so I think that is pretty \nwell understood.\n  One reason I wanted to mention this before the vote takes place, my \nwife thinks the greatest problem facing America is the price of gas at \nthe pump. My wife is not the only wife around here believing that, I \nknow. She was saying for a long period of time, what causes these \nthings? And it is very easy.\n  Even my grandkids understand supply and demand. That is taught in \nelementary schools nowadays. So supply and demand is at work here. We \nhave supply in the United States of America. We have--and I am going to \nshow you in just a minute--in fact, I will go ahead and do that now \nbecause I want everyone who votes on this to understand anyone, \nDemocrat or Republican, who votes against my amendment is voting to \nincrease dramatically the price of gas at the pumps.\n  The next time we hear someone say we have--this is something you keep \nhearing, that we have just 3 percent of the oil in this country. I \nthink that is interesting because they say 3 percent of the proven \nreserves. Well, proven reserves cannot take place until such time as \nyou drill to prove it.\n  We have Members of the majority, along with the White House, the \nmajority of the Members of the Senate have disallowed us to go out and \ndrill. So if you cannot drill--something like 83 percent of our public \nlands where we could be drilling for oil, we cannot do it because they \nwill not let us do it. So if they will not let us do it, then there \ncannot be proven reserves.\n  But they do have recoverable reserves. Our recoverable reserves right \nnow in America are 135 billion barrels. All we have to do, in order to \ndo that, is go out and take advantage of that and use these recoverable \nreserves.\n  With the CRS report that came out--the CRS is something that is \nrecognized as an impartial, bipartisan or nonpartisan study group. They \nstudy these things. They said that, as of 1 year ago, the United States \nof America--now this is very important because the United States of \nAmerica has the largest recoverable reserves in coal, gas, and oil of \nany of the nations. There they are right there. These are the reserves \nof coal--this is all three, isn't it? Fossil fuels. Yes, coal, gas, and \noil. There it is. This is the United States of America.\n  If you add this up, we have more than Saudi Arabia, China, Canada, \nand Iraq combined. That is what we have. But the problem is, \npolitically, they will not let us drill for it.\n  I know--and I regret to say this because I was just challenged, but \nit was true because I was there--21 years ago we had the Exxon Valdez. \nIt was a disaster. It took place up in Prince William Sound. Most \npeople here remember that now. It was an accident where you had a \ndeficient ship that had leaked in that beautiful, pristine water up \nthere.\n  I went up there. Quite frankly, there are a bunch of the far left who \nwere celebrating that it happened. Why would they celebrate a disaster \nsuch as that? They celebrated because they said: We are going to parlay \nthis into stopping oil production on ANWR or on the North Slopes of \nAlaska.\n  Well, that is kind of interesting that they are going to parlay that \ninto that. I said: How do you figure that? Because Prince William \nSound, the Exxon Valdez, that was a transportation accident. That hit \nsomething causing it to break.\n\n[[Page S1743]]\n\n  Then, I said: If you do away with drilling in America, that means we \nare going to have to transport it in from foreign countries, and the \nlikelihood of it happening again is far greater. Nonetheless, they \nsaid: We are going to use that.\n  I hate to say this also, but when we had our spill in the gulf not \ntoo long ago, a lot of people were saying: Aha, now we are going to \nstop all drilling, deepwater drilling in the Gulf.\n  We have tremendous reserves down there in the gulf. While the \nmoratorium was lifted, the administration has only issued one deepwater \ndrilling permit since that happened.\n  What I am saying is, we have all these reserves out there, and we can \ndo it. I am talking about gas and oil and coal. It is not just the oil \nand gas, but we have another opportunity out there.\n  We have talked about oil. We have talked about gas. In oil, if we \nwould just export our own resources, that is what we know is there, the \nreserves that we have in oil and in gas, it would run this country, in \noil and gas, for 90 years. That is our own stuff. That is not from \nSaudi Arabia. It is not from the Middle East. It is not even from \nMexico. That is our stuff.\n  The same is true with the coal reserves. There is the United States, \n28 percent of all the coal reserves. Right now, 50 percent of the power \ngenerated in the United States is generated with coal-fired generation, \nand they are trying to do away with that. So that is a target.\n  But again, we have these tremendous reserves in the United States--\nlet's not forget--so we can run this country for 100 years on just what \nwe have, except the politicians will not let us go in and recover our \nown reserves.\n  Let's not forget about oil shale. Right now oil shale is something--\nyes, there are several pilot projects to prove the shale's commercial \nviability. The Green River Formation, located in Colorado, Wyoming, and \nUtah, contains the equivalent of 6 trillion barrels of oil. Let me say \nthat again, 6 trillion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy \nestimates that of the 6 trillion, approximately 1.38 trillion barrels \nare potentially recoverable. That is the equivalent of more than five \ntimes the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia.\n  When I made this statement about having all these reserves, more than \nany other country, I was not counting shale because that is not quite \nhere yet--almost but not quite. Another domestic energy source that \ncould lessen our dependence is methane hydrates. I think everybody \nknows that. But I did not count that either.\n  So all these things that we could have counted are not there. But the \npoint is this: We have enough reserves to take care of all the problems \nwe have in this country for the years to come. I look at--some people \nwill come in, and they are well-meaning people, they will say: Well, we \nhave to go to green energy. I am for green energy.\n  But if you have something that is under development, and it might be \n1 year, it might be 20 years or 30 years before it comes, you have to \ncontinue to run this machine called America in the meantime. What do we \nknow works and what is available? It is oil, gas, and coal.\n  Just for a minute, I am going to deviate over there to what has \nhappened in Japan. We just came from a hearing. I am very proud that \nnot just our administration, the President and the Secretary of Energy, \nbut also the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that should not \naffect what we are doing right now. We currently have 12 applications \npending. Two of them are pending for almost immediate consideration for \nnuclear reactors, so that we will get into nuclear. Right now, we only \ndevelop about 20 percent of our energy from nuclear. France, for \nexample, does 80 percent. So that is something that is out there.\n  I would say, in my opinion, as one Member of the Senate, in order to \nstop, not reduce but stop, our dependance upon the Middle East \naltogether, all we have to do is keep working on all of the above. I \nwant wind, I want solar, and all that. But I also want those things \nthat are developed and available today--coal, gas, and oil.\n  You may wonder what I am getting around to with these charts. It is \nthe fact that we have a--everyone admits that the goal of this \nadministration--I am looking for it right now--is to get prices so \nhigh, oil and gas so high that we will have to be dependent upon other \nthings.\n  President Obama said, not long ago: Under this cap and trade--we are \ntalking about it could either be legislative or it could be \nregulations--``electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket.'' Notice \nhe said, ``necessarily skyrocket.'' His administrator, or the Secretary \nof Energy, to give you an idea of what is behind this, the high price \nof gas at the pumps, said--now this is Steven Chu, Secretary of Energy \nfor the Obama administration. He said: ``Somehow we have to figure out \na way to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.''\n  Let me repeat that. ``Somehow we have to figure out a way to boost \nthe price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.''\n  What are the levels in Europe? The United Kingdom, $7.87 per gallon; \nItaly, $7.54; France, $7.50; Germany, $7.41. That is the motivation out \nthere to do this. I think we have many others whom we could quote from \nthe administration, but I do not want this to turn into something that \ngives the appearance that we are just criticizing the administration.\n\n  The fact is, we have to do something about developing our own \nresources. If we do that, we are going to be able to bring down the \nprice--do two things. First of all, for our national security, quit \nworrying about depending upon the Middle East for our oil. We can stop \nthat just by developing our own resources. Secondly, go right back to \nelementary supply and demand. If we can supply the oil and gas and \ncoal, then we will lower the price and lower it dramatically.\n  Everybody knows that. That is why this vote that is coming up is so \nimportant. Because the vote is not just to try to keep us from having \nbetween a $300 and $400 billion tax increase on the American people \nthat will not accomplish anything. Remember what I said the \nAdministrator of the EPA said--not only that we would stop that kind of \na tax increase but also that we can stop the rise of gas at the pump.\n  So if somebody votes against this amendment, all it does is say that \nthe--which many Democrats, all Republicans and many Democrats agree--we \nare going to find out how many--the Congress should be the one to \naddress these issues, not the Environmental Protection Agency. So that \nis what the amendment is all about. Anyone who is going to be voting \nagainst the amendment is saying we do not want to develop our own \nresources. That is one of the most serious problems we are dealing with \nright now.\n  We have other problems that have to do with the EPA right now with \nall the regulations. They have this minimum achievable technology on \nemissions, on other things such as boilers and other things that would \nend up increasing the cost to do business. Ultimately, it is the \nconsumer who pays. I actually have a quote I cannot seem to find right \nnow, since I am not using notes, that says we do have the technology to \ndo all these things. Yet we are going to allow this to happen, even \nthough it is not necessary. So we have a big vote coming up. That vote \nis: Do you think the EPA should regulate the emissions of \nCO2 in America or do you think Congress should do it?\n  If you think the EPA should do it, get ready for a tax increase, \nbecause I can assure you, the President is just waiting to sign \nsomething that will allow them to continue down the road of \noverregulating. There is a cost to regulation. I think we all know \nthat. It is one that is huge.\n  If you look at the regulations we have, I have already mentioned the \n$300 to $400 billion and how that relates to everybody in my State of \nOklahoma who files a tax return. The boiler regulation that is coming \nout right now--the same EPA--that would affect 800,000 jobs in America. \nThe utility MACT--that is something the Director of the EPA just had a \nnews conference on today. The minimum achievable reduction in utilities \nwould cost about $100 billion. The ozone and the PM would be about $90 \nbillion.\n  As I say, we would be talking about a pretty big jobs bill but only \non this. I wish to make sure everyone understands. My very good friend, \nJohn Barrasso, a Senator from Wyoming, has a bill that is going to go a \nlot further than this. I am a strong supporter\n\n[[Page S1744]]\n\nof his legislation. It will go into the--keeping the EPA from using \nCO2 to change the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the \nEndangered Species Act. That is very good. That is not what this is.\n  I heard something this morning that I want to make sure to clarify \nbecause it is important because there are all kinds of things out there \npeople are saying will happen if we pass this amendment.\n  They are saying that is going to somehow affect--in fact, they said I \nrespectfully asked the members of the committee to keep in mind that \nEPA's implementation of the Clean Air Act saves millions of American \nadults and children from debilitating and expensive illnesses that \noccur when smokestacks and tailpipes release unrestricted amounts of \npollution. Yes, I agree with that. But let's keep in mind, I was a \nstrong supporter when the Clean Air Act came out and when the \namendments came out.\n  It was designed for the six criteria pollutants at the heart of the \nClean Air Act: lead, ozone, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon \nmonoxide, and particulate matter. These are real pollutants, not \nimaginary pollutants such as CO2. But that is what was \ntargeted by the Clean Air Act.\n  Of course, it has nothing to do with anything else. So those things \nare still going to be restricted. We have had some people say--and I \nhave heard this several times today--this amendment would block the \nadministration's announced plan to follow up with the Clean Air Act \nstandards for cars and light trucks. This is not at all true. That is \nall done by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That is \nnot within the jurisdiction of the EPA. That is NHTSA, they call it.\n  It has nothing do with mileage on cars, nothing do with the whole \neffort to increase mileage.\n  EPA is contributing practically nothing to the administration's \nglobal warming car deal--about 4 percent of the joint EPA-NHTSA \nprogram's emissions reductions. Dropping EPA would, therefore, have a \nmeaningless effect on oil consumption. According to the EPA, its \ngreenhouse gas car standards would mean that ``global mean \ntemperature'' is reduced by ``0.006 to 0.0015 [Celsius] by 2100.''\n  That is not even measurable. Don't let anyone use the argument that \nthis has anything to do with CAFE standards. It doesn't affect anything \nthat is harmful for people to breathe.\n  The amendment will be coming up soon. We are going to find out who \nwants to keep us from developing our own resources. It should be a very \ninteresting vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the amendment from the Senator from \nKentucky seeks to reduce discretionary spending by $200 billion. The \nactual amendment would cut in excess of $155 billion from domestic \ndiscretionary spending programs and the balance from security-related \nprograms. While I am sure the Senator is serious in his desire to cut \nspending, I would point out to my colleagues that for the remaining 6 \nmonths of this fiscal year, with the passage of the next short-term \ncontinuing resolution, the Federal Government will have less than $200 \nbillion in fiscal year 11 funds remaining for domestic discretionary \nspending.\n  My colleagues need to be advised that the CR that has passed the \nHouse will set a ceiling on domestic discretionary funding for the \nwhole year at $400 billion. Since we are half way through the fiscal \nyear, we have already allocated approximately half of these resources. \nMoreover, during the first 6 months of the fiscal year the government \nwas funded at a higher rate, approximately $405 billion. Therefore, we \nonly have approximately $195 billion remaining for the balance of the \nyear to spend on all discretionary domestic programs. While there are \nexamples where unobligated balances remain in some agencies, in general \nit is fair to say the Senator's amendment would cut this year's \nremaining domestic spending by 80 percent.\n  The amendment stipulates that the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nthe National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting are all abolished. If this wasn't bad enough, \nthe amendment would also cut more funding from the Department of \nEducation than they have remaining for the balance of the fiscal year. \nIt would cut more than remains available for the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development and from the Office of Personnel Management.\n  Some domestic agencies would have sufficient resources to survive \nthis cut, but none without dire consequences.\n  A cut of 35 percent to the EPA would seriously curtail funding for \nsewer and drinking water infrastructure, while leaving the agency with \nlittle funding to pay its personnel for the balance of the fiscal year.\n  For the Department of the Interior, the Paul amendment would almost \ncertainly necessitate the closure of our national parks and Indian \nschools.\n  On security funding, the bill would slash the State Department's \nbudget 75 percent below last year's level, effectively eliminating \nfunding for most State Department functions worldwide with devastating \nconsequences for ongoing operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.\n  The $30 billion cut to the Department of Defense would likely delay \nor terminate procurement programs supported by the Congress as the \nDepartment uses its authority to target cuts away from readiness and \npersonnel programs toward investment programs.\n  The Energy Department's nuclear weapons program would be cut by $2.5 \nbillion. This would put the safety, security and reliability of our \nnuclear weapons at risk.\n  The only thing that many agencies would be able to do if they were \nfaced with cuts of this magnitude would be to plan their shut down \noperations.\n  Not a single Member of this Chamber can responsibly vote for this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 216\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak about an amendment I have \noffered and we will be voting on in a little while. It is amendment No. \n216, and it is a basic, very simple amendment, but it will rectify or \nremedy a problem we have in our contracting.\n  We have all kinds of businesses across the country that are part of \nthe contracting process. But often when we have prime contractors who \nwill have the opportunity to bid on Federal work, they will list \nsubcontractors in their application. In some cases those subcontractors \nhappen to be minority-owned firms and women-owned firms, known, of \ncourse, by the acronyms MBE and WBE. So the prime contractors will list \nthem to make their applications more competitive, without informing--\nthis is where the problem comes in--without informing the \nsubcontractor.\n  This amendment does two basic things, and it is an amendment all of \nabout 13 lines when we get to the heart of it. Basically, what it \nrequires in these instances is that the prime contractor notify the \nsubcontractor. That is part one. Part two is, in these instances where \nthere may be an allegation of fraud or other problems the subcontractor \nwants to report, the Administrator, in this case, will establish a \nreporting mechanism that allows that subcontractor to report fraudulent \nactivity by the contractor.\n  So two very basic elements: a notification provision, so if you are a \nfirm that is listed on paperwork a prime contractor files, you be \nnotified of that--that is No. 1--and, in addition to the notification \nof the subcontractor, that the Administrator set up a program, a method \nwhere you can report fraudulent activity by the contractor.\n  It is that simple. At a time when we are trying to create jobs and \nsupport small businesses across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and \nacross the country, I think it is a very basic change that needs to be \nmade.\n  So I commend the work Chairman Landrieu has done on this bill and her \nleadership but in particular her support for this amendment.\n\n[[Page S1745]]\n\n  I yield to Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from \nPennsylvania being so supportive and so helpful. I think this is an \namendment we can support. I am hoping to get clarification to actually \ngo to a vote on this amendment sometime in the next 20 minutes or so. \nWe do not have that cleared at this point, but we are hoping to be able \nto vote on this amendment.\n  I would like to ask the Presiding Officer, though, to read the \npending amendments just by number and name because I think we have \nseven or eight pending amendments. Could the Presiding Officer clarify \nwhat amendments are currently pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are No. 183, a \nMcConnell amendment; No. 178, a Vitter amendment; No. 161, an Inhofe \nfor Johanns amendment; No. 216, a Landrieu for Casey amendment; No. \n186, a Cornyn amendment; No. 199, a Paul amendment; No. 207, a Sanders \namendment; No. 197, a Hutchison amendment; No. 184, a Coburn amendment; \nand, finally, No. 229, a Pryor amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. That is what our records \nshow.\n  I appreciate all these Members being very patient. We have their \namendments pending. We are going to try to line up votes for them, \nhopefully, sometime either later tonight or tomorrow.\n  We also have a few other Members who have said they would like to \nhave their amendments considered. I would simply ask if they can come \ndown to the floor. Tonight would be a good time because we have had a \nvery good, open, encompassing debate on a variety of different issues. \nOf course, the underlying bill before us is the reauthorization of the \nSBIR and STTR Programs that have been operating on a very short term \nwith very ineffectual authorizations that do not allow these programs \nto have the benefit for taxpayers they deserve. So we have struggled \nnow for 6 years, three Congresses. It is time to get this done.\n  So while we have many, many amendments that have been filed, I am \nhappy to report that there are probably just a few more Members who \nwant to actually come and speak on their amendments. Some have said: We \nwill take up our amendments on a later day. Many of the Members who \nhave filed five and six amendments have said: I am only going to go \nwith one, Senator Landrieu and Senator Snowe.\n  We are very grateful for everyone's cooperation.\n  So, hopefully, we can vote on the Casey amendment tonight, and then \nhave a queue of other amendments potentially in this order or some \nrevision of this order. But all those pending will be, of course, \nprovided an opportunity for a vote. We do have some outstanding \nquestions about one of the Coburn amendments we have not cleared on \neither side.\n  So I am hoping we can have that vote tonight, and we will know \nsomething in a few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 216\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we resume \nconsideration of the Casey amendment No. 216; that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided before we proceed to a vote in relation to the \namendment; that there be no amendments in order to the Casey amendment \nprior to the vote; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that the \nvote occur at 5:25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we are waiting for Senator Casey, I \ndon't think there is any opposition to this amendment. I see the \nranking member on the floor and I am wondering if she has anything she \nwishes to add at this point.\n  I said earlier Members have been very cooperative in trying to \nminimize--still have an open debate but nevertheless minimize--the \nissues and the amendments so we can pass this important bill and get it \nover to the House and onto the President's desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair as well. I wish to speak \nto the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think it \nis a critical amendment for the contracting process. As the Chair well \nunderstands, because I know the Chair has called many meetings on \ncontracts and processes, and over the years we have attempted to \nrectify and mitigate many of the problems that have arisen during the \ncourse of a contract to make sure there is access for small business \nwithin the Federal agencies, I have heard, as I know the Chair has as \nwell, from countless small businesses who feel abused by large prime \ncontractors. During the procurement process when preparing for \ngovernment bids, oftentimes large prime contractors do not fulfill \ntheir obligations to use small businesses as outlined in the \nsubcontracting plan. They identify the small businesses in their own \nplan that they submit to the government, they win the contract, and \nthen they turn around and don't use the small businesses they have \nidentified in their bid they have submitted to the Federal Government. \nSo I wish to congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania for identifying \nan important way to make sure small businesses are not left out of this \nprocess, because they are required--once they have been identified in \nan open, large prime contractor's plan, they are required to use that \nsmall business. But, unfortunately, if a small business is not notified \nthat the large prime contractor has won that bid from the Federal \nagency, they have no way of pursuing a process by which they make sure \nthey are part of that overall bid.\n  I think it is very important that small businesses have access to the \nprocurement process, and when large contractors are including small \nbusinesses, we have to make sure they notify the small businesses about \ntheir intent to use them in the bid process, and to make sure they are \naware that they have won the contract as well. This becomes paramount \nbecause small businesses then have the opportunity to contract with \nFederal agencies because the Federal Government is the largest \npurchaser of goods and services in the world, spending more than $500 \nbillion in fiscal year 2000 alone. For small firms that are struggling \nto stay afloat and maintain their workforce, Federal contracting can be \nan instrumental part of the larger strategy for broadening their \ncustomer base in creating jobs. So it is a commonsense amendment that \nprotects small businesses from abuses during the Federal procurement \nprocess.\n  Also, I think the reporting mechanism that is created by the \nSenator's amendment will allow small businesses to report fraudulent \nactivity with respect to subcontracting plans. These small business \nprotections will benefit small contracting firms without adding an \nundue burden to the government's acquisition workforce. I think it is \nan amendment that is not only practical but critical in making sure \nsmall business has fair access and opportunities for procurement within \nthe Federal agencies, and more to curb the abuses that have occurred \nwith large prime contractors that either disguise themselves as small \nbusinesses and go through the contracting process or use small \nbusinesses in their bid but never notify the small businesses of their \nintent to use them and, therefore, small businesses have no opportunity \nto pursue the legal process, due process to make sure they can report \nthese abuses.\n  I urge support of the Casey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I already spoke earlier on the amendment--\nactually, twice today, so I won't reiterate those points. I wish to \nthank and commend the work done by Senator Landrieu and Senator Snowe \nand the way they have worked together in a bipartisan manner to move \nthis bill forward but in particular to help us pass\n\n[[Page S1746]]\n\nthis amendment. We are looking forward to the vote, and I want to thank \nthem for their help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time remains before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 45 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me use the 45 seconds to ask unanimous consent to \nbe listed as a cosponsor of the Casey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to join Senator Snowe in supporting this \namendment. We have received actually many complaints from small \nbusinesses at any number of the roundtables we have held in our \ncommittee about the old bait and switch that is going on, where their \nnames are used by large contractors to actually succeed in receiving \nthe bid or winning the bid, and then, as Senator Snowe stated, their \ncompanies are switched out and they don't even know it. This also puts \nan enforcement mechanism in place and actually mandates the SBA to come \nup with an enforcement mechanism so we can have more honesty and \ntransparency.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       National Agriculture Week\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the importance \nof agriculture and celebrate National Agriculture Week.\n  President Dwight D. Eisenhower once said:\n\n       Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and \n     you're a thousand miles away from a cornfield.\n\n  This week reminds us that it is our job to bridge the gap between \nplowing fields and crafting laws and make sure our ranchers and farmers \nhave the tools they need.\n  In my home State of Montana, agriculture is the heart and soul of our \neconomy. It is an essential part of who we are. In Montana, agriculture \nis not simply a livelihood, it is our way of life. Growing up on a \nranch outside of Helena taught me firsthand the values of hard work, \nfaith, family, and doing what is right--values I try to bring with me \nto work every day.\n  Fifty percent of Montana's economy is tied to ranching and farming, \nand one in five Montana jobs is tied in some way to agriculture. It is \nour No. 1 industry. Each year, Montana ranchers and farmers produce \nnearly $3 billion of the highest quality agricultural goods produced \nanywhere in the world.\n  As a nation, we are blessed with a safe, affordable, and abundant \nfood supply. Our farmers and ranchers in our country put food on the \ntables of families around the world, and they help create good-paying \njobs here at home. Every year, the average American farmer feeds 155 \npeople worldwide.\n\n  While agriculture stands in the spotlight this week, it is critical \nto remember the words of President Eisenhower and recognize the needs \nof our ranchers and farmers every day throughout the year.\n  Next week, I will be holding a series of listening sessions across \nMontana to discuss the next farm bill. I did that last time around and \nthey were terrific. I learned so much by having these listening \nsessions all across our State. I will be starting Monday in the eastern \npart of Montana--in towns such as Forsyth and Miles City--and over the \nnext year I will work my way across the State collecting ideas and \ninformation from Montana's farmers and ranchers to make sure the next \nfarm bill works for them.\n  I am lucky to represent so many ranchers and farmers in our State who \nhave dedicated their life to the land. It is so important, and it roots \nus in our State. It grounds us. I am proud to honor these folks today \nduring National Agriculture Week.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is proceeding \nto consider legislation to reauthorize the Small Business Innovation \nResearch Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, SBIR/\nSTTR. Our Nation's small businesses and start-ups are crucial to \nmaintaining America's position as the world leader in technology and \ninnovation. The SBIR/STTR programs improve the ability of small \nbusinesses to take part in federally funded research.\n  Last week, the Senate voted 95-5 to pass another bill to help small \nbusinesses and our economic recovery, the America Invents Act. This \nlegislation will provide our small businesses and start-ups the legal \nlandscape that they need to protect and commercialize their inventions \nto create jobs and boost our economy.\n  The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, in strongly \nendorsing the America Invents Act, wrote that ``[p]atent reform is \nneeded to clarify and simplify the system; to properly protect \nlegitimate patents; and to reduce costs in the system, including when \nit comes to litigation and the international marketplace.''\n  Similarly, Louis Foreman, an inventor and advocate for other \nindependent inventors wrote that the legislation ``will make \nindependent inventors, such as myself, more competitive in today's \nglobal marketplace.''\n  Both the council and Mr. Foreman specifically noted the importance of \ntransitioning to ``first-inventor-to-file'' and ending fee diversion at \nthe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n  The America Invents Act will benefit small businesses and start-ups \nin several specific ways. First, the legislation will make it more \ndifficult for large infringers to harass a patent owner through \nsuccessive administrative challenges of the patent or challenges that \nhave no likelihood of success. Large corporations often use these \nchallenges to avoid license fees or discourage an infringement suit. \nFor small businesses, patent owners and independent inventors, the \nexpense of countering these tactics can make enforcement of their \npatents difficult to impossible. The improvements that this legislation \nmakes to the inter partes system will limit harassment.\n  Second, the America Invents Act requires discounts for small \nbusinesses at the Patent and Trademark Office, PTO. Specifically, the \nbill mandates that the PTO provide a 50-percent reduction in fees for \nsmall business, and a 75-percent reduction in fees for businesses that \nreceive a new ``micro-entity'' designation as truly small and \nindependent inventors. Together, these provisions ensure that the PTO's \nneed to collect fees for services is not done on the backs of small \nbusinesses. Small businesses will, therefore, be able to afford patent \nprotection better than today.\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\n  Third, as part of the transition to first-inventor-to-file, the \nAmerica Invents Act eliminates costly interference proceedings as the \nmethod for determining the right to a patent between competing \ninventors in favor of a derivation proceeding. Under current law, \nbefore enactment of the American Invents Act, when more than one \napplication claiming the same invention is filed, the patent is given \nto the applicant who has the resources to prove their claim to the \ninvention. This costly proceeding is almost always won by larger \ncorporations. A derivation proceeding is far simpler and does not \nrequire meticulous notes by the inventor, which gives large \ncorporations an advantage, because the key date is the date of \napplication.\n  Finally, the legislation will improve patent quality overall. Roughly \nhalf of all patents in litigation have claims invalidated. When there \nare too many patents out there that are not able to withstand court \nscrutiny, it leads to a more difficult climate for small businesses to \nlicense their inventions and raise capital from investors. By improving \nour patent system, we can provide confidence that when a patent is \ngranted, it is of high quality, and investors can rely on that.\n  The New York Times editorialized last week that today, ``The patent \nsystem is too cumbersome, and it doesn't protect the small inventor. \nThe America Invents Act is a smart reform.'' Indeed, the legislation is \ncrucial to fulfilling the promise that we make to small businesses and \nindependent inventors that if they put in the hard work, the United \nStates is the place where a great invention will be rewarded. I thank \nthe 95 Senators who voted in favor of Senate passage of the America \nInvents Act and look forward to continuing our work with Chairman Smith \nthe House of Representatives to get the legislation to the President's \ndesk without unnecessary delay. We tried to make sure that patent \nreform in the America Invents Act helps small businesses and increases \ntheir ability to serve as an engine for economic growth and good jobs \nhere in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This week, we are considering legislation on the Senate \nfloor that affects small businesses. I want to talk about another issue \nvery important to small businesses; that is, the topic of interchange \nfees, also known as swipe fees.\n  Last week, nearly 200 small businesses came to Washington, DC, from \nIllinois and from all across America. They came to stand up in support \nof the reform of interchange fees, swipe fees, that Congress passed \nlast year. They came to stand up to the major credit card companies, \nVisa and MasterCard, and the $13 trillion banking industry that is \ndoing everything in its power to reverse this reform.\n  We all know small businesses are the key to our economy and its \nfuture. We need for them to be able to grow, to hire more workers, and \nserve their customers well. But debit card swipe fees set by Visa and \nMasterCard on behalf of their big bank allies are crushing many small \nbusinesses.\n  Back in 2009, the banks made over $16 billion per year in debit swipe \nfees, about $1.3 billion per month. Now, $16 billion may not sound like \na lot of money when you compare it to the $20.8 billion that the New \nYork State comptroller said was paid out in Wall Street bonuses to \nmajor financial institutions just last year, but it is a huge amount \nwhen it affects small business.\n  For most Americans on Main Street, $16 billion in swipe fees is quite \na lot. This money comes out of the pockets of small business owners \nacross America and out of the pockets of their customers, who pay \nhigher prices for gas and groceries as a result.\n  According to data from the Federal Reserve and the Nilson Report, \nover half of all debit interchange fees--more than $8 billion per \nyear--goes to just 10 giant banks.\n  What it boils down to is this: Some who are pushing for a delay in \nthis reform are literally offering a handout of $16 billion mainly to \nthe biggest banks in America.\n  The swipe fee system does not have transparency and has no \ncompetition. The bottom line is that the current debit card system in \nthis country is a broken market. Ask any retailer, large or small, \nhotel owner, restaurant owner, convenience store owner, gas station, \nask them what bargaining power they have when it comes to the amount \nthey are charged for the use of a debit card, and the answer is, none. \nAsk them how much is being paid in each transaction. And the answer is, \nit is secret. Now, is that how you would build an economy, with no \ncompetition and no transparency? That is exactly what is going on with \nthe duopoly of Visa and MasterCard imposing these fees on small \nbusinesses.\n  The banks and card companies are sending an army of lobbyists to \nCongress to undo the reform Congress passed last year. There are \nhundreds of bankers swarming over Capitol Hill this week. Several \nMembers who have never supported an interchange reform in the first \nplace have introduced legislation to delay that reform that we passed. \nI am sorry to say that this plays right into the banking industry's \neffort to avoid accountability.\n  I want my colleagues to know that small businesses are going to tell \ntheir side of the story too.\n  Todd McCracken is the president of the National Small Business \nAssociation. He came to Capitol Hill last week, and this is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Small businesses aren't trying to do away with credit and \n     debit cards, we just want them to play by the rules. Small \n     businesses have been at the mercy of these large banks for \n     years, and the swipe fee reforms merely inject fairness and \n     transparency into a market that has been dictated by a \n     handful of companies for years.\n\n  Hundreds of small businesses also submitted formal comments to the \nFederal Reserve in support of reform. Those comments are posted on the \nFederal Reserve's Web site. I would like to read a few of those from my \nhome State of Illinois.\n  Nolan Williamson runs a flower shop. It is called Jerry's Flower \nShoppe in Carbondale, IL. Carbondale, IL, in southern Illinois, is the \nhome of Southern Illinois University. Here is what Nolan wrote to the \nFederal Reserve:\n\n       In 1964, Jerry's Flower Shoppe opened, and for 35 years I \n     have been a partner in the business. We are located in a \n     university town, and our business depends greatly on the \n     university. Since the university budget is down and they are \n     not spending, our business is suffering.\n       We have streamlined our business as much as possible. We \n     were forced to lay off one employee for a while, then brought \n     her back at reduced pay and reduced hours. As a retail \n     business, we have no choice but to accept credit and debit \n     cards. We had to increase prices to cover the high \n     interchange card fees. Even with a price increase, these high \n     card fees are eating away our profits.\n\n  Nolan concluded by saying:\n\n       Help our struggling business and other small businesses \n     around the country. Reduce our swipe fees to 12 cents as \n     proposed.\n\n  He alludes to the fact that when the Federal Reserve took a look at \nthe actual interchange fee being charged for the use of a debit card, \nthey estimated the average to be over 40 cents per transaction, which \nis more than 1.1 percent of the value of each transaction. The actual \ncost? Less than 10 cents. So what the credit and debit\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\ncard companies are doing is imposing a fee that there is no bargaining \nover, no competition, no disclosure, and forcing retailers to pay it. \nJerry's Flower Shoppe does not have a fighting chance against Visa and \nMasterCard. They have to pay it or else. That is, of course, \ntransferred to a cost to customers and reduced profit to the owners.\n  Here is another comment from Bob Stork. He owns Stork's Catering in \nSpringfield. I know Bob. Here is what he says:\n\n       My business has been in operation for about 35 years. We \n     are just a small enterprise with five employees. The economic \n     situation has taken a toll not only on my business, but also \n     on companies all across the country. Personally, I believe \n     that swipe fees are hindering these struggling businesses \n     even further. If these fees keep rising, they will eventually \n     place such a strain on us that we may be forced to close our \n     doors. Please continue your efforts to regulate the debit \n     swipe fees.\n\n  Here is a comment from Norman Flynn. He has a business, Culligan \nWater Conditioning, in Macomb, had it for over 70 years in his family. \nHe said:\n\n       We really cannot afford to keep getting hit with \n     unnecessary fees. Please seek to get the proposed rule \n     implemented quickly so that debit swipe fees will be lowered \n     and small businesses will get some breathing room.\n\n  I hope my colleagues understand that these small businesses need \nrelief right now. They need to understand that delaying swipe fee \nreform, which a bill just introduced this week would do, would give \nVisa and MasterCard and the banks a multibillion-dollar handout and \nwould leave small businesses and consumers footing the bill.\n  We have heard a lot about the bailout of Wall Street. This is the \nhandout to Wall Street. To think that they would turn around and give \nto these companies $32 billion in handouts, most of it going to the \nlargest banks in America, by delaying this rule at the expense of small \nbusinesses and consumers all across America.\n  As the big banks and card companies make their pitch, I hope my \ncolleagues will make their choice to stand with Main Street instead of \nWall Street. I hope they choose to stand on the side of hard-working \nsmall business owners. Most Americans understand--and I sure do--that \ngood jobs are created by small businesses all over this country. We \nhave to be on their side in this struggle and not on the side of the \nbiggest banks and Wall Street.\n  I wish to respond to another argument that was raised recently \nagainst interchange reform. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase have started \nthreatening that interchange reform will force them to limit debit card \ntransactions to $100 per transaction. This threat is so hollow, I am \namazed they are saying it publicly. It is a threat that defies basic \nlogic. Remember, it does not cost a bank any more to conduct a $100 \ndebit transaction than it does a $1 transaction. In both cases, the \ncardholder must already have the money in his account. The costs to \ntransfer that money through the network's wires are the same no matter \nthe dollar amount. The only logical reason why banks such as Chase \nwould make this threat is to scare opposition to interchange reform.\n  Once reform takes effect, big banks such as Chase would be crazy to \nfollow through on this threat of imposing dollar limits on debit \ntransactions. If they did, consumers will start moving in droves to \nsmall banks which are not regulated by this bill and will not impose \nunnecessary restrictions.\n  Chase also has no business to argue that they have to limit large-\ndollar debit transactions because they are afraid about fraud. \nRemember, this is the same Chase bank that last April told all of its \ndebit card holders not to use PIN numbers even though PIN has one-sixth \nas much fraud loss as signature debit cards. Chase did this because \nVisa and MasterCard give higher interchange fees for signature debit \nthan for PIN debit. Chase is the poster child for banks that have \nbrought increased fraud risks upon themselves by not using PIN numbers.\n  I also want to respond to my colleagues who tell me they are hearing \nfrom banks and card companies that consumers might be hurt by \ninterchange reform. First of all, these banks and card companies have \nno credibility when it comes to speaking on behalf of consumers. They \nsay interchange reform will force them to raise fees on consumers, but \nthey will not even admit that they were already raising consumer fees \nto record levels before interchange change reform passed.\n  Glance back at headlines like these: November 12, 2008, Wall Street \nJournal, ``Banks Boost Customer Fees to Record Highs.'' May 28, 2009, \nUSA TODAY, ``Banks Find Ways to Boost Fees; Checking Accounts Latest \nTarget.''\n  Banks and card companies also refuse to concede that consumers \nalready bear the cost of interchange fees in the form of higher retail \nprices. That is particularly hard on the unbanked and low-income \nAmericans.\n  Instead of listening to banks and card companies about consumer \ninterests, I suggest my colleagues listen to those consumer groups in \nWashington.\n  Just this week, the Consumer Federation of America sent a letter to \nall Senators. Here is what it said:\n\n       The current interchange system is uncompetitive, non-\n     transparent, and harmful to consumers. It is simply unjust to \n     require less affluent Americans who do not participate in or \n     benefit from the payment card or banking system to pay for \n     excessive debit interchange fees that are passed through to \n     the cost of goods and services. As a result, the Consumer \n     Federation of America does not support delaying \n     implementation of the new law.\n\n  Other groups, such as U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Public \nCitizen, and the Hispanic Institute, have argued strongly that \ninterchange reform will help consumers across America, just as it has \nhelped consumers in many other countries that have undertaken reform.\n  Do you know what the interchange fee is in Canada? It is zero. The \nsame companies that are offering debit cards here in the United States \ndo not charge an interchange fee in Canada. And they have just recently \nreduced the interchange fees dramatically in Europe, much lower than \nthe United States. Same companies.\n  How can they do that? They did it because the governments of Europe \nstepped up and said: This is a ripoff. You can no longer impose, \nunilaterally, interchange fees, and we are going to regulate it.\n  They said: Please do not. We will just drop the fees dramatically.\n  And they did.\n  Look what is happening here. We have a group of Senators and \nCongressmen who are now saying: We are not only refusing to assert the \nrights of consumers, we are going to back off and let the banks and \ncard companies charge whatever they want for at least 2 more years. \nWhatever happened to our sensitivity to the people we are supposed to \nrepresent--the consumers and the small businesses? That, to me, is a \ntroubling outcome, if, in fact, those who push this legislation \ncontinue to do so.\n  We all know the game plan that Visa, MasterCard, and the $13 trillion \nbanking industry is using.\n  We have seen it before. They will try to kill interchange reform \noutright using threats and scare tactics. If they can't kill it, they \nwill try to delay it, praying that the next President and the next \nCongress will be even friendlier to the banking industry.\n  Exactly the same thing happened when Congress passed the Credit Card \nAct in 2009. The banks and card companies fell all over themselves \ntrying to raise fees before the rules went into effect. When I would go \nhome to Springfield, my wife would say to me: Guess what, here is \nanother notice from the credit card company raising the interest rate \nyou have to pay on late charges. I thought you passed credit card \nreform.\n  I said: It doesn't take effect for a few more months. They are \nrunning as fast as they can to run up the fees in the meantime.\n  That is what is happening to businesses with the interchange fees. A \nlot of people don't know it because they don't get a notice in the mail \nabout the interchange fee. That has been their game plan in the past, \nand it is their game plan again.\n  I am sick of the big banks and card companies squeezing American \nconsumers and small businesses with tricks and traps and unfair fees. I \nwill stand with the small businesses and consumers of America on this \nissue. I will fight the big banks and the big credit cards and their \nefforts to kill or delay swipe fee reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for Main Street and\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\nagainst the abusive fees and practices of Wall Street.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1749-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JAPAN TRAGEDY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my deepest \ncondolences to the people of Japan, and to reaffirm that the United \nStates stands ready to assist the country and its people in this time \nof tremendous need.\n  On Friday, March 11, the world watched in horror as a devastating \n9.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the northeastern coast of Japan, \ntriggering a devastating tsunami that sent a 30-foot high wall of water \nhurtling into coastal towns and leaving complete destruction in its \nwake.\n  As a Senator from California, which has far too often experienced the \ndevastation of earthquakes, I was horrified by the magnitude of this \nevent.\n  In a stunning development, scientists are now saying that the quake \ncaused the island of Japan to shift by 8 feet and the Earth's axis to \nmove by 4 inches.\n  In Japanese cities such as Sendai and Minami Sanriku, entire \ncommunities and countless lives vanished in an instant. In Minami \nSanriku alone, 10,000 members of a population of 17,000 remain \nunaccounted for.\n  The force of the tsunami generated by the quake was so great that \nwaves traveled across the Pacific Ocean at more than 500 miles per \nhour, slamming into Hawaii and cities along the California and Oregon \ncoasts.\n  Today, we know that an estimated 4,277 lives have been confirmed \nlost--a figure that will undoubtedly rise--and that hundreds of \nthousands have been displaced. In this time of extraordinary grief, our \nthoughts and prayers go out to those who have lost loved ones and to \nthose whose family and friends remain missing.\n  What we also know is that without Japan's strict building codes and \nwell-developed early warning systems, this terrible tragedy would have \nbeen much worse.\n  I praise the work of all the first responders who are working around \nthe clock in Japan. Tens of thousands of Japanese rescue workers have \nbeen joined by teams from around the world, including from the United \nStates and China.\n  I know that this includes a search and rescue team from Los Angeles \nCounty.\n  The team, which left for Japan on Saturday, is made up of 74 rescue \npersonnel including firefighters and paramedics as well as six teams of \nsearch dogs who are trained to look for survivors trapped in debris \nleft by the earthquake and tsunami.\n  There are also approximately 600 servicemembers from Naval Air \nStation Lemoore in California aboard the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan aircraft \ncarrier, who are assisting relief efforts off the Japanese coast.\n  Our deepest gratitude goes out to all of those who are working \ntirelessly to save lives and bring comfort to communities in need.\n  We also know that the earthquake and tsunami have caused tremendous \ndifficulty at a number of nuclear energy facilities within Japan.\n  The damage and subsequent failure of systems at these nuclear \nreactors are a clear warning that we must step up efforts to ensure \nthat every precaution is taken to safeguard all of our people from a \nsimilar nuclear disaster.\n  Special and immediate attention should be given to those nuclear \nreactors that share similar conditions as the failing reactors in \nJapan--those located near a coastline or fault line, or those with a \nsimilar design.\n  We must all reexamine our assumptions about what constitutes a \ncredible threat to those reactors and ensure we learn the lessons shown \nto us by the recent events in Japan.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has \njurisdiction over domestic nuclear regulatory activities, I will ensure \nthat our members have full briefings on all of these issues, and I will \nhold a hearing on the safety of the Nation's nuclear facilities and \nwhat lessons can be learned from the dangerous situation at the failing \nreactors in Japan. I am also calling on the NRC to conduct a \ncomprehensive investigation of these issues, with a focus on areas that \nare especially vulnerable to seismic activity like California.\n  I would also like to spend a few moments talking about the \napproximately 300,000 Japanese-Americans who call California home.\n  I am particularly proud that the Japanese American community in my \nState has quickly stepped up to assist with relief efforts in the \naftermath of this horrible tragedy. This includes the Japan America \nSociety of Southern California--a nonprofit organization founded in \n1909 to build relationships between the United States and Japan. This \nalso includes the nonprofit Japanese Cultural and Community Center of \nNorthern California. These are just a couple of examples of how \nCalifornians are pulling together to help the thousands who have been \ndevastated by the earthquake and tsunami.\n  I thank all those in California, and those across the country and the \nworld, who have responded to this tragedy with an outpouring of support \nfor the people of Japan.\n  I would also like to take just a brief moment to thank the Federal, \nState, and local officials in Hawaii, California and along the west \ncoast for their quick response in warning residents of the tsunami \nthreat and assisting those communities affected by severe waves.\n  Coastal areas in northern California, particularly Crescent City and \nSanta Cruz, were impacted by these waves, resulting in damages to port \nand harbor infrastructure. I am pleased that federal officials arrived \nin California Monday and are working with State and local officials to \nassess the situation.\n  And finally, I thank Senators Reid, McConnell, Kerry, and Lugar for \ndrafting a resolution on the tragedy which passed the Senate Monday \nevening. I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  The resolution expresses the Senate's deepest condolences to all of \nthose affected by this tragedy, including the families of the victims. \nIt also urges the U.S. Government and the international community to \nprovide any additional assistance the Japanese government may need as \nit moves toward healing, rebuilding, and recovery.\n  Experts tell us that events of this magnitude are rare--in fact, this \nwas the largest recorded earthquake in Japan's history.\n  While we hope and pray that we never see such a horrific event again, \nthis tragedy serves as a stark reminder of nature's extraordinary power \nand how precious and fragile life is.\n  Let us also use this as an opportunity to redouble our commitment \nhere in America to do the hard work of preparing for the unthinkable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1749-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1749-S1750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Corporal Loren M. Buffalo\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of one of \nAmerica's bravest killed in action in Afghanistan--CPL Loren M. \nBuffalo--a fallen hero who served our Nation in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  Corporal Buffalo, 20, of Mountain Pine, AR, was by all accounts, \ndriven by a call to serve his country and strong sense of civic duty.\n  The son of an Arkansas National Guardsman and the grandson of a World \nWar II veteran, Corporal Buffalo joined the Army in 2009, just after \ngraduating from Mountain Pine High School. His father, Cecil Buffalo, \ntold The Sentinel-Record, that he knew his son wanted to serve his \ncountry all the way back in junior high. Mr. Buffalo said his son was a \n``strong-hearted all-American boy'' who ``loved his country and wanted \nto serve it.''\n  In Mountain Pine, Corporal Buffalo is remembered as a young man who \nwould make the best out of any situation. One of his mentors said that \nCorporal Buffalo ``was 100 percent about community.'' During his \nteenage years, Corporal Buffalo undertook a number of projects honoring \nand supporting our Nation's veterans.\n  Beyond a life of service, Corporal Buffalo enjoyed making music. A \nmultitalented musician, Mr. Buffalo said his son could play the guitar, \ndrums, bass and ``just about anything you put in his hand.''\n  Corporal Buffalo was assigned to B Troop, 1st Squadron, 75th Cavalry \nRegiment, 101st Airborne Division based out of Fort Campbell, KY. \nAccording to initial reports, he died from injuries sustained when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his dismounted patrol in \nKandahar. He received multiple medals for service, including a Purple \nHeart and a Bronze Star.\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\n  Corporal Buffalo made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. I ask \nmy colleagues in the Senate to join me in honoring his life and legacy. \nI ask that we all keep his family, fellow soldiers and friends in our \nthoughts and prayers during this difficult time. He is a true American \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1750-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING POLAND SPRINGS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in these challenging economic times, it \nis a pleasure to recognize a business that is growing and creating new \njobs as it demonstrates environmental stewardship and community \ncitizenship. The Poland Spring Water Company of Maine is such a \nbusiness.\n  The pure, natural spring water found in Maine's Western Mountains has \nbeen prized by residents and travelers since the earliest days of our \nNation. In 1845, Hiram Ricker began bottling this water and a company \nwas born. By 1904, the water had gained international praise earning \nmedals of excellence at the Columbian Exposition and the World's Fair. \nThe Ricker Inn, which opened a decade later, hosted such illustrious \nguests as Presidents Cleveland and Taft.\n  Today, Poland Spring is one of the best-selling bottled spring water \nbrands in North America. Its bottling plants in three Maine communities \nprovide some 800 good-paying, skilled jobs. Its annual payroll of $40 \nmillion and $65 million in purchases of goods and services from other \nMaine companies make it a mainstay of our State's rural economy. Its \ngenerous support for schools, fire and rescue, conservation, and many \nother causes strengthen our communities.\n  Three years ago, Poland Spring opened its newest plant in the small \ntown of Kingfield with 40 workers. This year, employment stands at 70 \nand the Kingfield operation was recently named ``The Best Plant in \nNorth America'' by Poland Springs' parent company, Nestle Waters. That \nis an outstanding record of growth and accomplishment in such a short \ntime, but it doesn't surprise me to see a Maine facility achieve this \ndistinction.\n  Poland Spring does not just bottle water--it is a diligent guardian \nof Maine's precious groundwater resources. The company's extensive \nmonitoring efforts to protect water quality and the local watershed set \na standard for the industry worldwide. From its ultra-light plastic \nbottle and energy-efficient building design to its operation of the \nlargest biodiesel trucking fleet in Maine, Poland Spring's commitment \nto the environment is seen at every step of the process.\n  I congratulate the Poland Spring Water Company for more than 160 \nyears of contributions to the State of Maine and the Kingfield facility \nfor its recognition as the best in North America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1750-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KATIE HURLEY\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I recognize a great Alaskan \nas she celebrates her 90th birthday at the end of this month. Katie \nHurley was born and raised in Juneau, AK, and embodies so much of what \nmakes Alaska great. She is a living history of the State of Alaska.\n  Katie was there at the very beginning of the push for Alaska \nStatehood, serving Governor Ernest Gruening in Alaska's territorial \ndays. Katie served as chief clerk to the Alaska Constitutional \nConvention in Fairbanks during the very cold winter of 1955-1956. With \na manual typewriter and mimeograph machine, she had minutes and \namendments ready every morning for the delegates. It is Katie's voice \nyou can hear in the audio recordings of the final roll call vote of the \nConstitutional Convention.\n  Katie's public service to Alaska transcends every level of \ngovernment. Governor Bill Egan appointed Katie to the State Board of \nEducation where she served for 7 years. She served to the term limit \nunder Governor Egan but was reappointed by Governor Jay Hammond. She \nhas been elected to the Alaska State Legislature and the Matanuska \nTelephone and Matanuska Electric association boards. She embodies \ncompletely what it means to be a public servant and community member.\n  It is appropriate Katie's birthday falls during Women's History \nMonth. Katie is a role model for so many Alaskan women. She was the \nfirst woman in Alaska to win her party's nomination for statewide \noffice. Katie was the first executive director of the Alaska Commission \non the Status of Women and was appointed by Governor Steve Cowper to \nthe Human Rights Commission in 1987, serving twice as chair.\n  She is still active in the Alaska chapter of the National \nOrganization of Women. In the past, she would grab her knitting--baby \nblankets for her grandchildren--to attend legislative hearings on \nwomen's reproductive health rights. She has been a tenacious advocate \nfor title IX funding and education equity. Katie is a breast cancer \nsurvivor of 21 years and still participates in the annual Alaska Run \nfor Women to raise money for breast cancer research. Last year--at age \n89--she finished the 5-mile course with her team.\n  Anyone who knows Katie understands she is never one to slow down. Her \nenthusiasm is infectious, and she still spends time imparting Alaska's \nhistory to young Alaskans and reminding all Alaskans of the common \ngoals we shared at statehood and the spirit in which our State \nconstitution was drafted.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Katie and her decades of \nservice to Alaska on her 90th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1750-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1750-4", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1750-5", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the second time, and placed \non the calendar:\n\n       H.J.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 596. A bill to establish a grant program to benefit victims of sex \ntrafficking, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my partner, \nSenator Cornyn, to reintroduce the Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking \nDeterrence and Victims Support Act. This bi-partisan legislation, which \nwas approved unanimously by the Senate in\n\n[[Page S1753]]\n\nthe 111th Congress, just a few months ago, as S.2925, is the first \ncomprehensive approach to combating the terrible and fast-growing \ncriminal enterprise of trafficking of children for sex right here in \nthe U.S.\n  Many people don't have any idea how many children in the U.S. are \nforced into sexual slavery. It is truly a moral abomination that an \nestimated 100,000 minors are trafficked for sex in the U.S. each year. \nThe reason that this crime has reached epidemic proportions is simple: \nthe resources are not in place to help innocent victims escape from \ntrafficking, nor to punish the violent, ruthless pimps who are \ntrafficking them.\n  In talking to law enforcement officials in Oregon, I learned that \ngang members, pimps, and traffickers have figured out that trafficking \na person is a lot less risky, and just as profitable, as trafficking \ndrugs. A pimp can make $200,000 a year on one trafficking victim. And \nthey know they can exploit vulnerable minors and not get caught because \nlaw enforcement lacks the training and resources to stop this crime. \nThe Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act \naims to turn that around.\n  This bill would, for the first time, provide a comprehensive solution \nfor addressing this problem. The bill would establish a pilot project \nof six block grants in locations in different regions of the country \nwith significant sex trafficking activity. The block grants would be \nawarded by the Department of Justice to state or local government \napplicants that have developed a workable, comprehensive plan to combat \nsex trafficking. The grants would require a multi-disciplinary approach \nto addressing trafficking problems. Applicants for the grants would \nhave to demonstrate they can work together with local, State, and \nFederal law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and social service \nproviders to achieve the goals of the bill.\n  Government agencies that get the grants would be required to create \nshelters where trafficking victims would be safe from their pimps, and \nwhere they could start getting treatment for the trauma they have \nsuffered. The shelters would provide counseling, legal services, and \nmental and physical health services, including treatment for substance \nabuse, sexual abuse, and trauma-informed care. The shelters would also \nprovide food, clothing, and other necessities, as well as education and \ntraining to help victims get their lives on track.\n  The bill would also provide training for law enforcement officers. I \nworked with some of the pioneering officers out there like Doug Justus \nin Portland and Byron Fassett in Dallas who really understand this \nissue. But, unfortunately, what Doug and Byron have told me is that \nmost officers don't have the training to recognize a sex trafficking \nvictim and don't know how to handle those victims in a way that will \nallow them to feel like they can turn away from their pimp. Without \nthis training--and without shelters--there's no way to begin building \ncriminal cases against the pimps, and no way to get these victims to \ncome to court to testify in criminal trials.\n  That is why it is going to take a comprehensive plan to finally turn \nthe tables on pimps. Without trained officers and service providers, \nand available shelters, there is no support and safe place for children \nwho are being trafficked. Right now there are only between 50 and 70 \nshelter beds in the entire country for minor victims of sex \ntrafficking. That is unacceptable. This bill will change that, and \nbegin to provide hope for trafficking victims.\n  Another serious aspect of this problem that this bill would address \nis the issue of repeat runaways. Evidence shows that the children at \ngreatest risk of becoming involved in sex trafficking are kids who have \nrun away from home over and over again. Many of them are children who \nhave been in the foster care system. The problem is that there is often \nno report made when a child runs away, and thus no way to know when a \nchild is a repeat runaway and at greatest risk.\n  This bill would strengthen reporting requirements for runaway or \nmissing children, and encourage the FBI to enhance the National Crime \nInformation Center, NCIC, database, which is where missing child \nreports are filed. Doing so would give law enforcement officers better \ninformation on the children at greatest risk by flagging repeat \nrunaways.\n  Before I conclude, I want to express that this is a very personal \nissue with very personal consequences. I had a chance to feel this \npersonal heartbreak last year when I accompanied police officers along \n82nd Avenue in my hometown of Portland. I will never forget a 15-year-\nold girl working out there with the tools of the trade. She had a cell \nphone to stay in constant contact with her pimp and report how much \nmoney she had made. She had a 15-inch butcher knife because she knew \nshe needed to protect herself. She had a purse full of condoms, because \nshe knew she couldn't stop until she'd had more customers during the \ncourse of the evening.\n  The fact that there are thousands of young girls like her out on the \nstreets, all across the country, every single day, is nothing short of \na national emergency. This bill sends a clear and powerful message to \nthe victims of this abuse, that somebody cares about her health and \nwellbeing. That is why I hope Congress will act quickly to provide help \nfor young girls like the one I met by passing this bill.\n  Last year, this legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent \nand the House by voice vote. Unfortunately, the bill passed the House \nshortly before Congress adjourned, and there was no time to resolve the \nminor differences between the two chambers' bills. But I will do \neverything I can to see that this bill moves forward promptly so that \nsex trafficking victims can begin to receive the care they need and \ndeserve.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the non-profit and \nfaith-based organizations in working on this issue. There are a lot of \ndeeply committed groups and individuals working to help victims of sex \ntrafficking. Their good work has laid the foundation for our efforts \nhere in the Congress.\n  I want to acknowledge the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, the FBI's Innocence Lost Project, Polaris Project, Shared \nHope International, ECPAT-USA, Rebecca Project for Human Rights, \nSoroptimists, and the YWCA; and there are many other fine groups that \ndeserve thanks.\n  I also want to recognize the work of champions--like Ambassador Luis \nCdeBaca, filmmaker Libby Spears, and local officials like Multnomah \nCounty Commissioner Diane McKeel, who have raised awareness and made it \ntheir priority to fight this horrific crime. The effort to save \nchildren from sex trafficking would not be possible without the \ninvolvement of all of these groups and individuals.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Cornyn for his dedication and \ncooperation in combating sex trafficking. I am also indebted also to \nthe members of the Judiciary Committee who played a constructive role \nin shaping the bill; and I particularly thank Chairman Leahy, Senator \nSessions, Senator Durbin, Senator Franken, and Senator Coburn for their \ninput and work to move this legislation forward in the last Congress. \nFinally, I want to acknowledge our House partners, Representatives \nCarolyn Maloney and Chris Smith, who introduced companion legislation \nlast Congress. I look forward to working with them again to quickly \nmove this legislation forward to passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nBy Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Akaka, \n  Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Coons, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Franken, Mr. \n   Inouye, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \n Schumer, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n                                Wyden):\n\n  S. 598. A bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and ensure \nrespect for State regulation of marriage; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce today a \nbill to strike the law commonly known as DOMA, the Defense of Marriage \nAct.\n  I want to thank my cosponsors--Senators Leahy, Gillibrand, Kerry, \nBoxer, Coons, Wyden, Lautenberg, Blumenthal, Merkley, Durbin, Franken, \nSchumer, Murray, Whitehouse, Shaheen, Udall of Colorado, Inouye, and \nAkaka for working with me on this important bill.\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\n  Today, there are between tens of thousands of legally married same-\nsex couples in the United States, and more than 18,000 in my State of \nCalifornia alone.\n  These couples live their lives like all married people. They share \nfinancial expenses, they raise children together, and they care for \neach other in good times and bad, in sickness and in health, until \ndeath do they part.\n  But here is the rub. Right now, because of DOMA, these couples cannot \ntake advantage of federal protections available to every other married \ncouple in this country.\n  For example, because of DOMA, these couples cannot file joint Federal \nincome taxes and claim certain deductions; receive spousal benefits \nunder Social Security; take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical \nLeave Act when a loved one falls seriously ill; obtain the protections \nof the estate tax when one spouse passes and wants to leave his or her \npossessions to another.\n\n  This has a very real impact. Let me tell you, for example, the \nstories of a married couple in California.\n  Jeanne Rizzo and Pali Cooper of Tiburon, CA, have been in a committed \nrelationship for more than two decades. In 2008, they were married in \nCalifornia before their family and friends.\n  They have lived in the same house, shared expenses, and raised their \nson, Christopher, together. The Defense of Marriage Act, however, means \nthat they cannot enjoy the simple conveniences of filing joint tax \nreturns as a married couple or obtaining continuing health coverage \nunder COBRA.\n  They have also told me the story of re-entering the United States at \nthe end of their honeymoon in 2008. They approached a customs agent \ntogether but were told that they could not go through the line as a \nfamily. When they said that they were legally married, a customs agent \nreportedly responded with a curt phrase to the effect of: ``Not to the \nUnited States you're not.''\n  Put simply, under DOMA, the Federal government does not treat people \nequally or fairly.\n  Last year, a Federal District Court declared the law \nunconstitutional; the Obama Administration has concluded that the law \nviolates fundamental constitutional guarantees of equal protection; and \neven former President Clinton, who signed the law in 1996, now supports \nits repeal.\n  The Respect for Marriage Act would right DOMA's wrong.\n  It would strike DOMA in its entirety. It would ensure that the \nFederal protections afforded to a married couple remain stable and \npredictable no matter where a couple lives, works, or travels.\n  In my lifetime, I have seen the happiness, stability, and comfort \nthat marriage brings. When two people love each other and decide to \nenter this solemn commitment, I believe that is a very positive thing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Respect for Marriage Act to \nrepeal DOMA and call on our Federal Government to honor the legal, \nvalid marriages of all Americans.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join the senior Senator from \nCalifornia and others to introduce the Respect for Marriage Act of \n2011. This legislation would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, \nso that same-sex marriages authorized under State law will be \nrecognized by the Federal Government and protected under Federal law. \nSince the passage of DOMA, several States, including the State of \nVermont, have provided the protections of marriage to same-sex couples. \nUnfortunately, under current Federal law, these families are not \ntreated fairly. That is why today's action is needed.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I often find myself \nconfronted by those who think the issue of civil rights is merely one \nfor the history books. This is not true. There is still work to be \ndone. The march toward equality must continue until all individuals and \nall families are both protected and respected. Today, Congress will \nbegin to help bring fairness to all our Nation's families.\n  The issue of marriage is one that has long been left for the states \nto determine, and they have. Today, five States, including my home \nState of Vermont, plus the District of Columbia, have granted same-sex \ncouples the right to get married. With DOMA as law, however, we are \ncreating a tier of second-class families in States that have authorized \nsame-sex marriage. As a Vermonter who has been married for 48 years, I \nbelieve it is important that we encourage and sanction committed \nrelationships. That is the best way to provide for stable, supportive \nfamilies. Vermont has led the Nation in this regard. In 2000, Vermont \ntook a crucial step when it became the first State in the Nation to \nallow civil unions for same-sex couples. In 2009, Vermont took another \nimportant step to help sustain the relationships that fulfill our lives \nby becoming the first state to adopt same-sex marriage through the \nlegislative process. I am proud of the progressive example set by my \nconstituents, and I do not want any of them harmed by the continuing \neffect of DOMA.\n  The time has now come for the Federal Government to recognize that \nthese families deserve all of the legal protections afforded to \nopposite-sex married couples recognized under state law. The Government \nAccountability Office issued a report in 2004 that stated that same-sex \ncouples are denied more than one thousand Federal benefits. Right now, \ncouples in states that authorize same-sex marriage laws cannot file \njoint Federal tax returns and are not entitled to the same Social \nSecurity and medical leave benefits as opposite-sex married couples \nunder Federal law. This goes against American values and it must end.\n  This is a question of basic civil rights, and how the constitutional \nprinciples of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clause protect all \nof us from discrimination. The President and the Attorney General \nrecognized this when they announced that the Department of Justice will \nno longer defend two court cases that have challenged the \nconstitutionality of the DOMA. I applaud President Obama and Attorney \nGeneral Holder for making the right decision. However, the \nadministration is still enforcing DOMA elsewhere, because it is the law \nof the land. It is now time for leaders in Congress to change that law. \nThe Respect for Marriage Act of 2011 would allow same-sex couples who \nare married under state law to be eligible for Federal benefits. \nNothing in this bill would obligate any person, religious organization, \nstate, or locality to celebrate or perform a marriage between two \npersons of the same sex. Those prerogatives would remain. What would \nchange, however, and what must change, is the Federal Government's \ntreatment of State-sanctioned marriage.\n  I believe this legislation is overdue, and it is a step in the right \ndirection toward fostering equal treatment under law. I urge my fellow \nSenators to come together to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n        Blumenthal):\n  S. 601. A bill to encourage and ensure the use of safe football \nhelmets and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, football fans today are \nwondering if there will be a National Football League season this fall. \nMany fans could find that their Sundays are not the same if team owners \nand players do not reach an agreement. Business owners who depend on \nthose fans will also be affected. That is an issue that members of \nCongress have weighed in on already.\n  But today I want to discuss a more important issue for the future of \nfootball. Football is facing a concussion crisis--a brain injury \ncrisis--that affects up to 4.5 million football players who are still \ntoo young to play in the NFL but may aspire to make it to the pros some \nday.\n  This fall, those kids and young adults will put on their uniforms and \npads and take to the gridiron. It is a time-honored tradition that will \ncontinue regardless of what happens to the upcoming NFL season. For \nmany rural communities in states like New Mexico, high school football \nmeans Friday night lights excitement and civic pride in the school \nteam. This year, about 8,000 New Mexican high school players will \ncontinue this American tradition.\n  But football is a contact sport, and thousands of student athletes \nare injured every year. Many of those injuries are concussions. In \nfact, one study\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\nestimates that as many as one in five football players suffers head \ninjuries in any given football season. For young people between 15 and \n24 years old, playing sports is the second-leading cause of traumatic \nbrain injury, behind only motor vehicle crashes. Every year, there are \nup to 3.8 million sports-related concussions, many of which go \nundiagnosed and unreported.\n  Those alarming statistics highlight the need for more awareness about \nsports concussion. That is why it is appropriate to discuss this \nimportant public health and children's safety issue today, which is \n``Brain Injury Awareness Day.''\n  Retired NFL great Nick Lowery--the all time leading scorer for the \nKansas City Chiefs and one of the greatest kickers to play the game--\nexplained to me:\n\n       When I played football in high school, in college, and in \n     the National Football League, suffering a concussion was \n     often shrugged off as merely having your `bell rung.' My \n     teammates had no shortage of toughness and wanted to build \n     the mentality to `out tough' our opponents.  . . . We now \n     know that multiple concussions can lead to lasting brain \n     damage and should be treated as a serious matter. Today's NFL \n     players want to set a good example for the next generation.\n\n  There have been alarming news stories about what has happened to \nseveral retired NFL players who were famous for that toughness Lowery \ndescribed. Long after their careers ended, some of those NFL greats \nsuccumbed to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, caused by repeated \nhead trauma. Last month, retired NFL player Dave Duerson took his own \nlife with a gunshot to the chest. According to news reports, he left \ninstructions to his family that his brain be given to the NFL Brain \nBank, presumably to be examined for evidence of CTE.\n\n  Yet, what is even more alarming is that researchers have already \nfound CTE in the brain of a deceased 18-year-old high school football \nplayer with a history of concussions. Researchers do not yet know how \nearly an athlete might develop CTE.\n  TBI can also be an ``invisible'' injury. Without the kind of brain \ninjury awareness that families and health care providers are trying to \nraise today, an athlete who suffers a mild TBI may not link that injury \nto common symptoms later such as headaches, nausea, and cognitive \nchanges.\n  One of my constituents, Alexis Ball, is a bright college student and \nstar soccer player at the University of New Mexico. She told my office \nhow she struggled for months with post-concussive symptoms. Concussions \nforced her to sit out from play and miss classes. Thankfully, she's \nrecovered today and now volunteers to raise concussion awareness among \nyoung athletes in Albuquerque.\n  But there are other cases that are much more unfortunate. The parents \nof one high school student athlete from Oregon named Max Conradt wrote \nme to explain how Max, their 17-year-old son, returned to play \nquarterback too soon after suffering a concussion. Max was wearing a \n20-year-old helmet when he suffered another concussion that led to \nbrain damage. Max's parents wrote me to ask, ``How is it possible that \nour son was issued a helmet three years older than he was?''\n  Unfortunately, there are an estimated 100,000 helmets out there that \nare more than a decade old. These helmets will be worn by high school \nand younger football players this fall. Many coaches will not know that \nsome of their helmets might be older than their players. And one helmet \nsafety expert has stated that even the best new football helmets would \nneed to be four times better--in terms of attenuating direct, linear \nforces--to protect against concussion.\n  These facts drive my serious concerns about the current voluntary \nsafety standards for new and reconditioned football helmets, which have \nnot been significantly revised in three decades.\n  On this Brain Injury Awareness Day 2011, I am pleased to introduce \nbipartisan legislation, the Children's Sports Athletic Equipment Safety \nAct, to require improvements to the voluntary football helmet \nstandards, including clearly visible warning and date of manufacture \nlabels, concussion resistance, if feasible, reconditioned helmets and \nyouth helmets.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by colleagues Senator Frank \nLautenberg and Senator Blumenthal. We are joined by Representatives \nBill Pascrell and Todd Platts, who lead the Congressional TBI Task \nForce, and Representative Anthony Weiner--all of whom are original \nsponsors of the companion bill in the House of Representatives.\n  The Children's Sports Equipment Safety Act takes a ``light touch'' \napproach to improving safety. This legislation gives industry groups \ntime to put safety first and improve their voluntary helmet standards \nbefore any mandatory federal safety rules replace them. But if those \nimprovements are not made, then the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nmust issue product safety rules for football helmets to protect kids.\n  I want to emphasize that the Children's Sports Athletic Equipment \nSafety Act isn't just about football helmets. This legislation would \nalso increase the potential penalties for making false injury \nprevention claims for other types of sports and athletic gear.\n  Tackling false advertising with more severe penalties may be an \nincreasingly important tool if companies continue to sell new \nheadbands, helmets, and mouth guards with potentially deceptive and \nmisleading safety claims. Young athletes could put themselves at great \nrisk if they think a new ``anti-concussion'' football helmet, soccer \nheadband, or mouth guard makes them invulnerable to brain injury. The \ncosts of such injuries in financial terms alone are staggering. The \ndirect medical costs and indirect costs of traumatic brain injuries \ntotaled an estimated $60 billion in the United States in the year 2000. \nThat figure of course does not account for the pain and suffering of \nvictims and their families.\n  I am pleased that the Children's Sports Athletic Equipment Safety Act \nenjoys support from a broad range of organizations and individuals. \nDeMaurice Smith, the Executive Director of the NFL Players Association, \nNFLPA, states in a letter that:\n\n       Not only is the NFLPA committed to the safety of \n     professional football players, but to all who play the sport. \n     We recognize a significant portion of those players are youth \n     and high school athletes who are currently at risk for \n     traumatic brain injury due to the absence of helmet safety \n     standards. We support the Children's Sports Athletic \n     Equipment Safety Act as introduced and commend you for \n     addressing this issue.\n\n  Other supporters include: Brain Injury Association of America; Brain \nTrauma Foundation; Cleveland Clinic; Consumer Federation of America; \nConsumers Union; National Consumers League; National Research Center \nfor Women & Families; and Safe Kids USA.\n  Nick Lowery, who played 18 years as a professional football player \nand is a member of the Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Fame, notes that:\n\n       Improving sports safety for kids and discouraging sports \n     equipment companies from making false injury prevention \n     claims are two straightforward ways to reduce brain injuries. \n     You can count on my enthusiastic support for this important \n     children's safety and consumer protection legislation.\n\n  Sports and exercise should be encouraged for everyone--especially \nchildren. We must do more to ensure that kids participate in sports and \nexercise for all the health benefits they bring. While there will \nalways be some risk of injury, we must make sure that athletes, coaches \nand parents know about the dangers and signs of concussion. We must \nmake sure that they are using safe equipment. And we must take false \nadvertising of safety gear out of the game.\n  I ask all my colleagues for their support of the Children's Sports \nAthletic Equipment Safety Act as part of this vital effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 601\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

False or misleading claims with respect to athletic sporting \n              activity goods.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Participation in sports and athletic activities \n     provides many benefits to children and should be encouraged.\n       (2) Participation in sports and athletic activities does \n     involve some inevitable risk of injury that no protective \n     gear or safety device can fully eliminate.\n       (3) Sports-related concussion is a form of traumatic brain \n     injury that can lead to lasting negative health consequences.\n       (4) Direct medical costs and indirect costs of traumatic \n     brain injuries totaled an estimated $60,000,000,000 in the \n     United States in the year 2000.\n       (5) Sports are the second leading cause of traumatic brain \n     injury for Americans who are 15 to 24 years old, behind only \n     motor vehicle crashes.\n       (6) Every year, American athletes suffer up to an estimated \n     3,800,000 sports-related concussions.\n       (7) The potential for catastrophic injury resulting from \n     multiple concussions make sports-related concussion a \n     significant concern for young athletes, coaches, and parents.\n       (8) Football has the highest incidence of concussions, \n     which also occur in many other sports such as baseball, \n     basketball, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, and softball.\n       (9) An estimated 4,500,000 children play football in \n     organized youth and school sports leagues, including \n     approximately 1,500,000 high school players.\n       (10) According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \n     more than 920,000 athletes under the age of 18 were treated \n     in emergency rooms, doctors' offices, and clinics for \n     football-related injuries in the year 2007.\n       (11) In any given football season, 20 percent of all high \n     school football players sustain brain injuries.\n       (12) One study that included a post-season survey of \n     football players found that 47 percent experienced at least \n     one concussion and almost 35 percent experienced multiple \n     concussions.\n       (13) Medical experts at Boston University School of \n     Medicine found that a deceased 18 year old athlete, who had \n     experienced multiple concussions playing high school \n     football, suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a \n     degenerative brain disease caused by head trauma.\n       (14) A football helmet's ability to protect players from \n     injury by attenuating acceleration forces can decline over \n     time as the helmet experiences thousands of hits from use \n     during successive football seasons after its original date of \n     manufacture.\n       (15) According to industry estimates, 100,000 football \n     helmets more than ten years old, and thousands almost twenty \n     years old, were worn by players in the 2009 season.\n       (16) A high school football player who suffered brain \n     damage from being hit in the head soon after suffering a \n     previous concussion was wearing a twenty year old football \n     helmet when he was injured.\n       (17) Children as young as 5 years old rely on football \n     helmets to protect against head injury.\n       (18) The widespread adoption of a voluntary industry \n     standard for football helmet safety led to an 80 percent \n     reduction in life-threatening subdural hematoma injuries.\n       (19) The voluntary industry safety standard for football \n     helmets does not specifically address concussion risk.\n       (20) There is no voluntary industry safety standard \n     specifically for youth football helmets worn by children, who \n     have different physiological characteristics from adults in \n     terms of head size and neck strength, especially those who \n     are younger than 12-years old.\n       (21) Some football helmet manufacturers and resellers have \n     used misleading concussion safety claims to sell children's \n     football helmets.\n       (22) Some used helmet reconditioners have falsely certified \n     that reconditioned helmets provided to schools and youth \n     football teams met voluntary industry safety standards.\n       (23) Used helmet reconditioners do not independently test \n     reconditioned helmets before certifying that they meet \n     voluntary industry safety standards.\n       (24) The industry organization that sets voluntary football \n     helmet safety standards does not conduct independent testing \n     nor market surveillance to ensure compliance with such \n     voluntary safety standards by manufacturers and \n     reconditioners that certify new and used helmets to such \n     standards.\n       (25) Football helmet manufacturers and reconditioners place \n     product warning labels underneath padding where the warning \n     labels are obscured from view and not clearly legible.\n       (26) The Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et \n     seq.) charges the Consumer Product Safety Commission with \n     protecting the public from unreasonable risks of serious \n     injury or death from consumer products, including consumer \n     products used in recreation and in schools.\n       (27) The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et \n     seq.) empowers the Federal Trade Commission to prevent unfair \n     or deceptive acts or practices, and prohibits the \n     dissemination of misleading claims for devices or services.\n\n     SEC. 3. FOOTBALL HELMET SAFETY STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Voluntary Standard Determination.--Within 9 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission shall determine, with respect to a standard \n     or standards submitted by a voluntary standards-setting \n     organization regarding youth football helmets, reconditioned \n     football helmets, and new football helmet concussion \n     resistance (if feasible) whether--\n       (1) compliance with the standard or standards is likely to \n     result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk \n     of injury in connection with the use of football helmets;\n       (2) it is likely that there will be substantial compliance \n     with the standard or standards; and\n       (3) the standard or standards are maintained by a \n     standards-setting organization that meets the requirements of \n     the document `ANSI Essential Requirements: Due Process \n     Requirements for American National Standards' published in \n     January 2010 by the American National Standards Institute (or \n     any successor document).\n       (b) Consumer Product Safety Standard.--Unless the Consumer \n     Product Safety Commission makes an affirmative determination \n     with respect to a standard or standards under subsection (a) \n     that addresses the matters to which the following standards \n     would apply, the Commission shall initiate a rulemaking \n     proceeding for the development of a consumer product safety \n     rule with respect to the following:\n       (1) Youth football helmets.--A standard for youth football \n     helmets which is informed by children's different \n     physiological characteristics from adults in terms of head \n     size and neck strength.\n       (2) Reconditioned football helmets.--A standard for all \n     reconditioned football helmets.\n       (3) New football helmet concussion resistance.--A standard \n     for all new football helmets that addresses concussion risk, \n     if the Commission determines that such a standard is feasible \n     given current understanding of concussion risk and how \n     helmets can prevent concussion.\n       (4) Football helmet warning labels.--A standard for warning \n     labels on all football helmets that, at a minimum, requires \n     clearly legible and fully visible statements warning \n     consumers of the limits of protection afforded by the helmet. \n     This standard may include requirements for pictograms, \n     instructions, guidelines, or other cautions to consumers \n     about injury risk and the proper use of football helmets.\n       (5) Date of manufacture label for new football helmets.--A \n     standard for a clearly legible and fully visible label on all \n     new football helmets stating the football helmet's original \n     date of manufacture and warning consumers that a football \n     helmet's ability to protect the wearer can decline over time.\n       (6) Date of reconditioning label for reconditioned \n     helmets.--A standard for a clearly legible and fully visible \n     label on all reconditioned football helmets stating the \n     helmet's last date of reconditioning, its original date of \n     manufacture, and warning consumers that a football helmet's \n     ability to protect the wearer can decline over time, despite \n     being properly and regularly reconditioned.\n       (c) Safety Standards.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission shall--\n       (A) in consultation with representatives of coaches, \n     consumer groups, engineers, medical experts, school sports \n     directors, scientists, and sports equipment standard-setting \n     organizations, examine and assess the effectiveness of any \n     voluntary consumer product safety standards for youth \n     football helmets, reconditioned football helmets, and new \n     football helmet concussion resistance proposed by a voluntary \n     standards-setting organization; and\n       (B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United \n     States Code, promulgate consumer product safety standards \n     that--\n       (i) are substantially the same as such voluntary standards; \n     or\n       (ii) are more stringent than such voluntary standards, if \n     the Commission determines that more stringent standards would \n     further reduce the risk of injury associated with football \n     helmets.\n       (2) Timetable for rulemaking.--If the Commission does not \n     make an affirmative determination under subsection (a) within \n     the 9-month period, the Commission shall commence the \n     rulemaking required by subsection (b) within 30 days after \n     the end of that 9-month period. The Commission shall \n     periodically review and revise the standards set forth in the \n     consumer product safety rule prescribed pursuant to that \n     proceeding to ensure that such standards provide the highest \n     level of safety for football helmets that is feasible.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF THIRD PARTY TESTING AND CERTIFICATION \n                   REQUIREMENTS TO YOUTH FOOTBALL HELMETS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The third party testing and certification \n     requirements of section 14(a)(2) of the Consumer Product \n     Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2063(a)(2)) shall apply to any youth \n     football helmet (including a reconditioned youth football \n     helmet) to which any consumer product safety rule prescribed \n     under section 3(b) of this Act applies as if the helmet were \n     a children's product that is subject to a children's product \n     safety rule without regard to the age of the individual for \n     whom it is primarily designed or intended.\n       (b) Special Application of Definition of Children's Product \n     for Purposes of Testing and Certification of Football \n     Helmets.--For the exclusive purpose of applying\n\n[[Page S1757]]\n\n     the definition of the term ``children's product'' in section \n     3(a)(2) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2052(a)(2)) to the requirements of subsection (a) of this \n     section, ``18 years'' shall be substituted for ``12 years'' \n     each place it appears.\n       (c) For the purposes of this section, third party testing \n     and certification shall be conducted by a testing laboratory \n     that has an accreditation--\n       (1) that meets International Organization for \n     Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission \n     standard 17025:2005 entitled General Requirements for the \n     Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories (or any \n     successor standard that is from an accreditation body that is \n     signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation \n     Cooperation for testing accreditation);\n       (2) that meets International Organization for \n     Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission \n     Guide 65:1996 entitled General Requirements for Bodies \n     Operating Product Certification Systems (or any successor \n     standard that is from an accreditation body that is signatory \n     to the International Accreditation Forum for product \n     certification accreditation); and\n       (3) that includes all appropriate football helmet standards \n     and test methods within the scope of the accreditation.\n\n     SEC. 5.

The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce \n     this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with the \n     same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all \n     applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade \n     Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated into \n     and made a part of this Act.\n       (2) Regulations.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Commission may promulgate such regulations as it \n     finds necessary or appropriate under this Act under section \n     553 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (3) Penalties.--Any person who violates subsection (a) or \n     any regulation prescribed under that section, shall be \n     subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and \n     immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act as \n     though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal \n     Trade Commission Act were incorporated in and made part of \n     this Act.\n       (4) Authority preserved.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to limit the authority of the Commission under any \n     other provision of law.\n       (c) Enforcement by State Attorneys General.--\n       (1) Right of action.--Except as provided in paragraph (5), \n     the attorney general of a State, or other authorized State \n     officer, alleging a violation of subsection (a) or any \n     regulation issued under that section that affects or may \n     affect such State or its residents may bring an action on \n     behalf of the residents of the State in any United States \n     district court for the district in which the defendant is \n     found, resides, or transacts business, or wherever venue is \n     proper under section 1391 of title 28, United States Code, to \n     obtain appropriate injunctive relief.\n       (2) Initiation of civil action.--A State shall provide \n     prior written notice to the Federal Trade Commission of any \n     civil action under paragraph (1) together with a copy of its \n     complaint, except that if it is not feasible for the State to \n     provide such prior notice, the State shall provide such \n     notice immediately upon instituting such action.\n       (3) Intervention by the commission.--The Commission may \n     intervene in such civil action and upon intervening--\n       (A) be heard on all matters arising in such civil action; \n     and\n       (B) file petitions for appeal of a decision in such civil \n     action.\n       (4) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed--\n       (A) to prevent the attorney general of a State, or other \n     authorized State officer, from exercising the powers \n     conferred on the attorney general, or other authorized State \n     officer, by the laws of such State; or\n       (B) to prohibit the attorney general of a State, or other \n     authorized State officer, from proceeding in State or Federal \n     court on the basis of an alleged violation of any civil or \n     criminal statute of that State.\n       (5) Limitation.--No separate suit shall be brought under \n     this subsection if, at the time the suit is brought, the same \n     alleged violation is the subject of a pending action by the \n     Federal Trade Commission or the United States under this \n     section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Barrasso):\n  S. 602. A bill to require regulatory reform; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, yesterday I offered three amendments to \nthe SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Bill to make commonsense reforms to our \nregulatory system. Today, Senators Roberts and Barrasso join me in \noffering the ``CURB Act''--which stands for ``Clearing Unnecessary \nRegulatory Burdens.'' This legislation combines the provisions of those \nthree amendments to force federal agencies to cut the red tape that \nimpedes job growth.\n  As I explained yesterday, all too often it seems Federal agencies do \nnot take into account the impacts to small businesses and job growth \nbefore imposing new rules and regulations. The bill we are introducing \ntoday obligates them to do so.\n  The CURB Act does three things: first, it requires Federal agencies \nto analyze the indirect costs of regulations, such as the impact on job \ncreation, the cost of energy, and consumer prices.\n  Presently, Federal agencies are not required by statute to analyze \nthe indirect cost regulations can have on the public, such as higher \nenergy costs, higher prices, and the impact on job creation. However, \nExecutive Order 12866, issued by President Clinton in 1993, obligates \nagencies to provide the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nwith an assessment of the indirect costs of proposed regulations. Our \nbill would essentially codify this provision of President Clinton's \nExecutive Order.\n\n  Second, the CURB Act obligates Federal agencies to comply with public \nnotice and comment requirements and prohibits them from circumventing \nthese requirements by issuing unofficial rules as ``guidance \ndocuments.''\n  After President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866, Federal \nagencies found it easier to issue so-called ``guidance documents,'' \nrather than formal rules. Although these guidance documents are merely \nan agency's interpretation of how the public can comply with a \nparticular rule, and are not enforceable in court, as a practical \nmatter they operate as if they are legally binding. Thus, they have \nbeen used by agencies to circumvent OIRA regulatory review and public \nnotice and comment requirements.\n  In 2007, President Bush issued Executive Order 13422, which contained \na provision closing this loophole by imposing ``Good Guidance \nPractices'' on Federal agencies, which requires them to provide public \nnotice and comment for significant guidance documents. Our bill would \nessentially codify this provision of President Bush's Executive Order.\n  Third, the CURB Act helps out the ``little guy'' trying to navigate \nour incredibly complex and burdensome regulatory environment. So many \nsmall businesses don't have a lot of capital on hand. When a small \nbusiness inadvertently runs afoul of a Federal regulation for the first \ntime, that first penalty could sink the business and all the jobs it \nsupports. Our bill would provide access to SBA assistance to small \nbusinesses in a situation where they face a first-time, non-harmful \npaperwork violation. It simply doesn't make sense to me to punish small \nbusinesses the first time they accidently fail to comply with paperwork \nrequirements, so long as no harm comes from that failure.\n  Each of these provisions has been endorsed by the National Federation \nof Independent Business, NFIB, and the Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship Council. I urge my colleagues to support the CURB Act, \nwhich contains these important reforms to our regulatory system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1757-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1757-S1758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 103--PROVIDING FOR MEMBERS ON THE PART OF THE SENATE \nOF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING AND THE JOINT COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS \n                             ON THE LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

FORD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 27 which was received from the \nHouse and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 27) providing for the \n     acceptance of a statue of Gerald R. Ford from the people of \n     Michigan for placement in the United States Capitol.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate is poised to approve a \nconcurrent resolution providing for the acceptance of a statue of \nPresident Gerald R. Ford to be placed in the Capitol. I am proud as a \nMichiganian, and proud as an American, to support this resolution.\n  In this turbulent moment, it is good to remember that this is not the \nfirst time our Nation has faced adversity. At another time--a time of \ndistress and doubt and anguish--Gerald Ford assumed our Nation's \nhighest office. We were fortunate indeed that at that time of great \ndanger, Jerry Ford was there to take the helm and keep our country on \nan even keel.\n  President Ford's courage in the performance of his duties and his \nwillingness to act in the Nation's interest even when it brought \ncriticism were the capstone of a lifetime of service. As a young Navy \nofficer during World War II, this son of Grand Rapids served his Nation \nwith distinction. In December 1944, when a great typhoon and fire \nthreatened Ford's ship, he demonstrated the courage and cool judgment \nthat would serve him so well in Congress and the White House.\n  Gerald Ford served Michigan and his country for 13 terms as a Member \nof the House of Representatives, earning bipartisan respect. He became \nVice President at a time of great controversy, but it was in navigating \nthe storm that brought him to the Presidency that he provided his \ngreatest service. At a time when our nation needed healing, he was a \nhealer. When we needed unity, he was our unifying force.\n  The people of Michigan are proud to call Gerald Ford one of our own. \nPlacement of this statue, a gift from the people of Michigan, in the \nRotunda of the Capitol on May 3, will be a fitting tribute to his \nservice.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 27) was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1768-4", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN SUPPORT OF REDUCING THE SENATE'S BUDGET BY AT LEAST 5 PERCENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 94\n\n       Whereas, the current level Federal spending is \n     unsustainable and action to reverse this course should not be \n     delayed;\n       Whereas, in 2010, Federal spending was nearly 24 percent of \n     the value of all the goods and services produced in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, the Federal deficit was over $1 trillion in fiscal \n     year 2010;\n       Whereas, Federal spending is at its highest percentage \n     since World War II;\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office estimates if the \n     United States maintains its current track of Federal \n     spending, the Federal debt would reach 90 percent of the \n     value of all the goods and services produced in the United \n     States by 2020;\n       Whereas, the national debt exceeds $13.9 trillion dollars;\n       Whereas, the United States borrows $44,000 for every person \n     in the country;\n       Whereas, the unemployment rate was 9.8 percent in December;\n       Whereas, the American people have responded to the economic \n     downturn by making hard choices and trimming their family \n     budgets;\n       Whereas, spending in the legislative branch rose nearly 50 \n     percent over the last 10 years; and\n       Whereas, in order to address the Nation's fiscal crisis, \n     the Senate should lead by example and reduce its own \n     legislative budget: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that it should \n     lead by example and reduce the budget of the Senate by at \n     least 5 percent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/16/senate-section/article/S1768-5", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1768-S1769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROVIDING FOR MEMBERS OF JOINT COMMITTEES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
