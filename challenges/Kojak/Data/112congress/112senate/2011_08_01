Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes with the \nSenate and the American people to talk to them about this great body in \nwhich we serve. I know there are all kinds of pundits and commentators \nwho talk about how the ``system is broken.'' They point to what has \nbeen going on in Washington in the last few months and say it shows \nthat we need a complete change in the way we enact laws; that it just \ndoesn't work anymore, and what is going on is terrible, awful.\n  I want to take a few minutes and historically review what our country \nis all about.\n  In the summer of 1787, the Founding Fathers were meeting in \nPhiladelphia, and they were having a very difficult time. They had \ntried a number of ways in the past to keep the country together. They \nhad the Articles of Confederation. They knew it wasn't appropriate; it \nwasn't working.\n  In June of 1787, a delegate from Connecticut came to a conclusion, \nand he had an idea that he would suggest to other members in the \ndelegation--the Founding Fathers--about how they could come up with a \nconstitution. That is why they were there.\n  His suggestion was full of merit because they had not been able to \nsolve the problem of the great State of New York, a huge area with \nmillions of people, and the little State of Connecticut, a very small \narea and a few people--how could those two States be together in the \nsame Union? They had already decided they were going to have three \nseparate branches of government. But the problems they had in \nPhiladelphia those many years ago was how to handle the legislative \nbranch.\n  The delegate from Connecticut came up with what was called the Great \nCompromise. His suggestion became part of our Constitution and allowed \nthe Constitution to become real. His suggestion was that we would have \none body of the legislature, the House of Representatives, that would \nbe elected every 2 years. If someone died, there would have to be an \nelection. No one in the history of our country has gotten to be a \nMember of the House without having been elected by their constituents.\n  The Senate, however, would not be representative of how many people \nwere in the State. Each State would get the same number. That was the\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\nbreakthrough. It was an experiment--a noble experiment. It has worked \nso well over these many years, where we have the legislative branch \nconsisting of two separate bodies. It is bicameral in nature.\n  There has been conflict. The Founding Fathers built conflict into the \nlegislative government because they believed that would be enough to \noffset the power of the judicial and executive branches of government. \nOver the years, things have been much worse than they have been in \nWashington in the last 3 months. Our country has been so successful as \na result of the Constitution's guidance.\n  I repeat, the Constitution has been so successful because of the \nGreat Compromise of the legislative branch of government.\n  In the early days of our country, there was conflict that went on all \nthe time. They were, from the very beginning, thinking: Can this great \ncountry survive? Then we had the conflict developing prior to the Civil \nWar. One Congressman and Senator, Henry Clay from Kentucky, was known \nas the Great Compromiser. He worked for generations to see what he \ncould do to stop the dissolution of the Republic. He was successful in \na very difficult time.\n  One Member of the House was enraged because Charles Sumner was \nantislavery. He was a fine, extemporaneous speaker. He was so able to \nexpress himself, Congressman Brooks came to the Senate floor with his \ncane and beat Senator Sumner with it. Senator Sumner never really \nrecovered. He was off work for a couple of years, and he had a \npermanent disability as a result of that beating he took on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Historic battles have taken place in our country which were much more \ndifficult than what we have just gone through. What we have just gone \nthough has been extremely difficult, but there was never any \nconsideration that the Republic would fall.\n  In more recent years, we had the civil rights disputes. Mr. \nPresident, years before that, the Congress reacted to slavery, and we \nhad the dissolution of slavery. Many years later came the civil rights \nmovement. The debate that took place on the Senate floor was very \nheated. Filibusters took place that lasted for weeks, not days. There \nwas tremendous acrimony as a result of that issue dealing with civil \nrights. But we worked through that. It was hard, and people at that \ntime thought Congress was broken.\n  Congress is not broken. Congress works the way it should. Does that \nmean it is always a very pleasant, happy place? No. Do I wish it \nweren't as difficult as it has been in the last few months? I wish it \nwas much better than that. That is where we are.\n  Through all the years and conflicts we have had, we have been able to \ncome together and reach reasonable conclusions. The great experiment \nthat started in 1787 has been very successful. A number of people have \nidentified our system of government, but I guess the best way to talk \nabout it came from Winston Churchill who said about democracy:\n\n       It has been said that democracy is the worst form of \n     government except for all others that have been tried.\n\n  I am not proud of the conflict we have had these last many months, \nbut I am satisfied we have been able to come together to find a \nsolution. It is not over until both Houses of Congress pass the \nlegislation dealing with the debt crisis. It is not over until the \nPresident signs the bill.\n  After weeks of facing off against each other, and this partisan \ndivide we have in the Senate, we were finally able to break through \nwith an agreement, which is typical for agreements that are difficult. \nNo one got everything they wanted. Everyone had to give up something. \nPeople on the right are upset, people on the left are upset, and people \nin the middle are upset. It is a compromise. It is not always easy for \ntwo sides to reach a consensus, but that is what we did. We did it on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  So I believe reasonable Republicans and Democrats alike understood in \nthis case that without compromise our country faced a very difficult \nsituation. But we did send a message to the world and to the American \npeople that our great democracy is working; as difficult and as hard as \nit is, it works.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the next 2 days on \nboth sides of the aisle to pass this remarkable agreement that will \nprotect the long-term health of our economy and avert default on our \nNation's debt. We still have a lot of problems dealing with the debt. \nToday, Congress has a unique opportunity and responsibility to show the \nworld what we can achieve, not in spite of our divided government but \nbecause of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5156-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say a word about the leadership in \nthe Senate. I have the good fortune of working with Senator Harry Reid, \nour majority leader. In my role as whip, or assistant leader, I have \nbeen close at hand when most of the major decisions have been made. I \nhave come to take the measure of this man from Searchlight, NV, and I \nhave found him to be an extraordinary leader.\n  At first blush, most people would not choose him for his ringing \noratory or a commanding presence. But I will tell you that he has \ncreated a leadership style in the Senate that is exceptional. I have \nwatched him during the span of the last 2\\1/2\\ years, particularly as \nhe has faced a myriad of challenges: a new President of his own party; \npassing the stimulus bill, when we didn't have 60 votes on the \nDemocratic side and had to rely on a cross-over vote from three \nRepublican Senators; dealing with the TARP crisis; the recession and \nwhat needed to be done to save financial institutions from dissolution; \nhis efforts, as well, on the Health Care Reform Act, which might have \nbeen the mightiest political battle I have ever been engaged in; the \nFinancial Reform Act--the list goes on and on.\n  Then comes this year with the new Congress--divided, with a \nRepublican leadership in the House. He has had to face passage of \nappropriations bills, continuing resolutions, and now the most recent \ncrisis over the extension of the debt ceiling. He is an exceptional \nleader.\n  I think the majority leader is such an exception because of his \nhumility. He is not the first to the camera nor the loudest in speech. \nHe is a person whose word is trusted and who works night and day until \nwe reach our goal. I admire him so much as a friend, and I am proud to \nbe part of his leadership team and Democratic caucus.\n  I would like to say a word, as well, about Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader. He stepped forward several weeks ago with an \nexceptional show of political courage when he made a suggestion about \nhow we could find our way through this crisis. It was not a welcome \nidea on his side of the aisle, and many of his critics took him to task \nfor suggesting how we could get through the debt ceiling crisis. I \nadmired the fact he stood up and understood his responsibility--our \nresponsibility--to the Nation beyond any partisan consideration. \nSenator McConnell played a critical role in working out the agreement \nwhich will come before us and is now pending before the\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\nSenate--or will be pending before the Senate shortly. I thank him. I \nthanked him last night personally, and I thank him publicly for joining \nin this bipartisan effort on behalf of the Senate with Senator Reid and \nworking directly with the President and Vice President.\n  I am also happy the leaders in the House--Speaker Boehner and the \nminority leader, Congresswoman Pelosi--were able to work together to \ncome up with this agreement.\n  There are harsh critics of this idea because, as Senator Reid stated \nearlier, what we have come up with as an agreement is not what I would \nhave written and certainly not what any Senator would have written. \nThere are parts of it that I don't care for at all and other parts I \nthink are very wise. That is the nature of compromise. I do not believe \nI have compromised my principles as a person or as an elected official \nin coming to this agreement.\n  At some point, you have to sit at the table and look the other side \nin the eye and realize they feel just as strongly as you do, and the \nonly common ground to be found between you is not when you give up or \nwhen the other side gives up.\n  Let me tell you what I think are the pluses and minuses of what we \nare about to consider during the course of this day. First, we have \naverted an economic crisis--if both House and Senate should approve \nthis measure. The notion we would default on our national debt for the \nfirst time in our history--as of midnight tomorrow night--would be \ndevastating to a weakened economy with more than 9 million Americans \nout of work. It would have raised America's interest rate on its own \ndebts, adding to our national debt.\n  As I have said on the Senate floor many times, a 1-percent increase \nin the interest rate paid by America costs us $130 billion more on our \ndeficit. So the idea of interest rates going up would add to our debt, \nnot solve our debt crisis.\n  In addition, it would force interest rates up all over America. \nIndividuals, businesses, and families would feel it in their credit \ncard bills, student loan debts, automobile loans, and home loans. \nBusinesses trying to engage in borrowing to expand the size of their \nbusiness for the developments they are undertaking would feel it. That \nis exactly the wrong thing to do, as the Federal Reserve strives to \nkeep interest rates low to promote growth, for us on Capitol Hill to do \nsomething which would have the opposite impact. So averting this crisis \nwas the No. 1 achievement of any agreement we reached among our \nleadership.\n  The fact we don't have to revisit this crisis on a weekly or monthly \nbasis is also a positive step forward. There was a feeling on both \nsides of the aisle--though not as clearly spoken on one side--that to \ncome back and do this over and over could not help but weaken the role \nand reputation of the United States and the global economy. So we now \nhave an agreement which will take us to February 2013, beyond the next \nPresidential election, giving whoever is elected or reelected an \nopportunity to govern and to manage the economy in a responsible way. I \nthink those are the major achievements.\n  Secondly, we make a downpayment on the deficit. I think that cuts \nboth ways. We need to address our deficit. This Nation cannot be great, \ncannot continue to grow while borrowing 40 cents for every dollar the \ngovernment spends. That is an unacceptable approach, and we need to \nreduce that dependency on borrowing and reduce the debts we are \ncreating. Reducing spending is the starting point.\n  I would question whether this is the right moment to do that. I \nhappen to believe, as others do, when we are in a recession and trying \nto create economic growth, pulling back on spending on such things as \ntraining and education and the building of infrastructure makes the \nsituation worse, not better. I didn't prevail in that point of view, \nand this does not reflect it. But the fact that we will be putting some \nmoney down toward reducing our deficit is a positive.\n  I am also glad that included in this agreement, when it comes to \nspending cuts, is protection for the most vulnerable people in America. \nI can't get over how many times Members of the House and Senate get up \nand make glowing speeches about cutting spending when those projects \nand programs they are cutting are safety nets for the most vulnerable \npeople in America. We are talking about those who are unemployed and \nlooking for work. We are talking about those who are elderly and poor. \nWe are talking about those who are suffering from physical and mental \ndisabilities. We are a great and caring nation. We have created a \nsafety net of programs so we don't see the homeless on our streets any \nmore than necessary because of the inadequacy of our programs, and we \ndon't turn a blind eye when it comes to the suffering many families are \ngoing through.\n  I am sorry we are making some cuts, but we are protecting most of the \nsafety net programs, such as Medicaid, the health insurance program for \nthe lower income people in America. Who counts on Medicaid? One-third \nof the children in America have their health insurance through \nMedicaid. Almost 50 percent of the live births in America are paid for \nby Medicaid. In addition, many elderly people, even those on Social \nSecurity and Medicare, have to turn to Medicaid to sustain them in \ntheir nursing home and convalescent home settings. So protecting \nMedicaid as part of this package is very important as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  I would also add, the approach we are using is more balanced than \nsome. I want America to be strong and safe. Everyone does. It is part \nof our Constitution that we swear to uphold. But there is money being \nwasted in the Department of Defense. There are contracts that are \noverrun, money overspent, and there is a lack of oversight. We can save \nmoney in the Department of Defense to reduce our deficit and not \ncompromise by one penny the safety and security of the United States.\n  This agreement before us says both the Department of Defense and all \nother departments of the government have to look for savings and \nreduction in spending to move us toward our deficit-reduction goal. I \nthink that is good.\n  What is missing in this package? What is missing is obvious. At its \nbest, this package will reduce our deficit by $2.1 trillion, maybe a \nlittle more, when it comes to future spending. Most of us believe \nunless we can reduce our deficit by $4 trillion, which is almost twice \nas much, over a period of 10 years, we will not make the positive \nimpact we need to make to spur economic growth and more confidence in \nthe American economy. But Senator Reid suggested, as part of this \nprogram, we create a joint committee to try to find a way to increase \nthe savings and reduction in deficit in the years to come.\n  Some skeptics this morning have said that is a typical Washington \ncop-out; that we are going to create another joint committee. Haven't \nwe had enough? One could make that argument, but I think it overlooks \nthe obvious. We are committed to reducing our deficit. We are committed \nto creating a joint committee that comes up with specific programs that \nwork. If we fail, there is a penalty. If the joint committee fails to \nproduce a product enacted by the House and Senate, there is a penalty.\n  Under our legislative language--it is known as a trigger--it says: If \nyou should fail to reduce the spending and reduce the deficit through \nthe joint committee, there will be a price paid--even deeper cuts in \nspending on both the defense and nondefense sides.\n  I don't want to see it move in that direction. I hope we can find a \nmore balanced approach and do it through the joint committee, working \non a bipartisan basis with appreciation and respect for one another \nacross the table, and we can reach that goal.\n  Erskine Bowles, former Chief of Staff to President Clinton; Alan \nSimpson, former Senator, cochaired the commission on which I served. \nThey sat down and created a template for us to reach meaningful deficit \nand debt reduction over 10 years of over $4 trillion. I took those \nideas and with others--Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, Senator \nChambliss of Georgia, Senator Crapo of Idaho, Senator Coburn of \nOklahoma, and Senator Conrad of North Dakota--sat down with the Gang of \n6, and we turned those ideas into what we thought was a legislative \napproach that would work.\n\n  I still think that has merit, and I still think it should be actively \nconsidered when we talk about the long-term\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\nreduction of debt. It is bipartisan, it is honest, it achieves real \ndebt reduction, and it does it in the fairest possible way. It puts \neverything on the table--everything. There are no sacred cows. \nEverything is on the table. It means it goes beyond spending cuts to \nthe entitlement programs, which makes those of us on the Democratic \nside particularly nervous. But it also goes to revenue--new revenue--to \nreduce the deficit, which makes those on the other side of the aisle \nnervous. But what we should be nervous about is a continuing deficit \nand a weakening economy and a debt left to our children.\n  I believe this proposal that is before us now--this agreement of the \nleaders--should be adopted in a timely fashion. I hope we can move to \nit today. We are working out with the Republicans a schedule when these \nmatters will be considered. There will be those on the right and the \nleft who will be critical, and I can understand their thinking. It \ndoesn't serve either side particularly well. But it is a compromise and \na consensus.\n  I think of all the people who contacted my office from Illinois and \nbeyond during the last several weeks, begging us to do something, to \nnot let this economy fail, to work together and compromise and find a \nway to resolve our differences. I think this is a reasonable attempt to \ndo that. I will support it, with some misgivings. But I believe it \ngives us the way to get through this crisis and to move to a better \nplace where we deal with this deficit and debt in a responsible, \nbipartisan manner, asking for shared sacrifice from all those across \nAmerica who can make a sacrifice. That is the nature of our Nation. It \nis the nature of our history, where time and again we have rallied as a \nnation to face even more daunting challenges in the past.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I have come to the floor and talked many \ntimes of my constituents back home in Alaska and the importance of \nensuring we have a balanced approach in how we deal with this \nincredible debt crisis we are in and how we manage to create some \ncertainty not only for today but in the years to come. We want to make \nsure we not only create certainty but we also do what we can to protect \nworking families, honor our commitment to seniors and veterans, and let \nour small businesses know that we stand behind them, we want them to be \nsuccessful, and we want to create some certainty out there so they can \nexpand their operations and opportunity.\n  I am sitting here in Washington, DC, and it is whatever temperature \nit is outside right now--maybe 100 degrees, with 80 or 90 percent \nhumidity--and sometimes I think we could have gotten this done quicker \nif we had just turned off the air-conditioning. We probably could have \ngotten things done quicker, with better results. But we are where we \nare. We are in the last 24 hours or so before we have to make a \ndecision as to what to do with the proposals, the solutions that have \nbeen presented.\n  I am here, but I wish I were home, to be frank with you. This last \nweekend, my son was celebrating his ninth birthday, and as a parent \nevery birthday is huge and makes a difference. I know the Presiding \nOfficer knows that very well. So while I am here, they were enjoying \nlife, and it made me think about a lot of things.\n  I wanted to put this poster up because I think it is a great poster. \nI got this text during a committee meeting. This is my son, who just \nturned 9, with a real fish. For those who can't see it, it is the same \nheight as he is. He caught this fish with his mother a few days ago. It \nis a 40-pounder king salmon. It is what we call a real fish. We \nconsider this small in comparison to some others we catch.\n  But when I got this text--and that is what is so great about \ntechnology: He sends me little notes and comments during meetings and \nwants to make sure I am connected to what he is doing back home. But \nthis debate we are having--this moment in time--to figure out where we \nare going is about the Jacobs and the other children of his age and \nthose not yet born. It is about what we are going to do for them. The \nPresiding Officer and I have already experienced and enjoyed many years \nof our life, and hopefully we will enjoy many more, but really it is \nabout Jacob and the other children.\n  When I go back home, I get a chance to talk with the kids. I am sure \nthe Presiding Officer has done the same, where you go into an \nelementary school--I know the Presiding Officer was a teacher in Sunday \npreschool--you go in and have conversations with the kids, and in their \nown way, which is sometimes very brutally honest, they tell you all \nabout what they think is going on. And I will give a quote here in a \nsecond of what my son said to me. He doesn't understand everything we \nare doing, but he understands it is an intense time here because I am \nnot home. I am not with him. So he knows it is important, what we are \ndoing here, as we debate this solution and what will be the next step.\n  Is what we have come up with a perfect solution? No. Are there some \nissues about which I am still concerned? Yes. But does it move us down \na path to start dealing with the spending, the deficit, and the debt, \ncreating certainty and protecting those who need protection, such as \nour seniors and our veterans? Yes.\n  This proposal produces about a $1 trillion downpayment on our deficit \nand debt. It lays out a process by which we can achieve another $1.5 \ntrillion in debt reduction if this joint committee can come back with a \nproposal.\n  In the process of all this, we will create certainty in the \nmarketplace. We will create certainty for that small businessperson who \nhas been thinking about expanding their business. They can do that \nbecause the markets will respond positively.\n  We will create certainty for the individual who was thinking about \nbuying a house or a car because now there will be stable rates.\n  For those who are putting money aside for the education of their \nyoung family, as I have been putting aside for Jacob for his college, \nwe will know now that the markets are better and safer, the bonds we \ninvest in are safer, and our children's future is a little more secure \nif we do the right thing over the next 24 hours, still knowing it is \nnot the perfect deal.\n  The proposal evenly splits cutting between half in discretionary and \nhalf in Pentagon waste, ensuring we still are a secure nation and \nprotecting our defenses but cutting what I would consider opportunities \nwithin the Pentagon to reduce.\n  As we sit here today, I think about Jacob's future and the futures of \nall\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\nthe kids I see back home. There is an enormous amount of opportunity \nfor the pages sitting here in this room, for the kids here during the \nsummer running around Washington, DC, and seeing these great monuments. \nThat is what we are doing here--guaranteeing those opportunities for \nthis generation and future generations. That is our task, making \ndecisions based on that, not on what our next election cycle will bring \nshould we get elected or not get elected or will this look good or not \nlook good on a brochure. Those who have that kind of thinking are not \nabout this country and are not supporting what this country is all \nabout. I think about all the issues in front of us, and there has been \nno more critical issue during my almost 3 years in the Senate that I \nhave had to deal with.\n  Is there a component missing in this solution? Yes. We are not \ndealing with the tax cuts the millionaires and billionaires received \nand benefited from when they really didn't need them. We are not \ndealing with the loopholes, the scams and shams people have taken \nadvantage of with our tax structure. We haven't resolved the question \nof fairness in our tax structure so that the middle class doesn't \ncontinue to carry the burden. We have not created a tax reform strategy \nthat creates an opportunity for us to be more competitive in this world \neconomy. We know that is still a big piece of this.\n  I am hopeful that the joint committee, made up of Democrats and \nRepublicans, will present to us a plan before Thanksgiving and we can \nthen sit down and look at that plan and realize it is an addition to \nwhat we are doing--hopefully in the next 24 hours--in creating more \nfairness.\n  I know the amazing thing about here--and I know, Madam President, you \nknow--this place is an unbelievable place for media. We breathe, they \nreport it. We sneeze, they report it. There will be two opinions on how \nwe sneeze--maybe three, maybe four--because that is how it works here. \nThey feed on every word we say, everything we do, and I know some are \nout there bragging that this is a great deal because it just does cuts, \nand it doesn't deal with revenues. Then there are others who say it \ndoesn't deal with revenues or it hurts Social Security. We can tell \nwhen that occurs, that is probably not a bad plan because there is so \nmuch that people don't like of each element or there are elements we \ndon't like. But we do need to deal with revenues at some point.\n  We will need to deal with a tax reform policy that brings balance and \nfairness where the middle class does not continue to keep holding the \nbag for everything.\n  There is a proposal Senator Wyden, Senator Coats, and myself have \nproposed. It is bipartisan. It is tax reform. It creates \nsimplification, creates more corporate competitive rates, reduces the \nrates down for individuals but gets rid of a pile of these loopholes, \nthese scams and shams that people have taken advantage of so they don't \nhave to pay their fair share for the services and the benefits we all \nreceive in this great country: the roads we drive on, the schools our \nkids go to, the defense of this country, the border protection of this \ncountry, the safest food in the world--you name it, we have it. That is \nwhy we are the envy of every country in the world as a place to be and \nraise your family.\n  But as I look at this picture--and, yes, I am doing a little \nmarketing of Alaska salmon. I would be remiss if I didn't do that. I \nthink about Jacob's future and what he has and what his potential is. \nBut I also think about his dream--because as he celebrated his \nbirthday, my father-in-law passed the same day. When he was a young man \nworking in Connecticut, he bought a house in New Haven as he went off \nto Vietnam and served his country. He was a colonel as he retired in \nthe Army, and then he sold that home to buy what is in the background \nhere, his cabin for his grandson to enjoy the fruits of his life and \nwhat he enjoyed of his American dream. That is what this is about.\n  It is about making sure this generation and future generations can \nalso have that American dream; that they have choices and options not \nrestricted by politics or the financial condition of the country but \nhave huge opportunities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I think about where we are today.\n  My son has been watching this because I am not home. He has a phrase \nhe likes to use, even though it is not the perfect deal, but it does \ncreate balance. He will say at times: ``Suck it up, buttercup.'' I \ndon't know what show he saw that on, but all I know is that is his \nphrase. That is what we are going to have to do here. It is not \nperfect, but we are going to have to do what is right for the next \ngeneration and future generations.\n  Madam President, we have huge opportunities and challenges ahead of \nus. We have an economy that needs additional work to ensure we are \ncreating every opportunity to create jobs in this country for \neverybody, no matter who they are, where they live, what age they are. \nWe need to make sure we continue to be the respected country my father-\nin-law fought for in Vietnam, my son hopes for, we hope for, and future \ngenerations hope for.\n  So today I come down because I think we are close to resolving the \nissue that has stretched us almost to the brink. Hopefully, as we get \nbeyond this issue we will have the ability as Democrats and as \nRepublicans to look, first, as Americans, as Alaskans, as North \nCarolinians--wherever we are from--and focus on what is good for this \ncountry.\n  We will hear more over the next 24 hours about the details and more \nof the deal. I have heard a lot of it already, but the public will \nlearn. There will be pieces we don't like. There will be pieces about \nwhich I will get phone calls in my office that people don't like it. We \nwill get calls. But at the end of the day, we are going to do it \nbecause it is the right way to move forward. It is going to be tough, \nand we will get criticism for what we could have done, but we are where \nwe are and we need to move forward.\n  As my son would say, we have to ``suck it up, buttercup.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 6 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, and that Senators during that period of time be permitted to \nspeak up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, after \nthe House votes later today--they have a 1-hour rule, so whenever they \ntake it up they will debate it for 1 hour--it is my intention to try to \nlock in a unanimous consent to set a vote to complete action on the \ndebt limit increase. This vote could happen either tonight or tomorrow. \nSo I want Senators to be aware of that. Of course, with a consent \nagreement we could move anytime we wish to this bill, but it would take \nconsent.\n  When we finish this we have some nominations we have to deal with, \nand we have to get the FAA issue resolved. But I think this will \nprobably be the last vote we have that I am aware of.\n  It has been a pretty hard work period we have had, the last two \nweekends and working late, and I think the Senate deserves to be able \nto go home as soon as we can. If there were ever a time when we needed \nto work with our constituents, it is now.\n  For me, personally, I have been here for a long time. I have a home \nin Nevada that I haven't seen in months. My pomegranate trees are, I am \ntold, blossoming and have some pomegranates on them. I have some fig \ntrees and roses and stuff that I just haven't seen. I have constituents \nI am anxious to see, friends I need to visit, relatives I need to \nvisit. So as soon as we can complete our work, I would like to move as \nquickly as I can to the summer recess period.\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\n  So what I would ask is that as the House moves to this bill this \nafternoon, Senators should use this time to come and talk about the \nbill, whether they like it or dislike it or are neutral. It would be a \ntime that they could get their remarks on the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I am happy to be the first to take the \ndistinguished majority leader up on his offer and be here on the Senate \nfloor to talk about this very important matter.\n  I plan on voting no on this proposal. It is a very important matter. \nIt is in many ways the greatest challenge we face as a nation. So I \ndon't come to this decision lightly, but I do come to it firmly for \nthree primary reasons.\n  First of all, this bill, this so-called solution, doesn't \nfundamentally change our spending and debt picture. It just plays \naround the margins. It doesn't make any big change whatsoever.\n  To put it differently, I don't want to default under any \ncircumstances, but I don't want a downgrade of our credit rating \neither. From everything the markets and the credit rating agencies--\nMoody's and Standard & Poor's--have said for months, this would result \nin a downgrade. This would result in higher interest rates--first for \nthe government and then for all of us--on our home mortgages, on our \ncar payments, and everything else. Why? Because, again, it doesn't \nfundamentally change our spending and debt picture. It only cuts $7 \nbillion in the first year and $3 billion in the second year, a total in \nthe first 2 years of $10 billion. That is basically a minuscule \nrounding error in terms of the size of the Federal budget.\n  Over the next 10 years, we continue to mount up $7 trillion worth of \nnew debt. So we are at $14 trillion now; we are going to add on another \n$7 trillion of new debt under this plan, and we do nothing to stabilize \nour debt-to-GDP ratio, which is perhaps the most important metric that \neconomists and others point to.\n  We need to do better. We need to have some plan to balance the \nbudget. This plan never balances. This plan has mountains of new debt \nstill building. This plan never stabilizes our debt-to-GDP ratio.\n  Again, I don't want to default. I will vote to avoid a default. But I \ndo not want a downgrade either that costs every American in a \nmeaningful way.\n  Second, I have looked very hard at the enforcement provisions of this \nbill, and I am convinced that even the meager numbers in this bill, in \nterms of cuts, are going to be blown, are going to be waived, because \nthere is no meaningful enforcement. The only thing it will take to bust \nthe numbers in this bill is a new bill that passes by a simple majority \nin the House and by 60 votes in the Senate. We are constantly looking \nat those sorts of vehicles, particularly when we are probably going to \nhave disaster appropriations and disaster bills coming to the Congress. \nThere are no real teeth in this bill. There is not adequate \nenforcement.\n  To their credit, several Members of this body and several Members of \nthe House have spent months talking about how good, meaningful \nenforcement mechanisms could work. The Gang of 6 had real enforcement \nmechanisms that they spent a lot of time on. Senators here, such as Bob \nCorker, had meaningful enforcement mechanisms built into their proposed \nlegislation. None of those are in this bill. Those could easily have \nbeen adopted. Those could easily have been put in the bill; they were \nnot.\n  Third, and finally, I am very concerned that the triggers in this \nbill that are supposed to be there to ensure a second round of savings \nand deficit reduction are not going to work. I do not see how they are \ngoing to incent, particularly the Democrats, particularly the left, to \nmove to a new package of savings and deficit reduction. I think, \nrather, the triggers will be triggered, and we will have unsustainable \ndefense cuts and also unsustainable cuts to doctors and hospitals in \nMedicare. That is perhaps another reason, going back to point No. 2, \nthat even the numbers in this bill are not going to hold. They are \ngoing to be waived; they are going to be busted.\n  I have to say I hope I am wrong on all three counts if this bill, in \nfact, passes. But I have looked at it carefully, soberly, and that is \nthe clear conclusion to which I have come. I hope we can do better. I \nhope we do better because we must for the American people, because we \nneed to start turning around our completely unsustainable spending and \ndebt situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I didn't come to the floor to comment on what Senator \nVitter just said, and I can sure appreciate his view that a decision \nthat ends up with a $7 trillion addition to the national debt over the \nnext 10 years is not getting us very far down the road compared to what \nthe people of the United States, who have to live within their income, \nbelieve this Congress should accomplish. But a $7 trillion addition to \nthe debt over that period of time, compared to what the President \nsuggested we spend over the next 10 years when he issued his budget to \nCongress, on February 14, we could end up with $13 trillion added to \nthe national debt--so somewhere along the line, between February 14 and \nlast night, when the President announced his support for this \ncompromise, he has come to the conclusion that we could spend $6 \ntrillion less over the next 10 years.\n  Even though a lot of people see this as not making progress, the \nPresident admitted he has found ways of changing his mind about $6 \ntrillion in the course of just a few months. I suppose it also might \nlead our constituents to think in terms of, there has to be something \nwrong with the thinking in Washington if, on February 14, they think we \nhave to spend X number of dollars that will add $13 trillion to the \nnational debt and here it is just 3 or 4 months since then and the \nPresident goes on television and says this is a good compromise and we \ncan be at $6 trillion less in spending. It probably leads people to \nbelieve there has to be a lot of money wasted in Washington, DC, if, in \nfact, between February 14 and last night, the President can find \nconsensus in spending $6 trillion less over the next 10 years. That is \na comment on what Senator Vitter just said and not disagreeing with \nSenator Vitter's comments in any way.\n  When we are in the Senate of the United States talking about what to \ndo about the deficit situation and how much deficit spending we are \nhaving, it probably gets lost in the minds of people that what we are \nspending today and adding to the national debt is creating a great \nlegacy of debt to leave to our children and grandchildren. This debate \naround this issue brings me to this question: Is it fair to tax our \nchildren and grandchildren just because they cannot vote? Our children \nand grandchildren, for the most part, do not have any voice in this, \nexcept what is given by our generation and people representing the \nolder generations, other than our children, making these decisions. \nThat is because we, in fact, are doing just that; taxing our children \nand grandchildren by adding to the national debt. That is what we are \ndoing with our irresponsible budget deficits.\n  We have a choice between a brighter future for our descendants or \nmore social spending now; more social spending or, as President Obama \nmight put it, investments. Any way we look at it, money we spend today \nand we do not pay for, we are putting this bill on future generations--\nour children and grandchildren. This is a choice we should be thinking \nabout as we arrive at a decision of whether to vote for or against this \ngrand compromise that has come out of these negotiations.\n  It gets down to basic choices of what do we do to encourage private \nsector employment. It gets down to choices of what we do about the size \nof government. There is a real choice in this debate as we talk about \nhow big government should be. The choice is, do we grow government or \ndo we grow the private sector?\n  What are the philosophical differences as well as the economic \ndifferences between growing government versus allowing business and \nentrepreneurship to flourish in America? We have had these dramatic \nincreases in expenditures over just the last 2 years; 22-percent \nincreases in appropriations in the last 2 years, when the economy only \ngrows about 2 percent. Everybody knows that is not sustainable. On top \nof that, we had a $814 billion stimulus package that did not do what it \nwas supposed to do to keep unemployment under 8 percent. At this time, \nwe have\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\ngone from the national debt being 35 percent of the gross national \nproduct to today being about 65 percent and before the end of this year \nit is going to be 72 percent. And it is on a path to go to 90 percent. \nSo we have seen government grow during the last few years out of \nproportion to the 20 percent of the gross national product that the \npublic sector, represented by the Federal Government, took, compared to \nthat growth from 20 to now 25.\n  Those 5 percentage points of growth in the government may not seem \nlike a lot but just look at the difference between incentives for \ngrowth of the private sector for creating wealth as opposed to the \nGovernment consuming wealth. That is a fact. Government consumes \nwealth; it doesn't create wealth. People who are using their labor and \ntheir minds and investing are the ones who create wealth in our \ncountry. Those 5 percentage points make a difference because it is a \nvery dramatic growth in government. As government consumes more--and I \nsaid it does not create wealth--it takes money out of the private \nsector, where it can grow more and create jobs and, consequently, then \nlimits the opportunity for expanding the economic pie. That is what the \nprivate sector does through investment and labor, expands the economic \npie. We can have economic growth so we can have more for more people.\n  But when government gets bigger, we restrict the opportunities for \neconomic growth in the private sector and we have less pie for more \npeople.\n  So a 5 percentage point growth in the government for the last 5 years \ncompared to a 50-year average lessens the chance for a brighter future \nfor our children and grandchildren, and that has to be a part of this \ndebate as we decide the size of government versus the size of the \nprivate sector--the wealth-producing private sector.\n  If we keep government at 20 percent, then that is going to leave more \nin the private sector that is going to create wealth. It is going to be \na more productive use of our resources.\n  The promise of our free market system can only be realized if we \nchoose less social spending, if we choose less intrusive regulation and \nmore efficient use of our resources in the private sector as opposed to \nthe public sector.\n  We should be doing those things not only in this budget agreement, \nthis deficit reduction agreement, but in all the decisions we make in \nthe Congress. We should be doing more to encourage productive uses of \nour resources in the private sector, rather than consumption of those \nresources in the public sector.\n  President Obama has launched a campaign over the 30 months he has \nbeen in office to defend the welfare state and of course the woefully \ninefficient government-run health care system that is an example of \nthat welfare state. I think we can learn some lessons from the rest of \nthe world as well in looking at what is right for America. We should \nlearn from history and not repeat the mistakes that have been made in \nother countries.\n  Since the 1950s, we have seen a lot of countries around the world use \ntransfers of wealth from one generation to another or the transfer of \nwealth from one group of people to another. We have seen grants. We \nhave seen a redistributive philosophy in a lot of countries. What did \nthat do? It did very little to raise the living standards of those in \nAsia, Latin America, Africa. More open economies have proven otherwise. \nMore open economies as we have had in Japan since the 1950s have lifted \nmore people out of poverty in 10 years than welfare state programs have \ndone in 50 years.\n\n  Japan--just using it as an example--forced its producers 50, 60 years \nago to compete. Private sector resources are more productive than those \nof the public sector making the decisions on how to use those \nresources, or a command economy, as you might call it. After Japan, we \nhad Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. More recently, in the last \n20 years, China and India have been encouraging more competition and \nmore productive uses of resources with less of it promoted by the \ngovernment. There are more decisions being made by the private sector \nin Brazil, and even parts of Africa are learning that is the route to \ngo. We should learn from that. We should not turn backwards and rely \nmore on government than we have in the past. By doing that, we retire \nopportunity in America. We retire opportunity by growing government at \nthe expense of individual initiative. I hope we don't go that route. I \nthink this budget debate has something to do with whether we are going \nto turn this around from the direction that it has taken over the last \nfew years. Those last few years have not just been the 30 months of \nthis Presidency but a little bit going back into the previous \nPresidency as well.\n  In regard to President Obama's programs, we have had few results from \nthe government becoming more involved in the economy. We have dealt \nwith near zero interest rates for a long period of time. I have already \nmentioned the $814 billion stimulus. There are other things that have \nbeen done in recent months to turn this economy around. We still have \nunemployment above 9 percent. The recovery that was supposed to come \nfrom all of these programs that have had greater government involvement \nin our economy have made a recovery very elusive.\n  In fact, there are even questions in the media recently of whether we \ncould be going into another recession. President Obama tried mightly \nand wastefully--and in the end, very ineffectually--to turn this \neconomy around through a massive number of government programs, but it \nhas not worked. Progress would have been greater if we had tried \nprograms by President Reagan or even President Kennedy's policies. In \nboth of those instances they cut marginal tax rates. They eliminated \nburdensome regulations. Instead, what do we have out there right now \neven today coming from the White House? Promises yet of higher taxes; \nalmost a demand that Congress pass higher taxes right now, and more \nregulations.\n  I just recently read about a businessperson saying there are 29 \nonerous regulations coming out of EPA that will be detrimental to job \ncreation because they are so costly. Another way of putting it is it \nmight cause businesspeople to worry about the uncertainty of what \ngovernment is going to do. When we have that uncertainty--and right now \nthere is a heightened uncertainty--it retards growth. It retards growth \nbecause people will not invest. When there is not increased investment \nand hiring, there is less productivity. What these issues are all about \nis creating jobs, and we are not creating jobs right now. That is what \npeople are going to see as a test as to whether we are out of a \nrecession--regardless of the leading economists who made the decision \nthat we have been out of a recession now for 2 months.\n  For people who are unemployed, it is not a recession; it is a \ndepression. They are going to measure coming out of a recession or \ncoming out of a depression by whether they have a job. Jobs are not \nbeing created.\n  President Obama promises what he wants is something that is fair and \nbalanced. When I hear him talking about ``fair and balanced,'' I wonder \nif he is trying to steal those words from Fox News. Why is it fair to \ndistribute more welfare to the present generation and today's voters by \ngrowing government at the expense of the wealth-creating private \nsector? That harms our children and our grandchildren who are going to \nend up paying for it with less productive uses of the resources of this \ncountry.\n  We should not be thinking, as Europe has thought, about growing \ngovernment, having government consume more of the resources of the \neconomy, leaving less to individuals to make decisions whether to save \nor spend and what to save and what to spend on. That is the way it is \ndone in Europe. We should not go that way.\n  I always use a statistic that may seem so small to be insignificant, \nbut I use a statistic of 1 percent. If we compare the United States \nwith Europe over the last 25 years, our growth has averaged about 1 \npercent more in the United States than in Europe. Now that 1 percent \nmay not sound like very much, right? However, over a generation, just 1 \npercent difference in growth--between the economy of Europe and the \neconomy of the United States--adds up to 25 percent differential in per \ncapita income.\n  It seems to me the issues of this debt reduction debate--or if you \nwant to call it increasing the deficit ceiling, the borrowing capacity \nof the Federal Government--too often tend to be\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\nabout what is the situation right now, but it is really a debate about \nwhat is fair for our children and grandchildren because those are the \ndecisions on borrowing that we are making today.\n  I have to go back to where I started with a question of whether it is \nfair for us to tax future generations for the borrowing that we are \ndoing today, and simply say it is not fair to tax future generations \njust because they cannot vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to say a few words to my fellow \nVermonters and anyone who might be interested as to why I will be \nvoting against this deficit-reduction package when it comes to the \nfloor. The reason is pretty simple. This deficit-reduction package is \ngrotesquely unfair, and it is also bad economic policy. It should not \nbe passed.\n  The wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations \nare doing phenomenally well. In a recent 25-year period, 80 percent of \nall new income created in America went to the top 1 percent who now \nearn more income than the bottom 50 percent. In terms of wealth, the \nUnited States has the most unequal distribution of wealth of any major \ncountry on Earth with the top 400 people owning more wealth than the \nbottom 150 million Americans.\n  When we talk about this deficit-reduction package with the richest \npeople becoming richer, huge corporations making billions of dollars in \nprofits and in some cases paying nothing in taxes, how much are those \npeople--the wealthy and the powerful--asked to contribute toward \ndeficit reduction and shared sacrifice? How much are the rich and the \npowerful going to contribute into this deficit-reduction package? The \nanswer is zero. Not one cent.\n  Meanwhile, as everybody in America knows, we are in the midst of a \nhorrendous recession. Real unemployment is over 16 percent. People have \nlost their homes, their life's savings. We have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty in the industrialized world. Yet this deficit-\nreduction package comes down on those people--the working families, the \nlow-income people, the sick, the elderly, the children. The rich pay \nnothing. Large corporations pay nothing. Yet working families and the \nmost vulnerable people in this country are going to be shouldering the \nburden of deficit reduction on their shoulders. That is immoral, that \nis wrong, that is bad economic policy.\n  Mr. President, as you well know, this is a complicated package, and \nnobody can predict with any certainty exactly what programs will be cut \nand how much they will be cut because the process will kick in to the \nappropriations committees all over, the House and the Senate, and they \nwill go to a supercommittee that will make very significant decisions. \nNobody with certainty can tell exactly what programs will be cut.\n  What we can say is we are looking at up to $1.4 trillion in cuts, and \nvirtually every program that working families depend upon, that our \nchildren depend upon, that the sick depend upon, is on the line.\n  In my State, for example, it gets cold. We have a beautiful State. We \nlove our winters, but it gets cold. It gets 10 below zero, 20 below \nzero. Many people in my State, including senior citizens, desperately \nneed a program called LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, which provides help to many people, including a lot of \nseniors, to help keep them warm when it gets 20 below zero. I fear very \nmuch there will be major cuts in that program.\n  In our State we have done very well in expanding community health \ncenters. We have over 110,000 people now accessing new community health \ncenters, finally being able to get a doctor and dentist when they need \nit. I am going to do everything I can to prevent those cuts. I fear \nthat those programs can be cut.\n  In Vermont, in Connecticut, all over this country, we have a major \ncrisis in childcare. Families want to get into the Head Start Program. \nThey want affordable childcare. Those programs will be cut.\n  In my State, we have a program that helps struggling dairy farmers, a \nprogram called the milk program. It helps them stay in business. I fear \nvery much--and I am going to fight against this--I fear that program \nwill be cut.\n  We have young people today from working-class families hoping upon \nhope that maybe they will be able to afford to go to college. Well, we \ncan expect major cuts in Pell grants and other programs that make \ncollege affordable for our young people.\n  In this country, we have people who are going hungry. We did a study \nrecently. There is more hunger among seniors. Some of those programs \nwill be cut. Affordable housing programs will be cut.\n  So let's not kid ourselves. In the midst of a terrible recession, \nwhen so many people are hurting, so many people are struggling just to \nkeep their heads above water economically, this deficit-reduction \npackage is going to slap them at the side of the head and make life \nmuch more difficult for them.\n  Now, Mr. President, as you well know, this is a two-part program. The \nfirst part calls for approximately $900 billion in cuts, and the second \npart calls for about $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion in cuts. Here is \nwhere it gets a little bit complicated because a supercommittee, made \nup of six Democrats and six Republicans, will have the opportunity to \nlook at everything.\n  As the majority leader said, everything is on the table. Now, what \ndoes that mean? If everything is on the table, Social Security is on \nthe table. What we have heard from our Republican friends, what we have \nheard from some Democratic friends, what we have heard from the \nPresident of the United States is that maybe we should adopt a so-\ncalled chained CPI, which will result in very significant cuts in \nSocial Security benefits. If you are 65 now and that program is \nimplemented, when you are 75, you are going to lose $560 a year, and 20 \nyears from now, when you are 85, you are going to lose $1,000 a year. \nAm I saying that definitely will happen? No, I am not.\n  Social Security will be on the table. Medicare will be on the table. \nMedicaid will be on the table. Everything will be on the table.\n  If that committee ends up not coming to a decision, if they end up \nbeing deadlocked, say, six to six, then we go to a sequestration \nprogram and more cuts will be made.\n  So I would say, when poll after poll after poll suggests strongly \nthat the American people want shared sacrifice--a poll just came out \nlast week from the Washington Post where 72 percent of the people \npolled said they believe folks making more than $250,000 a year should \npay more in taxes in order to help us with deficit reduction. Poll \nafter poll says it is absurd that large corporations get incredible \nloopholes that enable them to make billions of profits and not pay one \nnickel in taxes.\n  So this is a bad proposal. This is an unfair proposal. We can do \nbetter, and we must do better. I do not intend to vote for a deficit-\nreduction package where the sacrifices are being made by people in the \nmiddle class and working class who are already hurting. It is time for \nthe big-money interests to start remembering they are also Americans \nand they should contribute to deficit reduction.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Matthew Olsen\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, later on this afternoon the Senate \nIntelligence Committee is going to vote\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\nout the nomination of Matt Olsen to be the next Director of the \nNational Counterterrorism Center. I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Matthew Olsen to be the next Director of NCTC.\n  Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, we did a lot of self-\nexamination as a government and, putting it simply, realized that \npieces of intelligence that should have been connected had not been or, \nin other words, the dots had not been connected. Congress understood we \ncould not afford another lapse like 9/11, so it created the National \nCounterterrorism Center to analyze and integrate counterterrorism \ninformation across the government.\n  While we have not suffered another 9/11, our record is not perfect. \nFrom the Christmas Day bombing attempt, to Fort Hood, Times Square, and \nthe New York subway plot, the threats to our homeland are very real. At \nthe same time, changing political landscapes and challenges from \nadverse nations require constant attention. In this environment, it is \nessential for NCTC to perform its mission beyond reproach.\n  After the Christmas Day near-bombing aboard flight 253, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee conducted a review to determine where the \nintelligence community could have done a better job of anticipating \nthis attempted attack. Unfortunately, the committee's review showed \nthat NCTC had not lived up to its statutory responsibilities. The then-\nDirector, Mike Leiter, to his credit, took criticism in a very positive \nway and made the right kinds of changes at NCTC to move us in the right \ndirection.\n  While I am encouraged by the progress NCTC has made since then to \nrepair those shortcomings, there is much work that still needs to be \ndone. I believe Matt Olsen has the right background to take the helm of \nthis important intelligence center at this very critical point in our \nhistory. He is no stranger either to the Senate Intelligence Committee \nor to the serious threats that face our Nation. Members and staff have \nworked with him on several high-profile issues over the last few years.\n  As a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the National Security \nDivision, he was responsible for ensuring that our intelligence \nprofessionals had all the legal authority they needed from the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court in order to continue this country's \nsafety. Let me just say this was no easy task and the stakes were high, \nespecially given the political wrangling over FISA and the USA PATRIOT \nAct in recent years. Matt spent countless hours briefing our staff and \nother committees on many highly sensitive FISA issues. In large part \nbecause of his willingness to stick to the facts and not play political \ngames, he has earned the respect of Members on both sides of the \npolitical aisle.\n  For the last year, Matt has served in a very professional way as the \nGeneral Counsel for the National Security Agency, a position that has \nalso put him in close contact, again, with the Intelligence Committees.\n  GEN Keith Alexander, who heads up NSA, provided a letter of support \nfor Matt's nomination. I have also spoken personally with General \nAlexander about Matt. I have a great deal of respect for the general, \nand it speaks volumes to me that he has such high, unequivocal praise \nfor Matt, both as a leader and as a person.\n  Matt's other job--not an enviable one--which brought him in close \ncontact with the committee was his service as the Executive Director of \nthe Guantanamo Review Task Force. I have had numerous conversations \nwith Matt about some of the recommendations made by the task force on \ntransferring what I believe continue to be potentially dangerous \ndetainees.\n  I appreciate that the task force was following a deadline set by \nExecutive order to close Guantanamo Bay. But I believe we have accepted \ntoo great a risk to our national security by transferring many of these \ndetainees to other host countries. The recidivism rate continues to \nclimb. It is today somewhere in the range of 26 percent. We have no \nreason to expect it will stop climbing anytime soon. Our first \nobligation must always be to ensure the safety of the American people, \nnot to transfer dangerous detainees to meet an arbitrary political \ndeadline.\n  Of particular concern to me are the transfers of a number of Yemeni \ndetainees during 2009, when the intelligence community was already \nwarning about the dangerous security situation in Yemen. Of course, we \nall know that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula makes its home in Yemen \nand that several former GITMO detainees now hold high positions in \nAQAP. AQAP was directly responsible for the Christmas Day bombing \nattempt, and their efforts will continue to inflict harm on our Nation.\n  Matt acknowledges the difficulties presented by the Yemeni transfers, \nand he has acknowledged that the task force did not get every \nrecommendation right, just as the previous administration did not get \nevery recommendation right. He also shares my personal view that \nGuantanamo should remain open so that we are not transferring any more \ndetainees as the recidivism rate continues to grow.\n  I appreciate the many conversations and briefings he has had with my \nstaff on those transfer issues. I appreciate his willingness to \ncontinue to discuss these issues and the need for a long-term detention \npolicy even after taking on his new position as NCTC Director.\n  Ironically, in his new position, he will be responsible for tracking \nformer detainees, including detainees whose transfer the task force may \nhave recommended who slipped into their old ways, before they can \nstrike us again. It was in this capacity that Matt had an issue with a \ncolleague, and I have vetted this with Matt and with most of those who \nwere in the room on the occasion the issue arose. While better judgment \ncould have been used, the issue is now behind us. I have impressed upon \nMatt that if he is confirmed as the Director of NCTC, his credibility \nmust be unquestionable. He has confirmed to me that he will always \ncommunicate with Members of Congress fully and openly without political \ncensorship. He also is committed to being totally open and will have an \nongoing dialog with members of the respective House and Senate \nIntelligence Committees.\n  My good friend Senator Kent Conrad, who is actually the home Senator \nfor Matt since he is originally from North Dakota, spoke extensively \nabout Matt's reputation and commitment to public service during his \nconfirmation hearing. Many intelligence professionals on both sides of \nthe political lines wrote letters of recommendation on Matt's behalf.\n  I believe Matt when he tells me he is committed to working closely \nwith Congress and the Intelligence Committees to do the job needed to \nkeep this country safe. I will be supporting his nomination when it \ncomes to the floor, and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate Intelligence Committee just \napproved the nomination of Mr. Matthew Olsen to be the Director of the \nNational Counterterrorism Center, known as NCTC, by a unanimous voice \nvote.\n  The distinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee spoke \non the floor earlier in support of this nomination. I would like to add \nto his comments and offer my support so that the Senate can take up \nthis nomination quickly and hopefully confirm Mr. Olsen before the \nSenate goes on its August recess.\n  I have tried to move quickly on this nomination because the period \nleading up to the tenth anniversary of 9/11 is a period of heightened \nthreat, and one in which all parts of the national security agencies of \nthe government need to be operating at full capacity.\n  Mr. Olsen is currently the general counsel of the National Security \nAgency and has held a number of senior positions in the Department of \nJustice, including at the National Security Division and the Federal \nBureau of Investigation.\n  Let me take just a moment to discuss the current terrorist threat and \nthe role of the National Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC, which Mr. \nOlsen will be leading, if confirmed.\n  The NCTC is the central agency within the U.S. government dealing \nwith the identification, prevention, disruption, and analysis of \nterrorist threats. While it is best known for its role in consolidating \nand analyzing terrorism-related intelligence, the NCTC also plays an \nimportant role in conducting strategic planning for counterterrorism \nactions across the U.S. Government.\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\n  As I mentioned before, I believe that the period leading up to the \ntenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks is a period of heightened threat. \nDespite counterterrorism pressure against al-Qaida in Pakistan--\nincluding the successful strike against Usama bin Laden in Abbottabad--\nthe group remains dangerous and vengeful.\n  At the same time, the threat from al-Qaida's affiliates and adherents \naround the world has increased and presents particular challenges. I am \nespecially concerned about the threat to the U.S. homeland from al-\nQaida in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, as well as threats emanating from \nterrorist safehavens in Somalia and elsewhere.\n  This means, to me, that this is a crucial time for our \ncounterterrorism establishment to be at full strength. And the NCTC is \na linchpin of that establishment.\n  So I am pleased that the President moved quickly to nominate Mr. \nOlsen--an individual serving in a senior intelligence community \nposition today--to take the helm of the National Counterterrorism \nCenter.\n  As I mentioned previously, Mr. Olsen is currently the general counsel \nof the National Security Agency. In that capacity, he has the \nchallenging job of ensuring that the NSA's highly technical and highly \ncapable signals intelligence system is operating fully within the law, \nand using all legal authorities available to it.\n  Before his current position at the NSA, Mr. Olsen served in the \nDepartment of Justice in several capacities for 18 years, including 12 \nyears as a Federal prosecutor.\n  Among Mr. Olsen's positions at the Department of Justice, which has \nbeen the subject of some recent attention, was that of executive \ndirector of the Guantanamo Review Task Force created by Executive Order \n13492. The role of the task force was to conduct a detailed review of \nall of the information available on each of the roughly 240 detainees \nbeing held at Guantanamo as of January 2009.\n  It was Mr. Olsen's job to lead the large, interagency effort of more \nthan 100 national security professionals to compile and analyze all \nintelligence relevant to the detainees, the feasibility of prosecuting \nthem, the ability of a potential country receiving a detainee to \nmitigate the threat the detainee posed, and whether some detainees \nshould be held in long-term Law of War detention.\n  I will say this to my colleagues. Being the director of a large task \nforce making recommendations on Guantanamo detainees is about as \nthankless, as difficult, and as controversial a position that I can \nimagine. Every decision would be reviewed and criticized. But the new \nAttorney General asked Mr. Olsen to take on this job, and he agreed to \ndo it. That is what we admire about career professionals in government \nservice. And we should respect and reward that dedication and \nwillingness to take on the difficult and unpopular jobs.\n  I note as well that Mr. Olsen has been recommended by his current and \npast colleagues in the current and the past administration. The \nIntelligence Committee received letters of recommendation from General \nAlexander, former Attorney General Mukasey, former DNI McConnell, all \nthree former assistant attorneys general for National Security, former \nNCTC Director Mike Leiter, and many others. They have all spoken to his \ncapability and to his character.\n  I believe that Mr. Olsen is well qualified for the position, that he \nwill be forthcoming with Congress, and that he will do a good job in \nleading the NCTC.\n  Prior to serving on the Guantanamo Review Task Force, Mr. Olsen had \nbeen the Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the \nDepartment of Justice as well as the deputy assistant attorney general \nwith responsibility for intelligence matters.\n  He led the Department's effort to update the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, a process that eventually led to the passage of the \nFISA Amendments Act of 2008. In that position he worked closely with \nboth sides of the aisle, and was an invaluable resource as we found a \ncompromise to update important surveillance authorities and strengthen \ncivil liberty protections.\n  Mr. Olsen was also previously a federal prosecutor in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of Columbia, chief of the office's \nNational Security Section, and a special counsel to FBI Director Robert \nMueller.\n  The Intelligence Committee has thoroughly reviewed Mr. Olsen's \nbackground, he has answered all of our questions, and we held a hearing \non July 26 on his nomination. In sum, our due diligence is complete.\n  Now it is up to the Senate to confirm Mr. Olsen so that we do not \nleave the NCTC without a permanent director as we approach the 10th \nanniversary of 9/11.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the agreement that has \nbeen reached between the leaders in the Senate, the House Republicans \nand Democrats, and the President of the United States with respect to \nan extension of the debt limit and certain deficit reduction steps to \nbe taken in conjunction with that action.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that if we fail to act, most \neconomists believe we will face an interest rate spike. For every 1 \npercentage point increase in interest rates, we would add $1.3 trillion \nto deficits and debt over 10 years. If there was only a 200-basis point \nincrease, that would wipe out all the deficit reduction that is in this \npackage.\n  Colleagues need to keep in mind the consequences of our actions and \nhow critically important it is to prevent that interest rate spike.\n  In addition, David Beers at Standard & Poor's, global head of \nSovereign Ratings, made a statement in an interview on CNBC on July 26. \nThe chart is headlined, ``To avoid a U.S. credit rating downgrade, S \nwants to see a bipartisan debt reduction effort.''\n  He said this, specifically:\n\n       We will measure this matter on a number of parameters. One \n     is, is it credible? And credibility, among other things, \n     means to us that there has to be some buy-in across the \n     political divide, across both parties, because politics can \n     and will change going forward. And if there's ownership by \n     both sides of the program, then that would give us more \n     confidence. . . . It is not just about the number. It is \n     about the all-in intent.\n\n  However imperfect this agreement is--and it is imperfect because, \nafter all, it is a work of the hands of men. We are all imperfect. But \nit is critically important. It is important to demonstrate that we can \nwork together to achieve a result.\n  This package contains these elements: First, it prevents a default. \nIt saves the Nation from immediate economic crisis. It creates a \nprocess to allow a debt ceiling increase to 2013, so we don't have to \nreenact this entire episode in just a matter of months. It provides a \n$900 billion downpayment on deficit reduction that is enforced with 10 \nyears of spending caps. It creates a joint select committee of Congress \non deficit reduction, tasked with finding an additional $1.5 trillion \nin savings and to bring us a report before Thanksgiving. This select \ncommittee has a goal of $1.5 trillion in savings as a floor; it is not \na ceiling. This committee could come back to us with an even more \nambitious, more bold proposal to get our fiscal affairs in order. Let \nus hope that it is so.\n  The overall package that is before us--or about to be before us--\nrequires a vote on a balanced budget amendment. The debt ceiling \nincrease is not contingent on its passage, but there is a requirement \nto give colleagues in both Chambers an opportunity to vote. It also \nprotects Pell grants from deep near-term cuts. I think most of us \nunderstand how important Pell grants are to providing opportunities to \nyoung, talented people all across America to improve themselves through \nhigher education.\n  I was raised by my grandparents. My grandmother was a schoolteacher. \nWe called her ``little chief,'' because she was only 5 feet tall. But \nshe commanded respect. She commanded respect because she had character, \nand she told people in our family there are three priorities in this \nhousehold: No. 1 is education. No. 2 is education. No. 3 is education.\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\n  We got the message. I can remember, fondly, her telling us over and \nover: What you put in your head no one can take away. They can take \nyour property, they can take your wealth, but one thing nobody can take \nfrom you is what you have done to improve your mind. That ought to be \nsomething that is taught in every household in our country because it \nis central to America continuing to be a world leader.\n\n  The proposal that will be before us also creates a joint select \ncommittee on deficit reduction. As I have indicated, they have a goal \nof finding an additional $1\\1/2\\ trillion in savings, but they are not \nlimited to that level of savings. They could do more. It is bipartisan \nand bicameral, 12 Members--6 Democrats, 6 Republicans. Congress is to \nhave a report by Thanksgiving on their work. No amendments are allowed \nand a simple majority vote to pass in the Senate and the House.\n  This closely follows the recommendation of Senator Gregg and myself \nfrom 5 years ago to create a commission empowered to bring to a vote in \nthe Senate and the House a plan to get our debt under control and to do \nit so we wouldn't have the endless process our current situation \nrequires. The idea was to create a BRAC-like system, so a proposal \ncould come before the Senate and the House to get our debt down. It is \nmodeled, in many ways, after the reconciliation process that was \ndesigned for deficit reduction and only requires a simple majority \nvote.\n  There is a fail-safe if this committee fails to produce a result. The \nfail-safe is across-the-board cuts in defense and nondefense spending, \nwith exemptions for Social Security, veterans and low-income people and \nit limits the Medicare reductions to 2 percent. I would prefer the \nMedicare reduction not be there because there is no revenue that is \nassured in this plan. But we do have to have a fail-safe. We do have to \nhave some assurance that savings are actually realized, and this \nmechanism does that.\n  I think all of us know our current status finds us borrowing 40 cents \nof every $1 we spend. In fact, we are in a condition in which the \nUnited States is borrowing more than we have ever borrowed before as a \nshare of our national income. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us the long-term outlook is even more sober; that we \nhave a debt held by the public that is about 70 percent now. Right \nhere--the debt held by the public is at about 70 percent. Our gross \ndebt is actually approaching 100 percent, but our publicly held debt--\nthat is debt held by the public, not counting what we owe to trust \nfunds such as Social Security--is about 70 percent.\n  But look where we are headed if we stay on our current course. The \nCongressional Budget Office tells us by 2037 our publicly held debt \nwill be 200 percent of our gross domestic product if we fail to act.\n  How did we get into this circumstance? This says it very clearly and \nvery well. The red line is the spending line of the United States and \nthe green line is the revenue line going back 60 years. What we can see \nis the red line--the spending line--is the highest it has ever been. \nTwenty-four percent of gross domestic product is Federal spending. The \nrevenue line is the lowest it has ever been in that period--the lowest \nit has been in 60 years. Some of our friends on the other side say we \njust have a spending problem. They have it half right. We do have a \nspending problem. Spending is almost the highest it has been in 60 \nyears. But we also have a revenue problem because revenue is the lowest \nit has been in 60 years as a share of our national income. That is a \nfact. So we have to work both sides of this equation.\n  If we go back and reconstruct how we got into this ditch, a story on \nMay 1, 2011, in the Washington Post, is instructive. This is what they \nfound:\n\n       The biggest culprit, by far, has been an erosion of tax \n     revenue triggered largely by two recessions and multiple \n     rounds of tax cuts. Together, the economy and the tax bills \n     enacted under former President George W. Bush, and to a \n     lesser extent by President Obama, wiped out $6.3 trillion in \n     anticipated revenue. That's nearly half of the $12.7 trillion \n     swing from projected surpluses to real debt. Federal tax \n     collections now stand at their lowest level as a percentage \n     of the economy in 60 years.\n\n  This buttresses and confirms the point I just made. In addition, if \none examines our history going back to 1969 and looks at the five times \nwe have balanced the budget, in each of those times, revenue was almost \n20 percent of GDP. Right now--remember what I just said--revenue is \n14.8 percent of GDP. The five times since 1969 we have balanced the \nbudget, revenue was 19.7 percent of GDP in 1969; in 1998, it was 19.9 \npercent; in 1999, it was 19.8 percent; in 2000, it was 20.6 percent; \nand in 2001, it was 19.5 percent. By the way, all these budgets--these \nlast four--were the responsibility of Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton not \nonly balanced the budget, he stopped using Social Security funds to \nfinance other government operations, and he did it with the longest \nperiod of uninterrupted growth in our Nation's history and created 23 \nmillion jobs. The Clinton administration record on deficits, on debt, \non economic growth, and job creation is the best, by far, of all modern \nPresidents.\n  Facts are stubborn things. We have a Tax Code that is riddled with \ntax expenditures. It is riddled with tax expenditures. We are losing to \nthe Treasury $1.1 trillion a year to tax expenditures--tax preferences, \ntax loopholes, tax deductions, tax exclusions. Guess who gets most of \nthe benefit. Twenty-six percent of the benefit goes to the top 1 \npercent of those tax expenditures--those tax loopholes, those tax \npreferences.\n  Here is a quote from one of the most conservative economists in \nAmerica--Martin Feldstein, professor of economics at Harvard, Chairman \nof the Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan. This is \nwhat he said about tax expenditures on July 20 of last year.\n\n       Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce \n     government spending. Eliminating tax expenditures does not \n     increase marginal tax rates or reduce the reward for saving, \n     investment or risk taking. It would also increase overall \n     economic efficiency by removing incentives that distort \n     private spending decisions. And eliminating or consolidating \n     the large number of overlapping tax-based subsidies would \n     also greatly simplify tax filing. In short, cutting tax \n     expenditures is not at all like other ways of raising \n     revenue.\n\n  That is precisely why the fiscal commission and the Group of 6--both \ngroups I was proud to participate in--chose the reduction of tax \nexpenditures as one way of reforming the tax system, improving the \ncompetitive position of the United States, and raising revenue to help \nreduce this debt threat.\n  Anybody who wonders what is happening with respect to loopholes--\nexclusions, deductions, preferences in the Tax Code--doesn't have to go \nany further than this picture I have shown many times. This little \nfive-story building--Ugland House, down in the Cayman Islands--claims \nto be the home of 18,857 companies. What an amazing building that is. \nThis little building, the home to 18,000 companies. They all say they \nare doing business out of this building. Anybody believe that? They are \nnot doing business out of that building. They are doing monkey \nbusiness, and the monkey business they are doing is to avoid paying the \ntaxes all the rest of us pay because the Cayman Islands is a tax haven. \nThey do not impose taxes on these companies.\n  Guess what these companies do. They file returns that show--\nmiraculously--the profits from all their operations across the United \nStates don't show up in the United States. They show up in this little \nfive-story building down in the Cayman Islands. They say that is where \nthe profits are being realized. What a blessing that is because the \nCayman Islands do not impose any taxes on the profits that show up in \nthe subsidiaries of the companies that are doing business all over the \nworld.\n  Anybody who wonders if this is costing all the rest of us huge \namounts of money, here is what our Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations found in a report in 2007.\n\n       Experts have estimated the total loss to the Treasury from \n     offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per year.\n\n  Let me repeat that--$100 billion a year. If there is any doubt about \nthis, go home and Google tax havens. See what you find. I think you \nwill be quite startled by what you see. Continuing the quote from the \nreport:\n\n       Those losses include $40 to $70 billion from individuals, \n     and another $30 billion from corporations engaging in \n     offshore tax evasion. Abusive tax shelters add tens of \n     billions of dollars more.\n  My family and I, we pay what we owe. The vast majority of people in \nthis country pay what they owe. We\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\nhave a few people--unfortunately, it is a growing number and they tend \nto be people with much greater resources--who are not paying what they \nowe. We shouldn't permit it. That should come to a screeching halt.\n  The bipartisan groups proposing comprehensive and balanced plans with \nspending cuts and new revenue include the fiscal commission, the \nBipartisan Policy Center, and the Group of 6. These are the only \nbipartisan plans that have come from anywhere, and all of them \nrecommended a balance between spending cuts and revenue. Almost all of \nthem focused on reducing tax expenditures--the loopholes, the \nexclusions, the preferences, the tax havens--in order to raise revenue, \nto reduce rates, and make America more competitive but also to raise \nadditional revenue to dump this debt.\n  The other day there was a spirited debate on the floor between the \nsenior Senator from Arizona and the senior Senator from Illinois. I \narrived at the end of that debate and didn't have a chance to \nparticipate. There were a number of assertions made there by my friend, \nSenator McCain, and I wish to set the record straight. If we look at \nthe records of Reagan, Bush 41, Bush 43, and Clinton, with respect to \ndeficits, the record is very clear.\n  Here it is: During the Reagan administration, deficits exploded, and \nwe can see on the graph the deficits that averaged about $200 billion a \nyear. During the first Bush administration, the deficits actually got \nworse and ended up still in the range of $200 billion a year. President \nClinton inherited deficits of $200 billion a year, but we can see by \nthe last 4 years of his administration, he was in the black. The \nbudgets were balanced, and for 2 or 3 of those years, he actually \nstopped using Social Security money to fund government operations. \nThen, of course, we see what happened in the second Bush \nadministration: Deficits absolutely exploded--absolutely exploded.\n  The second Bush administration was, by far, the worst on record for \ndeficits and debt of any of these administrations; and, by far, the \nbest was the Clinton administration.\n  But we can look at it a different way. This chart shows, in dollar \nterms, what happened to the debt. We can see in the Reagan \nadministration the debt more than doubled. The Bush administration took \nit up much further. The Clinton administration actually started \nbringing down the debt. President Clinton was actually paying off debt \nduring his administration. Then we saw what happened in the second Bush \nadministration: The debt absolutely skyrocketed, going up well over \n2\\1/2\\ times.\n  Mr. President, when we then look at the record of economic growth \nunder those different Presidents, it is very interesting. Reagan, who \nmore than doubled the debt, had a pretty good record of economic \ngrowth--3.5 percent. Bush 1, who ran the debt up even further, had a \npretty paltry record--2.1 percent economic growth. Clinton, who \nactually paid down debt, had the best record of economic growth--3.8 \npercent on average. Bush 2, who put in place the massive tax cuts that \nballooned the deficits into debt, had the worst record of economic \ngrowth, averaging 1.6 percent.\n  Let's connect the dots. There was a big increase in debt during the \nReagan administration but pretty good economic growth; he took the No. \n2 spot. Bush 1: massive increase in deficits and debt, and economic \ngrowth faltered. The Clinton administration has by far the best record \non deficits and debt and also the best record of economic growth. Bush \n2, who had huge tax cuts never offset by an adjustment, as Reagan did, \nhad the worst record of economic growth.\n  Finally, on job creation, during the Reagan administration, 16 \nmillion jobs were created--quite a strong record of job creation during \nhis 8 years. During the first Bush administration, only 3 million jobs \nwere created. During the Clinton administration--by far the winner on \nthe jobs derby--23 million jobs were created, and he had the best \nrecord of deficit and debt reduction and the best record on economic \ngrowth. Do you know what. He raised taxes and cut spending. Wow. Our \nfriends on the other side said, when President Clinton raised taxes and \ncut spending, it would crater the economy. I was here. I heard the \nmajority leader on that side say that proposal would crater the \neconomy. Republicans repeated that line all across America. The Clinton \nplan to get the deficits and debt down by raising revenue and cutting \nspending, they all said, would crater the economy. They were wrong. \nThen it came time for the Bush administration, and he had massive tax \ncuts, and they all said that would be a huge job creator and fire up \nthe engines of economic growth. They were wrong again.\n  The record is clear. Look at the difference. There were 16 million \njobs created under Reagan, 3 million under Bush 1, 23 million under \nClinton, and 3 million under Bush 2. Clinton had the biggest reductions \nin deficits and debt by far of any of them. He had the best economic \ngrowth, and he had the best job creation. And the second Bush \nadministration comes and they say big tax cuts--that is going to fire \nup economic growth, that is going to fire up job creation. They were \nwrong.\n  When Clinton had a proposal to raise revenue and cut spending, they \nsaid it would crater the economy. Yet Clinton had the best record on \neconomic growth and the best record on job creation. They were wrong \nagain. During the second Bush administration, at the end--has everybody \nforgotten?--we were on the brink of financial collapse. I was called to \na special meeting in this building with the Bush administration's \nSecretary of Treasury, and I, along with other leaders of the House and \nSenate, was told we were days away from a financial collapse. This idea \nthat you can't raise revenue or it will kill jobs, you can't cut \nspending or it will kill jobs has not proven to be right. In the real \nworld, the Clinton administration raised revenue, cut spending to get \nour debt under control, and they had the strongest record of job \ncreation, the strongest record of economic growth of any of the four \nPresidents during that period by far.\n  I would just say I wish I could have participated in that debate last \nnight. I missed it, but I wanted to set the record straight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to talk \nabout the deal the Senate will vote on sometime later tonight or \ntomorrow. Before I do, I want to say to my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee, as always, what an \nexceptional job he has done in laying out fact from fiction, the \nrealities of the choices before us. I only hope that the revenue \npossibilities he clearly expressed exist as part of an equation to a \nsolution could be invoked, but I am concerned based upon what the other \nside says.\n  We have a deal before us that is a result of a manufactured crisis. \nThe debt limit has historically been raised as a matter of course by \nboth Republicans and Democrats, both sides, without conditions. Ronald \nReagan did it 18 times without conditions. George W. Bush did it 7 \ntimes without conditions. But, no, not this time.\n  For days, for weeks, this Congress has been held hostage by a radical \nfew--a band of tea party tyrants--who believe their opinions, their \nvalues, their view of the world, their vision of government must be \nAmerica's vision. It is not. In their world, there is no room for \nreasonable compromise, there is no room for fair and balanced budget \napproaches, the kinds of approaches to budgets I and many on this side \nhave worked for and voted for throughout our careers in Congress.\n  I have voted for balance going in, and I was looking for balance in \nthe final agreement or the hope of balance that the American people \nthemselves have expressed clearly they wanted to see: spending cuts but \nalso ending those tax loopholes and creating revenue.\n  I have voted for $2.4 trillion in cuts in the Reid amendment, with \nthe inclusion of a joint committee process--Senator Conrad was talking \nabout that--that could include revenues, a balanced approach.\n  I have supported increasing the debt limit in a responsible way, a \nbalanced, responsible, fair approach that implements significant but \nresponsible deductions.\n  I voted in 2010 to establish the Bipartisan Task Force for \nResponsible Fiscal Action--the precursor to the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission--to review all aspects of the financial conditions of our \ngovernment, including tax policy and entitlement spending.\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\n  I voted to protect Social Security from being used to balance the \nbudget when it hasn't contributed to our debt.\n  I voted in favor of the Pryor amendment to reduce the budget deficit \nby at least $154 billion with a balanced approach to cutting our \ndeficits that included discretionary spending, entitlements, and \nrevenues.\n  I have supported budget enforcement measures, such as the statutory \npay-go, to pay as you go when you come up with a new idea for spending \nor a tax break, to control both spending and revenues.\n  I led the effort in this Chamber to cut $21 billion in unwarranted \nBig Oil subsidies and supported saving almost $6 billion this year \nalone by cutting ethanol subsidies.\n  I have voted five times in the past to increase the debt limit in a \nresponsible way.\n  But this eleventh-hour deal, with so many strings attached that it \nhas become a tangled web of conservative social values, is nothing more \nthan a concession to the radical right of one party, and it flies in \nthe face of our values as a nation. It would mean drastic and dramatic \ncuts to one side of the ledger, overwhelmingly from nondefense \nspending, and no balance--I repeat, no balance--on the revenue side.\n  I know their suggestion is that the commission can look at revenue. \nYes, it can look at revenue, but that commission which is going to be \nappointed with an equal number of Republicans and Democrats and \nappointed by the leadership in both Houses pretty much tells you where \nit is going to end up.\n  Speaker Boehner has said he won't appoint anyone to the committee who \nwould accept revenue as part of the mix. Senator McConnell has said \nthere will be no new revenue. They get appointments to that commission. \nThat is half of the commission. Even Gene Sperling, the President's \neconomic adviser, said there will be no new revenues for the next 18 \nmonths, which is a clear reflection of what Speaker Boehner and \nMinority Leader McConnell have said.\n  Since they won't accept revenue except maybe in the context of tax \nreform, which the joint committee has said it can't do by the end of \nthe year, which is when this commission is called upon--by \nThanksgiving--to come forth and make a presentation, and we Democrats \nwill have members on the commission who will be responsible and want to \nstrike a deal, we will end up either having to accept the commission's \nspending cuts without revenue, leaving us with trillions of dollars in \nnondefense and entitlement cuts, or automatic sequestered cuts that are \neven more Draconian.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber really believe that the Bush tax cuts for \nthe top-tier, the richest, the wealthiest people--millionaires and \nbillionaires--which will expire in 2012, will be on the table in an \nelection year, that the President will issue a veto threat for those \ntax cuts and make them the hallmark of his reelection campaign? I don't \nthink so.\n\n  While I know that if we go to the automatic sequestered cuts, nearly \n$1 trillion of those automatic cuts will come supposedly from defense, \nwhat guarantees are there that we won't use the overseas contingency \nfund of $1 trillion to meet the defense side of the cuts--the very fund \nwhich Republicans, in the budget passed in the House, put in their \nbudget and which virtually all of my Republican colleagues here in the \nSenate voted on, and they voted on it as cuts. If that isn't the case, \nwhat makes us think that supplemental emergency appropriations won't be \noffered on the defense side while warfighters are in the field, leaving \nus with no real defense cuts but a hard $1 trillion in cuts on domestic \nprograms such as education, student loans, health care, renewable \nenergy, research and development? And the list goes on.\n  For those who suggest that this commission and the threat, the sword \nof those automatic cuts will make people act responsibly, what makes us \nthink that the old paradigm, which I long for, that people will be \nresponsible will take place given what we have seen in which we have a \nmanufactured crisis that has brought us to the verge of an economic \ncrisis that is not only national but international in proportion? If \npeople have been willing to bring us to that point, what makes us think \nthis negotiation as proposed by the legislation will work?\n  They will continue to look for deeper and deeper cuts to those basic \nservices we as a party and as a nation have fought for. We will spend \nthe next year headed into the national decisionmaking that will take \nplace next November forced to debate deeper cuts, refight old battles, \ndebate a balanced budget amendment and the Bush tax cuts, instead of \ntalking about creating jobs, which is what Americans want to see again, \nand helping middle-class families who are struggling to make ends meet.\n  But don't listen to me on that. Listen to Paul Krugman, a Nobel \nPrize-winning economist who wrote today that this deal is a disaster--\nhis words--for the economy. He said:\n\n       Start with the economics. We currently have a deeply \n     depressed economy. We will almost certainly continue to have \n     a depressed economy all through next year. And we will \n     probably have a depressed economy through 2013 as well, if \n     not beyond.\n       The worst thing you can do in these circumstances is slash \n     government spending, since that will depress the economy even \n     further. Pay no attention to those who invoke the confidence \n     fairy, claiming that tough action on the budget will reassure \n     businesses and consumers, leading them to spend more. It \n     doesn't work that way, a fact confirmed by many studies of \n     the historical record.\n       Indeed, slashing spending while the economy is depressed \n     won't even help the budget situation much, and might well \n     make it worse. On one side, interest rates on Federal \n     borrowing are currently very low, so spending cuts now will \n     do little to reduce future interest costs. On the other side, \n     making the economy weaker now will also hurt its long-run \n     prospects, which will in turn reduce future revenue. So those \n     demanding spending cuts now are like medieval doctors who \n     treated the sick by bleeding them and thereby making them \n     even sicker.\n       And then there are the reported terms of the deal, which \n     amount to an abject surrender on the part of the president. \n     First, there will be big spending cuts, with no increase in \n     revenue.\n       Then a panel will make recommendations for further deficit \n     reduction--and if these recommendations aren't accepted, \n     there will be more spending cuts.\n\n  I described before the possibility of getting revenue in that \nequation with the appointments being made by the authorities making \nthem, saying they will appoint no one who will consider revenues. There \nwill be, therefore, even more spending cuts. That is a Nobel Prize \neconomist.\n  No, there is no balance in this agreement, no real compromise. It \nsimply does not force the shared sacrifice the American people have \ndemanded. Oil companies will make $143 billion in profits this year, \nthe Big Five. They will keep picking the pockets of American taxpayers \nwith a ridiculous handout while they earn those billions in profits. \nEthanol millionaires will be off the hook with this deal. There is no \nbalance in this deal. There is no fairness. There is nothing but \nconcessions to the radical rightwing of the Republican Party that is \nholding the American economy hostage, with a gun to its head, \nthreatening to pull the trigger if they don't get their way.\n  Yet no one on the right seems to be happy. They want more. They \nbelieve they have not gotten enough. When is enough, enough? How far do \nwe have to bend before we break? How much do we have to give of our \nvalues, our beliefs, our vision of America? How much do we have to give \nof the promises we have made as a nation to hard-working, middle-class \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet, struggling to pay the bills, the \nmortgage, pay for health care, tuition to put their children through \ncollege, and give them a chance at a better life?\n  How about those whose lives would be shattered except for the \ngovernment's protection? We are their voice. I speak for them when I \nsay this is not a fair deal, but it is the deal before us. What is fair \nis fair, but this plan is not fair to the American people. I cannot in \ngood conscience support a plan where soldiers, seniors, students, and \nworking families must endure trillions in cuts while oil companies, \nbillionaires, corporate jet owners are not asked to pay one cent toward \nshared sacrifice.\n  The Republicans turned a relatively routine vote to meet America's \nobligations into a crisis threatening the world's economy. In response, \nthe Reid plan met them 80 percent of the way by proposing $2.4 trillion \nin cuts, creating a process where a bipartisan commission could find a \nbalanced approach to deficit reductions that would go beyond that and \nthat would meet the\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\nAmerican people's call for shared sacrifice from those who have not \nonly the greatest wealth in the country but also those who seem to have \nthe privilege and the power to fashion the Tax Code in a way that \nbenefits them but doesn't benefit working-class families in our \ncountry.\n  No, that was not enough for the tea party, nor for the party they now \ncontrol. No, instead they have insisted on a process where oil \ncompanies, billionaires, offshore tax havens, and the corporate elite \nare completely protected from making shared sacrifices. That is simply \nnot fair. I cannot support it. The thought that because our soldiers \nwill join seniors, students, and working-class families on the chopping \nblock that Democrats should flock to this plan is wrongheaded. \nEliminating troubled DOD weapons systems is one thing, but across-the-\nboard cuts will punish those who are bravely serving our country in a \ntime of war. Adding these cuts just makes what was a painful plan a \ntotally unfair, unbalanced, and unacceptable plan.\n  I supported the majority leader's plan. I have shown I am serious \nabout deficit reduction. I have supported a fair deal as described by \npeople in New Jersey and across our country, a reasonable deficit-\nreduction plan that truly represents compromise, a deal that fulfills \nthe commonsense idea of shared sacrifice.\n  I know shared sacrifice. This is not shared sacrifice. This is \ncapitulation to a radical fringe of the Republican Party that will not \nbend until they break this economy or get their own way. I have been \nfor deficit reduction. I have voted for fair approaches to deficit \nreduction. I know fairness, but this deal is not fair, and I will not \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the proposed debt \ncrisis agreement. The first thing I would like to do is express my \nappreciation--I think I would actually say empathy to the President, \nthe Vice President, and the bipartisan leadership of both Houses of \nCongress who have had to deal with this enormously significant and \ndifficult problem for our Federal Government because the obvious fact \nis we have worked our way into a very deep hole of debt. When I say \n``we,'' I mean we, all of us--succeeding Presidents of different \nparties, Members of both parties in both Houses of Congress. There is a \ntendency, when you have a problem such as this, to want to point and \nblame everybody else. The truth is, we are all responsible, and we are \nonly going to get out of this hole and get the American government and \nthe American people out of this hole if we work together to solve the \nproblems, just as we have together caused these problems.\n  I saw some numbers recently--I think I have them right; I know I have \nthem almost right--that express very simply what happened over the last \ndecade. In fiscal year 2001, the last year of the Clinton \nadministration, the Federal Government tax revenues--revenues--were at \nabout 19.6 percent of the gross domestic product. Federal Government \nspending in that year was about a point lower, 18.5 or 18.6 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. So you are raising about 1 percent more of \nthe GDP than you are spending, and you have a surplus.\n  What is it now? It is startling how the change has occurred. Spending \nis up close to 25 percent of the gross domestic product, and revenues \nare down to about 15 percent. Now you have a gap of about 10 percent of \nspending, as a percentage of GDP, over revenue, and we have this \nenormous deficit and debt--$14 trillion. If you said to me when I came \nto Congress in 1989 that our government would one day have a debt of \nover $14 trillion, I would have said: Impossible. But here we are. And \nit is growing at $1 trillion a year and more. That is the problem we \nhave.\n  When you think about those percentages I cited, speaking very \nsimplistically, the way we are going to get out of the hole we are in \nis by cutting spending and raising revenues. We would like to do that \nin a way that also gets us back to economic growth. That is the \ncritical third factor. If we are growing economically, the revenue \nsystem we have will raise more money and help us to close this gap.\n  But doing these two things that are critical to solving the national \ncrisis we have--which is to raise revenue and cut spending--is \ndifficult politically, very hard politically. It is not what a lot of \npoliticians think our constituents want us to do. But I think today the \nAmerican people are so anxious about the national debt, so anxious \nabout the economy, and so frustrated and angry with Members of Congress \nthat they would like us to do what is counterintuitive, which does not \nseem like traditional politics, which is to actually do together what \nwill solve the problem--stop the partisan politics, solve the problem. \nThey know we have to cut some spending, we have to raise some revenues, \nand they want us to do it fairly. That is the difficult dilemma the \nWhite House and the bipartisan congressional leadership faced in \ndealing with this problem, and it results in the agreement.\n  I thank the leaders and the White House for the agreement because it \ndoes do some significant things. No. 1, it avoids the unknown risk of a \ndefault for the first time in our history. Some people think it would \nnot be so bad. I do not want to play that game with our economy and our \nfinancial future. I think it would have hurt us. So it avoids that. \nSecond, it does begin to cut some spending and put some caps on. \nThird--and maybe this is the most hopeful--it creates a special joint \ncommittee of Congress to recommend further cuts in this so-called \nsecond tranche of cuts.\n  But it does not do two other things, and as a result, this proposal \nbefore us now is unfair. What doesn't it do? It seems to me that in \nreaching this agreement, each political party yielded to the other \nparty's highest priority political and ideological interest. So this \nagreement does not deal with entitlement reform at all, including \nMedicare reform, which is a priority for Democrats, and it does not \nraise revenues, which is a priority for Republicans. Why do I say it is \nunfair? It is unfair because it sets before us a solution to the \nproblem that only asks of the discretionary spending lines in our \nbudget.\n  What I mean to say here is that discretionary spending in fiscal year \n2010 represented about 35 percent of all government spending. Mandatory \nspending, the so-called entitlements, was almost 60 percent. So 35 \npercent discretionary, 60 percent mandatory. Interest payments were \nabout 5.5 percent. So if you are taking the mandatory spending off the \ntable and you are not going to add any revenues, then you are left with \ntaking all the savings that this agreement proposes to achieve--almost \n$3 trillion, maybe at best $3 trillion--you are taking it all out of \ndiscretionary spending. In doing that, you are going to end up having a \ndevastating effect on our security and I believe on our prosperity and \nalso on our future, on the capacity of our government to take care of \nthose who are most vulnerable and on the capacity of our government to \nhelp the economy grow.\n  To better explain this, I just want to say very briefly, what is \ndiscretionary spending? Well, there is the defense side, which is the \nDepartment of Defense. In some cases in the agreement, it is described \nas security, and that would include Homeland Security and the Veterans' \nAdministration. The nondefense discretionary includes most of what most \npeople see as our government: education, health, administration of \njustice, energy, environment, agriculture, commerce, community and \nregional development, science, space, technology research. All of those \nwill suffer devastating cuts under this proposal because we have not \nbeen able to deal with entitlements, particularly Medicare.\n  Why do I cite Medicare? I believe in Medicare. I think it is a great \nprogram. But, look, it is on course to do two things: One, it is going \nto go bankrupt soon, according to the report of its own trustees, no \nlater than 2024 but as soon as 4 or 5 years from now. The hospital part \nof Medicare is going to go bankrupt. It is not going to have enough\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\nmoney. Why? Because though people put money, through their payroll \ntaxes, into hospital insurance, the reality is that the average \nbeneficiary of Medicare takes $3 or $4 out for every $1 put in. You \ncannot do that and have it be sustained over the long haul. And over \nthe next decade, approximately 20 million more Americans are going on \nto Medicare because of the baby boomer generation. So it is the single \nlargest, fastest growing element of our Federal budget.\n  It seems to me--again, I support Medicare. I voted against the Ryan \nbudget. I do not want to privatize it. But you cannot protect Medicare \nas it is and expect it to stay as it is. You are only going to protect \nMedicare by changing it, and this budget does not touch that at all. I \ncould say more about that, but that is enough for the moment.\n  So the end result of all this is that of the approximately $1 \ntrillion in the so-called first phase or tranche of cuts adopted by \nthis plan, they are pretty much all from discretionary spending, \ndefense and nondefense--Head Start, Pell grants, education, and \ndefense.\n  The second phase is the part that bothers me and really worries me, I \nwould say. The proposal before us sets up a committee, 12 Members of \nCongress equal in terms of party allocation. They have the opportunity \nto deal with the problems that are left out of this and have this be a \nfairer proposal to get America back in balance; that is, to deal with \nthe entitlements and deal with the revenues--tax reform, entitlement \nreform, whatever you want to call it. But will they? And if they do \nnot, if the two parties' priority political and ideological interests \nare reflected in the committee and stop it from dealing with \nentitlements and revenues or are reflected on the floor, then there is \nan automatic mechanism for cutting an additional $1.2 trillion to $1.5 \ntrillion, and that all comes out of discretionary spending, defense and \nnondefense.\n  Some of my other colleagues have come to the floor to describe the \nimpact on nondefense discretionary spending, really most of what we \nknow as government: education, health care, environmental protection, \ntransportation, et cetera, et cetera.\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee. I am on the Homeland Security \nCommittee, privileged to be chair. My priority in my service in the \nSenate has been our national security. I will tell you this: If that \nsequester ever went into effect, it would have a devastating impact on \nthe ability of our men and women in uniform and their leaders to \nprotect our security in what remains a dangerous world.\n  The initial $1 trillion of cuts mandated in this proposal includes \n$350 billion over the 10 years from defense, as I understand the \nnumbers. President Obama had earlier directed the Department of Defense \nto cut $400 billion from their spending over the next decade.\n  The Department of Defense is working on that. GEN Martin Dempsey, \nsoon to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, said he was working on that. He thought he \ncould accomplish it, but it was not going to be easy.\n  He was asked: What would happen if you were demanded to go beyond the \n$400 billion in cuts from defense over the next 10 years? He said it \nwould be extraordinarily difficult and involve very high risk to our \nnational security. He is not against cuts in defense. I am not against \ncuts in defense. But they have to be reasonable because, in the end, \nthe first responsibility of our national government is to protect our \nsecurity.\n  If we do not have security, we do not have anything else. We do not \nhave freedom. We do not have prosperity. We do not have anything else. \nThe world is full of people who want to do us damage, who want to kill \nus, who want to bring down our civilization, who are involved in an \nideological--some sense theological--clash with us. I am just saying \nthat if the joint committee, the special committee, cannot reach \nagreement or reaches agreement and Congress rejects its proposals, \nthere will be an automatic cut in defense of an additional $500 to $600 \nbillion over the next decade. Add that to the $350 billion already in \nthe first phase mandated by this proposal, we have $1 trillion in cuts. \nWe are not going to be protected, as we have to be.\n  It is as simple as that. It is unfair--not only unfair, it is \nirresponsible. Admiral Mullen was in Afghanistan over the weekend. He \nhad a conversation with some of our troops that got a lot of attention \nfrom the media. One of the soldiers got up and said: Admiral Mullen, we \nwere following the debt debate in Congress. Can you promise us we will \nget paid regularly in the coming weeks?\n  Admiral Mullen quite honestly said: I do not know. Because it was not \nclear whether we were going to come to an agreement and avoid a \ndefault.\n  I will tell you, if this full package goes forward and the joint \ncommittee does not reach a different result and recommendation and $1 \ntrillion of cuts are imposed on our national security-Defense \nDepartment budget over the next 10 years, whoever is Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff when this goes into effect--it will be General \nDempsey--he will still be there, fortunately, in January of 2013--when \nthey are asked: Will we get paid, I believe they are still going to \nsay: I do not know. Some of you will. We may have to have a reduction \nin end strength in the force, the number of people we have protecting \nour country. If families of men and women in uniform for the United \nStates ask, if this total package of cuts goes into effect on defense, \nif their families of the military ask: Are our loved ones in uniform \ngoing to be given the equipment to carry out the missions our country \nis asking of them in a way that maximizes their ability to succeed and \nprotects them, I do not think anybody in the military can say yes. I \ncould not say yes, if that was the case.\n  So I am disappointed. I will say one other thing because we are all \nso focused on jobs and the economy. The American military does not just \nprotect our security and advance our ideals, as it does, and live by \nour ideals, as it does, but it also has a tremendous positive impact on \nour economy. It is the American military that is the foundation of an \ninternational system of stability and security that has undergirded, \nthat has been the precondition of the enormous growth that has happened \nin America and a lot of other places in the world, where hundreds of \nmillions, probably billions, of people have come out of poverty because \nthey could rely on the safety of the sea lanes, they could rely on \norder in the world in places such as Asia, Europe, and throughout the \nworld.\n  If the American military is cut as much, in the worst case as this \nproposal would cut it, it is the beginning of the end of America as a \ngreat international power. It is the beginning of the end of this \nsystem of international security that has undergirded our prosperity \nand so much of the prosperity of the world. Which other nation will \nassume the responsibility we have? We have benefitted from it greatly. \nIt is a statement that we are prepared to decline as a country.\n  I come back and say again, that to get us out of the fiscal hole we \nin the Federal Government have put this country into, everybody is \ngoing to have to give. Everybody is going to have to take cuts. That \nincludes defense, and there is a lot that can be cut out of defense. \nBut there is also a lot that has to be changed in entitlement spending.\n  There are people who are getting away with tax loopholes who ought to \nbe paying more in taxes. Everybody has to contribute to solve this \nnational crisis. Right now, this proposal is unfair because it adds \ncontributions, cuts, sacrifice only from the recipients of \ndiscretionary spending, and that means while all of them should be \npaying--should be accepting cuts, they are being asked to take cuts \nthat are unfair and counterproductive to our security, to our liberty, \nto our prosperity, to our morality as a country that has always taken \ncare of people who could not take care of themselves.\n  If these discretionary cuts go into effect, all that will be \njeopardized. So I have come to say this to my colleagues and to say, \nfrankly, that I have not decided how I am going to vote. I understand \nthe proposal does prevent the default, it does begin some process of \ncuts, and it has this committee which offers the most hope.\n  But on the other hand, I see in front of me a mechanism set up which \nI think--if it goes through its conclusion--will have not a net \npositive effect\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\non our future, if the committee's work is not good and accepted by \nCongress, but a net negative effect on America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the debt \nceiling agreement that was reached last night.\n  Over the past week I have heard from countless Minnesotans who want \nCongress to come together and reach a compromise on the debt ceiling.\n  They did not want their interest rates to rise, the value of the \ndollar to fall, or to see their retirement savings decimated again \nbecause some in Washington believe that if they refuse to compromise, \nthe resulting crisis will score them political points.\n  I would like to share with you some of the comments I received from \nMinnesotan's throughout the State.\n  Judy from Rochester writes:\n\n       As senior citizens, we understand where our country is \n     compared to where it has been in the last 50 years or so, and \n     we appreciate that sacrifices must be made. It is almost too \n     far back to remember when people all pulled together, \n     including congress, to solve our corporate issues.\n       . . . all the American people want is for you to represent \n     us and make the best decisions for us . . . using your best \n     judgment. Not prejudice or narrow viewpoint, but the best \n     judgment.\n\n  Paul from Rochester writes:\n\n       This is not the place for partisan political stubbornness. \n     It is the time for our elected officials to work together for \n     the good of the United States.\n\n  Louis from Lakeville writes:\n\n       It is time for all you legislators to put your political \n     affiliations aside and act as Americans and do what is right \n     for all Americans not just those who voted for you. We have a \n     tremendous fiscal mess in this country and we cannot waste \n     time blaming each other. It was jointly created and must be \n     jointly resolved.\n\n  Bonnie from Osseo writes:\n\n       Please put your ideologies aside and work in a \n     collaborative effort to restructure our debt and to give the \n     USA the opportunity to continue to prosper.\n\n  Marla from St. Paul writes:\n\n       It is so frustrating to see the same game of political \n     budgetary chicken playing out at the national level that \n     happened in the state level in Minnesota.\n\n  Tom and Mary from St. Paul write:\n\n       If you wanted to wake us up as citizens, you certainly \n     have. We've been told that if you allow a default, that will \n     cost our 401K to lose $9,000. Our stock portfolio and \n     retirement savings will likely take a 6 percent hit.\n       If ever a situation called for compromise, this is it. \n     Raise the debt ceiling, and not just for 6 months, (Reagan \n     did it many times) but make real promises to deal with the \n     debt, and then make the real fight where it belongs, over the \n     next budget, not paying for our current obligations. Do you \n     really want the Chinese to call in all our debts now? Have a \n     phased, sane plan for bringing down the debt, not a forced/\n     false crisis. We're just hard working Americans trying to go \n     on with our lives. We never write these kinds of messages. \n     This is scary and we won't forget. Get it done please.\n\n  Jake from Minneapolis writes:\n\n       In these upcoming days, as you are faced with difficult \n     decisions, I implore you to work with your colleagues on both \n     sides of the isle to finalize the budgetary issues facing the \n     United States at this time. As a husband who is supporting \n     his wife as she attends a graduate program at the University \n     of Minnesota, I am very concerned about what a default of \n     United States loans would mean in regards to our finances.\n       I am faithfully paying down student loans and my wife and I \n     will begin to pay down the student loans that she has \n     incurred to pay for her education as she finishes her program \n     in May. Paying off loans is never fun; it means cutting some \n     things out of our budget (things that we like such as going \n     out to eat or to the movies) and compromising on difficult \n     decisions.\n       I hope that as decisions are made regarding the financial \n     situations facing the United States you will be a person who \n     reaches across the aisle, with a willingness to compromise \n     and to make difficult decisions.\n\n  Marilyn from Buffalo writes:\n\n       As an independent voter I am asking you to compromise on \n     the budget issue. I am also asking you to use a balanced \n     approach to reduce the budget deficit.\n\n  Jay and Bonnie from Moorhead write:\n\n       We would like to see a timely resolution to both the debt \n     limit issue and deficit reduction by means of genuine \n     negotiation resulting in a nonpartisan compromise which will \n     keep our country financially solvent.\n\n  Kim from Duluth writes:\n\n       I am writing to add my voice to the growing number of \n     citizens worried about Washington's inability or perhaps \n     unwillingness to get done the work you were elected to do. In \n     my opinion as a working class American, I believe we ALL are \n     expected to compromise in hopes that we can further the good \n     work of our nation. I firmly believe all of America needs to \n     be accountable to the economic disaster we have known was \n     approaching these many long decades. So please, in the \n     vernacular, ``suck it up'' and get the job done!\n\n  While no one feels the agreement we will soon vote on is the perfect \nsolution, we are in the bottom of the ninth here, the time has come to \nbreak through the partisan stalemate and pass something to provide \ncertainty so we can move our country forward.\n  This is why I plan on voting for this agreement as it will ensure our \ncountry does not default on our obligations--something that would have \ncaused real pain for Minnesota families and businesses--while also \nproviding a down payment on deficit reduction.\n  Unfortunately, this debate has once again shown we need to change the \nway Congress conducts its own business.\n  I come from county government and I can tell you local governments do \nnot operate this way.\n  Minnesota is home to more Fortune 500 companies per capita than any \nother state. After fielding many calls over the past few weeks from \nbusiness leaders from the biggest businesses in our State, like General \nMills, to the smallest, one, two, three-person operations, they do not \nrun their businesses this way.\n  And there is no doubt, this is not how families balance their \nbudgets.\n  The sooner we can come together to agree on the next stage of this \npackage, the better for our economy and the better for our country.\n  I believe we should look at things such as closing the loopholes for \noil subsidies. I believe we should look at things such as tax cuts on \nthe wealthiest expiring at the end of 2012. These are things that \nshould be in the mix as we move forward.\n  It is time to put our political differences aside to work on an \nagenda that strengthens our economy, promotes fiscal responsibility, \nand increases global competitiveness.\n  If we insist on using the debate as a vehicle for rhetoric only, we \nwill not just be doing ourselves a disservice, we will be cheating our \nchildren and grandchildren out of knowing the America in which we grew \nup.\n  We already know much of what will need to be done. Our failure to act \nhas not been because we lack solutions but because, too often, Congress \nhas lacked the political will to get behind a consensus proposal.\n  In the Senate, we have had this work going on. We have had bipartisan \ngroups of Senators, including the Gang of 6, working together to find a \nsolution. We need to now take that work and make sure that gets \nincluded in the consideration by this committee.\n  It is time for us to work together and tell the American people what \nthey need to hear. We need to show them that Washington isn't broken; \nthat, instead, we are willing to put aside our partisan politics to do \nwhat we were elected to do--to do what is right for America.\n\n\n                        Passing an FAA Extension\n\n  Mr. President, I will turn to another issue I hope we can resolve \nbefore the end of this week, which is to pass an FAA extension.\n  I rise today to speak about the urgent need to pass a Federal \nAviation Administration extension. The Federal Aviation Administration \nnot only keeps our airways safe but it also ensures that our air \ntransportation runs effectively by overseeing grants for critical \nconstruction projects at our airports.\n  As you know, Congress allowed the FAA's most recent extension to \nexpire on July 22. This has resulted in a partial shutdown of the FAA.\n  While the current partial shutdown of the FAA is not affecting the \nsafety of our airways, it is still having some detrimental effects on \nour country's air service.\n  The lack of an extension means the FAA doesn't have the authority to \ncollect the fees and taxes the aviation system needs to fund ongoing \nconstruction and improvement projects at our airports. This is \napproximately $200 million a week.\n  The fees and taxes have nothing to do with the current debt issues we \nhave been debating over the past few weeks. These fees and taxes go \ninto a trust fund that is self-funded and separate\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nfrom the budget that has been in the news.\n  The trust fund pays for construction projects such as a new terminal \nat the Duluth Airport in Minnesota. This new terminal is critical to \nthe Duluth area. The terminal will allow more flights in and out of the \nairport, which is vital as more and more businesses are moving to \nDuluth.\n  Unfortunately, the airport at this time is waiting for a $5.2 million \ngrant that has already been awarded from the FAA. For each day that the \nairport waits to receive its grant money, the risk is higher that the \nairport will be forced to delay the terminal project for 1 year. Why is \nthat? Why can't they go through constructing things in December and \nJanuary in Duluth? It is pretty cold in Duluth then, and it is hard to \ndo the construction, if not impossible. That is why it is so critically \nimportant that we get this money in Duluth immediately. Such a delay \nwill not just be inconvenient, it will cause the cost of the project to \nsignificantly increase.\n  Duluth is not the only airport suffering. Construction projects are \nbeing halted throughout the country. The Associated General Contractors \nestimates that 70,000 construction workers in related fields have been \naffected by this shutdown.\n  I know there are political issues surrounding Congress's inability to \npass an FAA extension. However, these issues have nothing to do with \nthe construction projects such as the Duluth terminal, the 4,000 \nfurloughed FAA employees, or the 70,000 construction workers just \ntrying to make a living.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan work that has gone on in the Commerce \nCommittee and in this Chamber with Senator Rockefeller from West \nVirginia and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas. I continue to \nsupport them in their efforts to get this FAA extension done.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the FAA extension. The lack of one is \nhurting our aviation system and our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the debt ceiling agreement that will soon \ncome before the Senate is a clear and present danger to the fragile--\nindeed, faltering--economic recovery. To say this is the wrong policy \nat the wrong time is a gross understatement. One has to ask the \nquestion: Is anyone paying attention? We just learned economic growth \nfell to a 1.3-percent annual rate in the second quarter. The first \nquarter growth was revised downward sharply to just four-tenths of 1 \npercent--virtually flat.\n  The economy created a meager 16,000 jobs in the month of June--again \nflat, not even keeping up with population growth. Last month, over 25 \nmillion Americans could not find full-time employment. Let me repeat \nthat: over 25 million Americans are effectively out of work. This \nincludes those formally looking for work and those so discouraged that \nthey are no longer looking but want to work. State and local \ngovernments continue to slash funding for jobs at a stunning pace, \ndestroying an estimated 500,000 jobs in the last 2 years. Let me repeat \nthat: In the last 2 years, State and local governments have destroyed \nan estimated 500,000 jobs. Those are consumers too. Those are people \nwho shop and buy cars and clothes and houses and go out to eat at \nrestaurants and things such as that.\n  According to an article in today's Wall Street Journal, in the first \nhalf of 2011, all government spending fell at a 3.5-percent annual \nrate, enough to knock three-quarters of a percentage point off the GDP. \nOn top of this wreckage, this so-called budget deal is proposing to \nslash funding in investment by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years--an \nunprecedented step that will further destroy demand and directly kill \nmillions of public- and private-sector jobs.\n  This is what Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the bond investment \nfirm of PIMCO, said just yesterday on one of the network shows in \nregard to this budget deal:\n\n       Unemployment will be higher than it would have been \n     otherwise.\n\n  Speaking of this budget deal we are talking about, he said \nunemployment will be higher because of it.\n\n       Growth will be lower than it would be otherwise, and \n     inequality will be worse than it would be otherwise.\n\n  He added:\n\n       We have a very weak economy, so withdrawing more spending \n     at this stage will make it even weaker.\n\n  For months now, Washington politicians have been distracted by the \nphony manufactured crisis about raising the debt ceiling. This city has \nbeen obsessed with this. The rest of the country, for a very good \nreason, is more concerned with a far more urgent deficit than the \nbudget deficit. They are more concerned about the jobs deficit--25 \nmillion people out of work. In a recent CBS News-New York Times poll, \n53 percent of the public polled named jobs and the economy as the most \nimportant problem, while only 7 percent named the deficit.\n  So I oppose this misbegotten, misguided deal they have conjured up in \nreturn for raising the debt ceiling. I don't oppose raising the debt \nceiling. I wish to make that clear. I believe we have a constitutional \nobligation to pay our debts and to make good on our debts, as we have \ndone since the Revolutionary War. What I am objecting to is the deal \nthat was put together in order to permit us to perform our \nconstitutional obligation.\n  I oppose it for four reasons: Reason No. 1 is this deal will destroy \nmillions of jobs, as I have said, in both the public and private \nsector. By shutting off Federal funding in investment--a critical \nengine sustaining our sputtering economy--it could easily plunge \nAmerica back into recession.\n  Please read your history, see what happened in 1937 and 1938. We were \ncoming out of the Depression and all of a sudden Congress decided to \ntighten down the screws and plunged us right back into higher \nunemployment.\n  Secondly, I have always advocated a balanced approach to deficit \nreduction, including both spending cuts and revenue increases. This \ndeal--the one we are going to have before us this evening, I guess--\nrejects a balanced approach. It rejects any sense of equity and \nfairness.\n  As my friend, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, said earlier \non the floor: This is not fair. Are we concerned about fairness or is \nthat just sort of passe? Is that something we should even be concerned \nabout, whether something is fair? I think we ought to be concerned \nabout fairness. This is the message that is coming across loudly and \nclearly in the phone calls coming into my office and the e-mails I am \ngetting from Iowa and around the country.\n  This deal offends people's basic sense of fairness--that Congress \nwould slash funding for things such as student loans and cancer \nresearch and Head Start programs and Vista and legal services or cut \nessential funding for seniors--senior volunteer programs, senior \ncenters, and Meals on Wheels--cutting support for people with \ndisabilities, cutting the safety net for a lot of the most vulnerable \npeople in our society, hurting the middle class. We can do that, but we \nsimply can't ask for one more dollar of shared sacrifice from the \nmillionaires and billionaires who have made so much money in the last \ndecade and who have received, thanks to this Congress, huge tax breaks.\n  This deal is not fair.\n  Third, I oppose this deal for the simple reason that I oppose paying \nransom to hostage takers. Since the 1930s, Congress has routinely \nraised the national debt 89 times, including 7 times during the recent \nPresidency of George Bush, and 18 times under Ronald Reagan. Did \nDemocrats hold the economy hostage? Did we say: Oh, no, we are not \ngoing to raise the debt unless you do this, this, this, and this? No. \nDid we filibuster? No.\n  Oh, there is always a skirmish on raising the debt ceiling. Ever \nsince I have been here, for the past 35 years that I have been here, 36 \nyears now, there is always a skirmish on it. But do you know how it has \nalways worked? The majority always has to come up with the votes so \nthere is no default. Well, that is not the way it is working this time.\n  This time congressional Republicans are holding our Nation hostage, \nthreatening to default on our national debt and plunge America into an \nabyss that we don't even know what would possibly happen; that would \naffect our\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\nbond rating for years in the future, affect the interest rates that \neveryone pays on their car loans, their student loans, housing, and \neverything else. They would plunge America into that unless their \ndemands are met.\n  Let's be clear. This is not a negotiating tactic; this is blackmail. \nRepublicans have basically said: We will inflict grievous harm on the \neconomy if Democrats do not meet our demands. Well, President Obama \nsaid it earlier. We are not going to go into default. So with this kind \nof a lopsided deal, the ransom is paid, the hostage is released. But \nwhat a terrible precedent this sets. Make no mistake, Republicans will \nuse these same despicable tactics down the road in the future.\n  Now, if I sound like I am picking too much on Republicans, let me \njust say, with this kind of precedent, I can see a Republican \nPresident--and there will be another one sometime, but I hope not too \nsoon. But there will be a Republican President and there will be a \nDemocratic Congress, and Democrats will use this as a precedent: We \nwill hold it hostage.\n  Is this the way we want to start running our country? What a terrible \nprecedent this sets. It reminds me of the precedent that was set \nstarting back in the 1980s with the use of the filibuster in the \nSenate.\n  Now, I say to the President that I have for years advocated that we \ndo away with the filibuster over a short period of time; that we allow \nthings to be slowed down but not be stopped because of a filibuster. I \ndidn't just say this now; I said it in 1990s. It was right after \nDemocrats had lost control of the Senate and Republicans had taken \nover, and I even advocated doing away with the filibuster then because \nI said it was escalating. It was a tit-for-tat. When the Republicans \nwere in charge, we filibustered; and then when we got in charge, they \nfilibustered, but they added a few more. Then when we got in charge, we \nfilibustered, but we did it a little bit more than what they did. This \nwent back and forth.\n  I predicted in 1995 that if we didn't nip that in the bud, it was \ngoing to get out of hand. Sure enough, it got out of hand. That is what \nI mean. That is what happens. You set a precedent like that, and there \nis no end to it.\n  So I think the precedent that has been set bodes ill for our country, \nnot just for Republicans but for Democrats too.\n  President Obama had an alternative, however, to capitulating to the \nRepublicans' hostage taking and their blackmail. In remarks in the \nSenate on Saturday and many times, I have urged the President to \nrespond to this unprecedented threat by taking the unprecedented action \nunder the 14th amendment to the Constitution of basically eliminating \nthe debt ceiling. I know the occupant of the chair, the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware, has advocated this for some time also. It is \ndeeply regrettable that President Obama preemptively took this option \noff the table.\n  Throughout history, where meaning is unclear, where precedent was \nnonexistent, the American people, through their elected officials and \nthrough their President, have acted boldly to protect the interests of \nthe United States and to save our country.\n  I have heard it said that people around the President at the White \nHouse--well, they got attorneys to weigh in on this and the Justice \nDepartment. I understand that the Vice President said this morning to \nthe House caucus that the authority was unclear as to whether the \nPresident could take such action.\n  Again, I repeat: Where there is no precedent, where the meaning is \nunclear, we can't run across the street to the Supreme Court and ask \nfor an advisory opinion. They don't give those advisory opinions. But \nwhen the country is in a crisis mode and our future is at stake, I \nbelieve the President can act boldly, should act boldly, must act \nboldly, both to prevent the country from falling into a crisis but also \nto prevent this kind of hostage taking, this kind of blackmail that we \neither do it this way or we will not raise the debt ceiling.\n  I pointed out in my speech Saturday, and I point out again, Thomas \nJefferson concluded the treaty with the Louisiana Purchase--and he \nhimself wrote letters, and I have copies of those letters. I have read \nthem, letters to Senator Breckenridge anguishing over whether he had \nthe constitutional right to do this.\n  In one letter he said: I believe Congress is going to have to pass a \nconstitutional amendment and send it to the States for their \nratification before I can do this. But, finally, Jefferson came to the \nrealization that if he didn't take this action, the whole western part \nof the United States at that time might never become part of the United \nStates. Think about that. We might have been facing a part of the \nUnited States that belonged to France.\n  So Jefferson acted boldly. In fact, there were critics at that time \nwho said he didn't have the authority to do that, and they had a vote \nin the House of Representatives, by the way. I think it carried by a \ncouple votes.\n  Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. There is \nnothing in the Constitution that gave him the power or the authority to \ndo that, but he did it. He did it to help save the country and to right \nan egregious wrong.\n  More recently, Franklin Roosevelt--you can read about it in the \nhistory books. In the 1930s, it was clear if we didn't come to the \nassistance of Great Britain, it was going to fall to Nazi Germany--not \nthat they needed our men but they needed our material. They needed the \nkind of material that we could supply in a short amount of time so they \ncould defend Great Britain against Nazi Germany.\n  So Franklin Roosevelt concluded a lend-and-lease program. That is \nwhat it was called, the lend-and-lease program. Even President \nRoosevelt at that time said in his writings he considered this probably \nunconstitutional. But he had to do it to save our country because it \nwas a crisis, and he acted boldly to do it.\n  There was no clear authority for him to do that, but, as I point out, \nthere was no prohibition against him doing that either. There was no \nprohibition explicitly in the Constitution to prohibit Thomas Jefferson \nfrom making the Louisiana Purchase. There was no express prohibition \nagainst Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation. There was no \nexpress prohibition against Franklin Roosevelt signing the lend-and-\nlease deal.\n  So, again, I point out, where meaning is unclear--and in the 14th \namendment the meaning is kind of unclear. But we do have a court case, \nPerry v. U.S., 1935. Read what Chief Justice Hughes wrote in his \nopinion. He said quite clearly that Congress has the power to borrow \nmoney. He said that is a good thing. It may be used to save our country \nsometime. But, he says, Congress does not have the authority to alter \nor destroy those obligations. We cannot alter or destroy those \nobligations once we make them.\n  So as I argued Saturday, and I continue to argue, if Congress either \nthrough action or inaction destroys or alters those debt obligations, \nthen I think it is up to the President of the United States to step \ninto the breach.\n  Is there clear authority for the President to do this? No. I submit \nthere is no clear prohibition against him, either, to do this. So when \nI cast my vote later today against this deal, I am not casting a vote \nto send our country into default. I would not do that. If I thought \nthat my vote was the determining vote to send this country into \ndefault, I would not do that. That is not the way I see it, Mr. \nPresident. The way I see it is even if we turn this down, the President \ncan use his Presidential power and authority to sign an Executive order \ngetting rid of the debt ceiling so that, constitutionally, we make good \non our debt obligations.\n  Read Perry v. U.S. I think you can see it there. So if this deal goes \ndown either in the House or the Senate, the President can act before \ntomorrow to save this country. He may not want to do it, but he should \ndo it. And he should have put that out there a long time ago.\n  Each one of the three cases I mentioned, Jefferson, Lincoln, and \nRoosevelt, three great Presidents, took action to save the country, and \nthey did the right thing.\n  Mr. President, my fourth reason for opposing this deal is because, in \ntruth, it is not about reducing the deficit. First and foremost, this \ndeal is about preserving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks \nfor corporations and the wealthiest in our society. Bear in\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nmind this is the singular purpose and goal of today's Republican Party: \nnot reducing the deficit but preserving and expanding tax breaks for \nthe wealthy. Here is why I say that.\n  Back last December when Republicans demanded the deal to preserve the \nBush-era tax cuts for the wealthy, that deal added a whopping $800 \nbillion to deficits in just 2 years: this year 2011, next year 2012. \nHere we have it. We are being asked to raise the debt ceiling. A big \nportion of that is to pay for tax breaks to the wealthiest just in 2 \nyears because of that deal last December where the Bush-era tax cuts \nwere extended for 2 years, the wealthy can get billions in tax breaks \nfor 2 years. So now what we are being asked to do is to pay for these 2 \nyears' of tax breaks to the wealthiest by slashing funds to the most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  So that is the game here. The game here is to preserve those tax \nbreaks even though we have to slash funding for the most vulnerable.\n  In December, Republicans' No. 1 priority was preserving tax breaks \nfor the wealthy even if that meant adding hundreds of billions of \ndollars to the deficit. So last December Republicans said: We have to \nextend the Bush-era tax breaks for 2 years. That tax bill added $800 \nbillion to our deficit. I didn't hear a peep out of them, not one peep \nfrom the Republicans about the impact on the deficit.\n  Now, in recent weeks and months Republicans have repeatedly rejected \ngrand bargains to reduce future deficits by nearly $4 trillion. Why did \nthey reject the Reid proposal and proposals by the administration and \nothers? Because each one would have required some modest sacrifice from \nmillionaires and billionaires to help pay for those tax breaks they \ngot. Republicans adamantly opposed this.\n\n  In his remarks last evening announcing this debt ceiling bad deal, as \nI call it, President Obama said the result ``would be the lowest level \nof annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was President.'' \nThat bears repeating. President Obama said the result ``would be the \nlowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was \nPresident.''\n  For the record, the American people do not want to take down Federal \nfunding and investment to the level of the Eisenhower years. To do so \nwould be tantamount to repudiating what we have done since then to make \nour country better and more fair, to make our country more of a middle-\nclass society, more a country where people born into poverty can aspire \nto be in the middle class to get a good education, good health care, \ndecent housing, a ``Head Start.''\n  To return to the spending of Dwight Eisenhower would be tantamount to \nrepudiating the Great Society programs. We always hear from Republican \nfriends how the Great Society was a failure, what a failure the Great \nSociety was. I respectfully disagree. Head Start a failure? It was a \nGreat Society program. Medicaid? Of course Medicaid now is exempted out \nof this measure. How about the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \ntitle I, where we have agreed to put money out to the States to help \nlow-income students and schools in poor areas? That is a Great Society \nprogram. How about the Higher Education Act? Student loans help a lot \nof kids go to college.\n  I have here a list of some of the Great Society programs: the Civil \nRights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of 1965; the Age \nDiscrimination and Employment Act of 1967; Job Corps--that is another \none which is going to get slashed because of this, Job Corps; VISTA; \nUpward Bound; food stamps, now called the SNAP program, which enables \nlow-income people to have a decent diet during economic downturns; \nLIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program; the community \naction programs that do so much for the elderly and the poor. I \nmentioned the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965, the Bilingual Education Act to help kids--\nlearners of English as a second language. I mentioned Medicare and \nMedicaid. How about the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Land \nand Water Conservation Act and on and on. I am not going to read them \nall. These are all parts of the Great Society programs. They made our \ncountry what it is today. But, they do cost money.\n  We have cleaner air, cleaner water, better educated kids, better \nhealth care, better cancer research--all kinds of research done at the \nNIH. These programs, along with Social Security, undergird the middle \nclass in our society. They create a ladder of opportunity to allow \ndisadvantaged Americans to work, move upward, and become part of the \nmiddle class. These programs define America as decent, compassionate, \nand, yes, as a great society.\n  The President is sorely mistaken if he believes the American people \nwant to slash the budget to the level of the Eisenhower years and turn \nback the clock on half a century of progress.\n  Mr. President, I hope that is not what you meant. I hope that is not \nwhat you meant. To turn spending back to the level of the Eisenhower \nyears is not a bragging point. That is not something positive. To me, \nthat is a big negative.\n  What we need is to have a better and more fair tax system to pay for \nall the things that make our society great. We are not having the right \ndebate here. We have not had the right debate for a long time. The \ndebate ought to be about what is happening to our society.\n  I just read a recent interview with Bill Moyers. Bill Moyers was \nasked what his greatest fear was. His greatest fear was that we in \nAmerica would accept greater and greater inequality, wealth inequality, \nas the norm; that we would accept a greater and greater inequality as \nnormal. Here is maybe what he was talking about. From 2005 to 2009, the \nmedian net worth of Hispanic households went down 66 percent. The \nmedian net worth of African-American households went down 53 percent. \nThe median net worth of White--Caucasian--households went down 16 \npercent. The median net worth right now of a White--Caucasian--family \nin America is 20 times that of an African-American family and 18 times \nthat of a Hispanic family. This is twice the gap since before the \nrecession, and it is the biggest gap since this data was collected by \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1984.\n  Do you see what is happening? Our country is pulling apart. There are \nfewer and fewer people at the top getting more and more wealth and more \nand more people at the bottom, destroying the middle class.\n  From 2005 to 2009, the median net worth--I keep stressing ``median \nnet worth.'' What that means is you take all the things you own--your \nhouse, car, TV sets, all the stuff you own--and you subtract that from \nall your debts and obligations--mortgage, things such as that for the \nmiddle household with half having more and half having less. The median \nnet worth from 2005 to 2009 of African-American households went from \n$12,124 to $5,677. The median net worth of Hispanic households went \nfrom $18,359 to $6,325. Keep those figures in mind--median net worth of \nAfrican-American households in 2009, $5,677; Hispanic households, \n$6,325. That is their net worth. That is everything. White households, \nin 2009--from 2005 to 2009, the net worth went from $134,992 to \n$113,149. So as of just 2 years ago, the median net worth of White \nhouseholds was, indeed, 20 times that of African-American households \nand 18 times that of Hispanics. Here is Hispanic households: net worth, \n$6,325; median for Whites, $113,149. Again, that wealth, as I say, is \nthe sum of all their assets--their houses, their cars, their bank \naccounts--minus their debts, including mortgages, loans, and credit \ncard debt.\n  The share of wealth? In 1988, the top 5 percent of Americans, in \nterms of wealth, had $8 trillion in assets. That was 1980. In 2010, \nthat top 5 percent had $40 trillion in assets. That is more than 60 \npercent of the national wealth. The other 95 percent of America has the \nremaining 40 percent.\n  Jim Wallis, president of Sojourners, Rev. Jim Wallis, said, ``A \nbudget is a moral document.''\n  ``We are making choices,'' he added, such as whether to cut $8.5 \nbillion for low-income housing or whether to retain a similar amount in \ntax deductions for mortgages on vacation homes for the wealthy.\n  As Senator Menendez said earlier, it is not fair. This is the debate \nand discussion we should be having in America, in the Senate, and in \nthe House. There is this huge disparity in wealth in this country, and \nit is getting worse year by year. Yet our Republican\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nfriends say: Give more tax breaks to those at the top.\n  The American people get it. They understand this. They know there are \nover 25 million of them out of work. They know that wealth disparity is \nopening up a huge gap. The middle class is being destroyed in our \ncountry, and this so-called budget deal is going to make it even harder \nfor anyone to succeed in becoming a middle-class person.\n  I just want to say that the most important thing we can do right now, \nthe single most important thing we can do--I hate to say this--is not \n``balance the budget,'' which is not what we are going to do now--this \nis raising the debt ceiling. That is not the most important thing. \nSlashing government spending is not the most important thing right now. \nThe most important thing is to marshal the forces of the Federal \nGovernment to put people back to work, to get jobs going in our \nsociety.\n  There is a lot of work to be done. There are highways to be built and \nbridges to be built and schools to be remodeled, new technologies, new \npower systems, new clean energy, a smart grid, cleaning up the \nenvironment. Anyone who has suffered through the heat wave in the last \ncouple of weeks knows something is going on in this country. Something \nis going on. We need more clean energy.\n  We need to make sure those children who are born today whose parents \ndo not have anything, whose net worth is so little they don't have \nanything, we need to make sure that they have decent health, that they \nhave early education programs and Head Start Programs. We need to make \nsure that every child has the best school and the best teachers in \nAmerica, make sure that our streets and our neighborhoods are safe so \nfamilies can go out and walk in the evening or at night and feel safe. \nWe need to make sure the food we eat is duly inspected so we can have a \nhigh assurance we are not going to get sick and make sure the drugs we \nneed are available, that the medicines we need, are affordable.\n  There are a lot of jobs that need to be done in this country, and we \ncan put a lot of people to work. That should be the role of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Some people say--I have heard it said many times: Government doesn't \ncreate wealth, only the private sector creates wealth. The government \nconsumes wealth, it doesn't create it.\n  I had a hearing in my committee about a month ago or so, the HELP \nCommittee, and we had the head of the National Institutes of Health \ndown, Dr. Francis Collins. The head of NIH had an interesting story to \ntell. It had to do with the Human Genome Project, mapping and \nsequencing the human gene. We did it. It was a tremendous scientific \naccomplishment. Dr. Collins headed that effort. So we mapped and \nsequenced the human gene. The Batelle organization in Ohio, a research \norganization, analyzed it and said we had to put in taxpayers' money, \n$3.8 billion worth of tax dollars into this. In the last 10 years, the \nprivate sector--because of this research that was done in mapping and \nsequencing the human gene--has put in over $790 billion in investment, \ncreating thousands of jobs all over this country, making huge \nbreakthroughs in the genetic causes of so many diseases and finding \ninterventions to help cure diseases and keep people healthy. Private \ninvestment never would have been done if we had not put $3.8 billion \ninto the NIH to map and sequence the human gene.\n\n  The Interstate Highway System would never have been completed by any \nprivate company. We did, through the power of the Federal Government. \nYou know what. It was not Federal Government workers out there working \non that highway. It was young kids like me. When I was a kid, I was \nworking out on the Interstate Highway System making summer money to go \nto college in the fall. I didn't work for the government; I worked for \na private contractor.\n  There are plenty of jobs that need to be done, and we need to put \npeople to work. That is the single most important thing we can be \nabout. Yet what we are doing, as I quoted earlier, is we are actually \ngoing to make it harder. Economists say the deal could complicate the \ntask of putting people to work. There is broad agreement that the \nUnited States needs to pay down its debts, but most economists say the \ngovernment should have waited a year or more for the economy to \nstrengthen. We sure missed a big window of opportunity to reduce our \ndebt in our strong years when the asset prices were booming. This time \nit is different. Instead we are stuck trying to do it now when the \neconomy is so weak, and we should not be cutting and slashing. We \nshould be investing and putting people to work.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided, \ncounterproductive debt ceiling deal. Let's stop this precedent of \ntaking a hostage of the United States until we get what we want. Mark \nmy word, if we do this, it is going to happen again. Then maybe \nsometime when there is a Republican President and the Democrats are in \ncharge, then the Democrats will turn on the screws and we will hold \nthem hostage for something. It is a terrible way to run a country. It \nis a terrible way to run a democracy.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided, counterproductive debt \nceiling deal. Let's join together to pass a truly balanced approach to \nbring deficits under control, one that first invests in putting people \nto work. Then as the economy begins to grow and the private sector \nbegins to invest, then we start cutting spending, reducing the deficit. \nLet's have a balanced approach that will allow us to continue to invest \nin education, infrastructure, research, and the other things that will \ncreate jobs and boost our economy, that will build the middle class. \nThis bill is a job killer. This debt ceiling deal is a job killer. A \nlot of economists agree with that. We should reject it.\n  Mr. President, you have the pen, and you have the Executive order and \nyou can get rid of that debt ceiling. Take a bold action to save our \ncountry and say: No, we are not going to let any group of Congressmen \nor Senators of any political party take our nation hostage again.\n  I ask unanimous consent the time until 8 p.m. be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, you have only been in the chair for a \ncouple of minutes. I was going to ask you what is going on today, but I \nthink I have a pretty good idea. You and I have spent a fair amount of \ntime discussing and thinking through what we ought to do in light of \nthese big deficits. We had the privilege of serving together as \nGovernors for a number of years. We had a requirement to submit \nbalanced budgets and to balance the outflows and revenues in an ongoing \nbasis. In some cases we had pretty good fiscal controls in place to \nhelp us. The rules were in place to help us, whether constitutional or \nstatutory. In some cases not.\n  Your State and, I think, my State have a reputation for being \nfiscally sound operations. I was elected State treasurer and became \nState treasurer. In 1976 to 1977--as the Presiding Officer has heard me \nsay before--we had the worst credit rating in the country, and we \nmanaged to climb from there until the time when I finished my last term \nas Governor to have a AAA credit rating. I am very proud of that.\n  I am relieved, if you will, that today it looks as though we have in \nplace a course that will enable us to preserve the AAA credit rating \nfor our country and, hopefully, for our States around the United \nStates. One of our members of our caucus said something the other day \nthat really struck a chord with me with respect to deficits and the \ndebt ceiling. He said: We need a solution, not a deal. That is what he \nsaid. He said: We need a solution, not a deal.\n  I could not agree more. I could not agree more. While I am going to \nvote for what has been represented to us probably tomorrow, I do not \nregard this as a solution in the true sense. It is closer to a deal. \nSome may argue whether it is a good deal or a not-so-good deal, but I \nsee it as a deal, not a solution.\n  What is difficult for me is there is a solution out there. There is a \nsolution that a lot of people worked on very hard, including the guy \nwho helped craft the last bipartisan deficit-reduction plan in the \nCongress in 1997, Erskine Bowles, then-President Clinton's\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\nChief of Staff. He worked with a lot of folks--a Republican-controlled \nHouse, a Republican-controlled Senate. One of the people he worked with \nwas a guy named Alan Simpson, a Republican from Wyoming. He was a \npretty good deficit hawk in his day and still is.\n  The two of them and others came up with the deficit-reduction plan \nthat led to several balanced budgets at the end of the Clinton \nadministration. A lot of people forget we actually balanced our budget \na dozen years ago--not just once, not just twice, but several times. We \ncan do this sort of thing.\n  The deficit-reduction plan they came up with then was not just \nrevenues, it was not just spending. I don't think it was just domestic \ndiscretionary spending or defense spending. As I recall, pretty much \neverything was on the table, and they came up with a deficit-reduction \npackage--50 percent revenues and 50 percent spending--and as I said \nearlier managed to balance the budget several times in a row.\n  I like to say there are four ways to balance the budget. The first of \nthose is to cut spending. The second way is to raise revenues. A third \nway is to grow the heck out of the economy. The fourth way is to look \nin every nook and cranny of the Federal Government, including every \nkind of program--defense programs, domestic programs, entitlement \nprograms--and ask this question: Is there a way to get better results \nfor less money or better results for the same amount of money?\n  If we pass this agreement and what is being presented to us that is \nbefore the House this evening, and we actually pass it in the Senate \nand the President signs it into law, we are going to see not the \npromise of the deficit commission's recommendations, which was \ncochaired by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson. We are not going to see \nthe opportunity to reform or overhaul entitlements, to reform the Tax \nCode, to raise some revenues--not by raising taxes but by broadening \nthe base, limiting some of those $15 trillion of tax expenditures. It \nis what it is.\n  One of the things we are going to have the opportunity to do and \nprobably a greater need to do is this: We are going to need to redouble \nour efforts to look at programs--domestic, defense entitlements--and \nask that question: How do we get better results for less money?\n  We have one former Governor, the Presiding Officer, Senator Shaheen \nleaving, replaced by another former Governor, Senator Manchin, now the \nPresiding Officer, who knows what it is like to make these tough \ndecisions. He has had to do them for 8 years.\n  Just as an aside, I would like to say this: There are two Senators \nborn in West Virginia. That is the two of us, two Senators who were \nformer Governors and former chairs of the National Governors \nAssociation. So we share a very special bond.\n  Madam President, I am talking about what could have been and what I \nthink still should have been; that is, the deficit commission's \nrecommendations, which is broad-based and a real solution and not just \na deal. That is not going to happen. Whether we like it or not, it is \nnot going to happen.\n  The question is, What do we do? The suggestion is that we do at least \nmore of what we are already doing; that is, trying to get better \nresults for less money out of the Federal programs, all kinds of \nFederal programs, the kind of thing you and I did as Governors of our \nStates, the kind of thing we are trying to do in the Federal Financial \nManagement Subcommittee which I chair, formerly chaired by Tom Coburn. \nWe work across party lines. It is a pretty good example of how we ought \nto work on how to get things done. Democrats and Republicans on the \nsubcommittee work together. We work on the OMB, we work with the \nGeneral Accountability Office, we work with the inspector generals and \nall of the departments of the Federal Government across the landscape. \nWe also work with nonprofits such as Citizens Against Government Waste.\n  What are we working on? We are working on how to get better results \nfor less money. How do we not just identify fraud, but how do we get \nrid it? How do we put a spotlight on agencies and departments and \nFederal folks who are doing a good job with good results for the money \nthey are spending, and how do we put a spotlight on those who are not \nand make sure we get more good behavior and less bad behavior.\n  Almost everything I do I know I can do better. I think the same is \ntrue of all of us. The same is true with our Federal programs. We have \nto go for it. I like to try to find an opportunity in adversity. Albert \nEinstein used to say in adversity lies opportunity. I have been looking \nat this deal and trying to see where is the opportunity. The \nopportunity is to just do a better job in evaluating performance, \ndemanding high performance, and working hard to get that performance \nand working with the administration and those Democrats and Republicans \nin the Senate.\n  One of the reasons I like the deficit commission's proposal is \nbecause it addresses some of the uncertainty that currently faces the \nbusiness communities in our Nation, whether they happen to be large or \nsmall. I have heard--and I am sure the Presiding Officer has heard--\nfrom all kinds of businesses that one of the things they need from us \nis some certainty, some predictability. Businesses need certainty and \npredictability.\n  I have had any number of CEOs and businesses, large and small, who \nsay to me that the reason we are sitting on a pile of cash and not \ninvesting our money is because we don't know what we are going to do \nwith the budget. We don't know if we will have a default. We don't know \nwhat will happen with the Tax Code. We don't know if we are going to \nhave an energy policy. We don't know if the Supreme Court or if the \nFederal courts are going to overturn the health care reform. We don't \nknow if we are going to do something about our infrastructure, \ntransportation or otherwise. Businesses are reluctant to spend money \nuntil we address those uncertainties.\n  One of the things I loved about the deficit commission's \nrecommendation, refined by the Gang of 6, is they would have addressed \nuncertainty with respect to the spending plan and getting us on the \nright track for deficit reduction. It would have been bipartisan, and \nit would have been comprehensive. It would take a big step toward \nproviding expectations and predictability and certainty with respect to \nour Tax Code, and we could use both of those.\n  I was talking today and listening a little bit to the news, and they \nwere talking about who is winning because of this debate and who is \nlosing. I would like to think that Democrats are not big winners or \nRepublicans are big winners. I hope the American people, the people we \nrepresent, are at least modest side winners.\n  One of the things the President didn't want to do was have us go into \ndefault. He was willing to bargain long and hard in order to avoid \ndefault, and I commend him for that. The President doesn't want to have \nanother debate over the debt ceiling until we get past the next \nelection, and for him that was important. He wants to be able to run \nthe administration.\n  As a Governor, I remember how hard it was for us in Delaware to work \nin the Governor's Office on more than two or three big things at a \ntime. It is hard to do. This administration had their hands full on \nthis issue for months and were unable to work on some of the other \nthings they needed to be doing to help run our country and move us \nforward.\n  The other thing I think is important to the President is he wanted to \nget started or continue on the deficit-reduction side and finding more \nsavings in reduction. He didn't want to slam on the brakes right now. \nIf I could use a car analogy of driving down the road, we have been \ndriving down the road for the last couple of years to try to come out \nof this recession with both feet on the accelerator. What the President \ndidn't want, and what I don't want, is to go from both feet on the \naccelerator to both feet on the brakes.\n  One of the values of the plan that is being presented is that we \ndon't make that transition. We do start tapping on the brake and \neventually we do put the brakes on, but it is not just like that. So \nthere are some things important to the President.\n\n  On the Republican side, they wanted deficit reduction; they wanted it \nto be real, they did not want it to be illusory--neither do we--and \nthey are unwilling to raise any revenues, even by reducing some of \nthose $15 trillion worth of tax expenditures--tax breaks, tax \nloopholes, tax credits, and so forth.\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\nSo we get, I think for the Republicans who are focused on spending and \nwho didn't want to do any kind of revenues, even revenues that were \nbeing provided by dividing the base and lowering the rates, they \nweren't willing to go there. I think, for them, they can maybe declare \nvictory.\n  The question is, How about the rest of us? How about the people who \ndon't work here, the people who don't focus that much on partisan \npolitics, how did they make out? For them, it is sort of a mixed bag. \nIt is a mixed bag. If I were a teacher giving a grade in a class, I \nthink I would assign it incomplete because we have plenty of work to \ndo.\n  This idea of creating this bipartisan committee, joint committee, of \n10 people, 6 Senators, 6 House Members--the total would be 12, 6 \nDemocrats and 6 Republicans, I hope that works. I think--my preference \nwould have been taking the Gang of 6, the people who worked for 1 year \non a deficit reduction plan, which I think is a whole lot better, and \njust make them--if we are going to have a special committee--make them \nthe folks on the committee. That isn't going to happen, unfortunately. \nThey would have been my nominees, my appointees, but it is not my \ndecision to make.\n  But, anyway, we are going to create this joint committee. Sometimes I \nthink if we can't come to consensus on good public policy, what we are \ninclined to do around here is just to do more process. I hope and pray \nthis isn't more process. I hope, at the end of the day, the men and \nwomen who serve on this joint committee will be open to our input and \ncertainly open to the input of some of the Senators, including the \nDemocrats and Republicans who served on the deficit commission and who \nwent on to be a part of this Gang of 6.\n  The last thing I think I want to say is this: A lot of times in \ngovernment--I hope we weren't quite as guilty of this in State \ngovernment as here--but a lot of times in government we focus on \nsymptoms of problems. We don't focus on the underlying disease or the \ncause of the problem. I like to use the patient analogy. The patient is \nexhibiting certain symptoms and sometimes we can look at those symptoms \nand figure what the cause of the problem is and try to cure the \npatient. Here the symptom has been all along the debt ceiling, but that \nis the symptom the patient is exhibiting or is facing. The underlying \ncause of the disease is the way we spend money and raise money. I think \nwe have been treating the symptom--avoiding the default on the debt \nceiling--but I am not entirely pleased that we are curing the patient, \ntaking the steps to cure the patient.\n  That is sort of where I see us. I will close with these words. I see \nSenator DeMint waiting to speak, so I will wrap up. A guy who never \nserved in the Senate, served over in the House, Rahm Emanuel from \nIllinois, Congressman and later Chief of Staff to President Obama for \nhis first couple years, Rahm Emanuel, now the mayor of Chicago, has a \nsaying, and I think it is his original saying. He likes to say: ``Never \nwaste a good crisis.'' Sometimes it takes a crisis around here to get \nsomething done. He likes to say: ``Never waste a good crisis.'' We have \nwasted this crisis, and we should not have done that. We should have \ntaken the bull by the horns. I wish the President had embraced his own \ndeficit commission sooner, more robustly. I wish our own leaders, \nDemocratic and Republican, here and over in the House, had said: That \nis a pretty good idea. Let's give that a shot. Unfortunately, they \nchose not to do that. It was bipartisan. It was bicameral. It is \nunfortunate.\n  But it is what it is. We need to move forward. I just hope colleagues \nwill be given the opportunity to offer a lot of input to this \nbipartisan joint committee that is being created, and maybe, in their \nwisdom, reporting back to us at the beginning of December, there will \nbe some of the elements in deficit reduction that were captured by that \ndeficit commission that are missing in this deal that is before us \ntoday. If that happens, this will have been a better outcome than I \nmight have otherwise hoped for.\n  With that, I yield the floor and yield to my friend from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The last 2 years--2\\1/2\\ years--have been remarkable in a lot of \nways. We have seen a lot of things around our country that are \nbeginning to change the political landscape in Washington.\n  After President Obama's election, with a lot of fanfare and hope \nattached, we saw a lot of changes begin in Washington--a lot of new \nspending with huge stimulus plans that clearly have not worked. We have \nseen a takeover of the health care system and the financial system.\n  But what we saw across America is what encouraged me. We saw millions \nof Americans, from all spectrums of politics, united, coming together \nfor tea party rallies and townhalls. They were concerned about our \ncountry. They were concerned about the spending and the borrowing and \nthe debt. In these groups were liberals and Libertarians and \nIndependents and Republicans and Democrats--people with all political \nbeliefs who knew intuitively, instinctively, in their guts, that, in \nWashington, we couldn't keep spending more than we were bringing in \nwithout bankrupting our country.\n  I joined a lot of those groups around the country, and these were \nhardly radical people. They were commonsense Americans from all walks \nof life who were just concerned about what we were doing in Washington. \nThey wanted us to get control of the spending and debt. We saw a lot of \npeople in Washington ignore what was going on. But across the country, \nmany Republicans, and even some Democrats, were listening to what they \nwere saying and made strong commitments that if they were elected to \nthe House or the Senate, they would come and get control of the \nspending and the borrowing and the debt and try to return to some \nfiscal sanity, some concept of constitutional limited government that \nwe promise people when we take our oath of office and that we would \nstand by it. So we saw many new Republicans come to the House and to \nthe Senate with a commitment to get control of the spending and debt, \nto save our country from this obvious bankruptcy we are headed toward.\n  The tea party was involved with that. It is hard for me to listen to \na lot of the criticism of the tea party and their desire to balance the \nbudget. There is no one tea party. What we are talking about are \nthousands of citizen groups across this country who are being vigilant \nabout their government, which is what our Founders asked them to be. \nThey are not radical people. They are very commonsense people, and they \nunderstand what we are doing in Washington is about to destroy the \ncountry.\n  The tea party is being used a lot to suggest it is a small, radical \ngroup that is controlling some in the Republican Party. Over 70 percent \nof Americans agree with them--that we should balance our budget, that \nwe should cut spending and send a balanced budget amendment to the \nStates to ratify. For every person who says they are part of a tea \nparty, there are hundreds of Americans who feel the same way who share \nthose ideals of constitutional limited government and the concern and \nreal fear that what we have been doing in Washington is taking our \ncountry literally to the brink.\n  It is deeply disturbing to hear the Vice President refer to tea \nparties as terrorists, as he did today, holding a gun to the heads of \nRepublicans and forcing us to make cuts. Clearly, Vice President Biden \nand many here are not listening to what Americans are saying, and they \nare trying to diminish what Americans are saying by suggesting this is \npart of one small group.\n  The President showed right away this year, even after the November \nelection, that he wasn't listening. He sent a budget to Congress that \nincreased the debt another $10 trillion by his measures but actually \nanother $15 trillion if we look at it in any kind of objective way. \nWhen the Republicans in the House demanded that they keep their \ncommitment to cut $100 billion the first year, what did the President \ndo? He said he would meet halfway, at $30 billion. He doesn't think we \nneed to cut anything. He thinks we need to increase spending, and that \nis what he has been doing.\n  This is the second crisis we have had this year. The first was that \nyear's budget, where we came right to the edge of closing the \ngovernment because the President and the Democrats did\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nnot want to cut anything--at least in the negotiations we see. If they \nare going to meet us halfway between 100, they start below zero if they \nend up at 30. They are not with us, and it is hard to negotiate with \npeople who don't understand that we truly do have a problem.\n  Washington, as Senator Rubio said, has a debt problem, but America \nhas a jobs problem. One of the things we need to understand is, if we \ncould stop growing the government, we could start growing the economy. \nMore jobs would mean more tax revenue and less debt. But, \nunfortunately, this President continues to make things much worse. He \nwants to continue to spend and borrow, but he will not take \nresponsibility for his spending. He has failed to lead and he loves to \nblame others. Sure, he inherited some problems--every President does. \nGeorge W. Bush before him inherited a recession. Reagan inherited \ndouble-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates. Yet they moved to \nsolve the problems. The difference is, Obama continues, after 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, to blame others and his policies continue to make things worse.\n  Let's talk about this debt ceiling for a minute, this debt crisis, \nand try to set the record straight. Clearly, President Obama has failed \nto lead in this whole process. We do need to remember, while he is \ntrying to blame others for this debt ceiling problem, that it was a \nDemocratic Congress and the President who signed into law the current \ndebt limit we have. This was not a Republican-created problem that we \nhave. Then, for the last 4\\1/2\\ years, Obama and the Democrats had \ncontrol of spending, so they set the debt limit, and they have spent \nthe money to take us up to the debt limit.\n  We have known for the last 6 months that we needed to deal with this \nproblem. Yet the President submitted no plan at all. He just asked \nCongress to rubberstamp an increase of $2.4 trillion in our debt, to \nborrow another $2.4 trillion, and, he said, with no strings attached. \nHe didn't want to cut anything when this whole debate started--no \nleadership; 6 months, no plan, just speeches, trying to shift the \nblame.\n  He likes to ignore the fact that the House passed a bill that would \nsolve our problem. It was a bill called Cut, Cap, and Balance. It cut \nspending right now, it controlled spending out over the next 10 years, \nand it sends a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to the \nStates to ratify. The response from the Democrats in the Senate and \nPresident Obama was truly astounding. The President says he wants a \nbalanced solution, but he does not want a balanced budget. He has \nactually called us extreme for wanting to balance the budget, and, he \nsaid, we can do our job without a constitutional requirement to balance \nthe budget. We can do a job on America, but we are not doing the job we \nwere sent to do, and we certainly have proved we cannot control \nspending unless it is by law that requires us to do that.\n  Even though this bill passed the House by a large number, with some \nDemocratic support, and it gave the President a $2.4 trillion increase \nin the debt limit but only if we cut spending and controlled it and \ncreated some permanent accountability, we sent it to the Senate, and \nthe leader of the Democratic Party would not even allow it on the floor \nfor any debate because he saw the polls. He saw that already, within \njust a couple days, that 70 percent or nearly 70 percent of Americans \nsupported the approach of cutting and controlling spending and creating \nsome permanent accountability. So it was pushed aside so we could make \nsome more backroom deals, with no transparency, no accountability, no \nleadership.\n\n  I commend Speaker Boehner, Leader McConnell, the Republicans who have \nworked through this process. Dealing with people who will not put a \nplan on the table is very difficult. The Republicans passed cut, cap, \nand balance. Then they followed up with another plan that was not so \ngood, but it was a plan, and it did not even get past the front door in \nthe Senate.\n  For 6 months, no plan from the President, no plan from the Democrats. \nNow we have gotten a deal with a partner who does not want to cut \nspending, after a November election where we were sent here, and the \ncountry pleaded with us to get control of spending, borrowing, and \ndebt.\n  We can look at this deal two ways. There are two realities. From any \nWashington standard, this is a historic sea change in the way we do \nbusiness. Instead of what we were doing last year, where we were \ntalking about how much more we could spend and how much porkbarrel \nbacon we could take home, at least this year we are talking about the \nfact that we need to cut spending. So we can say the deal makes \nprogress in that respect.\n  But in the real world, a dollars and cents world, we have to realize \nour country is on a path toward bankruptcy right now. We are projecting \nadding another $10 trillion or $15 trillion to our debt. No one is \ngoing to lend us that amount of money. We do not have 10 years. This \ndeal does not change that trajectory at all. We will still borrow $10 \ntrillion or more in the next 10 years. We will still add $1 trillion a \nyear to our debt.\n  We cannot call this a debt reduction bill. We can not even call it a \nspending reduction bill. For the next couple years, it hardly cuts \nanything. When we talk about cutting in Washington, we are not cutting \nspending from where it is today; we are reducing the rate of increase \nthat is planned. So it is important we tell the truth to the American \npeople that while this deal may be the best we can do--with the \nleadership in the White House, or lack thereof, as well as the \nleadership, or lack thereof, in the Senate--it may be the best \npolitical solution we can get, but it does not solve America's problem. \nIt certainly does not solve America's job problem, and it does nothing \nbut add another $10 trillion to our debt if we are able to go that far.\n  I will be voting against this bill because I do not believe we have \n10 years to try to get it right. I think it is very likely, over the \nnext year or two or three, that we are going to reach a very real debt \nlimit when no one will lend us any more money.\n  Today, in America, we have to borrow $140 billion a month in order to \npay our regular bills. The people who are adding to that debt every \nmonth think it is extreme to balance their checkbook. It is time we get \nour House in order and force this Congress, by the Constitution, to \nbalance its budget. We cannot continue to spend more than we are \nbringing in and expect to reduce our debt. That is the inside \nWashington mentality.\n  This deal is not a good deal for America. It may be the best deal \nWashington can come up with, with the current leadership, but it puts \nour country at risk. But in a Washington where there is no leadership \nin the White House, there is no accountability, and there is someone \nsitting in the Oval Office who will not take responsibility for \nanything, this may be a deal we have to accept for now.\n  I intend to vote against it because it is important we tell America \nthe truth; that this puts our country at risk. It is time we do what is \nbest for America, not what makes the best deal in Washington. I would \nencourage my colleagues to vote against this deal, even though I know \nthey already have the votes. But I hope when this is passed, we will \nnot think for 1 minute we have solved the problem, we will not try to \nconvince Americans that now we have a few more years to spend and \nborrow without any repercussions.\n  We need to immediately get back to the debate that was getting \nAmerica involved in the last election, which was balancing our budget \nand getting some fiscal sanity in Washington. While we are in desperate \nstraits in our country right now, and we see our economy getting worse \nbecause of the policies of this administration, the good news is this: \nWe can solve this problem with one more good election. That is what I \nam looking forward to: taking my case to the American people and the \ncase they sent us here to make to this Congress, that we need one more \nelection to finish the job they started in 2010. If they want us to get \ncontrol of spending and borrowing and debt, we need a few more good \npeople, such as the House freshmen who have stood their ground on this \nwhole debate and those who have come in here in the Senate and have led \nthe way for a balanced budget. It is that day I am looking forward to \nbecause on that day, we will once again, hopefully, listen to America, \nget our House in order, balance our budget, and do what is best for our \ncountry.\n  I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Dr. Agnes Varis\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I know the Presiding Officer cares \na lot about Dr. Agnes Varis as well, and as soon as I finish speaking, \nI will take the chair so the Presiding Officer may say a few words \nabout her.\n  I would like to say some words about a great American, a wonderful \nNew Yorker, and a dear friend, Dr. Agnes Varis.\n  Sadly, for all of us, Agnes died last Friday, July 29. She fought a \nrelentless disease for more than 2 years. She did not want a funeral, a \nmemorial service or an obituary, but those of us who knew and admired \nAgnes could not allow this passing to go unremarked.\n  Agnes was a miracle worker, and I would like to take a few moments \njust to share a small fraction of the wonderful things she accomplished \nin her life of over 80 years.\n  Dr. Varis was an incredible woman who founded a generic drug company \n40 years ago, when a woman CEO was very uncommon. After great success \nin business, she turned her time and support to people and issues she \ncared about. From her tireless support for affordable drugs to her \ngenerous and unwavering assistance to students, artists, musicians, and \nanimals, Agnes was an angel to so many.\n  Agnes was a woman who did not take no for an answer. She fought for \nbattered women of Bergen County, NJ, helped out music lovers seeking \naffordably priced tickets, supported and cheered on women in politics, \nand generously improved veterinary science and animal shelters.\n  When one met Agnes, one saw she was a powerful woman and a caring \nwoman. She combined both those features in a beautiful human being.\n  She came from humble beginnings, and maybe that is why she never \nstopped making a difference in the lives of those around her. She would \nsee somebody whom she hardly knew and hear about their plight and then \nmove heaven and Earth to help them. She was a generous soul.\n  She knew education, success, and culture were essential ingredients \nto a happy life, and she brought all those gifts and opportunities to \nthousands, if not millions, of people.\n  Dr. Agnes Varis was born in Massachusetts in 1930 and was raised in \nBrooklyn, NY, my hometown. She was the only one of eight children of \nGreek immigrant parents to attend college. She earned her degree in \nchemistry and English from Brooklyn College and later in her career \nattended NYU's Stern School of Business.\n  Right out of school, she took an entry-level job in a chemical \nmanufacturing company that focused on bulk pharmaceuticals and her \nsmarts made her incredibly successful.\n  Agnes was a pioneer and a leader in the pharmaceutical industry. As \npresident and founder of Agvar Chemicals and Aegis Pharmaceuticals, Dr. \nVaris worked tirelessly to increase the accessibility of lifesaving \npharmaceuticals for people in the United States and around the world.\n  She was one of the founders of the modern generic drug industry and a \nkey player in the adoption of the Waxman-Hatch Act of 1984, which \ncreated a streamlined approval process for generic pharmaceuticals. It \nis the reason affordable generics exist.\n  Today, just about every one of us takes generic drugs. They are low \ncost, save people money, and, even more importantly, it makes those \ndrugs accessible to people who might not otherwise afford them. In this \nway alone, Agnes probably saved the lives of hundreds of thousands, if \nnot millions, of people.\n  She was the one who introduced me, along with a few of her friends, \nto the issue of generic drugs and why they are so important. I have \nworked very hard on that issue for over a decade--a decade and a half--\nand it was Agnes always importuning me on.\n  She was always generous, as well as being a skillful and savvy \nbusinesswoman. Nearly 1,000 unemployed service workers who lost their \ninsurance in the aftermath of September 11 got Agvar generic drug plan \ncards, which were good for 1 year, and they gave free generic drug \nprescriptions at any Duane Reade pharmacy in New York City.\n  Isn't that amazing? No one asked her to do this. She heard it \nsomewhere or other that there were people who lost their jobs, and she \nknew they needed drugs, so she bought them a drug card.\n  At the height of the AIDS epidemic in Africa, Agnes helped broker an \narrangement between the Clinton Foundation and an Indian generic \npharmaceutical company to provide affordable AIDS medications to \nAfrican nations at a very low cost.\n  This was written up in all the newspapers but not Agnes's name. She \ndid not want her name out there. She just wanted to do good, help \npeople who needed help, save lives.\n  Agnes and her husband Karl were great music lovers. They loved \nclassical music. Just as she brought affordable drugs to market, Agnes \nsupported the arts and made music and concerts more affordable to all.\n  She donated the Agnes Varis Performance Stage to Jazz at Lincoln \nCenter and sponsored the Jazz Foundation of America's national \neducational children's Jazz in Schools Program, which employs elderly \njazz musicians. Just like Agnes: She knew there were elderly jazz \nmusicians who were out of work and struggling. She knew bringing jazz \nto young children would be a great thing for many of them. She combined \nthe two and just did it. That was Agnes.\n  She was one of the Metropolitan Opera's--in New York City, one of the \ngreatest operas in the world--she was one of its most generous and \nengaging board members. She was committed to bringing opera, typically, \nagain, to the widest possible audience, including those who could not \nafford tickets. In 2006, she funded the enormously popular Agnes Varis \nand Karl Leichtman Rush Tickets program, which offered expensive \norchestra seats for $20, $25--affordable to one and all.\n  In 2009, Dr. Varis was appointed by President Obama to the \nPresident's Commission on the Arts and Humanities.\n  She was a great lady, a rare lady, someone who combined so many \ndifferent attributes and made a powerful impression, even if one only \nmet her for 10 minutes.\n  Agnes, we will miss you. But all your good works and all the \npossibilities and opportunities you made for others will allow your \nspirit to live on.\n  God bless you, Agnes Varis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Ohio\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I only wanted to add my voice to \nyours about Agnes Varis. I appreciate the junior Senator from West \nVirginia giving me a moment or two.\n  I have known Agnes for many years. I worked with her on generic drug \nissues for the last decade--more than that--when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. She had a commitment and a compassion for the underdog \nthat is rare in this world, especially rare for someone as successful \nas she was.\n  I remember years ago hearing her story as a Greek immigrant and with \na mother who actually could not read and write and how Agnes was so \nimportant to that family after her father died when Agnes was a very \nyoung woman--a girl still--and how Agnes went to Brooklyn College and \nwas, I believe, the only woman there at the time.\n  And something else Agnes did--and I apologize to the Senator from New \nYork, now the Presiding Officer, for not hearing all of his remarks. \nAgnes really stepped up after Hurricane Katrina and helped by not just \ngiving some of her wealth to these musicians who did not have jobs \nbecause of the destruction of New Orleans but stepped up and actually \nhired these musicians so they were actually working, not just getting \nhelp from her, hired them to go around to the schools and through much \nof Louisiana and play for students and teach students music and, if \nnothing else for those students who had the musical talent that most of \nus have, which is limited, helped those students appreciate music and \nappreciate jazz. So she was a terrific woman whom I last saw maybe a \nmonth and a half ago. I miss her. I miss her already. I miss her laugh \nand her smile and her\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\nservice not to just New York and New Jersey, where she lived, but much \nof this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you. It is hard to add to the Senator's \nrecognition of Agnes, and also my colleague, the Senator from Ohio. You \ncan tell Agnes touched quite a few of us in so many different ways.\n  Agnes was a friend of mine and also a friend of my family's. She was \na dear mentor to my daughter Heather, who is in the industry. We are \nall going to mourn her passing. Heather introduced me to Agnes about 10 \nyears ago, and from the first day I met Agnes, she was the type of \nperson I always heard my grandmother would say: People don't know how \nmuch you care until they know how much care.\n  The thing about Agnes was it was not how much you had here, but it \nwas what you had in your heart. Agnes was that type of person who was \ntruly remarkable. She lived an astonishing life, Mr. President, as you \nreferred to. She represented the best in our country, and she truly \nlived the American dream.\n  Agnes was a first-generation American and went to college at a time \nwhen few women attended college. She started at the very bottom rung of \nthe chemical industry and worked her way up the ladder to the top. She \nwas truly an entrepreneur. She and her husband Karl loved the arts, but \nthey also took a risk. They took their life savings together of about \n$50,000 to start Agvar Chemicals.\n  Agnes was a fortunate American. She used her wealth to support the \ncauses she most believed in, especially the arts, women's issues, and \ncaring for the workers in New York after September 11 and, as we heard \nfrom our colleague from Ohio, after Katrina.\n  Agnes was always telling my daughter Heather that you can see a lot \nmore from the edge than the middle, and it was the few who were willing \nto be on the edge who created the right middle. That deep and poetic \nstatement is a piece of wisdom many in this country could benefit from \nhearing. Agnes had such a generous spirit, and over the years, my \ndaughter Heather sought her ``agvice,'' as she called it, many times.\n  Our entire family and all of my colleagues, I know, who knew Agnes \nwell are definitely going to miss her. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith her and her family. I am glad we had a chance to honor Agnes on \nthe floor of the Senate. I know she would be so proud. I thank my \ncolleagues for recognizing her also.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request H.R. 2553\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we are entering the second workweek \nof a partial shutdown of the Federal Aviation Administration. I know \nthe Congress, the President, and the American people have been focused \non the debt and deficit crisis, but behind that, and not in the shadows \nto those of us who care about aviation, I want people to understand \nthat what has been happening to the FAA is causing enormous pain \nthroughout the country, and the pain will only grow because of an \napparent shutdown of the attempts to pass the Federal aviation bill, \nprimarily because of the House.\n  Because Congress has failed to pass the 21st short-term extension of \nthe FAA--do you understand what that means? It is simply saying: I \nwould like to have a clean bill of extension. That is all. No policy, \njust a clean bill. Give us another several weeks to work on some of the \ncomplicated issues.\n  So 20 times we have done that over 4 years, and there has been no \nobjection. The 21st time, there is content--suddenly, policy is \ninjected into the request for a clean extension, or the response to the \nrequest. In this time, nearly 4,000 hard-working Federal aviation \nemployees have been furloughed. That means they go without pay. If \nthings follow their current course, as I believe they will, they will \ngo at least another month or more without pay. I do not know how many \nof them continue to stay in their jobs.\n  It has halted critical airport safety capacity and air traffic \ncontrol projects. To be quite honest with you, the whole prospect of \nNextGen, that is, the GPS system of tracking planes and how far they \nare from each other--once we have that like every other industrialized \ncountry, they will be able to land quickly and more efficiently and \nwith fewer delays.\n  They have suspended payments to hundreds of small businesses \ndependent upon reimbursement from contracts they have made with the FAA \nfor their work. So that just stops. Things just come to a dead halt. \nRunways, control towers, whatever--they just stop, and they will stay \nstopped. They will remain stopped, as things are going now, throughout \nthe month of August and the early part of September.\n  They have forgone more than $250 million in aviation tax revenue that \nis critical to supporting our aviation system. That is about $25 \nmillion a day that is meant to go into the airport trust fund that does \nnot, and by the time we return, that will be about $1.2 billion.\n  Very shortly, I will seek unanimous consent to pass a clean extension \nof the FAA, and it will be objected to by the Senator from Utah. In \nsome ways, you can say it is a futile gesture, but it is all I have \nleft. It is all I have left in trying to take this incredible process \nwhich we have been working on, Senator Hutchison and myself, forever--\nforever.\n  With so much damage being caused, you might ask why not all of my \nRepublican colleagues but some of them have refused repeated requests \nto pass a clean extension, some here in the Senate, mostly all in the \nHouse, all of the leadership in the House. So I want to outline how we \nhave, in fact, in my judgment, come to this point.\n  The chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, which is called T and I--that chairman is my counterpart on \nthe Commerce Committee. He has certain jurisdictions, and I have \ncertain jurisdictions. They are not always the same. He is \ntransportation and infrastructure; that doesn't comport exactly with \nthe jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. But in any event, he seems \nwilling to shut down the FAA, you know, is certainly going to stick it \nto the FAA employees, and there will be many more of them by the time \nthis has ended.\n  It is a tragedy that never had to happen. It is a tragedy about ego, \nabout bullying, about an attempt to prove one side would cave. It is \nsort of the worst kind of political bickering the American people are \nso sick of, but this time, they are going to pay a terrible price.\n  They are insisting on antiworker language. It has to do with the \nNational Mediation Board. They know full well this was destined never \nto happen in the Senate. They knew full well the President of the \nUnited States had already said publicly a number of times that he would \nveto anything which contained this kind of language for the National \nMediation Board, basically changing 75 years of labor law.\n\n  To be just a little bit explicit about this because it is \ninteresting, what they want to do is have a system wherein if, when--\nyou are voting to join a union or whatever, and let's say I am a worker \nbut my mother is very sick, so I am at home taking care of her, so I do \nnot vote. The fact that I did not vote does not mean I just did not \nvote; it means I voted no, thus helping the company, thus tilting, in a \nvery odd way, very un-American way, what an election is all about.\n  We have not had a formal conference. Senator Hutchison and I have \nresolved over--and Maria Cantwell, John Thune--we have resolved over \n250 differences between the House and the Senate, and now there are \nonly about 12 that remain to be resolved, all of which can be resolved. \nBut that is of no consequence.\n  I also sent over suggested language for a significant program such as \nthe Essential Air Service Program, 6 weeks ago, to the chairman, \nChairman Mica, that reforms in a way that saves $71 million each year \nfor the 4 years of the bill in the Essential Air Service Program.\n  Six weeks ago, the House passed a clean, short-term extension--the \n20th--like every other extension that has gone on around here forever--\npassed it clean, no policy, nothing in it, just extend it so we have \nmore chances to talk--but then they promptly left on a week tour of \nEuropean and Middle\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\nEastern airports, which made it a little more difficult to talk.\n  Since they returned, I have been told that unless and until the \nSenate accepts House language on their proposed changes to the National \nMediation Board, they would negotiate no further, and that message was \nreaffirmed in the strongest terms this afternoon.\n  You know, this all started with Delta Air Lines. Delta Air Lines is \nout of Atlanta, GA. They do not have any unions. That is their \nbusiness, not mine. They have had four elections. Unions have tried to \norganize four times.\n  Four times the unions have lost. So it would appear their chances are \nnot very good in the future. But that doesn't stop Delta. They want to \nmake sure we put in place a structured system that is out of kilter to \na fair election, and other purposes with other unions.\n  What they then did is sent over an Essential Air Service policy rider \non the extension--unprecedented--with which we didn't agree. Therefore, \nwhen you don't do it in the first place, or if you do it, both sides \nhave to agree before you send it over--and it is easy to say we will \nextend it and include that policy because both sides agreed to it. But \nthey sent over an Essential Air Service program essentially targeting \nrural communities in the States of Democratic Senators. If the House \nwas serious about reforming Essential Air Service, they would have \nstayed at the negotiating table. They would have welcomed the chance to \ncome back.\n  The House-passed extension is not about policy; it is about politics, \nand everybody knows that. So here we are on the eve of the August \nrecess, and we have a choice tonight. We can pass a clean extension and \nput people back to work--all the 4,000 people who are furloughed and \nhave gone through some period of time without paychecks. They would \nautomatically be taken back and life would be as it was before through \nSeptember 16. So that is another month and a half of wages they would \nhave to feed their families, and contractors could go back to work, and \nprojects at airports and related facilities could continue. It is very \nimportant.\n  Aviation is 10 percent of the American economy--the GDP. We have \ninflicted far too much damage on our aviation system for the needs of \none airline--one airline.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow this consent agreement to go forward. \nIt won't. But if you believe in the goal of having an FAA system that \nis funded, and is well, and which can take on the incredible \ntechnological needs that we have to--in particular, the Next Generation \nsystem, which is not just ground-based, but avionics have to be placed \nin every single plane that flies. That is a major undertaking.\n  What they have done by their decision is to take $25 million a day \noutside, away from the airport trust fund. The airport trust fund \ncannot afford that. What I want the airlines to be thinking about over \nthe next number of weeks, until we can get back at this--unless \neverything suddenly changes tonight, but I doubt that--is how they are \ngoing to divide up between themselves the $1.2 billion they will owe to \nthe airport trust fund.\n  I commit to the President of the Senate and my colleagues that I will \ndo everything I can to make sure that not just the $250 million, which \nthey have already vanquished out of the airport trust fund, which we \ndepend upon for everything, but the billion above that. That will \nhappen at $25 million a day, because they didn't want to give up \nanything so they could have their National Mediation Board stacked the \nway they wanted it, and in a most unfair and most un-American way.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 109, H.R. 2553; that a Rockefeller-\nHutchison substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; \nthat the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed; and that \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, for the third time in a week, I must object \nto another short-term Federal Aviation Administration extension. I want \nto make it absolutely clear that a long-term FAA reauthorization is a \npriority for this country, and it is a priority for me. The current \nlapse in FAA taxes and expenditure authority from the Airport and \nAirway Trust Fund is a detrimental situation brought on by the Senate \nmajority's refusal to engage in substantive negotiations on a long-term \nFAA reauthorization bill, which, by the way, did pass the House. \nAdditionally, it is not clear to me that the legislation just offered \nwould avoid a retroactive tax increase on travelers. I didn't set out \nto cause FAA taxes to expire, but reinstating them on a retroactive \nbasis is more than I am willing to subject taxpayers to.\n  As I have already said, I share House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee Chairman Mica's frustration, and the \nfrustration of Republican leadership in both the House and Senate, that \nfavors to organized labor have overshadowed the prospects for long-term \nFAA reauthorization.\n  Last year, the National Mediation Board changed the rules under which \nemployees of airlines and railroads are able to unionize. For decades, \nthe standard has been that a majority of employees would have to agree \nin an election to form a union. However, the new NMB--National \nMediation Board--rules change that standard so that all it takes to \nunionize is a majority of employees voting. This means the NMB wants to \ncount an employee who doesn't vote as voting for big labor.\n  Somehow, organized labor is able to claim that it is democratic to \nappropriate someone else's vote without that person's input and \nparticipation, even though the rule I am talking about has been in \nplace for 75 years. They just changed it in favor of the unions. Unions \nwin--at least the NLRB proceedings. They win 60 percent of the \nunionizing attempts.\n  I personally have not had any communication with anyone in the \nindustry. I am here because I think what the NMB did is absolutely \nwrong, and someone needs to stand up to them.\n  This issue is much larger than the NMB itself, and the airlines and \nrailroads impacted by the NMB ruling. If NMB succeeds, and the \nadministration is allowed to put their thumb on the scale in favor of \nbig labor in contradistinction to 75 years of labor law practice, every \nsmall businessperson anywhere will be at risk.\n  The long-term House FAA reauthorization bill does not create a new \nhurdle to unionization; instead, it restores the longstanding ability \nof airline employees to make decisions for themselves--and not just a \nfew of them but all of them.\n  In a few minutes, I will ask unanimous consent for an amendment that \nincludes NMB language from the original House-passed long-term FAA \nreauthorization, and this whole problem would go away. Again, in a few \nminutes, I am going to ask unanimous consent for an amendment that \nincludes NMB language from the original House-passed long-term FAA \nreauthorization.\n  My critics will point out that both times I have previously asked \nconsent, it has been for legislation that didn't include the removal of \nthe NMB's heavy new hand. However, I have spoken frequently on this \nissue, and I bet my position is very well known. I was hopeful my \nearlier request for consent would stimulate discussion on a long-term \nreauthorization and the issues preventing a long-term reauthorization \nfrom taking place.\n  My concern is that the White House and their allies in Congress will \ncontinue to hide behind a perpetual series of short-term extensions, \nrather than working toward an actual bill. This is why I have decided \nto ask unanimous consent for an amendment containing the NMB language, \nbecause it is clear this is the only way to move this issue forward--by \nNMB language getting the law back to where it really has been for 75 \nyears. As my critics will point out, this wasn't my first choice. But \nas my critics have made clear, this is the only way to actually \nacknowledge and deal with the issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 2553, which was received from the \nHouse; that the Hatch amendment at the desk\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nbe agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read the third time and \npassed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, may I make a further comment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I made one mistake in my remarks--which is very \nunusual. The repeal of the National Mediation Board's decision language \ndid in fact pass the House. I said it didn't. It never passed the \nSenate and has never been debated in the Senate. The committee of \njurisdiction has never brought it up, never had a hearing, and it was \nnot raised during any of the floor considerations in the Senate.\n  I suggest that if we were operating under the rules the Senator from \nUtah wants to see happen, I don't think any of us would be here. I \ndon't think there would be any mayors, Governors, or Senators, because \nmost people don't vote. They would all be voting no. One way or \nanother, we would not be here. It is ludicrous.\n  I regret very much that this card is being played. I regret even more \nthe fact the business community and the airline community, in \nparticular, led by Delta, was so quiet during all of this.\n  I got a message in the middle of this afternoon that the American \nTransportation Association, which is a legacy of the big airlines \nassociation, and Delta in particular, wanted to pass a clean bill of \nextension.\n  Well, that doesn't work, Mr. President. It is so easy to say we would \nlike to have it passed. But it is much too late to do anything about \nit. There are no phone calls. The whole thing is really a sham. It is \nvery painful, and potentially very threatening, to West Virginia. I \ntherefore object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have not wanted to pursue this \nissue, because the debt ceiling issue has absorbed all of the air in \nthe room and in the United States, as it should; it is a huge priority. \nBut I have to set the record straight a little bit about how this came \nabout.\n  First, I agree with the House position. I would reverse the NMB \ndecision because I think it is wrong. However, what happened here is \nthat, after 20 extensions of the FAA bill because of disagreements on \nseveral issues, the House decided to put this one--well, actually, to \nbe honest, the House didn't even bring up NMB; they put another issue \non the extension language, and it is the Essential Air Service \nlanguage, which we have been trying to negotiate but have not yet come \nto a full agreement on among all of the parties. It is really the NMB \nissue that is causing the House to shut down the FAA. So the entire \nFAA--not the air traffic controllers, thank goodness but 3,492 \nemployees of the FAA have been shut down, and this affects 35 States. \nThey are on furlough without pay, through no fault of their own.\n  And interestingly, airports that were in the midst of building \nrunways or adding to their infrastructure or repairing their \ninfrastructure also have had work stoppages because of the House \naction. The Associated General Contractors of America has estimated \nthat 70,000 construction and related jobs are at risk because the House \nput an Essential Air Service amendment on a clean extension of the FAA.\n  Mr. President, I want the House position to prevail. But we are \ngetting ready, in the next day or so, to leave probably for the month \nof August and then come back after Labor Day. We should not shut down \nthe FAA because of a rider put on the extension of the FAA legislation \nthat has not been negotiated.\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, the House has not even appointed conferees. \nThe chairman of the House committee has not called a meeting of the \nchairman of the Senate, plus the two ranking members. There has been no \nfull negotiation with the principals. Yet the House put this extraneous \namendment on the bill, and the FAA is shut down and the lives of 70,000 \npeople are at risk.\n  We got a letter from Boeing because they are trying to get their new \nBoeing 747-8 certification, but the workers are not there to do it. So \nin addition to the work stoppages--and the FAA has now issued a total \nof 219 stop-work orders across the country--we also are seeing the \ncertification of a great new airplane also on hold. That may start \ndisrupting the capability for the airlines that have purchased these \nplanes to be able to start flying the airplanes and upgrading their \nservices.\n  This just does not make sense. We are going to lose $1 billion in the \naviation trust fund if we leave this Congress for the month of August \nand we don't extend the FAA--$1 billion of revenue paid by passengers \nin a ticket tax. They are paying it, but it is just not going to the \naviation trust fund. It is going to the airlines in the form of a \nhigher ticket price. It should be going to the aviation trust fund \nbecause that is what we use to build the runways and to make the \nrepairs and to keep our airports operating. So we are going to lose $1 \nbillion in revenue.\n  Here we are, on the brink of cutting spending and raising the debt \nceiling and trying to put our fiscal house in order. Yet we are going \nto let $1 billion be lost that rightfully should go to the aviation \ntrust fund. The users are going to pay for it anyway, and that money is \ngoing to have to be made up. How is it going to be made up? It is going \nto have to come from general revenue because contracts have already \nbeen let. That money is going to have to be spent.\n  I cannot think of anything more fiscally irresponsible than to tax \nthe users, not put it in the aviation trust fund and have to replace \nthat money at some point.\n  I am a fiscal conservative, and I am trying to make the cuts that are \nnecessary, trying to do the things that are right. But I have to \nquestion those who are saying we are going to not be for essential air \nservice--which has a total budget of about $200 million--but we are \ngoing to waste $1 billion to not let a bill go through that keeps the \naviation trust fund and the FAA going. That just doesn't add up.\n  If we are going to be sincere about the wise use of our taxpayer \ndollars, I don't think it is right taking money from people who are \ntraveling on the airlines and who are thinking that money is a ticket \ntax to pay for airport infrastructure when, in fact, it is going into \nthe airlines' pockets, and then having the taxpayer make up that money \nbecause these contracts have already been let. Is that fiscal \nresponsibility?\n  Here we are on the eve of trying to show fiscal responsibility and do \nthe right thing for our country. I don't think so, Mr. President. It \ndoesn't pass the smell test.\n  I hope my colleagues, before we leave--and the House of \nRepresentatives and the people who are supporting them in the Senate--\nwill relent and let the FAA keep operating. Let's come back in the \nmonth of September and negotiate an FAA bill as we normally do in this \nCongress. If we can't come to an agreement, then, on the NMB--and I am \ncertainly going to support changing the decision that was made--maybe \nwe can talk harshly and throw down the gauntlet, but not without any \nnotice, adding it to this FAA extension without ever negotiating on it. \nThat is not the way we ought to operate. It is enough to make the \npeople of our country think: You know what. We expect better. We expect \nbetter, and I expect better.\n  I cannot believe my colleagues would let the FAA shut down and \njeopardize 70,000 jobs and take money from airline travelers--when on \ntheir ticket it says ticket tax for aviation trust fund--and defraud \nthem because that tax is not going to the aviation trust fund. Is that \ngoing to make the people of our country believe Congress is doing the \nright thing? It doesn't pass the smell test.\n  It is time for the airlines of this country to stand up and say: We \nneed a clean extension of the FAA, and we need for the House and Senate \nto meet, as we normally do, in a conference and take up the issues. As \nI said, I am going to support the reversal of the NMB decision, and I \nam going to support a reform of essential air service in the context of \nnegotiating perimeter rule and other issues that are in contention, \nwhich is the honorable way to\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\nproceed. But I don't feel very good right now about what the Senate is \ndoing in supporting the House in an irresponsible position that is \ndefrauding the airline passengers of this country right now because \nthey are collecting a ticket tax that is not going to the aviation \ntrust fund.\n  It is wrong, Mr. President. I hope in the next few hours our \ncolleagues will come to their senses, do the right thing, pass a clean \nextension, and send it to the House, where I hope they, too, will act \nso that we can have a conference committee and work out the issues with \nhonor and integrity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the anguish of my dear friend \nfrom Texas, and I don't disagree, except for one thing. The tax is not \nbeing charged, and that should be a savings to the customers and \nconsumers who are using the air services. But whether it is or isn't, \nthat takes away from the major issue, and there may be another issue on \nessential air service, I don't know, because I am not on these \ncommittees. I have been asked by our leadership to make these \nobjections.\n  What is important here--and it is not some itty-bitty little thing--\nis that we have labor law regulators out of control. When the NMB--the \nNational Mediation Board--which is run by a bunch of Democrats--comes \nout and does away with 75 years of labor law with just the stroke of a \npen and makes employee votes not important, that is not some little \nitty-bitty issue. That is a big-time issue.\n  For 75 years unions have been winning union elections by getting a \nmajority of the employees in a firm, not by getting a majority of those \nwho vote. Those other people, whether they vote or not--and they may be \nsick, they may be ill, they may not have been able to be there, they \nmay have been out of town--their votes are important as well. The \nunions have always had to get a majority, and they have done that year \nafter year after year in most situations and in most union elections.\n  Let me give an example: Let's say you have a company with 1,000 \nemployees and only 100 show up, and 51 of them vote for the union. Is \nit right to bind all 1,000 employees in the company itself when only 51 \nout of the 1,000 employees have voted for it? Of course, it is not. \nThis is a very important issue.\n  All those who propose getting this long-term extension, or even a \nshort-term extension, have to do is correct the National Mediation \nBoard. Get union elections back to where a majority of employees are a \nrequisite in order to have a union, and I don't think there would be \nany problem in solving this problem. It would be solved in a \nnanosecond.\n  Now, maybe this essential air service language is something that \nmight cause problems. Well, I would suggest both sides get together and \ntry to resolve those issues. But this is not some little, small issue. \nThis is a big issue.\n  It even becomes bigger when you consider the National Labor Relations \nBoard, run 3-to-1 by Democrats, and the President will not appoint the \nrecommended Republican to make it an even 3-to-2, so it is 3-to-1. They \nare running ramshackle fast over labor laws in this country. This kind \nof oppressing is something they will do, if they can, in a nanosecond. \nThey have been saying they are going to do it. They have been trying to \nenact card check for years. In fact, they have been trying to enact \nlabor law reform--which I fought back in 1977 and 1978--for years so \nthey can give the unions a decided advantage that should not be given \nunder any circumstances in union elections.\n  If this gets through--the NMB--then what would stop the National \nLabor Relations Board, which handles millions of employees--millions of \nemployees--from doing the same and continuing to do things that are \njust outrageous, like they are doing? They are usurping the ability of \nthis legislature, the Congress of the United States, to run these \nissues the way they should be run. They should not be acting as a \nsuperlegislature, enacting laws from a partisan board to do these \nthings.\n  This is not some little issue. This is a big issue. I wish I wasn't \nin the middle of it. I just happened to be here one day when I was the \nlast one here, and I had to object. But I knew when I did object it was \nthe right thing to do under the circumstances.\n  If we allow these boards to usurp our powers of the legislative \nbranch of government and do anything they want to do because they have \na supermajority--a superpartisan majority--then this country can't \nlast, and the freedoms we all value will not last.\n  The freedoms we all value won't last. I don't want to see anybody not \npaid. I don't want to see anybody not be able to do their job. But, by \ngosh, I don't want to see a runaway National Mediation Board, either, \nor a National Labor Relations Board that will use a precedent such as \nthis in ways it really shouldn't be used. So these are not small \nissues.\n  I hope we can get together. I hope the two committees will get \ntogether and resolve this issue. I am not on either of the committees. \nI am just someone who around here has had to stand up on some of these \nlabor union issues--not against unions. I am one of the few persons in \nthis whole Congress who actually earned a union card and became a \nskilled tradesman and worked for 10 years in the building construction \ntrade union, and I am proud of it. But I have to say that I am going to \ncall on both sides to get this problem solved and get rid of allowing \nthe National Mediation Board to usurp the powers of the legislative \nbranch of government and get the law back where it was, where it is \nmore fair and where it makes sense. If we do that, I don't see why this \nwould be held up for 10 seconds.\n  So I call on both sides to try to resolve this issue. I don't feel \ngood being in the middle of it just because I happened to be on the \nfloor at the wrong time. All I can say is that, having gotten in the \nmiddle of it, as much as I love and admire the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas and appreciate and admire and love my friend from West \nVirginia--and I do--this could be resolved, and there is no reason we \nshouldn't resolve it. This is an important issue, and all I can say is \nthat I would like to help get it resolved, if I can, and if I can, I \nwill. But both sides have to get together, and that includes both sides \nof Capitol Hill. I think this problem could be resolved, but these are \nnot little issues.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, and I \nappreciate his passion for the issue. I agree with him on the issue.\n  The way for us to get together and resolve it is to have a conference \ncommittee, to have the conferees appointed on the House side. The \nconferees are appointed on the Senate side already, and we are ready to \nnegotiate this bill. And I am going to be for the same position as the \nSenator from Utah because I don't think NMB made the right decision. I \nthink it is a terrible overstretch, overreach of that board to change \nthe law or change the regulation about what is a union election. I \nthink they are wrong.\n  But we cannot solve the issue with the House sending an extension of \nthe FAA with a rider that is completely separate from that issue. NMB \nis not in the rider, it is not in the rider at all, but that is the \nissue everybody is negotiating unilaterally here. The House has sent \nover a bill that has an essential air service amendment that also has \nnot been negotiated, but what they are negotiating on is the National \nMediation Board. Well, if that is confusing, there is a reason--because \nit is confusing.\n  So why don't we unconfuse and have a conference committee the way we \nnormally do here, and let's hash out these issues. If we would have a \nchance to actually have a conference, negotiate all the issues, and \nthen if someone is not satisfied, there are procedures that are \nhonorable to blow up a bill that you don't like, but it is not \nhonorable for the House to send an extraneous amendment on an FAA \nextension and shut down airports that are being repaired and built in \nour country, jeopardizing an estimated 75,000 jobs, jeopardizing the \ncertification of a major new airplane that wants to get out there and \nstart being used and an aviation trust fund that will lose over $1 \nbillion because we are not collecting the tax, and the airlines are \npocketing\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nthe money by having a higher ticket charge, mostly. They may not all be \ndoing that, but most of them are. That is just not right, and we are \ngoing to have to make that up because there are contracts pending that \nare going to have to be paid for.\n  It is not fiscally responsible, and it is not honorable, and it is \ntime for us to pass a clean extension of the FAA. Let's negotiate until \nSeptember 30, and then, if we can't agree, we won't sign a conference \nreport and it won't come back. I will stand there and not sign a \nconference report, but it is kind of hard to do that if you are not \ndoing the right thing by sitting down and talking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Before the distinguished Senator from Texas leaves the \nfloor, I wish to express my appreciation for her bipartisanship in \nworking through this difficult issue.\n  Everyone understands that the labor issue is something that is \noverhanging this very important piece of legislation, but it shouldn't \nbe hanging over an extension of the bill. Tens of thousands of people \nare not working because of this. Actual safety of our airports is a \nconcern to me. FAA is doing everything it can to make sure it is safe \nand sound, but 4,000 people who work for the Department of \nTransportation are off work, in addition to the tens of thousands of \npeople who have construction jobs. We have a new airport control tower \nin Las Vegas being constructed. They worked about 2 weeks, and they are \nnow all laid off. It is not fair.\n  This extension should go forward and be resolved in conference with \nthe other body. It is so unfair. But this is not the last word. There \nwill be more said about this. This is wrong.\n  We are going to be leaving town leaving up to 80,000 people who are \nconstruction workers out of work. We need those jobs. I can't stress \nenough how much we need those jobs. So it is too bad.\n  I do thank my friend, the Senator from Texas, for being so forward-\nleaning on this and not being partisan. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Chair lays \nbefore the body the House message to accompany S. 365, I be recognized \nto move to concur in the House amendments; that the time until noon, \nTuesday, August 2, be for debate on the motion to concur, equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; that at noon, the \nSenate proceed to vote on the Reid motion to concur; that the motion to \nconcur be subject to a 60-vote threshold; that no amendments, points of \norder, or other motions be in order to the message prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Senators, it is my intention to \nhave the Chair lay before the Senate the House message to accompany S. \n365 at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, August 2. There will be no rollcall \nvotes tonight. The first one will be tomorrow at noon.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we do have a financial crisis in our \ncountry. The debt limit we will be considering tomorrow is the \nthermometer, the canary in the coal mine that tells us we are at a \ndangerous level. For example, we have reached it faster and at higher \nlevels than we ever have, the result of which is that our debt rise is \ntelling us we have to raise our debt limit. Those things happen \nperiodically, but this one would be the largest debt limit increase in \nour history. We have never had such a surge.\n  The deficit for this single fiscal year ending is expected to be $1.5 \ntrillion. The largest deficit President Bush ever had, and it was \nlarge, was $450 billion. The last 2 years have been $1.2 trillion, $1.3 \ntrillion, and this year it is expected to be $1.5 trillion. Under the \nPresident's budget, we will go from interest on our debt this year of \n$240 billion to $940 billion in the tenth year. That is for a single \nyear.\n  For example, our education and transportation budgets have greatly \nexpanded. Spending $940 billion on interest will crowd out tremendous \nportions of the good things we would like to do with taxpayers' money. \nInstead of being able to improve our infrastructure or do other things \nwe think could be good, we will be sending that money to debtholders \nabroad to pay them back for the money they have loaned us that we have \nbeen spending now. As I speak, 42 cents of every dollar we spend will \nbe borrowed.\n  This is a very real situation. I have always felt that we have a \nresponsibility to be honest with our constituents, and we are going to \nneed to raise the debt limit. It places too much risk on our economy \nnot to raise it. But I want to share some thoughts about why I am \nuneasy about the legislation that is before us and why I will not be \nable to support it.\n  I have been warning for months now that we are heading to a situation \nin which we will have a last-minute, eleventh-hour bill; that the \nSenate will be asked to pass it without adequate time to review it; \nthat other bad items could be included in this debt limit increase. \nAdditionally, it is not the kind of process we need to pursue.\n  Our Democratic leadership decided they did not want to bring up a \nbudget. They instructed the Budget Committee chairman--of which I am \nthe ranking member--not to bring up a budget. When asked about it, the \nmajority leader said it would be foolish to have a budget.\n  We have gone now 824 days without a budget under the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate at a time when we have had the largest deficits \nin American history. At this extremely important time we do not have a \nbudget. They said it would be foolish to have a budget. My questions \nis, Why would it be foolish? Because, if you pass a budget--and one can \nbe passed with a mere 50 votes. It is given an expedited procedure. It \ncannot be filibustered, it is guaranteed a vote in 50 hours, but you \nhave a right to file amendments. When you file and get a vote on \namendments, then people are held accountable for their yea or nay.\n\n  We have had a lot of people say we would like to do more. Maybe if we \nhad a budget we would have had a chance to vote on spending.\n  The problem is a decision was made that it would be too difficult to \nexecute the normal, regular order in the Senate, to bring forth a \nbudget and actually have amendments filed and Senators do what they are \npaid to do. I think that is particularly problematic in light of what \nhappened in the last election. The American people are not happy with \nus. They rightly believe that Congress cannot justify a situation in \nwhich 42 cents of every dollar we spend is borrowed. Congress cannot \njustify a $1.5 trillion deficit this year. People are not happy about \nthat. I have been to town meetings and people say: You work for me. I \nam not happy.\n  You have seen that on television in the last election. It was a \nshellacking for those who thought that business as usual ought to \ncontinue in the United States of America; that money could just be \nborrowed, borrowed and spent, and when the problems hit we would just \nraise taxes on the American people and they would have to pay for our \nspending binge. People are not happy with this.\n  They were demanding, among other things, accountability. They were \ndemanding that we in Congress be responsible for what we do. We should \nbe transparent and willing to answer at home for what we had done. That \nis a fair request in a great Republic such as ours. I have been \ncritical of the absence of a budget. We will not vote on one.\n  We had the Reid proposal and the Boehner proposal and finally this \ncompromise proposal. Our colleagues, the Democratic majority, brought \nup the House budget so they could vote it down. It was a historic \nbudget. They did it publicly. They voted on the floor. There were \namendments. The House plan reduced spending by as much as $6 trillion. \nThey changed the debt course of America. I would have liked to have \nseen them go further because even that plan to alter the debt \ntrajectory of America, bringing down our deficits, still did not \nbalance in the 10th year.\n  People say the House was radical and they did strange things. Not so. \nRead that budget. It was an honest budget based on good numbers. It \nchanged the debt course of America. But even that,\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nas I said, did not go as far as we really need to go.\n  The House did its bit and we did nothing in return. Now we get to the \npoint where the debt limit, August 2, is upon us and we are supposed to \nvote. This morning at 3 a.m., apparently, legislation was finally put \ntogether. It was brought forth to the floor of the Senate. We will vote \non it tomorrow morning, maybe noon, after a couple of hours of debate \ntomorrow. I am really uneasy about that. I am uneasy about what is \ncontained in it.\n  What does it do? The good part is it reduces our spending by about \n$2.1 trillion, maybe $2.4 trillion. A more solid belief is we will \nreduce spending if Congress adheres to the guidelines. Over a period of \nyears we tend to figure ways around the limits and constraints that are \nput on spending, but the plan is to reduce spending by $2.1 trillion.\n  It is a step. It is better than more spending like we have been \ndoing. In the last 2 years under President Obama, when the Democratic \nmajority had 60 Senators in the Senate, nondefense discretionary \nspending went up 24 percent. The budget that the President submitted \nthis year calls for a 13.5 percent increase in education for next year. \nBeginning October 1, fiscal year 2012, when we are in the worst \nfinancial shape ever, a 13.5 percent increase in spending? Is that \ncommon sense? Does that make reasonable judgment? Is that a reasonable \njudgment for America, when we are in a situation such as this?\n  It proposes a 9.5 percent increase in the Energy Department. It \nproposes a 10.5 percent increase in the State Department. It proposes a \n60-percent increase in the Highway Department. And I'm told there will \nbe a tax. I ask them: Mr. Secretary, what tax?\n  It will not be a gas tax.\n  I say: OK, we agree, it is not a gas tax. What is the tax?\n  We will talk about that.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said that is no income. You cannot \nsay you have income to offset a big increase in high-speed rail and \nthings like that if you do not have a source of revenue.\n  That is the situation in which we find ourselves. We have a deep, \nphilosophical disagreement. The majority in this Senate and the \nPresident believe in spending. When I said 24 percent increase, that \ndid not include the almost $1 trillion in the stimulus package. It did \nnot include that, all of which, every penny, was borrowed because we \nare in debt. When you spend this extra money, you borrow the money. We \ndo not have it to spend.\n  However, we have a disagreement about where we are heading in our \ncountry. We should have had a full, glorious debate in the Senate. The \nFinance Committee should be looking at how to deal with taxes. The \nAppropriations Committee should be asking how can we reduce \nexpenditures. Every authorizing committee needs to be looking at what \nthey can do to do the job better with less cost and more efficiently. \nThe Budget Committee should be producing a budget that can be adhered \nto and passed, and that would bind the Senate to change the spending \ntrajectory we have been on. But none of that has happened.\n  Instead, we have a bill to raise the debt limit. We are here because \nwe spent so much money. We are up at the limit and if we do not raise \nthe debt limit there will be substantial reductions in spending \noccurring pretty quickly. That is where we are.\n  I believe this bill raises serious questions about the Senate and how \nwe do business. As I said, I warned that we would be at the eleventh \nhour when it all came forward.\n  One thing particularly concerning to me as the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee is that this bill deems certain budget numbers and in \na way gets around, again, the budget process. It is going to give my \ncolleagues, the Democratic majority, additional avenues to avoid \nproducing a budget for the third consecutive year. I do not believe \nthat is a healthy process.\n  Second, I ask my colleagues to think about this, and I will wrap up. \nI don't need to go into great detail about it. We are being asked to \nallow our leaders to select up to 12 people, 12 people who will be on a \nspecial committee and will have almost complete jurisdiction to work on \nany issue they choose. After they reach an agreement, if they do, that \nagreement will be presented to both Houses of Congress. There will be \nonly 30 hours of debate, no opportunity to amend it, and there will be \nan up-or-down vote. I have to say the chance of an up-or-down vote \nbeing successful is very high, because the product that will come out \nof that committee will be in harmony with what the leaders who \nappointed the members of the committee desire, because the power to \nappoint is the power to control.\n  The committee will come back with this leadership proposal. It will \nbe on the floor and it will be for an up-or-down vote and it is very \nlikely to pass. Hopefully, it will have some good things in it. But it \nis unlikely that it would go past $1.5 trillion in reduced spending \nover 10 years. That is roughly what they have been given. That on top \nof the $900 billion that would go into effect immediately with the \npassage of the legislation would result in about a $2.4 trillion total.\n  I believe that is an insufficient number. It is not close to what we \nhave to do given our expected debt. Over 10 years the debt of the \nUnited States will increase an additional $13 trillion. Reducing it $2 \ntrillion is not enough. We have heard the economists and others testify \nbefore the Budget Committee. Republicans and Democrats, say those \nreductions are not sufficient. Many economists said the absolute \nminimum was $4 trillion, and this will be half that.\n  That legislation will then come before us. We will have an up-or-down \nvote and presumably it will pass. The great traditions of the Senate, \nfull, free, open debate will not occur to the degree that it ought to \noccur. The regular order will not be followed. Committees will have \nonly an ability to send over advice if they so desire. As a result, I \nthink we as Members of the Senate need to ask ourselves if we are \ngetting pretty far away from the traditions of this body when you do \nnot have public debate on a budget, you create a committee of limited \nnumbers of people to produce legislation that cannot be amended and \nwill only be up-or-down and no ability to have a supermajority vote, \nbut a 50-vote, contrary to the normal process of this body.\n  For those reasons I believe, as a Senator and a ranking member on the \nBudget Committee who has wrestled with this for some time, I will not \nbe able to support the legislation, although I truly believe it is a \nstep forward, and I respect my colleagues who worked hard to try to \nbring it forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many of us undoubtedly remember the heart \nwrenching images of starving Ethiopian and Somali children in the 1980s \nand 1990s. Those haunting images are hard to forget.\n  Unfortunately, I am compelled to come to the floor to draw attention \nto a tragic famine again confronting that part of the world.\n  On July 21, the United Nations declared ``famine level food \ninsecurity'' in two regions in southern Somalia.\n  What does ``famine level food insecurity'' mean?\n  It means three tragic conditions are all occurring at the same time. \nFirst, malnutrition rates exceed 30 percent. Second, access to food and \nwater is below subsistence levels for extended periods of time. And \nthird, more than 2,000 to 10,000 people are dying of hunger each day.\n  Or more simply--a severe famine threatens the lives of 11 million \npeople in east Africa today. The area affected by famine is expected to \nexpand in coming weeks--and if not addressed soon--in coming months.\n  These millions of men, women, and children in Somalia and around the \nHorn of Africa are literally starving to death. These are children who \nwill never reach their full potential because they do not have simple \nnutrients to fully develop--nutrients we take for granted.\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\n  Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program, \ncarries around devastating photos showing what malnutrition does to the \nbrain development of children.\n  She notes that when a child is born, about 60 percent of that baby's \nbrain is formed and, if in the next 3 years in life they don't have \nadequate nutrition, their brains will not grow to maturity.\n  Her photos show the brain of a 3-year-old child who was properly \nnourished and that of a child who was malnourished. The actual volume \nof the brain of the malnourished child is as much as 40 percent \nsmaller.\n  These are the innocent victims of hunger in east Africa and sadly, in \nstill too many other corners of the globe.\n  I am happy to note that the U.S. is the largest bilateral donor of \nemergency assistance to this growing crisis. We have responded with \nover $431 million in food and nonfood emergency assistance this year \nalone. And Secretary of State Clinton just announced an additional $28 \nmillion in aid for people in Somalia and for Somali refugees in Kenya.\n  But more needs to be done and the United States cannot solve this \ncrisis alone.\n  How did this happen again?\n  The Horn of Africa is rife with challenges, both natural and man-\nmade. The region has had two insufficient rainy seasons culminating in \nthe driest growing season recorded in 60 years.\n  Neither crops nor livestock are surviving, so food and commodities \nnow sell at prices well beyond the reach of the country's people.\n  The price of red sorghum, a staple crop in Somalia, has increased \nmore than 200 percent. In Kenya, the price of white corn has increased \n58 percent. And in Ethiopia, the price of yellow corn has increased by \nmore than 100 percent.\n  Millions of people, including in the neighboring countries of Kenya, \nEthiopia, Djibouti, and Uganda are also at risk of starvation.\n  It's also a man-made crisis. Somalia's central government collapsed \nover 20 years ago. And al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization, has \ncontrolled much of southern Somalia since 2006.\n  Not surprisingly, the two areas most acutely experiencing famine are \nin southern Somalia, which is under al-Shabaab-control. Al-Shabaab \nrecently expelled relief organizations, which effectively destroyed \nfood-aid distribution channels--the lifeline for Somalis trapped under \ntheir control.\n  The mounting food crisis is also creating a refugee crisis that \nrecognizes no borders. Already almost 25 percent of the Somali \npopulation--2 million out of 7.5 total million people--are displaced.\n  Kenya, with 3.5 million people who are vulnerable to food insecurity, \nis also already home to Dadaab, the largest refugee camp in the world.\n  This camp was built 20 years ago as a temporary shelter for 90,000 \npeople. Today it holds 400,000. And another 1,300 refugees arrive every \nday from Somalia.\n  In Ethiopia, a refugee camp called Dollo Ado is holding 120,000 \npeople. But with a population of 3.2 million people affected by the \nfamine, this camp is growing by 2,000 people per day.\n  Mogadishu, the hollowed out capital of Somalia, has become an oasis \nin southern Somalia because relief organizations are allowed to operate \nlife-saving programs there. This is the city that thousands of people \nhave fled in the past 20 years due to violence.\n  Can you imagine Mogadishu being an oasis?\n  Yet the capital city is seeing a daily influx of 1,000 to 1,500 \npeople.\n  This network of emergency and humanitarian programs is the only hope \nfor millions of people and deserves continued international support.\n  Stepping in to provide food, water and basic sustenance where there \nis none is not only the right thing to do, it is the American thing to \ndo. We have always led and joined efforts to help the most vulnerable \naround the world and should continue to do so.\n  The House passed its Agriculture Appropriations for 2012 and chose to \nreduce the aid available for emergencies like these by 49 percent.\n  Thankfully, USAID is on the ground in Africa providing expertise, and \nAdministrator Shah personally visited the region last week.\n  And the Feed the Future Program--which is modeled on the Global Food \nSecurity Act I sponsored with Senators Lugar and Casey--has been \nundertaken by the Obama administration. The program works to break the \ncycle of hunger and food insecurity by getting at the root causes and \nhelping countries develop their own viable agricultural sectors.\n  As Josette Sheeran points out, ``for the first time in most people's \nmemory we're in a post-surplus world. There is no surplus of food in \nthe world and you have one bad drought or one bad flood . . . it will \nimpact the price of food globally.''\n  In the meantime, the international community needs to step up to the \nplate in east Africa before it is too late. And the United States must \ncontinue to show moral leadership even in a time of stretched budgets.\n  International donors are meeting this week in Nairobi to try to raise \n$1.6 billion to help with this crisis in Africa. I urge our friends and \nallies around the world to help do their part.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5185-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5185-S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ALLIED INVASION OF SICILY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 68th \nanniversary of the Allied invasion of Sicily.\n  On July 10, 1943, under orders from GEN Dwight D. Eisenhower, the \nFifteenth Army Group, comprised of GEN George Patton's Seventh Army and \nBritish GEN Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army, began the Allied invasion \nof the island of Sicily, termed Operation Husky.\n  Prior to the ground invasion, brave Allied pilots softened the Axis \ndefenses with heavy aerial bombardment. In the early hours of July 10, \nAllied ground forces successfully landed on enemy shores with little \nresistance.\n  Over the next few days Allied forces continued on with much success. \nOn July 11 and 12 enemy forces attempted numerous counterattacks, all \nof which were repelled by the skill and determination of the American \nforces. On July 22, an element of GEN Patton's Seventh Army captured \nthe city of Palermo, the news of which so inspired the Italian people \nthat on July 24 and 25 a palace revolt took place toppling the fascist \ngovernment of Mussolini.\n  On July 31 Italian and German forces, faced with certain defeat, \nbegan a tactical withdrawal from Sicily.\n  One of the heroes of the action of July 31 received the Medal of \nHonor. Near Gagliano, Sicily, SGT Gerry H. Kisters, of Bloomington, IN, \nand nine other soldiers ``. . . were advancing ahead of the leading \nelements of U.S. troops to fill a large crater in the only available \nvehicle route through Gagliano,'' the award citation reads, and ``. . . \nwas taken under fire by 2 enemy machineguns. Sgt. Kisters and the \nofficer, unaided and in the face of intense small arms fire, advanced \non the nearest machinegun emplacement and succeeded in capturing the \ngun and its crew of 4. Although the greater part of the remaining small \narms fire was now directed on the captured machinegun position, Sgt. \nKisters voluntarily advanced alone toward the second gun emplacement. \nWhile creeping forward, he was struck 5 times by enemy bullets, \nreceiving wounds in both legs and his right arm. Despite the wounds, he \ncontinued to advance on the enemy, and captured the second machinegun \nafter killing 3 of its crew and forcing the fourth member to flee.''\n  For his actions under fire Lieutenant Kisters received our Nation's \nhighest military award, the Medal of Honor.\n  Lieutenant Kisters, like so many Hoosiers before and since the Battle \nof Sicily, demonstrated the stalwart courage and self-sacrifice that is \nnecessary to preserve the freedom and liberty that we all too often \ntake for granted.\n  Lieutenant Kisters, in addition to receiving the Medal of Honor, also \nreceived a Distinguished Service Cross and a Bronze Star during WWII, \nnot to mention his Purple Heart, and continues to be remembered and \nhonored in Indiana, where last year July 31 was named Gerry Kisters Day \nin Bloomington, and in 1945 Monroe County Airport was dedicated as \nKisters Field in honor of the Medal of Honor awardee.\n  As we recognize these historical events, I call attention to the \n99,500 military personnel who today are on the ground in Afghanistan, \nwith another 31,000 deployed to the region aboard ships at sea, on \nbases, and air\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\nstations in the region supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. Mr. \nPresident, 48,110 personnel are deployed to Iraq, with another 32,000 \ndeployed to the region aboard ships at sea, on bases, and air stations; \n4,469 have been killed in Iraq operations since 2003, and 1,638 have \nbeen killed in Afghanistan since 2001. These men and women continue to \nanswer the call to serve a cause greater than themselves as those men \ndid in Operation Husky 68 years ago this month. I ask my colleagues \nhere today to join me in humbly honoring Lieutenant Kisters, and all \nthose who have and continue to serve our Nation in uniform, for their \ninspirational service, selflessness, and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5186-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Nathan R. Beyers\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of a young Coloradan, SGT Nathan \nR. Beyers. Sergeant Beyers died on July 7, 2011, when insurgents \nattacked his convoy with an improvised explosive device in Baghdad, \nIraq. Sergeant Beyers was serving in support of Operation New Dawn. He \nwas 24 years old.\n  Sergeant Beyers loved the Army and he was proud to be serving our \ncountry. Born and raised in Littleton, CO, Sergeant Beyers graduated \nfrom ThunderRidge High School. He joined the Idaho National Guard a few \nyears ago, and he was assigned to Bravo Company, 145th Brigade Support \nBattalion, 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team.\n  He is remembered by family, friends, and servicemembers as a brave \nsoldier, dedicated husband, and proud father. Sergeant Beyers and his \nwife, Vanessa Mary Beyers, recently had their first child. Vanessa said \nthat he died ``doing something he loved.'' Hundreds gathered at Fort \nLogan National Cemetery in Denver to honor and remember Sergeant \nBeyers.\n  Sergeant Beyers' commanding officers immediately recognized his \nexceptional bravery and talent. He earned, among other decorations, the \nBronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Army Good Conduct Medal, Army Reserve \nComponents Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and Iraq \nCampaign Medal with Bronze Service Star.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Sergeant \nBeyers's service was in keeping with this sentiment: by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a \nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  Mr. President, I stand with Colorado and people nationwide in \nprofound gratitude for Sergeant Beyers's tremendous sacrifice. He \nserved proudly and honorably in Iraq when his country needed him most. \nWe are humbled by his service and his sacrifice. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending heartfelt sympathy and condolences to Sergeant \nBeyers's family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5186-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MARDI GRAS INDIANS HALL OF FAME DAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, most of my Senate colleagues are aware \nof the rich culture and heritage that is on display in Louisiana during \nthe days and weeks before Lent. Parties and parades mark the end of the \nMardi Gras season and the beginning of fasting and sacrifice. But few \noutside of Louisiana are familiar with the unique tradition of the \nMardi Gras Indians.\n  I rise today to celebrate this unique Louisiana tradition and \nrecognize the Mardi Gras Indians Hall of Fame Day to be celebrated at \nOretha Castle Haley Elementary School in New Orleans, LA, on August 7, \n2011.\n  The history of the Mardi Gras Indians dates back to the late 1800s, \nbut their origin remains a mystery. Because most of their history and \npractices have been passed from generation to generation orally, we may \nnever know if the Mardi Gras Indians came about to pay homage to Native \nAmericans for hiding runaway slaves or simply as a expression of the \nconnection between Native Americans and African Americans. What we do \nknow is that their tradition adds an incredible story to the history of \nNew Orleans and Mardi Gras.\n  Today, the Mardi Gras Indians consist of more than 40 individual \ntribes. These tribes compete against one another using chants and music \nalong with their elaborately decorated costumes called ``suits.'' The \nsuits are each hand sewn by the tribe members and typically take an \nentire year to complete. Ornaments on the suits can include feathers, \nostrich plumes, beads, velvet, rhinestones, and sequins, all \nbeautifully sewn together to tell the story of the individual tribe \nmember and contribute to the tapestry of whole tribe. Native American, \nAztecan, Caribbean, and West African cultures have all greatly \ninfluenced the work of art that is the Mardi Gras Indian suit.\n  The traditions of the Mardi Gras Indians also include a hierarchy \nstructure consisting of a ``big chief,'' a ``big queen,'' ``chiefs,'' \n``spy boys,'' ``flag boys,'' and ``wild men,'' just to name a few. \nEvery member of the tribe has a specific set of duties culminating in \nthe big chief who represents the tribe against all other tribes.\n  In addition to being a key part of Mardi Gras, Mardi Gras Indians are \nstrong community leaders in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. The \nMardi Gras Indians have worked to preserve, celebrate, and advance the \ncultural arts and music of their tribes and communities. By doing this, \nthe tribes have also continued to encourage the younger generations to \nlearn and embrace the tribes' histories. One tribe, the Guardians of \nthe Flame, has established a nonprofit called Guardians Institute to \neducate New Orleans children on the importance of art, music, and \nhistory in order to keep these traditions alive.\n  Dr. Roslyn Smith, former principal of Oretha Castle Haley Elementary \nSchool in New Orleans, summarized the Mardi Gras Indians best by \nsaying, ``the Big Chiefs are community leaders, and in many ways they \nare social warriors, struggling to preserve traditions of beauty in the \ncommunity while working to make the communities better places.'' Please \njoin me in honoring and celebrating the Mardi Gras Indians and \nespecially the Mardi Gras Indians Hall of Fame Day on August, 7, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5186-3", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5186-S5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPBELL COUNTY, WYOMING\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the Centennial \nof Campbell County, WY.\n  The citizens of Campbell County are blessed to live in this beautiful \nenvironment. Located in northeastern Wyoming and nestled in the Powder \nRiver Basin, the county is bordered by the Black Hills and the Big Horn \nMountains. Its 39,000 residents live in the communities of Gillette, \nWright, Weston and Rozet. Land was taken from previously established \nWeston and Crook counties to create the new district. Officially \nrecognized on May 23, 1911, the county was named after John A. \nCampbell, Wyoming's first territorial Governor.\n  Campbell County as we know it today is vastly different from 100 \nyears ago, but it is this shared history between today's residents and \nthose of the past that creates a special bond. It has been host to \nNative Americans, fur trappers, mountain men, homesteaders, ranchers \nand oil men. The basin area was first used by members of the Sioux, \nCrow and Arapaho Native American tribes. They used the wide plains and \ngrasslands as hunting grounds, and evidence of their presence can still \nbe found today. Fur trappers and mountain men also traveled in the \ncounty. One such frontiersman, Robert Campbell, was a successful trader \nand explorer of the Rocky Mountains. He travelled through the county on \nhis way to the Wind River Mountains.\n  The construction of the railroad had a major impact on the \ndevelopment of Campbell County. As the desire to move west increased, \nthe residents of the county recognized the need to lay tracks of their \nown. Incorporated as a town in 1891, Gillette was originally developed \nas a transfer point for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. It \nwas named after Edward Gillette, who was in charge of an early survey \nfor the railroad. The addition of the railroad, along with the emigrant \ntrails in the area, was essential to the establishment of the county.\n  Campbell County has since capitalized on these rich opportunities for \ngrowth and development. While ranching and agriculture are important \nindustries, the extraction of coal, oil and natural gas is widely \nacknowledged as the principal industry within Campbell County. The \nresidents proudly recognized their county as the Energy Capital of the \nNation. The Powder River Basin is the largest supplier of coal in\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\nthe United States, providing nearly 40 percent of the Nation's coal. \nCoal mining has had an important role in the development of the \ncounty's infrastructure. For instance, Wright was built in close \nproximity to the Black Thunder coal mine, the second most productive \ncoal mine in the United States. Improved technology in extraction \nmethods has increased the production of coal bed methane gas and oil. \nThese advancements will continue to serve the nation's growing energy \nneeds well into the future.\n  This year, the Campbell County Centennial Committee has planned \nseveral countywide celebrations, including the installation of a Survey \nPlaque in the Campbell County Courthouse.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, August 9, 2011, I will have \nthe honor of announcing the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming's \nYouth of the Year at their annual award and recognition breakfast. This \nevent is a wonderful celebration. In addition to the Youth of the Year, \nthe Boys and Girls Clubs will honor two of Wyoming's own: Vice \nPresident Dick Cheney and Lynne Vincent Cheney. They are being \nrecognized for their devotion and commitment to the youth in our \ncommunities and across the State of Wyoming. While both of these \ndistinguished individuals have received many honors and accolades, to \nbe recognized by the Boys and Girls Clubs is very special to them.\n  The Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming is a great organization \nthat continues to have a positive impact in the lives of youth. They \nserve all children, regardless of economic circumstances. Dedicated \nstaff and volunteers enthusiastically work with the students, creating \nan environment that fosters their positive growth and development. \nYoung people are provided the tools and opportunities needed to \nsucceed. Hundreds of kids benefit each year from the Boys and Girls \nClubs.\n  The mission of the Boys and Girls Clubs is to create a better future \nfor its members through focusing on positive outcomes: academic \nsuccess, good character and citizenship as well as healthy lifestyles. \nAt this year's awards and recognition breakfast, three outstanding \nyoung people will be honored and one will be chosen as the 2011-2012 \nYouth of the Year. These young citizens have excelled in all of the \npositive outcomes, and serve as excellent examples for other youth to \nfollow.\n  Jessica Treto is a sophomore at Kelly Walsh High School. She loves to \nplay card games with younger club members and admits she hardly ever \nwins. Jessica wants to be a counselor because she enjoys helping \npeople.\n  Chrissy Stufft is also a sophomore at Kelly Walsh High School. She is \na cheerleader and plays third base on her softball team. Her favorite \ntelevision show CSI has inspired Chrissy to be a forensic scientist.\n  Anthony MacMillan is a junior at Natrona County High School. Anthony \nis an avid swimmer. Due to his love for cooking, he wants to be a \npastry chef.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nJessica, Chrissy, and Anthony. Knowing of these fine young people gives \nme the confidence that the future of America is in good hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5187-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JORDAN BROWN\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Centennial \nof Goshen County, WY.\n  Goshen County is remarkable. Its 13,250 residents are fortunate to \nlive in the unique and diverse communities of Torrington, Lingle, Fort \nLaramie, LaGrange and Yoder. Nestled in a temperate basin along the \nNorth Platte River, the people have always connected with the land and \nits legacy. Officially recognized on February 24, 1911, the basin area \nhas a rich history, one that gave the county its unique name. Legend \nhas it an unknown traveler roamed the area known as Goshen's Hole. \nThough his identity was never discovered, he was most likely a trader \nor a fur trapper. The legend of the name's origins has long been \ncelebrated and contended by the folks in this area.\n  Goshen County was a gateway to the Wild West, and its organization \nbenefited from those headed westward. The Goshen Hole area, a popular \nstop for many, saw traffic from Native Americans, mountain men and fur \ntraders. Thousands of emigrants following the California, Mormon and \nOregon trails passed through the county by way of Fort Laramie. \nEstablished in 1834 along the banks of the Laramie River, the fort \nserved as a trading post, post office, resting point and an important \nmilitary base during the Plains Indian Wars. Today, the community of \nFort Laramie works to preserve the fort's key role in our State's \nhistory.\n  Between 1876 and 1887, the area hosted part of the Cheyenne-Black \nHills Stage Route between Cheyenne and Deadwood, SD. The route provided \nsafe transport of freight, gold and passengers through land inhabited \nby Sioux Indians. The town of LaGrange began as one of many stage stops \ncreated to accommodate these passengers--it is now the oldest \nincorporated town in Goshen County. The development of the Union \nPacific Railroad extension project offered new opportunities and \nconnected the county to an ever-expanding West. Yoder began as a \nstation along the extension line into the valley, and later prospered \nas an agricultural center. These\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\nextended tracks--coupled with the stage routes--were vital to the \ncounty's establishment.\n  Today, the county is home to those looking to tame their own bit of \nthe Wild West. Thanks to its temperate climate, agriculture is Goshen's \nprimary industry. A highly developed irrigation system borrows waters \nfrom the North Platte River, the Hawk Springs reservoir and the \nPathfinder Dam, which allows profitable crops of sugar beets, beans and \nwheat to prosper in the North Platte Valley. Small-acreage farms and \nsustainable growing practices bring the farming tradition into the 21st \ncentury. The county is consistently the leading beef producer in the \nstate as over 200,000 head of cattle are raised each year. In addition, \nGoshen County is working to answer America's growing energy demands. \nIts proximity to the Niobrara Shale Formation provides the county with \nopportunities for future oil and natural gas production.\n  In honor of the 100th anniversary of Goshen County, I urge my \ncolleagues to see this ``Valley of Abundance'' in person. I \ncongratulate the citizens who have worked so hard to preserve the \ncounty's heritage. They should be proud to celebrate this landmark \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5189-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I condemn in the strongest possible terms \nthe Cuban regime's unjust incarceration of Alan Gross. As the editorial \nhighlights and as the Castro regime well knows, Mr. Gross is simply a \nhumanitarian who was seeking to help the Jewish community in Cuba \naccess the Internet. Only the most oppressive, totalitarian regime \nwould seek to jail someone for trying to expand access to uncensored \ninformation.\n  As this editorial notes, ``The regime in Havana is so brittle and \ncreaky that it blanches at the idea of its subjects communicating too \nfreely with the outside world, lest they undermine a communist system \nwhose attempts at economic development have delivered scanty results.''\n  I also take this opportunity to once again call on the Obama \nadministration to halt its new Cuba policies that liberalize travel and \nexpand allowable remittances to Cuba. This unilateral gift to the \nCastro brothers by the Obama administration is totally unwarranted, \nespecially in light of Mr. Gross' case as well as the ongoing \nrepression of the Cuban people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a July 29, 2011, editorial by the \nWashington Post entitled ``Cuba Should Free Alan Gross'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 29, 2011]\n\n                      Cuba Should Free Alan Gross\n\n       Alan P. Gross, the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development subcontractor who committed what Cuba considers \n     the unconscionable offense of making the Internet available \n     to members of its minuscule Jewish community, has almost \n     exhausted possible judicial appeals of his 15-year prison \n     sentence.\n       Mr. Gross, 62, a resident of Potomac, was arrested in \n     December 2009 as he prepared to fly home from Havana. \n     Convicted on trumped-up charges in March this year, he \n     appeared a few days ago before Cuba's highest tribunal to \n     appeal his conviction and plead for release. The outcome of \n     his appeal, expected in the coming days, is certain to be \n     dictated one way or another by Cuban leader Raul Castro--and \n     will be a sign of whether Cuba is remotely interested in \n     better relations with Washington.\n       Cuba, besides its repressive ally Venezuela, is virtually \n     the only place in the Western Hemisphere where distributing \n     laptop computers and satellite phone equipment intended to \n     connect people to the Internet--Mr. Gross's supposed \n     ``crime''--could be construed as subversive. The regime in \n     Havana is so brittle and creaky that it blanches at the idea \n     of its subjects communicating too freely with the outside \n     world, lest they undermine a communist system whose attempts \n     at economic development have delivered scanty results.\n       There are plenty of humanitarian reasons to release Mr. \n     Gross, who has been confined for 19 months. Somewhat \n     overweight when he was arrested, Mr. Gross has lost 100 \n     pounds, according to his wife and other American visitors who \n     have been allowed to meet with him; he also suffers from \n     gout, ulcers and arthritis. His daughter is struggling with \n     cancer, and his mother is reported to be in poor health.\n       Cuban authorities have portrayed Mr. Gross as a spy \n     involved in an enterprise aimed at undermining the regime. \n     That seems unlikely in the extreme. In fact, Mr. Gross, a \n     veteran development worker who had minimal command of \n     Spanish, was part of a democratization project of the sort \n     the U.S. government runs in countries all over the world.\n       At the time of his arrest, Mr. Gross was working for \n     Development Alternatives Inc., a Bethesda firm that had won a \n     $6 million government contract to promote democracy in Cuba. \n     His work consisted mainly of providing computers and \n     satellite phones to Cuban Jews, a community thought to number \n     about 1,500, so they could access the Internet, whose use is \n     restricted in Cuba, and contact Jewish communities beyond \n     Cuba's shores. Not exactly a cloak-and-dagger project likely \n     to bring the Castro brothers to their knees.\n       The Obama administration has made it clear that any \n     improvement in relations with Cuba is on hold pending Mr. \n     Gross's release.

I am proud that Dr. Sabshin's family lives \nin Connecticut and honored to remember a man who spoke out against \nharmful discrimination, breaking down the stigma of mental health ahead \nof his time.\n  As the former director of the American Psychiatric Association, Dr. \nSabshin worked diligently to advance the field of psychiatry by \nstrengthening research efforts and advocating for increased mental \nhealth funding.\n  Dr. Sabshin was born on October 28, 1925, in New York City. \nGraduating high school at age 14 and college at 17, he was a scholar \nfrom childhood. After graduating from the University of Florida, he \nserved briefly in the U.S. Army and then enrolled in medical school and \ncompleted his residency at Tulane University in Louisiana. Upon \ngraduation from medical school, he practiced medicine at the Michael \nReese Hospital in Chicago and eventually became the head of the \nUniversity of Illinois' Department of Psychiatry.\n  At the University of Illinois, he became an active member of the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association. In 1974 he was appointed medical \ndirector of the American Psychiatric Association and served as director \nuntil 1997. During his time, he oversaw the publication of new editions \nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which \nsets standard criteria for classifying mental health conditions.\n  In fighting discrimination, he worked tirelessly to eliminate \nhomosexuality from the list of psychiatric disorders in the manual, and \nhis work helped to change attitudes toward homosexuality. During his \ntenure as director, Dr. Sabshin was also a leading voice against the \nideological manipulation of psychiatry by communist authorities in the \nSoviet Union.\n  Upon his retirement from the American Psychiatric Association, Dr. \nSabshin was hired as a clinical professor at the University of \nMaryland's medical school. He also was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal \nCollege of Psychiatrists. He is survived by his wife Marion Bennathan \nof London, his son Dr. James Sabshin of Woodbridge, CT, and four \ngranddaughters.\n  Dr. Sabshin has been called ``central to the evolution of modern \nAmerican psychiatry.'' This characterization could not be more \naccurate. Dr. Sabshin's death is a great loss to the professional \ncommunity and especially to all those who have benefited from his many \nyears of great public service. I know my colleagues will join me in \nhonoring the great life of Dr. Melvin Sabshin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5189-3", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5189-S5190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI DELTA RESEARCH CENTER\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the University of Missouri's Delta Research Center. The \nPortageville, MO, facility was officially dedicated on August 8, 1961, \nand has since become a beacon for the agriculture industry. I am so \nproud of the Delta Center's many accomplishments.\n  Over the course of five decades, the success of the Delta Center was \nmade possible by a special team of experts from the University of \nMissouri, College of Agriculture, Food and Natural\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nResources, a dedicated field staff, talented scientists, and the wisdom \nof top-notch agricultural leaders serving on the Delta Research \nCenter's Advisory Board. The University of Missouri's Delta Research \nCenter has advised farmers about boosting harvests and battling pests, \nwhile overseeing research with global implications. This includes the \ndevelopment of numerous strands of cotton and most notably 16 new \nsoybean varieties, some with cyst nematode resistance, which has impact \nfar beyond the rich cropland of the Bootheel of Missouri.\n  On September 2, 2011, the Delta Research Center will host the 50th \nAnnual Field Day which showcases the world class studies they conduct, \nbringing together all sectors of the agriculture industry from those \nwho plant the seed to those who market the product. It is always a day \nof learning and gives Missourians the tools needed to stay competitive \nin a global market. I look forward to joining hundreds of farmers, \nagri-businesses and others to learn the results of the special research \nthat will be on display.\n  For our Nation to remain a leader in the production of food and fiber \nfor our citizens and the world, we must continue important agriculture \nresearch like that conducted at the University of Missouri's Delta \nResearch Center. Jake Fisher, superintendent and a dedicated employee \nfor 50 years, summed it up best when he said, ``Our team effort is not \nonly about the results we bring about today; we must be focused on ten \nto fifteen years down the road, so we remain on the cutting-edge of \nagriculture production and technology.''\n  Jake Fisher and his talented team at the University of Missouri's \nDelta Research Center demonstrate every day that hard work, vision, and \npublic-private partnerships can be successful in advancing our Nation's \nrich agricultural resources.\n  I am very proud of the many accomplishments of the University of \nMissouri's Delta Research Center and ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the center on 50 years of service and monumental \naccomplishments in agriculture research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5190-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING DON DICKEY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Don Dickey, a longtime resident \nof Juneau, AK, passed away on June 25, 2011, at the age of 89. A native \nof Stockton, CA, Don moved to Alaska in 1952 to manage the Fairbanks \nChamber of Commerce. He returned to California in 1955 to work for the \nCalifornia State Chamber but in 1960 decided Alaska would be his home. \nIt was then that he relocated, once again to Alaska, to organize the \nAlaska State Chamber of Commerce. He served as president for the Alaska \nState Chamber for 22 years.\n  In 1981, Don was named director of the Alaska Division of Tourism, \nworking for Governor Hammond and then Governor Sheffield. He was a key \nplayer in the growth of Alaska's tourism industry.\n  Terry Miller, who served as Don's deputy when he directed the Alaska \nDivision of Tourism remembers Don's effort to persuade all of those in \nthe Alaska tourism business to join together in a cooperative marketing \neffort to sell Alaska as a destination, rather than their individual \nbusinesses. ``He got the little mom and pop operations, the cruise \ncompanies, the airlines, everybody with a stake in it to pool their \nmarketing dollars.'' Alaska's former Lieutenant Governor John Coghill \ndescribed Don as, ``the one who probably laid the blueprint for what \nhappened later.'' What happened later was the emergence of Alaska as \nthe premier visitor destination it is today.\n  Those who knew Don best describe him in these terms: classy, gentle, \ndynamic, charming, a great promoter of Alaska, and a very funny guy. \nHis admirers refer to him as one ``who could totally captivate a room \nand be very persuasive,'' and as one ``who could inspire and motivate \nothers.''\n  I have known Don since I was a young girl growing up in southeast \nAlaska. He always had a joke, a story, or funny quip to share. My \nfamily and I have fond memories of good times spent together.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate and the people of Alaska, grateful for \nhis leadership, as well as his wit, I extend condolences to Don's wife \nGen, his children Dru and Dane, and all of those who mourn the loss of \nthis exemplary Alaskan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5190-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ERIN DUFFY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 1460. A bill to grant the congressional gold medal, collectively, \nto the First Special Service Force, in recognition of its superior \nservice during World War II; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President: When speaking of the Royal Air Force \nbefore Parliament, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said: \n``Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to \nso few.''\n  Churchill's words would ring true for the First Special Service Force \nas well. An elite and clandestine military unit during World War II, \nthe Force was trained for the most difficult missions over the most \narduous terrain. The Force pioneered many of the tactics used by \ntoday's Special Operations Forces. Their courage and audacity helped \nbreak through Nazi lines. Surprise night raids. Scaling cliffs. \nTraversing snowy mountain passes. The\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\nForce never faced a mission that was too difficult or too dangerous to \naccomplish.\n  It is a great honor to introduce legislation today with my colleagues \nSenator Tester and Senator Burr bestowing the First Special Service \nForce with the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor the United States \nCongress can present. It is reserved for an individual--or group of \nindividuals--who performs an outstanding act of service to the United \nStates. I can think of no group of men more deserving of this high \nhonor than the First Special Service Force.\n  The Force was comprised of volunteers from 49 States, the District of \nColumbia, and Canada. These men trained at Fort Harrison, in Helena, \nMT. Later, they were nicknamed the Black Devil's Brigade by a German \nsoldier who complained they attacked in the middle of the night and \nthen disappeared.\n  The Force's training in Helena, Vermont, and Virginia was \nunconventional and brutal. Hand-to-hand combat. Demolition. Rock \nclimbing. Ski and mountain warfare. Amphibious landings. Night air \ndrops. Their training far surpassed that of any other unit during World \nWar II. This unique training led to remarkable success in battle.\n  The Force deployed to Italy in 1943. The first mission was to capture \ntwo peaks on the German Winter Line. This line had proven unbreakable \nand defeated massive Allied attacks. The road to liberate Rome led \nstraight through this line. General Eisenhower needed to find a way to \nblast through. He chose the First Special Service Force.\n  The Force attacked the German line using what both Allied and Axis \nforces thought was an impossible route--the north face. In the dead of \nwinter. In the middle of the night. Needless to say, they surprised the \nGerman forces on Monte la Difensa. Over the next 46 days, the Force \ndefeated the fortified German Winter Line. The victory came at a \ndevastating price. The Force lost 1,300 men out of a total of 1,800.\n  The First Special Service Force then moved to the Anzio-Nettmo \nbeachhead. For 99 days, the Force battled the infamous German Hermann \nGoering Division. The Force pushed the Germans back, liberating Italian \nvillages as they moved north toward Rome. On June 4, 1944, members of \nthe Force routed German Forces guarding the eight bridges leading into \nRome. Their advance cleared the way for other Allied forces to liberate \nRome.\n  The Force then turned to the Iles d'Hyeres, islands in southern \nFrance. Their amphibious assault surprised the Nazi occupiers and led \nto the capture of four Nazi forts. The Black Devil Brigade continued to \nthe mainland where they hunted down the retreating German Eighth Army. \nThe Force drove eastward in 15 weeks of battle to the Franco-Italian \nborder, liberating the towns of Grasse, Villeneuve-Loubet, Sospel and \nCastillon in southern France.\n  The Force deactivated on December 5, 1944 in southern France. The \nremainder of the war would be fought by large-scale armies, not covert \nunits like the First Special Service Force.\n  During the war, the Force suffered 2,314 casualties, equating to an \nastounding 134 percent of its combat strength. It captured over 30,000 \nprisoners, won five U.S. campaign stars and eight Canadian battle \nhonors. It never failed a mission. Today, only 230 of these brave \nsoldiers remain to tell the tales of their remarkable service.\n  As a testament to the unwavering camaraderie of the Force, the First \nSpecial Service Force Association was formed and continues to have \nreunions every year. They will be honoring the 70th anniversary of the \ncreation of the Force at their reunion next year. With every passing \nday we lose more of these brave warriors, and it is crucial that we \nhonor them now.\n  We owe the liberty we enjoy today to the brave men of the Black Devil \nBrigade. So many of us indebted to so few. Fortunately for our great \nNation, the legacy of the First Special Service Force lives on. The \nCanadian Special Operations Regiment and the Special Forces of the \nUnited States trace their lineage back to the First Special Service \nForce.\n  It is time to award the First Special Service Force the Congressional \nGold Medal. I strongly urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill to \nhonor these American heroes with the recognition and gratitude they \nhave earned.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Shaheen, \n        Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Blumenthal):\n  S. 1465. A bill to authorize a pilot program on enhancements of \nDepartment of Defense efforts on mental health in the National Guard \nand Reserves through community partnerships, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Joining \nForces for Military Mental Health Act with my colleagues Senators \nAyotte, Kerry, Shaheen, Scott Brown, Whitehouse, Leahy, and Blumenthal.\n  This legislation seeks to improve the coordination of research, \ntreatment, education and outreach of mental health, substance use \ndisorders, and traumatic brain injury, TBI, among members of the \nNational Guard and Reserve and their families.\n  These service members often return from a tour of duty and transition \ninto civilian life far from military bases and without easy access to \nthe care they might need, which can make transitioning back into family \nlife and careers more difficult. Those who do seek care in their \ncommunity may not always receive the most appropriate and effective \ntreatment.\n  The Joining Forces for Military Mental Health Act would authorize the \nSecretary of Defense to provide grants to community partners that \nengage in research, treatment, education, and outreach. This will help \nensure that every member of the military receives innovative and \neffective treatments and the most updated information about mental \nillness, substance abuse, and TBI connected with military service.\n  This type of coordination of research, treatment, education, and \noutreach, and collaboration with community partners could improve the \nhealth outcomes of members of the National Guard and Reserve and their \nfamilies. This bipartisan legislation has been endorsed by the National \nGuard Association of the United States, and the Red Sox Foundation and \nothers have already shown this type of coordination to be effective in \nproviding quality care. I urge my colleagues to take a close look at \nthis legislation and join me in supporting this effort to improve the \nmental health care that members of the National Guard and Reserve and \ntheir families receive in the community.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1465\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nimportant contributions of a very special Floridian for his unrelenting \ndetermination to protect one of our nation's most unique natural \nresources--America's Everglades. A prestigious attorney and commanding \nlitigator, Thom Rumberger has dedicated much of his personal and \nprofessional life to advancing the restoration and protection of the \nRiver of Grass. His brilliance, creativity and fearlessness combined to \nmake Thom one of Florida's most influential Everglades leaders.\n  A man proud to serve his country and his community, Thom interrupted \nhis college career to volunteer for the Marine Corps and serve in the \nKorean War. Over the course of his life he has continued his service as \na dedicated public servant, a respected judge and prosecutor. Thom is a \ndedicated father and grandfather who has always found great happiness \nand comfort in his ever-expanding family. The relentless efforts Thom \nundertakes to preserve Florida's natural heritage will be a legacy gift \nto his family, his colleagues, and to the American public.\n  After serving two years in the United States Marine Corps, Thom \nearned his bachelor's degree, with honors, and his law degree from the \nUniversity of Florida, where he was Associate Editor of the University \nof Florida Law Review in 1960. Before becoming Florida's youngest \nCircuit Court Judge in 1969, serving in the Eighteenth Judicial \nCircuit, he was the Brevard County Solicitor and Special Assistant \nState Attorney in the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit. From 1971 through \n1974 he was the County Attorney for Seminole County, Assistant to \nFlorida's Governor Claude Kirk, and served as a member of the Florida \nLand Sales Board.\n  Thom has been a long-time friend of George and Mary Barley, both of \nwhom dedicated their lives to restoration of the Everglades. George and \nMary established the Everglades Trust and the Everglades Foundation. \nUpon George's untimely death in 1995, Thom joined with Mary to make \nsure George's dream of a restored Everglades became a reality. An \nactive leader in the Republican Party, Thom was able to elevate \nEverglades restoration to a bi-partisan issue at both the state and \nfederal level.\n  Thom's success extends to his career in private practice, as he is \none of the founding partners of the Rumberger, Kirk & Caldwell law \nfirm. Under his leadership, his firm's modest beginnings were quickly \nsurpassed as it moved to the forefront of business litigation, \nrepresenting such multi-national corporations as American Airlines, \nSears, Roebuck and Co., General Motors Corporation, Honda Motor \nCompany, Ford Motor Company, and Toyota Motor Corporation. Today, his \nfirm includes 75 trial attorneys in five offices across Florida and \nAlabama. Thom has been listed in Florida Super Lawyers every year from \n2007 to 2010.\n  Legend has it that Thom once convinced a Federal judge to allow a \nreal automobile in the courtroom as evidence. Yes, Thom convinced the \njudge to have a window enlarged in a historic courthouse to accommodate \na crane that lifted the car right into the courtroom.\n  Thom has been known throughout his life for his infectious sense of \nhumor as well as the breath of his various careers. Often referred to \nas a ``career chameleon'', Thom worked his way through college as a \nsnake handler at the Ross Allen Reptile Institute at Florida's Silver \nSprings performing shows with lethal snakes to the thousands of \nvisitors who came to watch the dangerous performance. Thom promises \nthat it was there that he learned the skills of public speaking and \nworking with the public which would become such a critical component of \nhis future success. Thom also enjoyed a brief acting career as the \nstunt man for the Creature of the Black Lagoon before beginning his \nlegal career.\n\n  In addition to building an impressive legal career, Thom has \ngenerously committed himself to public service. He was appointed to \nFlorida's Federal Judicial Advisory Commission and the Board of \nSupervisors of the Spaceport Florida Authority. Currently, Thom is \nChairman of The Everglades Trust, and has served as Chairman of the \nCollins Center for Public Policy, and as a member of the Board of \nVisitors of Florida State College of Law and Board of Trustees for the \nLaw Center Association of the University of Florida.\n  He has represented environmental organizations including Save the \nManatee, The Everglades Trust, and Save Our Everglades. Thom has also \nserved as lead counsel for The Everglades Foundation since 1999.\n  Notably, Thom was instrumental in the passage of two Everglades \nrelated Florida constitutional amendments, the Federal Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan, and in obtaining several billion dollars \nin funding for Everglades restoration. Thom also was primarily \nresponsible for Florida's acquisition of the 75,000-acre Babcock Ranch \nwhich provides new and necessary corridors for the endangered Florida \npanther.

Con. Res. 27\n\n       Whereas Sergeant First Class Leroy Arthur Petry of the \n     United States Army, a native of Santa Fe, New Mexico, was \n     awarded the Medal of Honor by President Obama on July 12, \n     2011;\n       Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest honor awarded to \n     members of the Armed Forces for valor in combat;\n       Whereas the official citation awarding the Medal of Honor \n     to Sergeant First Class Petry states that then-Staff Sergeant \n     Petry ``distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and \n     intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call \n     of duty in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of \n     Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008'';\n       Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry joins an elite group of \n     Medal of Honor recipients dating back to the Civil War;\n       Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry has continued a long \n     tradition of military service to the United States by New \n     Mexicans, dating back to the defense of the Western United \n     States during the Civil War, and followed by participation in \n     every major war fought by the United States;\n       Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry is the second living \n     recipient of the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War;\n       Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry fought with bravery and, \n     despite wounds to both of his legs, had the courage and quick \n     thinking needed to save the lives of his fellow soldiers by \n     throwing back an enemy grenade and losing his right hand when \n     the grenade detonated shortly after he released it;\n       Whereas the actions of Sergeant First Class Petry represent \n     the highest values of the Army, the Rangers, and the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry has consistently \n     demonstrated humility and dedication to his fellow soldiers;\n       Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry, who overcame a troubled \n     youth and found the strength to turn his life around and \n     dedicate himself to serving the United States, is an example \n     to all people who are struggling in the United States; and\n       Whereas the brave actions of Sergeant First Class Petry, as \n     well as his modesty and selfless service, stand as the \n     embodiment of the best attributes of the people of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors the service and sacrifice of Sergeant First \n     Class Leroy Arthur Petry of the United States Army and his \n     family; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to recognize \n     the valor, heroism, and dedication to the United States \n     exhibited by Sergeant First Class Petry.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a \nresolution with Senator Jeff Bingaman honoring the bravery and \nsacrifice of Santa Fe, New Mexico native Sergeant First Class Leroy \nArthur Petry, an Army Ranger who in 2008 risked his life to save his \nfellow soldiers on the battlefields of Afghanistan and who was awarded \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor by President Obama in July.\n  I was humbled to be at the White House along with Sergeant First \nClass Petry's family, friends, and fellow soldiers as President Obama \nhonored him with the Congressional Medal of Honor. It was truly a \nspecial day for everyone involved as we honored only the second living, \nactive-duty service member to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor \nfor actions in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  On July 12, I detailed the actions of Sergeant First Class Petry. \nUnder enemy fire, with bullet wounds in both of his legs, Sergeant \nFirst Class Petry still had the courage and valor to render aid to his \nfellow Rangers and to throw a grenade that landed near his fellow \nsoldiers back towards the enemy.\n  When the grenade exploded, it took with it Sergeant First Class \nPetry's hand, but not his spirit. Not even the loss of a hand would \nstop him from fighting the enemy and supporting his unit. He would tie \na tourniquet to his arm and continue the fight.\n  As I have said before, Sergeant First Class Petry's story is one of \ncourage and sacrifice and immense love of country. It is a story that \nbegan years ago in Santa Fe with a young man who struggled in high \nschool but refused to give up, to drop out and instead buckled down, \ndug deep, and found the hero within. A hero to the men he saved that \nfateful day in Afghanistan, and a hero to all Americans who owe their \nfreedoms to our brave men and women in uniform.\n  Today, let us honor him further with this resolution and send the \nmessage that Congress honors his service and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/01/senate-section/article/S5197-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1466.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1466) to establish the Commission on Freedom of \n     Information Act Processing Delays.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I joined Senator Cornyn in \nreintroducing the Faster FOIA Act of 2011, a bipartisan bill to \nstrengthen the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. Last week, the House \nRepublican leadership stripped these FOIA provisions from legislation \nthat unanimously passed the Senate in May as part of a procedural \nmaneuver to address unrelated issues surrounding the debt limit. I urge \nthe Senate to promptly reaffirm its bipartisan commitment to open \ngovernment and to once again pass the Leahy-Cornyn Faster FOIA Act of \n2011 so that this good government bill can be enacted into law.\n  The Faster FOIA Act enjoys broad bipartisan support from across the \npolitical spectrum. The Senate unanimously passed this bill in May, \nafter the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill by voice \nvote. Recently, more than 35 transparency organizations urged the House \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform to act on this \nlegislation. On July 26, the Washington Post editorialized that the \nHouse should promptly enact this bipartisan bill to improve the FOIA \nprocess.\n  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced the Faster FOIA Act in 2005 to \naddress the growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal \nagencies. During the intervening years, the problem of excessive FOIA \ndelays has not gone away. We reintroduced this bill in 2010, and the \nSenate unanimously passed it last year. The current bill is the most \nrecent product of our bipartisan work to help reinvigorate FOIA.\n  The Faster FOIA Act would establish a bipartisan Commission on \nFreedom of Information Act Processing Delays to examine the root causes \nof excessive FOIA delays. The Commission would recommend to Congress \nand the President steps that should be taken to reduce these delays so \nthat the administration of the FOIA is more equitable and efficient.\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\n  The Faster FOIA Act will help ensure the dissemination of government \ninformation to the American people so that our Democracy remains \nvibrant and free. This is a laudable goal that we all share. Neither \nChamber of Congress should allow partisan politics to obstruct the \nimportant goal of this bill.\n  The ongoing debate in Congress about the national debt has made clear \nthat we must find ways to work together, across party lines and \nideologies, to address the many challenges facing our Nation. This \nbipartisan spirit is at the core of the Faster FOIA Act. I have said \nmany times that open government is neither a Democratic issue nor a \nRepublican issue it is truly an American value and virtue that we all \nmust uphold. I urge the Senate to promptly pass this bill and I hope \nthat the House of Representatives will quickly follow suit and enact \nthis good government measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post editorial entitled: \n``Time to Reinforce FOIA'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 26, 2011]\n\n                Freedom of Information Act Needs a Push\n\n       This year marks the 45th anniversary of the Freedom of \n     Information Act, FOIA, a crucial, if sometimes sluggish, \n     vehicle through which journalists can demand greater \n     government openness and accountability. In May, in a rare \n     moment of bipartisanship, Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and \n     John Cornyn (R-Tex.) won unanimous Senate passage of the \n     Faster FOIA Act, which would establish an advisory panel to \n     examine the backlog of more than 69,000 FOIA requests. It's \n     time for the House to take it up.\n       While the panel would be authorized only to provide \n     Congress with recommendations for further action to enhance \n     the filing and receipt of FOIA requests, it would be a small \n     step forward. At best, the panel could develop the means to \n     enforce the 20-day standard for the screening of requests, \n     which, in reality, can take months or years.\n       As much as FOIA can be a journalist's best friend, it can \n     also be a nightmare. Despite amendments in 2007 and 2009, the \n     FOIA process remains beset by incompetence and lack of \n     guidance for evaluating requests. ``The overarching problem \n     is inadequate implementation and compliance among the \n     agencies,'' Malcolm Byrne, deputy director at the National \n     Security Archive, told us.\n       Despite a 2009 executive order that instructed all federal \n     agencies to open more documents to the public--to err on the \n     side of openness when deciding whether to release documents--\n     government offices have classified more documents since \n     President Obama took office, according to the Federation of \n     American Scientists.\n       The executive order tried to force all federal agencies to \n     implement new regulations to ensure greater transparency in \n     the disclosure process. But this hasn't happened, either. A \n     report by the Information Security Oversight Office in April \n     found that less than half of 41 evaluated agencies had made \n     significant efforts toward this end.\n       These facts should reinforce the need for progress, however \n     modest, when it comes to improving the FOIA process. While \n     there was no opposition to the Faster FOIA legislation in the \n     Senate, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House \n     Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has yet to take a \n     position on the bill, according to a spokesman. We urge him \n     to embrace it in the same bipartisan spirit as the Senate, \n     and to do so immediately.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, there be no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1466) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
