He hasn't been there that long, but he came \nas a superstar and has changed that school district dramatically. He \nhas raised student achievement, and he has improved the graduation \nrate. He has great teachers, administrators, and the whole staff has \ndone very well.\n  During the short time he has been there--some 2 years--the graduation \nrates have increased by almost 25 percent. That is unheard of around \nthis country, and this is a metropolitan area. His success is a \ntestament to the impact quality educators have on school achievement \nand on students' lives.\n  I was pleased to submit a letter in support of Dr. Morrison's \ncandidacy for this honor. He certainly deserves this recognition. So I \nlook forward to continuing my work with Dr. Morrison and the Washoe \nCounty School District to help improve education for Nevada students. \nThe entire school district, including the school board, is to be \ncommended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S880-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRANSPORTATION AND PAYROLL TAX NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, thanks to bipartisan cooperation, the \nconference committee reached an agreement to extend the payroll tax cut \nand unemployment insurance. This compromise effort also protects \nMedicare patients' right to choose the doctors who take care of them.\n  I commend the members of the conference committee for their diligence \nand dedication--for holding a lot more conference sessions. That is the \nway this place should be. They are hard and difficult, and they are \nrepresentative of this body. It is hard to arrive at a result, but they \ndid.\n  The Senate will vote on that conference report as soon as we can \ntoday. Of course, we will need Republican support to pass it. But the \nstatements made by my friend, the Republican leader, make it pretty \nclear we will get Republican support because, among other things, \nSenator McConnell said Republicans strongly support extending this tax \ncut for the rest of the year, and that is good.\n  Americans are waiting and watching what happens here today. With our \neconomy gaining steam--though still fragile--it is crucial we prevent a \ntax increase on 160 million Americans, and these are working Americans. \nIt is also important to protect the safety net for millions of \nAmericans who can't find work. We have 3\\1/2\\ million people who are in \nsome stage of unemployment in this great country, and we must protect \nseniors' access to quality medical care by protecting a drastic pay \ncut--by preventing a drastic pay cut for the doctors who take care of \nthem.\n  An agreement to solve these issues was possible because Republicans \nlearned the meaning of the word ``compromise.'' Both sides gave a \nlittle to get something done for the American people. We don't have to \nhave a fight on everything. I have said that so many times recently. We \nneed to work together.\n  We have coming up soon this transportation legislation. I am not \nhappy with the amendments the Republicans have offered. I don't like \nthem. They are not relevant or germane, most of them. But they have a \nright to offer those amendments, so we will have to work our way \nthrough those. I hope my Republican colleagues will understand when we \nget back that they can't have them all. But I will make an effort to go \nthrough those. We will have some votes the Republicans will not want to \ntake either, but we will work through this and get this very important \nbill done.\n  Whether it is the State of Iowa, the State of Delaware, or the State \nof Nevada, it doesn't matter what State we are looking at, this bill is \nimportant because it means jobs and it is helping our infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, we have had thousands of organizations supporting this \nlegislation. Well, that is an exaggeration, but more than 1,000--\nhundreds and hundreds: AAA, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, all the \nconstruction groups, and labor unions wrote letters to us to get this \npassed. A number of them have written letters saying: Stop offering \nthese irrelevant, ideological amendments to this bill. These groups \nbelieve, as I do, this measure is essential to job creation and \neconomic growth. This legislation is too important for more delays.\n  Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, their highway bill is so \nbad they had to take it down. The view of the Congressional Budget \nOffice was that it would bankrupt the trust fund.\n  The highway bill has been paid for with a trust fund. People who buy \nsome gasoline or diesel fuel pay a tax, and that goes into this big \ntrust fund and allows us to do the infrastructure. But because of the \neconomy and people's driving habits being different, the trust fund \ndoesn't have enough money. That is why the Finance Committee, on a \nbipartisan basis, had to report enough out to fill up that trust fund. \nBut it wasn't much money.\n  But what the Republicans have done is, in effect, place a tax on \nFederal employees to do that. That will never sell, Mr. President. That \njust will not work. We have to have bipartisan legislation.\n  So I hope the House, during its break period, will understand that we \nhave to work together. We are going to send them a bill, and I hope \nthey get one that is better than the one they can't now do and put one \ntogether they might be able to do. Then we will have a conference and \nwork this out.\n  Mr. President, compromise worked for the payroll tax conference \ncommittee. It always works. So I look forward to that day and a \nsignificant accomplishment for this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S880-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in recent weeks, we have seen the Obama \nadministration reverse quite a few of its positions on very important \nissues, so I am going to go through several of those positions that \nhave been reversed to remind people of the number and the consequences \nof those reversals, and also to remind people that when Presidents make \npromises, they do not always keep them.\n  This has continued to be a recurring pattern, where the \nadministration's deeds have not lived up to its words. Here is the \nrecord:\n  The administration reversed its position on employer funding for \nemployee contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs \nunder the new health care law. Those of us who opposed the President's \nlaw when it was passed in 2009 and 2010 warned Catholic groups that, if \nit passed--meaning if the health care reform bill passed--religious \ninstitutions would be required to pay for these services.\n  For some religious institutions, payment or providing these services \nwould violate their constitutional right to freely exercise their \nreligion under the first amendment. Sure enough, when the Department of \nHealth and Human Services issued a regulation implementing the \nPresident's health care law, religious-affiliated entities, such as \ncolleges, hospitals, and charitable organizations, were required to pay \nfor these services. If these institutions did not pay, then they would \nface a $2,000 fine per employee, per year under the health care reform \nbill.\n  Many Catholic entities objected. They correctly saw the rule as a \nthreat to their freedom of conscience, protected by the first \namendment. But many non-Catholics also were angered. They knew and \nfeared that if the health care reform bill proposed by President Obama \nallowed the government to run roughshod over some people's freedom to \npractice their religion,\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\nit could do the same for practices of other religions beyond \nCatholicism. The regulation was a direct assault on freedom of \nconscience, and the American people knew it.\n  It was no longer a contraceptive issue. The issue was freedom of \nreligion. So last week the President ordered a change. No longer would \nthe employer, such as religiously affiliated institutions, have to pay \nfor coverage of services to which it conscientiously objected. Instead, \nthe cost supposedly would be paid by insurance companies. Of course, \nsomebody will ultimately have to pay the cost.\n  After the President's reversal, employers will still pay insurance \ncompanies to provide for coverage and, more directly hitting the \ninstitutions, those that are self-insured will still have to pay not \nindirectly but very directly.\n  Since the substance has not changed, the change appears to be \ndesigned to undercut opposition rather than to respond to legitimate \nobjections to the earlier policy. Then we get back to basics: There is \nno such thing as a free lunch. We have to wonder how carefully the \noriginal policy was vetted by the administration.\n  As a result, President Obama has been accused of waging war on \nreligion. This particular policy violated the rights of religious \nentities and individuals, and the administration considers the matter \nsomehow to simply be closed by the press announcement 1 week ago. But \nthe Catholic bishops and many other religious organizations violently \ndisagree. So Congress may have to overturn the policy if we want to \nabide by the strict words of the Constitution and freedom of religion, \nbecause if we don't, I expect the President's new policy will be \nchallenged in the courts on the first amendment, free exercise clause, \nand the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n  Moving on to another change of policy. Another recent policy shift \noccurred on a different first amendment issue beyond freedom of \nreligion. Turning to the right of free speech.\n  The Supreme Court ruled that the first amendment required that \ncorporations and labor unions be allowed to make independent \nexpenditures on behalf of candidates. President Obama severely \ncriticized that ruling of a couple years ago, and right after it was \nmade he even objected in his State of the Union Address right in front \nof the same Supreme Court Justices. Even the New York Times has said \nhis criticism at that time of the Citizens United decision was probably \nwrong. Nonetheless, President Obama has repeatedly said he thinks the \nruling harms democracy.\n  But now, President Obama has changed his mind. He is encouraging, \nunder Citizens United, donors to give to a super PAC that supports his \ncandidacy. He now says Democrats need to match the Republicans to tap \nthese sources of campaign funds.\n  Here, though, he has made more than a 180-degree turn. He has gone \nbeyond simply asking donors to give to super PACs that independently \nsupport his candidacy. Under the new policy, even White House staffers \nand Cabinet Secretaries can attend super PAC events.\n  At these events, corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals can \npay large sums for access to key administration policymakers. These \nadministration officials do not directly ask for money, of course, but \nthey help to raise unlimited funds from corporations and unions. Of \ncourse, this is allowed under Citizens United, but it is the very same \ndecision the President criticized and now he is going against his own \ncriticism.\n  I do not know what principled position would allow a President to \ncondemn a decision and then have his administration officials help \ncorporations and unions capitalize on that decision for his benefit.\n  I suspect, of course, that the President would say he will still \noppose that decision, even if he indirectly obtains the benefits of the \nCitizens United case. But I think it is very important that we \nunderstand letting a President have it both ways is not principled.\n  Let us consider another issue--the issue of lobbyists. In December \n2011, through a fundraising e-mail, President Obama wrote:\n\n       We don't take a dime for D.C. lobbyists or special-interest \n     PACs--never have and never will.\n\n  But one of his campaign bundlers, former Representative Ron Klein, \nhas raised between $200,000 and $500,000 for the Obama campaign. Do you \nknow what. Mr. Klein is a registered Federal lobbyist.\n  On the 2008 campaign trail, President Obama pledged there would be no \nrevolving door between lobbying and serving in his administration. He \nissued an Executive order to bar former lobbyists from joining his \nadministration to work at agencies they recently lobbied. Yet he issued \na waiver allowing William Lynn, who had been a top lobbyist for a major \ndefense contractor, to manage day-to-day operations at the Pentagon. \nMore recently, he made Cecilia Munoz the head of his Domestic Policy \nCouncil. Ms. Munoz was a registered lobbyist through 2008. The \nadministration has admitted to granting waivers for only a few \nlobbyists. Yet it has declined to identify all lobbyists to whom it \ngranted waivers.\n  The promise of transparency doesn't apply in this case, evidently. So \nthe President's actual policy is, ``No lobbyists in my administration, \nunless I absolutely want them.''\n  Then there is the President's public commitment to transparency in \ngovernment. I just mentioned one violation of that transparency. Now we \ngo on to talk about his transparency problem.\n  President Obama issued an Executive order to department heads. The \norder reads:\n\n       My administration is committed to creating an unprecedented \n     level of openness in government. We will work together to \n     ensure the public trust and establish a system of \n     transparency . . . ''\n\n  But that is not policy the administration followed in responding to \nFreedom of Information Act requests. The Obama Justice Department \nadvised agencies to tell Freedom of Information Act requesters seeking \ncertain national security- or law enforcement-related documents that \nthose documents did not exist.\n  He said to tell them these documents do not exist, even if the agency \nknew the documents did exist.\n  The process seems to have been to make a grand pronouncement and \nscore political points. Then, when they think no one is paying \nattention, the policy shifts. I do not know who was responsible for \nvetting this blatantly dishonest policy, but the predictable firestorm \nensued and, thank God, the administration has now backed down.\n  This is not the only instance of the administration failing to \npractice what it preached concerning FOIA requests. A different Obama \nExecutive order gave these directions:\n\n       The government should not keep information confidential \n     merely because public officials might be embarrassed by \n     disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or \n     because of speculative or abstract fears.\n       Nondisclosure should never be based on an effort to protect \n     the personal interests of government officials at the expense \n     of those they are supposed to serve.\n\n  That is not how the Department of Homeland Security handled FOIA \nrequests. Homeland Security FOIA requests were sent to the Secretary's \noffice for political appointees to review. Career FOIA staff were not \nallowed to respond to the requests without the approval of political \nappointees.\n  The House Governmental Reform and Oversight Committee has \ndemonstrated these political officials misused FOIA exemptions to \nprevent the release of embarrassing records. This was in direct \nviolation of the President's promise.\n  Moving on. As a candidate, President Obama stated that:\n\n       [i]t is a clear abuse of power to use [signing] statements \n     as a license to evade law that the President does not like or \n     as an end-run around provisions designed to foster \n     accountability. I will not use signing statements to nullify \n     or undermine congressional instructions as enacted into law.\n\n  However, in his first year in office, President Obama signed an \nomnibus appropriations bill that contained a standard provision that \nFederal funds could not be used to pay the salary of Federal employees \nwho attempted or threatened to prevent another Federal employee from \ncommunicating with Congress.\n  This provision has always provided important protection for \nwhistleblowers against waste, fraud, and abuse in government, and \nsomehow these whistleblowers, under the President's signing statement, \nwouldn't dare talk to Senator Grassley or other Senators about waste, \nfraud, and abuse. So how\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nare we supposed to find out about it? Whistleblowers are very helpful.\n  It happens that President Obama's signing statement contended that \nthis provision did not detract from his authority to direct department \nheads to supervise employee communication with Congress. Worse, it said \nthis authority would be used when employee communication would reveal \n``confidential information.''\n  This signing statement, if carried out, would undermine congressional \ninstructions as enacted into law, and it would harm the ability of \nCongress to conduct its constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the \nexecutive branch.\n  Then just this week, the President flipped again on yet another \nsubject. In 2009, he said he was ``pledging to cut the deficit we \ninherited in half by the end of my first term in office.''\n  At the time he was sworn in, the deficit was $1.3 trillion. The \nfiscal year 2013 budget the President has just proposed would create a \n$900 billion deficit--much more than half of the 2009 level that he \npromised to cut in half. This is true even after he proposes to raise \ntaxes, since the amount of the new government spending he seeks is so \nenormous.\n  This is a long list of flip-flops, of failure to keep commitments, \nand hypocrisy. There are others as well.\n  I give the President the benefit of the doubt in his altered views of \nthe PATRIOT Act, Guantanamo, and other national security issues. He \nholds an office in which he sees daily the unrelenting national \nsecurity threats the country faces. But for the other issues I have \nraised, the consistency of the Obama administration is its \ninconsistency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am not sure what the order is here. I am \nhappy to defer to whatever has been agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This is the third anniversary of the President's nearly $1 \ntrillion stimulus bill. But it is not an anniversary worth celebrating.\n  Back then, the Obama administration promised the American people that \nthe stimulus bill, if passed, would keep unemployment below 8 percent \nand create 3.5 million jobs. So let's look at where we are today.\n  The unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent for a record 36 \nmonths, and our economy has lost nearly one-half million jobs since the \nstimulus was passed.\n  We can't conclude anything else other than the fact that the stimulus \nhas failed--and failed badly. It was a misuse of hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars, and it proves that when government tries to pick winners, many \nof their choices such as Solyndra, turn out to be losers and all that \nat the expense of the American taxpayer.\n  By looking at the President's budget proposal that we are going to be \ndealing with this year for the next fiscal year, it appears the \nadministration has not learned from its past mistakes.\n  Despite some glimmers of hope for improvement in our economy, today \nmillions of Americans awoke across the country without a job.\n  This morning, millions of Americans are wondering how to make their \nnext mortgage payment, how to pay for their medical bills, and how to \nfill up their gas tanks without breaking the bank. But little is being \ndone here in Washington to address this. While it is obvious that there \nare no silver bullets or short-term fixes to this problem, we have not \ntaken the necessary steps to get ahold of our larger fiscal issue and \nproblem--the growing red ink and debt our economy is being burdened \nwith through the policies that are enacted and not enacted here in \nWashington.\n  The Obama budget is out of touch with the reality of our fiscal \nsituation. The President's fiscal year 2013 budget increases spending \nevery year, proposes the largest tax increase in history, burdens the \ncountry with more debt, and never balances the budget. As we have seen \nbefore, the administration's budget principles cannot be anything but \nspend more, borrow more, and tax more. This is a failed approach, it is \ndropping us deeper and deeper into debt, and making our solutions more \ndifficult every day that we spend more than we take in.\n  One of the major things we have not addressed this year because we \nhave not exhibited the will to do so is failure to address \nentitlements. Entitlements and mandatory spending plus the interest we \npay on borrowed debt continue to eat up ever more of our budget, a \nlarger and ever growing percentage which will continue over the next \nyears at a staggering number. It simply is not sustainable. While we \nmust work to save our safety net programs that we have promised the \nAmerican people, we need to understand that doing nothing makes the \nsituation worse and does not do anything to help retirees. We have to \nbe honest--with those retirees and those nearing retirement and those \nwho are looking to the future--about the solvency of the Social \nSecurity trust fund and the solvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  Medicare is projected to go broke by 2024. Over the next decade, \nSocial Security spending will grow by 6 percent annually, and by 2026, \nbenefits for all retirees will have to be cut by a minimum of 23 \npercent if we are to keep the trust fund solvent. The gravest threat to \nMedicare and Social Security is doing nothing. We in fact are doing \nnothing.\n  We will have legislation to vote on here today that further \nexacerbates the problem of the Social Security trust fund. This is \ncouched as a tax break for American people to be extended as a result \nof a payroll tax cut on their Social Security contributions. So instead \nof putting today's requirement of a percentage of your income into the \nSocial Security trust fund for the benefit of retirees and our own \nretirement when we finish our careers, and the American people's \nretirement, we are deducting from that trust fund money that is going \nto have to be paid back. It is a shell game. We are telling the \nAmerican people they are going to continue for the next year to get a \npayroll tax cut but the tax cut is taken out of the contribution to the \nSocial Security trust fund. I am amazed that AARP or Save Social \nSecurity or all the entities that put ads on the air and send mailers \nto people around the country that say don't let Congress cut our \nMedicare funds, don't let cut Congress cut our Social Security--where \nare they today, saying Congress is robbing our Social Security trust \nfund and then they call this a tax cut?\n  Be honest with the American people. We are simply taking money from \nthe trust fund for retiree benefits, making Social Security come closer \nand closer to bankruptcy and insolvency, at the same time not telling \nthe American people that this so-called tax cut is robbing that fund.\n  We will be presented with a vote today to be honest with the American \npeople, saying you have a shell game going on here that will have to be \nrepaired, probably with borrowed dollars, that is going to make our \nsituation worse, yet we go home and say we have extended a tax cut for \nyou. Let's at least be honest with the American people and straight out \nand tell them we are taking the money out of your Social Security trust \nfund to extend the program here to give you a so-called tax break. It \nis a shell game. It is going to have to be repaid.\n  I think it is clear that we simply have not addressed the fundamental \nproblems underlying the fiscal situation that exists here in the United \nStates. Until we level with the American people and until we have the \nwill to step forward and do what is necessary to save this country from \ndefault, to save these social safety net programs from default, we will \nbe continuing what has been done in the past, and that is leaving us in \nan ever more precarious position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President I come to the floor today with a number \nof my women Senate colleagues to talk about what happened yesterday at \nthe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. They held a \nhearing on the administration's decision to\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\nmake sure that women have access to affordable contraception, but guess \nwho was missing. The women. This is a picture of the first panel from \nyesterday's hearing. Not one woman was seated at this table, not one \nwoman at the table, yet the topic was women's health.\n  What is more difficult to understand is that when female members of \nthe House committee asked for a woman to testify along with the men, \nthey were denied. Their request was simple: to allow Sandra Fluke, a \nGeorgetown Law School student, to testify on this panel of all men. As \na woman she could speak firsthand about how this rule would impact \nwomen. But their request was denied because the chairman said Sandra \nFluke was unqualified.\n  How can a woman be unqualified to talk about women's health care? Yet \nevery one of these men on the panel was deemed to be qualified to talk \nabout women's health care. I am disappointed. I know it is a \ndisappointment that is shared by millions of women across this country. \nI am saddened that here we are, in 2012, and a House committee would \nhold a hearing on women's health and deny women the ability to share \ntheir perspective.\n  Time and time again, women have been silenced in this discussion, a \ndiscussion about our own very personal health care decisions. In fact, \na recent analysis of the leading cable news channels showed that almost \ntwice as many men as women were invited to join the conversation.\n  I think it is critical to understand that the underlying issue here \nis about affordable access to contraception--something that is basic to \nwomen's health. Birth control is something that most women use at some \npoint in their lifetime and something that the medical community \nbelieves is essential to the health of women and their families. \nResearch shows that access to birth control is directly linked to \ndeclines in maternal and infant mortality, that it can reduce the risk \nof ovarian cancer, and that it is linked to overall good health \noutcomes.\n  Some women, 14 percent of them, use birth control not as \ncontraceptives but to treat serious medical conditions. That is about \n1.5 million women.\n  When the administration first announced its decision to require \nemployers to offer health insurance coverage for contraception, there \nwas a robust conversation about religious liberty. In response to that, \nthe President modified his decision last week, preserving the religious \nliberty of those religiously affiliated institutions, such as hospitals \nor universities, but also protecting the women who work for them. His \ndecision ensured that all women have access to contraceptive coverage, \nand if a woman's employer has a religious objection, women can get that \ncritical coverage directly from their health plans.\n  The Catholic Health Association has supported this policy, and yet, \nas we saw yesterday, some attempt to continue to politicize this issue. \nWe cannot lose sight that this is at the most fundamental level of \ndebate about women's preventive health.\n  Women deserve a voice in this debate because, after all, in the end \nthis is about our health and it is about a health care decision that is \nbetween women, their families, their doctors, and their own faith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  For millions of American women, reading the news this morning was \nlike stepping into a time machine and going back 50 years, seeing the \nheadlines and the photos of this all-male panel in the House talking \nabout a woman's right to access birth control, and no women on the \npanel. It turns out the chairman of the House oversight committee \ndecided he was not going to allow a young woman who had been asked by \nthe minority to testify and tell her story--actually of a friend who \nhad lost an ovary because of her lack of contraception coverage. So \nthis 19-year-old woman was left to watch, like the rest of us, as all \nfive men addressed the committee about how they supported efforts to \nrestrict access to care.\n  I am sure by now many of my colleagues here have seen this picture of \nthis all-male panel, the picture that says a thousand words. It is one \nthat most women thought was left behind when pictures only came in \nblack and white.\n  But this was not the only story this morning that made women feel as \nif the clock had been turned back on them. The other story comes to us \nfrom the Republican Presidential nomination trail. It seems that \nyesterday, on national television, one of the chief financial backers \nfor Rick Santorum, the Republican candidate who is now surging toward \nthe nomination, suggested that contraception was once as simple as a \nwoman putting aspirin between her knees. Really? Shocking. Appalling. \nAn insult. In fact, both of these stories are enough to make any woman, \nregardless of her own politics, angry. It certainly does me.\n  These are things that are happening today and they are enough to make \nyou believe that after years of progress, nothing has changed. For many \nwomen and men who are waking up to the news this morning, it may seem \nthis is a swift and sudden attack on women's health care, but I am here \non the floor of the Senate today to tell you all there is nothing \nsudden about it. There is nothing new about these Republican attacks on \nour family planning decisions. In fact, from the moment they came into \npower, Republicans in the House of Representatives have been waging a \nwar on women's health. If you do not believe me, look at the first \nbills they introduced after they arrived here in Washington, DC, and \nwere sworn into office. After campaigning across the country on a \nplatform of jobs and the economy, the first three bills they introduced \nwere direct attacks on women's health in America.\n  The very first bill, H.R. 1, would have totally eliminated title X \nfunding for family planning and teen pregnancy prevention. It included \nan amendment that would have completely defunded Planned Parenthood and \ncut off support for millions of women who count on it.\n  Another one of their opening round of bills, more than a year ago, \nwould have permanently codified the Hyde amendment and the DC abortion \nban, and the original version of their bill did not even include an \nexception for the health of the mother.\n  Finally, they introduced a bill right away that would have rolled \nback every single one of the gains we worked so hard to get for women \nin the health care reform bill. It would have removed the caps on out-\nof-pocket expenses that protect women from losing their homes and their \nlife savings if they get sick. It ended the ban on lifetime limits on \ncoverage. It allowed insurance companies to once again discriminate \nagainst women by charging them higher premiums or even denying women \naccess for so-called preexisting conditions--that, by the way, includes \npregnancy.\n  It would have rolled back the guarantee that insurance companies \ncover contraceptive activities, which will save the overwhelming \nmajority of women who use them hundreds of dollars a year.\n  In addition to showing their true colors with their very first \nlegislative efforts, Republicans have shown they will go to about any \nlimit to restrict our access to care, even shutting down the Federal \nGovernment. It seems extreme? That is exactly what happened last April, \nwhen Republicans nearly shuttered the Federal Government over a rider \nthat was another attempt to go after title X and Planned Parenthood.\n  I remember, I was in those meetings, months and months of \nnegotiations on the numbers in our budget. I was astonished that \nRepublicans, late at night, were willing to throw all that work away to \ngo after women's health. I was the only woman in the room that night. I \ncan remember being personally disgusted that Republicans thought they \ncould get away with making women victims, under the cover of darkness, \nin the middle of the night, with moments to go before the government \nwas shut down.\n  But I also remember the resounding ``no'' when they tried to pull \nthat, first from me, then from my women colleagues joining me today, \nand then a loud and overwhelming chorus of men and women all across the \ncountry. That chorus of women was heard again a few weeks ago after yet \nanother attack on women's health care. This time the attack came \ncloaked in a sham investigation led by some of the same\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\ncongressional Republicans who yesterday had this all-male panel talking \nabout women's contraception. It was an investigation of the Susan G. \nKomen Breast Cancer charity sites to cut off funding for lifesaving \nbreast cancer screenings for women. We know what happened after the \noutcry followed that decision. I certainly remember going home and \nstanding shoulder to shoulder with women and men in my home State in \nfront of a clinic that provided those breast screening referrals and \npledging to safeguard against any future attacks in the wake of that \ndecision, but I didn't think it would come the very next week. \nApparently, Republicans are still not done. Even after the loud rebuke \nafter the Komen decision, they have decided again to pick on women's \nhealth.\n\n  Just last week, the junior Senator from Missouri introduced an \namendment to a job-creating transportation infrastructure bill that is \nas extreme as anything we have seen. It is an amendment that will allow \nany employer--a barber, a banker, a multinational corporation--to be \ngiven an exemption to not cover contraception or any essential \npreventive for any religious or moral reason. It is an amendment that \nwould give any employer an unprecedented license to dictate what women \ncan and cannot have covered. It puts your employer smack in the middle \nbetween you and your health care. It is politics between women and \ntheir health care, and before the news that women across the country \nawoke to this morning, it was just the most recent in a very long line \nof attacks on our reproductive rights.\n  Contraceptive coverage should not be a controversial issue. It is \nsupported by the vast majority of Americans who understand how \nimportant it is for women and their families, but let me remind \neveryone Republicans have made it clear from the start this is not \nabout what is best for women or men or their family-planning decisions, \nit is apparently a political calculation. This is about their \nconstituency. It is about their continued push to do whatever it takes \nto push their extreme agenda.\n  The women of the Senate, the Democratic women, are here to say \nenough. We are standing today and every day to fight for women and \ntheir right to make their own basic health care decisions, not their \nemployer, not an extreme part of the Republican Party, not some men on \na panel but themselves. We will continue to do so, and I am proud to \nstand with the women of the Senate to do just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nconsume 3 minutes and my colleague from California may also consume 3 \nminutes before we move on to the next matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I have said it time and time again \nall across New York State at event after event: We need more women's \nvoices in our decisionmaking process. We need more women at the table \nin government and in business. When women are at the table, they bring \na very different perspective to the same problems, a different set of \nsolutions, a different approach. At the end of the day, the outcomes \nare better when women's voices are heard.\n  But just when I thought I couldn't be any more dumbfounded by the \ndebate around here in terms of denying access to women's health \nservices, there was a hearing yesterday in the House of Representatives \non the topic of contraception and all the witnesses were male. My \ncolleague, Carolyn Maloney, had it quite right when she walked out on \nthat farce.\n  Let me be clear, once again: 99 percent of all America's women have \nused contraception at some time in their lifetime. When will they get \nthis simple, nondebatable fact that the power to decide whether a woman \nwill use contraception lies with her, not her boss, not her employer. \nWhat is more intrusive than trying to allow an employer to make medical \ndecisions for someone who works for them? This has nothing to do with \nreligious freedom, and you don't have to take it from me. Take it from \nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. In the majority decision of the \n1990 case on Employment Division v. Smith, Scalia wrote:\n\n       We have never held that an individual's religious beliefs \n     excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law \n     prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate.\n\n  It is time to end this ridiculous, ideological fight once and for all \nand get back to the real business at hand of growing our economy and \ngetting Americans back to work.\n  But if our Republican colleagues want to continue to take this issue \nhead on, we will stand here as often as is necessary and draw a line in \nthe sand that the women of the Senate will continue to oppose these \nattacks on women's rights and women's health care.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of my fellow colleagues this morning. They are eloquent. When I \nlooked at this scene that Senator Murray and Senator Shaheen had up \nhere and looked at this picture of this panel that is supposed to be \nspeaking about women's health--in particular, birth control--obviously \nI was stunned. It brought back a memory from 20 years ago when all of \nAmerica looked at the Senate and saw there was not one woman on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and they realized that year, in 1991, that \nthere were only two women in the entire Senate. It sent shockwaves \nthrough the country. Whether one agreed with Anita Hill or Clarence \nThomas, that was not the point. We had very strong feelings about that \non both sides.\n  The point of this is that on an issue so critical to this Nation, the \nnext Supreme Court Justice, there was not one woman on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and we had the ``Year of the Woman,'' and we \ntripled the number of women in the Senate. It wasn't much, 2 to 6, but \nit was a start, and now we are at 17, and we are going higher because \nyesterday this is what America saw, a Republican House of \nRepresentatives that is so hostile to women's health that they didn't \neven think about having a person on there who was a female, nor did \nthey have anyone on there that agreed it is important that women have \naccess to birth control knowing that for many women birth control is \nmedicine, knowing that 99 percent of women, sometime in her lifetime, \nutilized birth control.\n  So this picture is worth a thousand words. I have a 16-year-old \ngrandson. I came home, I had this picture in my hand. I went up to \nhim--he's not particularly political--and I said: Zach, what do you \nnotice about this? He said: ``It's all dudes.'' This does not take a \ndegree in political science to see what is going on here. When we come \nback, we are going to be on the highway bill. There will be some bumps \nin the road along the way, but at one point we will probably have an \namendment to vote on called the Blunt amendment. As we get to that \nlater, I will talk about it.\n  But Senator Blunt, a Republican Senator from Missouri, has put \nforward an amendment that would allow any single employer--regardless \nof how large or small their operation--to deny essential health care to \ntheir employees and preventive health care if they simply say it is a \nmatter of conscience. It is right there. Senator Blunt says: Oh, no. I \nheard Senator Brown defending Senator Blunt saying: No, no. Oh, yes. \nJust read it and look at the list of lifesaving and health-saving \nservices that would be denied.\n  So women of America and the men who care about you, get ready because \nthere is an assault on women, and stand with us.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I would yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues from \nCalifornia, New York, New Hampshire, and Washington State for the great \njob they have done. Before I speak about our judicial nominee, I wish \nto say I join them in their remarks and their feelings. This is about \nwomen's health, and women and men all over America are scratching their \nheads and saying: Are we fighting against contraception? Are we turning \nthe clock back 60 or 70 years? It makes no sense.\n  If a woman wants contraception for either birth control or other \nhealth purposes--and most women use it for other health purposes--it is \nup to that woman, not her employer. That is the\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\nbottom line. The vast majority of Americans, men and women, agree with \nthat statement. That is true of every major religion from the polling \ndata I have seen.\n  Frankly, I don't understand this Republican Party. First, they made \nwar on the Hispanic community, one of the fastest growing segments in \nAmerica on immigration, and now they are making a war on the majority \nof America, women. While not every woman feels the way we do, the vast \nmajority of women do. So I don't get it.\n  Then to take an amendment such as that from my friend from Missouri \nand expand it even further and say, if someone owns a McDonald's, they \ncan decide to not provide contraceptive services--the real reason might \nbe because they don't want to pay extra or other reasons that are not \nreligiously based--I don't get it.\n  I hope we do have a vote on the Blunt amendment because I think the \nAmerican people would not be for that amendment on an overwhelming \nbasis. The more they learn about it, the more that happens, and that is \nwhy the tide is moving in that direction.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for allowing me to say a few words on \nthat issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S885-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FURMAN NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of Jesse Furman, who is \na nominee for the District Court in the Southern District.\n  I have had the good fortune to present to the President more than 13 \nnominees for the Federal bench, every one of them is incredibly \naccomplished. Each represents the best of the bar that the State of New \nYork has to offer. I believe in excellence, moderation, and diversity, \nwhich are the three standards I use. But on the standard of excellence, \nJesse is no exception to my standard of excellence. In fact, he doesn't \njust meet it, he shatters it. He is one of the most brilliant lawyers \nin the country. He is amazing. The fact that he wants to serve our \nFederal Government on the bench is a tribute to us all. It is a tribute \nto our country and to him.\n  How about moderation? This is the issue I wish to speak most to my \ncolleagues about. Who was his protege in many ways? Judge Mukasey. He \nworked for Judge Mukasey as a clerk and then as attorney general. A lot \nof people on this side of the aisle, including myself, have real \ndifferences with Judge Mukasey, but if we cannot support Jesse Furman \nfor the nomination, then we cannot support anybody because this \nnomination could have come from a Democrat, it could have come from a \nRepublican, it could have come from a conservative, it could have come \nfrom a liberal. He is truly a mainstream thinker, and so this vote will \nbe indicative. Because if Jesse Furman cannot achieve cloture, then our \nsystem is so paralyzed we better go back to the drawing board because \nit will mean no district court judge can be approved, none.\n  So I would ask Senators on both sides of the aisle to support him. I \nknow we have a number of our Republican colleagues who have said they \nmight support him, and I hope they will. We had a good vote in the \nJudiciary Committee on Jesse Furman. Again, he is truly excellent, \nendorsed by his former coclerks on the Supreme Court, including those \nwho clerked for Justices Rehnquist, Thomas, O'Connor, Kennedy, and \nScalia.\n  John Podhoretz, a conservative columnist, wrote that Furman should be \nconfirmed because he is ``terrifically knowledgeable, entirely \nrespectful of views that differ from his, and utterly without an axe to \ngrind.'' That is why he passed without discussion out of the Judiciary \nCommittee without dissent.\n  Please, colleagues, a vote for Furman will show that we can come \ntogether certainly on a judge of such moderation.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1813, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1813) to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and \n     highway safety construction programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 1633, of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 1634 (to amendment No. 1633), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works, with instructions, Reid \n     amendment No. 1635, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1636 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 1635), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 1637 (to amendment No. 1636), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote \nno on cloture on Senator Reid's amendment No. 1633 to the highway bill. \nThe bill we are getting ready to vote on puts the other titles into the \nhighway bill from the Commerce Committee, Finance Committee, and \nBanking Committee.\n  I am going to object on the grounds that the Commerce Committee title \nis not the title that should be included in this bill. What happened is \nthat there was a partisan amendment that was added to a markup very \nlate that the minority had not had a chance to work out before it went \nto the markup. We thought it wasn't going on the markup, but it did go \non the markup before we were able to have the input and work it in a \nbetter way, which has been our usual position in the Commerce \nCommittee.\n\n  The bill would create an unfunded, unlimited discretionary grant \nprogram that has divided the transportation community. It will add a \nnew Assistant Secretary for Freight Planning and Development and a \nwhole new office in the Department of Transportation. This is a part of \nthe bill that certainly none of the Republicans can support, and it \ncaused a party-line vote in the Commerce Committee.\n  Additionally, the bill that will be before us contains provisions \nthat would create two new programs within the Research and Innovative \nTechnology Administration that would cost taxpayers $28 million \nannually to administer, and the CBO estimates the underlying bill would \ncost $615 million for 10 years including these two new programs. That \nwould be about double what the levels are for this program in today's \nterms. So the next 10 years would have been at $318 million if we had \nkept it at static levels, which we are doing in most other parts of the \nhighway bill. Instead, the bill we are voting on today would more than \ndouble that to $615 million over the next 10 years for RITA.\n  We don't have to have this kind of partisan effort on the bill. Our \nCommerce Committee has been very good at bipartisan work. I see the \nSenator from California on the floor who has worked in a bipartisan way \nwith the Senator from Oklahoma on the underlying bill. But the Commerce \nbill that came out was not bipartisan.\n  We have worked hard with Senator Rockefeller and we have informed all \nof our Members on both sides to get a consensus, and we got one. We got \na consensus that would have taken the Freight Act part of it that set \npolicies for new freight studies--we did that. That part would be in \nthe compromise bill. It keeps the funding in line with current levels \nin the Research and Innovative Transportation Administration. But those \ncompromise provisions that Senator Rockefeller and all of our staffs of \nthe whole committee worked on are not in the bill we are voting on \ntoday.\n  We worked together relating to the importation of motor vehicles and \nequipment in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \nreauthorization bill. It would stop unsafe equipment from entering our \nports. We worked hard to put forward language that provides inspectors \nthe right tools while at the same time minimizing unnecessary costs and \nburdens on equipment manufacturers. Again, the modifications are in the \nbill that we agreed to with the majority in the Commerce Committee, but \nthey are not in the bill\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\nthat came out of the committee and the bill that is on the floor today.\n  The first package of reported bills did not contain a rail title at \nall. So if the bill that is before us today is accepted and cloture is \ninvoked, we will have a Senate highway bill that does not have a rail \nprovision. We will go to conference without a Senate position on a rail \nprovision, which the House has.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I have worked together on this rail part. We \nhave worked with all of the stakeholders in the rail industry as well \nas Amtrak, and we have come forward with a bill the Republicans support \nand most of the Democrats support on the committee. It will lead to \nbetter rail planning at the Department of Transportation, and it will \nenhance rail economic regulation on the Surface Transportation Board. \nThe rail title would also allow the commuter and freight rails to apply \nfor extensions for implementation of positive train control on an as-\nneeded basis, and it directs the DOT to use the 2015 route map to \nimplement positive train control, as Congress intended when it passed \nits law in 2008.\n  All of these important policy gains will be lost if we adopt the \ncloture vote today. I hope my colleagues will vote no on cloture so we \ncan put the provisions that have been agreed to on a bipartisan basis \nin the bill so that the Commerce title will reflect the full Commerce \nCommittee, rather than what came out that had not been fully vetted and \nis not the position of the full Commerce Committee, with Republicans \nand Democrats together. I hope we will have that chance to put the new \nversion together that would include the compromises that have been made \non a bipartisan basis.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield? And I ask unanimous consent that \nshe have an additional 60 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just wanted to make the point that I think Senator \nHutchison has been probably one of the most productive members of the \nCommerce Committee I have ever seen. I have been on that committee for \na very long time. Her relationship with Senator Rockefeller is stellar. \nI too believe she makes a point when she says they have continued to \nwork together since the bill was reported out and they have come to \nagreement.\n  So I guess my question is, as someone who has given flesh, blood, \nsweat, and tears on this highway bill, knowing that we have a couple of \nthese bumps in the road, should we not invoke cloture today--I \npersonally hope we do, and we can fix the bill, but if we don't--and if \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison are able to take their work \nand put that in as a substitute, would my friend be back on board here \nworking toward completion of this bill?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If I understand the question of the Senator from \nCalifornia, if we can substitute at some point the compromise language \nin the Commerce title, I am going to be absolutely supportive of this \nbill because I trust Senator Rockefeller. We have worked together. We \nhave both given. He doesn't like parts of this bill, I don't like parts \nof it, but we have given.\n  I would say the Senator from California has done a stellar job with \nthe Senator from Oklahoma on the underlying bill. Oh my gosh, what a \ncomplicated bill. The Senator from California is the chairman, the \nranking member is from Oklahoma, and they have worked for the good of \nAmerica on this bill. The Banking Committee has a bipartisan title. I \nbelieve there is a compromise coming forward in the Finance Committee. \nI am not familiar with that, but I know the compromise title of the \nCommerce Committee has been worked through fully with everybody on \nboard, and it will be acceptable, I believe, to the whole Senate.\n  So I think we are just a little premature today. I think we need to \nstop cloture. I think we need to make the changes that are required, \nand I think this bill will sail in the future.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Jesse M. \nFurman, of New York, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \ncloture motion on this nomination is withdrawn.\n  There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the \nnomination.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the filibuster \nhas\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\nbeen dropped on this very good man. This nomination has taken months to \nget here. I would urge everybody to vote for it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for pressing \nforward to obtain a vote on the nomination of Jesse Furman, finally \nbringing to an end the 5-month Republican filibuster of this \nnomination. It should not have taken five months and the filing of a \ncloture petition to secure a vote on this superbly qualified, consensus \nnominee. When the Judiciary Committee voted on this nomination last \nSeptember, it had the support of every Democrat and ever Republican on \nthe Committee. Yesterday, I spoke, again, of the dangers posed by this \nRepublican filibuster of a consensus Federal district court nominee. I \nam glad Senate Republicans have backed away from their misguided \neffort.\n  The extended delay in considering the Furman nomination has not only \nbeen damaging to the Federal District Court of New York, but also to \nthe people it serves. This has also led to some extreme groups on the \nfar right making scurrilous attacks on the reputation of this good man. \nI trust that no Senator will credit the mischaracterizations of Mr. \nFurman's record. His role in filing an amicus brief in a First \nAmendment case in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Anti-Defamation \nLeague when he was in private practice has been misquoted and \nmischaracterized to the point where you have to wonder if it is \nintentional. Of course, no lawyer should be disqualified from being a \njudge for advocating on behalf of client. Were the Senate to go down \nthat road, we would disqualify many outstanding lawyers capable of \nbeing excellent judges. Senate Republicans filibustered Judge Jack \nMcConnell of Rhode Island because he represented parents and children \nexposed to health risks by lead in paint. That error should not be \nrepeated.\n  I am glad the Senate is finally voting on this nomination. With 21 \njudicial nominations approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nawaiting a final vote, with one out of every 10 Federal judgeships \nvacant throughout the country, and with the Senate still more than 40 \nconfirmations behind the pace we set with President Bush, the Senate \ncannot afford this continuing obstruction and delay of judicial \nconfirmations. This filibuster, like the filibuster of Judge Adalberto \nJordan that we finally ended earlier this week and others, bring \nderision upon the Senate, are a colossal waste of the time, and harm \nour Federal courts and the American people seeking justice.\n  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to abandon the damaging tactics \nthat led to this unnecessary 5-month filibuster of the Furman \nnomination, the shameful 4-month and 2-day filibuster of the Jordan \nnomination, and to abandon their continued stalling of 20 additional \njudicial nominees ready for final consideration and confirmation. I, \nagain, urge Senate Republicans to join with us to restore the Senate's \nlongstanding practice of considering and confirming consensus nominees \nwithout extended delays. The American people deserve no less.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we turn to the nomination Jesse M. \nFurman, to be U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New \nYork. Mr. Furman was reported out of the Judiciary Committee last fall \nby voice vote.\n  When we considered his nomination last year, a few items of concern \nwere raised. These issues included writings he made while in college on \ngun control and an amicus brief he drafted opposing a religious club's \naccess to school facilities for meetings.\n  Based on his hearing testimony and responses to written questions, I \nwas willing to allow Mr. Furman's nomination to move to the full Senate \nfor consideration.\n  In the interim, conditions have changed which require me to give a \ncloser scrutiny to Mr. Furman's record and to the confirmation process \nin general.\n  Generally, I am willing to give the President's nominees the benefit \nof the doubt when the nominee on the surface meets the requirements I \nhave previously outlined. But as I indicated over the past few weeks, \nwe are not operating under normal circumstances. The atmosphere the \nPresident has created with his disregard for Constitutional principles \nhas made it difficult to give his nominees any benefit of the doubt. \nGiven that I did have some doubts about Mr. Furman's record, I oppose \nhis confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the Judiciary \nCommittee for reporting Jesse Furman out without dissent. Furman is a \ntruly excellent figure. He clerked for the Supreme Court, has the \nsupport of all the clerks with whom he served, including those from \nScalia and Rehnquist, on both sides of the aisle.\n  He worked for Attorney General Mukasey and clerked for Mr. Mukasey. \nHe is truly a moderate. He could be nominated just as easily in the \ngrand tradition of judicial integrity by someone from this side of the \naisle or that side of the aisle.\n  If we cannot approve Mr. Furman and have a close-to-unanimous vote on \nhim, I do not know on whom we can because he is such an excellent, \nthoughtful, and moderate judge. So I hope all of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will vote for him. It may begin to mark a new wave, \nat least, in dealing with district court judges.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I would like to offer my support for \nthe confirmation of a highly qualified and accomplished New Yorker, \nJesse Furman who has been nominated by President Obama to serve the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  Jesse is currently the Assistant United States Attorney in the \nSouthern District of New York where he has served as Deputy Chief \nAppellate Attorney since 2009. Previously, he worked in the Office of \nthe Attorney General at the Department of Justice where he served as \nCounselor to the Attorney General. He has also worked in the law firm \nof Wiggin & Dana. From 2002 2003, he clerked for the Honorable David H. \nSouter of the Supreme Court and from 1999 2000 for the Honorable Jose \nA. Cabranes of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit. He also served as a law clerk for the Honorable Michael B. \nMukasey of the United States District Court for the Southern District \nof New York.\n  Jesse received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1998 and his \nbachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1994 where he graduated \nsumma cum laude. He also served as a Henry Fellow at Oxford University.\n  Because of Jesse's extensive legal career, I am more than confident \nthat he has the experience to serve the Southern District of New York \nwith great competence and fairness.\n  While Jesse is more than qualified to be appointed to a judgeship, \nhis confirmation has been delayed for 5 months by Senate Republicans. \nWhat makes this puzzling is the fact that Jesse's nomination was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee without opposition from \na single member of the Committee. Not a single member. This is the \nninth judicial nominee that Majority Leader Reid has had to file \ncloture on to end a Republican filibuster and secure an up or down \nvote. It should be noted that Senate Republicans have yet to explain \nwhy they refused to consent to Jesse's nomination.\n  In addition, Jesse's nomination is supported by numerous \nconservatives including former United States Attorney General under \nG.W. Bush Michael Mukasey who stated: ``My view of him is perhaps best \nreflected in the fact that he is the first person I sought to hire \nafter I was confirmed as Attorney General . . . his advice was \nunerringly sound and his help indispensable.''\n  Furthermore, former Supreme Court clerks who served at the same time \nas Mr. Furman, including clerks for conservative Justices such as Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, Justice Thomas, and Justice Scalia stated that: \n``Mr. Furman has brought tremendous intellectual rigor, an open mind, \nand good common sense.''\n  I want to remind my colleagues that Senate Democrats worked to \nconfirm 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees in 17 months. \nBlocking Jesse's nomination is highly unusual and incredibly \ndisappointing and quite frankly, irresponsible.\n  I want to thank Chairman Leahy for his leadership on the Judiciary \nCommittee in the effort to confirm highly\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\nqualified individuals such as Jesse Furman. Jesse's commitment to \nupholding fairness within our legal system is well regarded and highly \nrespected. I strongly support his nomination and believe that if \nconfirmed, Jesse will be an excellent Judge to serve on the United \nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote favorably for his confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jesse M. Furman, of New York to be United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York?\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S888, February 17, 2012, the Record reads: . . . advise \nand consent to the nomination of Jesee M.

Mr. President, I assume the next business is the vote on \nthe payroll bill. Before that, I will take 1 minute.\n  As we vote on this bill and prepare to go home, I ask you to remember \nfour numbers: No. 1, 160 million; that is the number of Americans who \nare helped by this bill. The next number is 1,000; that is $1,000 that \neach of those Americans is going to benefit by, by passage of the bill. \nThe next number is 13 million, which is the number of Americans who are \nunemployed and would be dramatically helped by this bill. Finally, 48 \nmillion, which is the number of seniors in America who have doctors \ntake care of their health care needs.\n  Remember those four numbers and vote for this bill. Remember, the \nother body passed this bill by a margin of 293 to 132, evenly split \nbetween Republicans and Democrats. I urge passage of the bill.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of mistakes in the Joint \nExplanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference on H.R. 3630 \nrelated to sections 7003 and 7004 and the current law description of \nthose sections:\n  No. 1, on page 36, in the paragraphs describing current law, the last \nclause of the last sentence of the third paragraph should read:\n\n       A Senate point-of-order against emergency designations \n     under BBEDCA exists pursuant to section 511 of public law 112 \n     78.\n\n  No. 2, on page 37, in the paragraphs describing the conference \nsubstitute, the description of section 7003 should be deleted, and the \nparagraph labeled Section 7004 should be re-designated as section \n``Section 7003'' and should read:\n\n       Paygo Scorecard Estimates--The budgetary effects of this \n     Act shall not be entered on either PAYGO scorecard maintained \n     pursuant to section 4(d) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act \n     of 2010.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. On behalf of myself and Senator Baucus, I wish to \nstate that title VI of the conference report to H.R. 3630, the Middle \nClass Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, contains landmark \nbipartisan legislation that more than 10 years after 9/11 will provide \npolice, firefighters, and other first responders with a nationwide, \ninteroperable wireless broadband network for public safety. This \nlegislation will also help ease the Nation's growing spectrum shortage, \nthrough the auction of new spectrum to commercial providers. Revenues \nfrom these spectrum auctions will fund the public safety network--and \ncontribute $15.2 billion to the unemployment compensation fund.\n  Specifically, Title VI of the conference report provides $7 billion \nin spectrum auction proceeds as well as D-Block spectrum worth $2.75 \nbillion to develop a nationwide, interoperable wireless broadband \nnetwork for public safety officials through a new First Responder \nNetwork Authority. The title also directs the Federal Communications \nCommission, FCC, to auction underutilized spectrum and provides the \nagency with authority to hold voluntary incentive auctions. These \nauctions are expected to raise more than $25 billion in revenue. In \naddition, the title authorizes the FCC to create guard bands in the \nbroadcast spectrum that can be used for innovative new unlicensed uses \nlike Super Wi-Fi. These efforts will help meet the growing spectrum \ndemands of smartphones and tablets. Moreover, investment in the \nwireless economy is expected to create hundreds of thousands of new \njobs.\n  The title is based on bipartisan legislation developed by Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Hutchison, S. 911, and a comparable House bill, \nH.R. 3630. The public safety provisions are based on the national model \nfirst developed in S. 911, with some changes to ensure flexibility for \nStates. The spectrum auction provisions are based on the auction model \nin H.R. 3630, with some changes regarding unlicensed spectrum and FCC \nauction rules.\n  As to public safety provisions, title VI of the conference report \nprovides for the construction of a nationwide, interoperable public \nsafety wireless broadband network. It does this using the D-Block \nspectrum, which is ideally located for fostering seamless communication \namong first responders. It will allow them to take full advantage of \nbroadband functions in emergencies e.g., allowing firefighters to \ndownload floor plans to see inside buildings before they enter. It also \nwill promote economies of scale and efficiencies from using the same \nspectrum nationwide.\n  The title creates a First Responder Network Authority as an \nindependent entity within the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration, NTIA, and provides the Authority with $7 \nbillion and a license to use the D-Block to build the nationwide public \nsafety network. To ensure efficiency, the title requires that the \nAuthority leverage existing commercial networks in construction. To \nensure national interoperability, the title also creates a technical \nadvisory board at the FCC to develop initial interoperability \nstandards. States that want to construct their own portion of the \nNational public safety network have the option to apply for Federal \ngrants to build and operate the radio access network in the State if \nthey can demonstrate to the FCC that the network will meet the \ninteroperability standards and to the NTIA that they have\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\nthe resources and capability to provide comparable coverage and \nsecurity and the ability to maintain ongoing interoperability.\n  Unlike H.R. 3630, the title does not require public safety officials \nto return the important 700 MHz narrowband spectrum to the FCC for \nauction. Instead, it requires the return of a more limited amount of \nspectrum currently used by public safety. This return of a portion of \nthe so-called ``T-Band'' spectrum occurs 11 years from the date of \nenactment, and public safety relocation costs will be reimbursed from \nany auction proceeds. This time frame provides an opportunity for \ncontinued assessment of the viability of this transition--and its \nimpact on public safety communications.\n  The title also authorizes up to $300 million for critical public \nsafety research and development activities and promotes deployment of \nNext Generation 9 1-1 services, which will complement the advanced \nbroadband capabilities of the public safety network by enabling the \ndelivery of voice, text, video, and other data to 9 1-1 call centers.\n  As to the spectrum auction provisions, the auction provisions in \nTitle VI of the conference report are largely the same as those in H.R. \n3630, with two significant exceptions--the provisions relating to \nunlicensed spectrum and FCC auction authority.\n  Unlicensed spectrum has been an engine of economic innovation and \ngrowth. Today, unlicensed uses include Wi-Fi connections for laptops, \ntelevision remote controls, and cordless telephones. In the future, \nunlicensed spectrum is expected to enable new forms of communication, \nlike Super Wi-Fi. The title advances this goal in three ways. First, it \ngives the FCC the authority to preserve existing television white \nspaces. Second, it gives the FCC the authority to optimize these white \nspaces for unlicensed use by consolidating them into more optimal \nconfigurations through band plans. Third, it gives the FCC the \nauthority to use part of the spectrum relinquished by television \nbroadcasters in the incentive auction to create nationwide guard bands \nthat can be used for unlicensed use, including in high value markets \nthat currently have little or no white spaces today. Nationwide, \nunlicensed access to guard bands will enable innovation, promote \ninvestment in new wireless services, and enhance the value of licensed \nspectrum by protecting against harmful interference and allowing \ncarriers to off-load data to alleviate capacity concerns.\n  Under current law, the FCC has broad authority to craft auction rules \nin the public interest. The agency has used this authority to ensure \nthat communications markets remain competitive. H.R. 3630 would have \nrestricted the FCC's future ability to limit participation in and set \nrules for spectrum auctions. Title VI of the conference report modifies \nthis prohibition by expressly preserving the FCC's flexibility to \nprotect competition in the awarding of licenses, and to adopt auction \nprocedures and other rules of general applicability.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Congress has taken an important step today \nto address the looming spectrum crunch that our country faces as well \nas provide first responders with the nationwide network that they \nundoubtedly need. From cell phones to WiFi to broadcast television and \nradio, spectrum fuels some of the most critical technologies of the \nmodern age. Empowering the Federal Communications Commission to conduct \nvoluntary auctions in order to recover potentially underutilized \nspectrum will ensure that the public airwaves are being put to the best \npossible use. I am particularly pleased to see that this provision \ncontains language that will protect broadcast television stations along \nthe Canadian border.\n  A potential consequence of the spectrum auctions that Congress has \nbeen considering is that the Federal Communications Commission may need \nto ``repack'' or move certain television stations to new channels to \nappropriately free up spectrum. This type of repacking occurred \nfollowing the transition to digital television and put some broadcast \nstations in Vermont in the position of having to reduce power to avoid \ninterference with Canadian broadcast signals. Further repacking without \nappropriate protection could have serious consequences for stations in \nVermont and elsewhere along the border. The language in the bill \nCongress has passed today makes sure that repacking along our borders \nis subject to international coordination with Canada and Mexico.\n  In January, I joined with the other members of Vermont's \nCongressional delegation in sending a letter to Secretary of State \nClinton requesting that the State Department explore a new spectrum \ncoordination agreement with Canada. As Congress moves forward today \nwith approving spectrum auctions, I once again call for a new agreement \nthat will ensure adequate spectrum exists for repacking in Vermont and \nelsewhere along the border. Broadcast television is critically \nimportant to communities across this country, and the steps Congress \nhas taken today will make sure that residents relying on this free \nservice do not see significant disruptions due to a lack of \ninternational coordination.\n  The voluntary spectrum auctions that Congress has approved today are \nan important step in freeing up the airwaves for new and innovative \nuses. The auction provision also ensures that public safety will \nfinally have a nationwide broadband network at its disposal, which was \na key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. I am pleased that \nstakeholders came together to craft a compromise that will help to spur \ninnovation, improve public safety, and preserve access to the free, \nover-the-air television that is so important our communities.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that today we can approve a \nfull-year extension of the payroll tax cut, important tax relief that \nis focused on middle-class families who have suffered greatly during \nthe Great Recession, tax relief that will help continue the economic \nrecovery that appears to be under way and that we all hope will \nstrengthen in the months to come.\n  The controversy over how to offset the cost of this payroll tax \nrelief has twice now nearly derailed this important middle class tax \nrelief. I am glad that we have for the second time avoided such an \noutcome. But my strong preference would be for our colleagues across \nthe aisle and across the Capitol to accept the reality that added \nrevenue must eventually be a part of our strategy here. Democrats have \noffered common-sense solutions that would have allowed us to prevent a \ntax increase on American families without adding to the deficit and \nwithout damaging our economic recovery. Rather than take steps such as \nask for a small contribution from the wealthiest Americans--those with \nannual incomes above $1 million--our Republican colleagues preferred to \nadd to the deficit. That is an unfortunate choice.\n  Just as important as the extension of middle-class tax relief in this \nbill is the extension of emergency unemployment benefits. It is good \nfor Michigan and good for the Nation that we have rejected the approach \nadvocated by some, which would have slashed these important benefits. \nEmergency jobless benefits have kept food on the table and shelter \noverhead for millions of families across the country coping with the \nloss of a job through no fault of their own. Beyond those families, \nthis funding has been an economic lifeline to communities hard-hit by \njob losses, and it has been an important component in our economic \nrecovery.\n  I should note here that my own State cannot take full advantage of \nthis extension unless it reverses the decision of the Governor and \nState Legislature to cut State benefits from 26 weeks to 20 weeks. \nBecause of this decision, from March through May of this year, \nMichiganians who could be eligible for a total of 89 weeks of benefits \nwill be limited to 69 weeks. For a relatively small investment on the \nState's part, we could make a major difference for Michigan families if \nwe reverse the State's cuts. I hope the Governor and Legislature will \nreconsider their position.\n  The extension of the so-called ``doc fix'' to prevent major cuts in \nMedicare reimbursements to health care providers is another important \npart of this legislation. Year after year we find ourselves toying with \nthe idea of allowing drastic cuts to the providers who serve our \nnation's elderly and most vulnerable. I am glad we again avoided this \noutcome; however, we missed yet\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\nanother important opportunity to fix this growing problem that becomes \nmore expensive the longer we wait to act.\n  In addition to supporting our nation's health care providers, this \nbill includes a short-term extension of hospital wage index \nreclassifications under Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act. \nWhile I am disappointed we were unable to provide a long-term extension \nof this provision--which helps remedy an inaccurate Medicare \nclassification--at least we were able to include a retroactive 4-month \nextension for affected hospitals in my State. And while some of the \nhealth care cuts used to pay for these extensions will be very \ndifficult to absorb, I am pleased we successfully pushed back against \nthe most draconian cuts to important safety net providers that House \nRepublican's included in their bill.\n  The legislation also authorizes the Federal Communications Commission \nto hold incentive auctions to entice broadcasters to sell some of their \nunused or underused spectrum to free up spectrum to meet growing demand \nfor wireless broadband technologies and also help public safety \nofficials build a national broadband network to improve communications \nduring emergencies.\n  Securing adequate spectrum for and building out a nationwide \ninteroperable public safety broadband network is an important public \npolicy goal that is overdue to be implemented as a recommendation of \nthe 9/11 Commission.\n  One issue related to these auctions of particular interest to me is \nthe uniqueness of our border states when it comes to spectrum signals. \nBroadcasters, including those in Detroit, Flint, Traverse City, Grand \nRapids, and Lansing, have been concerned about potential interference \nof signals along the border if spectrum allocations were modified from \nthe carefully negotiated existing signals. I am pleased that this has \nbeen addressed by requiring that any reassignments of channels be \nsubject to special rules to avoid that interference.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the conference committee \nwas able to reach agreement to provide critical tax relief for American \nworkers and to extend unemployment benefits for out-of-work Americans.\n  In a letter to conferees earlier this month, I urged the committee to \ninclude a permanent repeal of Medicare's sustainable growth rate, SGR, \nformula and offset the cost with savings from capping a portion of the \nspending for overseas contingency operations, OCO, below amounts in the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, baseline.\n  Every Medicare expert knows that the SGR formula is irreparably \nflawed and needs to be repealed. If the conference committee was unable \nto reach agreement, doctors serving Medicare beneficiaries would face a \n27.4-percent cut on March 1.\n  While I am disappointed that conference committee was unable to \npermanently repeal the SGR, I am grateful that they averted the latest \ncrisis by including a 10-month fix, freezing payments to physicians \nthrough the end of the year.\n  However, the latest Medicare physician payment fix comes at a great \ncost to hospitals, clinical laboratories, and preventive health \ninitiatives.\n  The conference report offsets the cost of the SGR with $9.6 billion \nin Medicare cuts, $4 billion in Medicaid cuts, and $7.5 billion in cuts \nfrom provisions in the Affordable Care Act, ACA.\n  Massachusetts hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be \nnegatively impacted by the cuts to bad debt payments which reimburse \nproviders for beneficiaries' unpaid coinsurance and deductible amounts \nafter reasonable collection efforts. Because of this provision, \nMassachusetts hospitals will be cut by approximately $94 million over \nthe next decade.\n  Clinical laboratories in Massachusetts will also bear \ndisproportionate cuts because of offsets in the conference report. They \nwill see their Medicare payments reduced by 2 percent in 2013 and will \nsee additional reductions in the future. There are over 630 medical \nlaboratories in Massachusetts, and I am concerned that these cuts will \ndelay or deny patient access to lifesaving and life-enhancing \ninnovative diagnostic tests.\n  The conference report substantially reduces funding for the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund created in the Affordable Care Act by \n$5 billion. Massachusetts supports public health funding solely from \ngrants and has received over $24 million in grants from the prevention \nfund since enactment of health reform. Cuts to the prevention fund will \njeopardize preventive care initiatives throughout the State, including \na program by UMass School of Public Health and Health Sciences to \nprovide diabetes care trainings throughout western Massachusetts.\n  I am also disappointed that the conference report will eliminate the \nextension of funds for section 508 hospitals on April 1, 2012. This \nwill cause approximately $4 to $7 million in annual cuts to Berkshire \nMedical Center, the only section 508 hospital in Massachusetts.\n  However, I am supporting the conference report because it is \nimperative for Congress to pass tax relief, extend unemployment \nprotections, and prevent damaging cuts to physicians. The Medicare \nphysician payment fix is particularly important to the Massachusetts \neconomy. One in five workers in Massachusetts is employed in health \ncare. Nearly 15 percent of my State's economy is based on health care. \nThis issue directly impacts 20,000 physicians, their 64,724 employees, \nand every health care constituency which depends on Medicare, including \nthe 187,000 employees of Massachusetts hospitals.\n  I am concerned about a provision that was included in the conference \nreport that would increase by 2.3 percent retirement contributions for \nsome Federal employees. This provision will reduce pay for Federal \nworkers who have already been faced with a freeze in salary.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to permanently repealing \nthe SGR later this year.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today both volcanic \nand flabbergasted. I am volcanic that this bill is not fully paid for \nand that we are using permanent solutions to solve temporary problems. \nAnd, I am flabbergasted that Republicans are more willing to protect \nbillionaires than keep our economy rolling and provide a safety net for \nthose going through tough times.\n  We are asked to make an impossible choice. I want to continue the \npayroll tax holiday. I want to continue unemployment insurance. And I \nwant to stop a pay cut to doctors that care for the injured and infirm. \nBut I will be darned if I agree to pay for it by cutting payments to \nhospitals that serve the poor and by asking civil servants to take it \non the chin when billionaires do not have to contribute a dime.\n  Republicans say they want to cut spending. They say they are serious \nabout reducing the deficit. But the only thing they are serious about \nis protecting the pampered and prosperous. I will give you an example. \nContinuing the payroll tax holiday costs about $100 billion. I want to \npay for it by cutting tax breaks for billionaires, tax breaks for oil \ncompanies, and tax breaks for big agriculture. But Republicans do not \nwant to pay for it at all. The so-called party of fiscal discipline \nwants to add $100 billion to the deficit before asking billionaires to \npay more. Some people might call that hypocrisy. I call it a sham.\n  This bill would block a 27% pay cut to doctors that care for the \ninjured and infirm. I support that but I would like to see a long-term \nfix to this payment problem and not just a 10-month patch. To pay for \nthis temporary fix, the bill cuts $10 billion to hospitals that provide \ncare to the poor and Medicare patients. We ask doctors and hospitals to \ncare for the most vulnerable and then we say we would not pay the bill.\n  The bill also cuts funds for health prevention activities. \nRepublicans like to call it a ``slush fund.'' Since when did efforts to \ncombat our Nation's highest cost disease and conditions like diabetes, \nAlzheimer's and heart disease become a ``slush fund''? The bill also \ncuts laboratory services that diagnose illness. We are cutting the \n``good-guy'' institutions to protect the checkbooks of the wealthy.\n  The bill also sticks it to civil servants who are already operating \nunder a 2-year pay freeze. Congress has already balanced the budget on \ntheir backs and saved $60 billion over 10 years by freezing their pay. \nInstead of asking billionaires to sacrifice once it asks more than 2 \nmillion middle class civil servants to pay more again. It leaves the\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\nhedge fund managers alone and takes from the GS 5 earning $30,000 a \nyear and the GS 7 earning $40,000.\n  Across the country there are 2 million civil servants who work for \n300 million Americans every day with honesty, integrity and competency. \nThey keep our food safe, our environment clean, our communities \nprotected and our democracy stable. They are at our borders and \nairports protecting our safety and at Social Security offices helping \nseniors get their benefits. They are Nobel Prize winners, they create \nprivate sector opportunities and they are the economic engine of \nMaryland. Despite all of this, civil servants have been the target of \nunending attacks. They have been downsized, furloughed and shut down. \nThey are enduring pay freezes and broken promises on retirement \nsecurity. Every great democracy needs a civil service. We have one but \nwe can not keep it if we keep up this toxic environment for our civil \nservants.\n  I support a payroll tax holiday. I support extending Unemployment \nInsurance and I support a long-term doc fix. But these items must be \npaid for. We cannot let corporations and the wealthy walk away again \nwhen the middle class gets stuck with the bill.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the average Rhode Islander remains worried \nabout the economy and their future. There are some signs that offer \nhope in the economy, but for too many, good news still eludes them. \nCongress has the ability and the obligation to reinvigorate the \nrecovery, boost demand, and create jobs. Unfortunately, because of \nRepublican obstructionism, Congress has not been able to act and \nproduce the kind of results the American people and Rhode Islanders are \nasking for, mainly more jobs. In fact, Republicans have manufactured \ncrises. Last summer they jeopardized the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States by refusing to raise the debt ceiling, and in December, \nthey threatened to cut off jobless benefits to millions of out-of-work \nAmericans looking for a job and raised taxes on the middle class by not \nextending the payroll tax cut.\n  Fortunately, this conference report avoids last-minute threats of \nfinancial calamity or economic ruin. This compromise will continue the \npayroll tax cut for 160 million working Americans and jobless benefits \nfor millions of unemployed individuals looking for work all through \n2012.\n  What I find most disconcerting in the debate preceding this \nconference report and the deal that we struck with Republicans is their \nview of the reasons why Americans are out of work. As economists have \nshown, Americans are out of work because of the weak economy and the \nunwillingness by many in this body to do something about it.\n  Republicans believe that slashing the duration of unemployment \nbenefits will yield jobs. This is a view that is harmful to many in my \nState. Republicans in the House would have cut benefits immediately \nfrom its current maximum of 99 weeks, targeted towards the hardest hit \nStates, to 59 weeks. This would have hurt families and the economy. The \nrelatively small weekly UI benefit can be the difference between paying \nrent and putting food on the table and ensuring the survival of local \nbusinesses.\n  The White House, as part of a broad jobs plan, which was designed to \nappreciably reduce the unemployment rate, also proposed to reduce the \nmaximum amount of jobless benefits from 99 to 79 weeks. This proposal \nmade sense as part of a broad package that would help Americans get \nback to work. However, Republicans blocked that jobs package and \ncherry-picked the 79 weeks from the President's proposal and presented \nthat as the Democratic starting point. I and my fellow Democrats during \nnegotiations stressed that existing law is 99 weeks; and, in fact, \nunder this conference report 99 weeks will continue for many States \nthrough April and May. Democrats were able to ensure that the ultimate \nreduction to 73 at the end of the year was gradual and that the maximum \naid continued flowing to the highest unemployment States.\n  Senate and House Democrats were also successful in including \nimportant and commonsense reforms to the unemployment insurance system \nthat will bolster reemployment services for the unemployed. There is \nalso a key provision to help prevent the loss of jobs in the first \nplace. My work sharing legislation that was included in this bill will \nprovide $500 million to enhance and expand the use of a proven \ninitiative to help keep Americans on the job and provide employers with \na practical alternative to layoffs that is good for business. This \nvoluntary program has been very successful in Rhode Island, saving over \n10,000 jobs. Economist Mark Zandi estimates that temporary financing of \nwork share offers a very high ``bang for the buck'' of $1.69. Work \nsharing allows businesses to retain skilled workers, temporarily cut \ncosts, and maintain employee morale. It keeps people working while \nreceiving a share of unemployment benefits to make up for lost wages \nand retaining health insurance and retirement benefits. This means \nworkers can continue to pay their mortgages and bills, provide for \ntheir families, and support businesses in their local communities. More \nthan 20 States have adopted work-sharing initiatives. By including this \nprovision in the conference report, we are encouraging States with \nexisting layoff prevention systems to utilize them more frequently and \nincentivizing States without work sharing to create them.\n  This compromise also improves work search requirements and helps \nStates recover benefit overpayments.\n  Importantly, we prevented Republican UI proposals that would have \nrequired a GED to collect UI benefits; this proposal would have \ndisproportionately and unfairly harmed older workers. And, it could \nhave led to the denial of benefits, despite the efforts of the \nunemployed worker, because access to a GED program was unavailable. \nRepublican efforts to cut adult education funding have and will \ncontinue to limit access to these education services.\n  In addition, this conference report includes an agreement that will \ncreate a critically needed nationwide wireless communications network \nfor public safety, while also allowing the Federal Government to \nauction off portions of the wireless spectrum that it no longer needs. \nI fought against language in the House bill that the Department of \nDefense stated would be damaging to our Nation's defense capabilities \nby forcing the Department to withdraw from certain portions of the \nwireless spectrum that it currently uses. I am pleased that the \nconference report does not include this language.\n  The compromise also ensures approximately 181,000 Rhode Islanders on \nMedicare will continue to have access to health care services by \npreventing a 27-percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors. And it \nprovides over $7 million for Rhode Island to help an estimated 4,000 \nparents and children every month through December retain their Medicaid \ncoverage as they transition to employment and increase their earnings.\n  While I am pleased that I helped prevent any benefit cuts to seniors \non Medicare and other low-income individuals and families to pay for \nthe extension of these health care programs, included in the proposal \noffered by Republicans in the House, I am disappointed that the \ncompromise includes reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals, \nnursing facilities, and clinical laboratories.\n  There was a better way to pay for this legislation. Congress could \nhave closed egregious corporate subsidies and made our tax system \nfairer. Unfortunately, Republicans refused.\n  But overall, this compromise continues important policies that help \nthe middle class. But Congress still has much work to do to create jobs \nand restore economic opportunity and fairness.

Mr. President, what we have just gone through is an effort \nto bring the highway bill to be closer to the end.\n  The amendment I have offered does not have in it the Commerce \nCommittee-reported matter. There has been an effort made by members of \nthe Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis to have another proposal, \nand that is what is now in this bill. I would hope that will be \naccepted--I am told it will--when we get back, which will allow us to \nstart legislating, the Monday we get back, on this bill. We have to \nmove to completion.\n  As I said earlier today, I don't like a lot of the amendments my \nRepublican colleagues have offered, but they have a right to offer \namendments. We are going to have to work through these amendments. I \nhope we can come up with, the day we get back or at least the next day, \na list of finite amendments, Republican amendments and Democratic \namendments, and work our way through those. We can't have hundreds of \namendments, and I hope we can work that down to a reasonable number. \nBoth sides are going to offer amendments. I am sure it won't be a lot \nof fun, but that is why we are elected--to make tough decisions.\n  There are some measures we have to vote on that relate to the bill. I \nknow that may sound a little unusual, but there may be some amendments \nthat are germane or relevant to the matter we are considering. We are \ngoing to work through those.\n  I hope we don't have to file cloture on the bill--that would be \nnice--because this legislation is important because the surface \ntransportation law that is now in effect expires at the end of March. \nSo we have a lot of work to do in a short period of time.\n  So Senators understand, we have a lot more to do. We not only have to \nfinish this bill, but it is imperative that we bring to the floor the \npostal reform legislation. It is extremely important. We also have a \nlot of nominations we are going to have to deal with, and these are the \nthings we have in the short term. The highway bill and the postal bill \nare really big, important pieces of legislation.\n  I would be happy to yield to my friend, the chairwoman of the \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Very briefly, I just want to thank my friend so much. He \nhas a lot of ties to the environment and public works community, and we \nknow every State in the Union is watching us. They want to know that we \nare going to get our job done on the highway bill. I see Senator Thune \nis on the floor. He has been extraordinarily helpful as we have worked \nour way through this in the most bipartisan fashion.\n  For people who might be confused with the vote that took place, I \njust wanted to point out that in the package that was on the floor, \nwhat happened was there was a problem in the Commerce Committee. There \nwas a bipartisan problem there which has now been worked out.\n  So what my colleague has done now is--I ask unanimous consent that I \ncan control the floor for the next 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So what my colleague has done by offering this amendment \nis to offer now the agreed-upon Commerce package and the agreed-upon \nbill so that we can finally get started and not have us torn asunder.\n  It was wonderful to interact with Senator Hutchison today because she \nmade her point that she is quite satisfied with the compromise that has \nbeen worked out between herself and Senator Rockefeller on the new \ncompromised Commerce piece.\n  So when we come back, here is where we will be: Senator Reid has \noffered that new package, which is 100 percent bipartisan. I have \ntalked with Senator Inhofe. His staff and my staff are going to be \nworking literally--I don't want to say 24/7; that is an exaggeration, \nbut they are going to be working every day, including the weekends, \nover this work period to take probably 200 amendments--that is usually \nwhat happens in these bills--and try to get a few that are simple, that \nare not controversial, get those agreed upon on a staff level, and \nbring them back to a lot of principals. We have a lot of principals in \nthis because we have four committees--all working in good faith, I \nmight add.\n  So I am excited. I know Senator Landrieu is on the Senate floor, and \nshe has been doing a wonderful job with Senator Nelson, Senator Shelby, \nSenator Wicker, Senator Carper, and others, on a bipartisan basis on \nthe RESTORE Act. It is an amendment that has been filed, and I am very \nhopeful that is the type of thing we can get done with good will here, \npeople willing to not filibuster but agree to 60-vote thresholds, if \nthey have to, with time agreements.\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\n  Here is the deal, and I will close. Senator Reid was exactly right. \nIf we don't do this bill, our entire transportation program expires at \nthe end of March. That is 1.8 million jobs directly impacted by this \nbill. In the bipartisan bill we have worked out, we not only protect \nthose jobs, but we create up to 1 million new jobs because we have \nadded a very important piece, the TIFIA piece. So we have made that a \nmajor program which has cost very little because the way money is \nleveraged, it will leverage local funds, State funds, private funds. \nThat means we could see up to 1 million new jobs.\n\n  As we leave here today, the good news is that we have made sure that \nmillions of working Americans will be able to count on the payroll tax \ncut. That is good. We make sure that so many of our unemployed workers \ncan know they will continue to receive unemployment and that our senior \ncitizens know their doctors will not run away from them when they come \nin with their Medicare card. We have done a good thing on that.\n  There are things in that bill I don't like. Certainly it was a \ncompromise. We met each other halfway. In the highway bill, we have \ndone that as well. So I am ever so grateful to the leadership in the \nSenate because they could easily have said: Well, we had a cloture \nvote, and it went down. Let's forget the bill.\n  But we are all working together. We knew we had to take this step to \nget to the next step. So we are at that step. We will come back, and we \nwill begin in earnest to dispose of amendments. I hope we will have a \nlist from the staff of maybe 15, 20 amendments that are not \ncontroversial that we can move forward on and then get to some of the \ndifficult issues.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues on both side of the aisle--why do we \nneed to have a birth control amendment on a highway bill? Why do we \nhave to have foreign relations amendments? I serve on that committee, \nForeign Relations, and I am proud of it, but we shouldn't be bringing \ncontroversial, unrelated amendments to the highway bill because 2.8 \nmillion jobs are hanging in the balance.\n  But I leave here with great optimism. A couple of days ago I said I \ndidn't see a path forward for the highway bill and the transit bill. \nToday I see a very clear path forward. If we all continue to work \ntogether, we are going to be proud and we are going to make everyone, \nfrom the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL CIO and every group in between \nthat has joined in a coalition of 1,000 organizations--they are going \nto be happy, and, most of all, the American people will be happy, \nbecause we have to fix those bridges and those highways, and we have to \nmake sure our people have alternatives so they can get into transit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                     PAYROLL TAX CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I reluctantly supported the conference \nagreement because it is absolutely essential that we extend the payroll \ntax holiday and unemployment insurance benefits. The stakes are too \nhigh to do otherwise for our economic recovery and for millions of \nAmericans struggling to make ends meet. We cannot abandon them or \nreverse progress during this difficult time.\n  However, I strongly oppose the decision to pick the pockets of \nFederal workers yet again just to offset the cost of 10 months of \nunemployment insurance benefits. I am not opposed to offsetting the \ncosts, but I believe shared sacrifice is essential and a simple matter \nof fairness and decency. Unfortunately, once again, rather than asking \nmillionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes, some of \nmy colleagues insisted on taxing America's dedicated middle-class \npublic servants.\n  Future Federal employees will be required to pay an additional 2.3 \npercent of their income toward their pensions. That means most \nemployees will pay a total of 3.1 percent of their salaries, and that \nis in addition to the 6.2 percent they pay for Social Security \nretirement benefits. This agreement effectively lowers the Federal pay \nscale by 2.3 percent going forward, and this comes after Federal wages \nalready have been frozen for 2 years. Under this agreement, future \ncongressional employees--all of our staffs, who often work long hours \nfor us and are underpaid--will pay more toward their pensions at the \nsame time as we cut their pension benefits by more than one-third. \nThese are permanent changes made to fund just 10 months of unemployment \nbenefits--not a good investment in our Nation's future.\n  Some of my colleagues would have you believe that Federal employees \nare overpaid, and that simply is not true. In many critical fields, the \nFederal Government struggles to compete with the private sector to \nrecruit and retain the skilled people our Nation needs: experts in \ncyber security and intelligence analysis, doctors and nurses to care \nfor our wounded warriors, accountants who protect taxpayers during \nbillion-dollar defense acquisitions. These are just a few examples. \nFederal employees handle incredibly complex work. On paper, an analyst \nmight compare the salary of a nuclear submarine mechanic to a car \nmechanic. We all depend on the important work car mechanics do, but \nclearly we used to recruit the most sought-after mechanics possible to \nbe our nuclear sub mechanics, and we need to pay them enough to retain \nthem. As the income gap in this country widens and so many hard-working \nAmericans face increasing economic insecurity, I am proud that the \nFederal Government still pays most employees a living wage.\n  Many private sector employers are scaling back or eliminating \npensions. Just this week, General Motors announced plans to suspend \npension benefits for nearly 20,000 employees who have been with the \ncompany for more than 10 years. Long term, this unfortunate trend will \nrob millions of Americans who have worked hard all their lives of the \nsecurity retirement they earned and deserve. This trend, tragically, is \nbound to increase poverty among senior citizens in the coming years.\n  Some of my colleagues want to follow the private sector and eliminate \nor dramatically reduce the Federal pension.\n  Today, this conference agreement will, unfortunately, take the first \nstep in that direction. But I call on my colleagues to prevent the \nFederal Government from joining this race to the bottom. I fear this \nshortsighted attack on Federal workers will repeat itself. Every time \nwe need an offset to fund anything, I expect there will be another \nproposal to cut Federal pay, pensions or other benefits. We must stop \nand help to protect our Federal workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments \nof the Senator before me. I wish to rise to inform colleagues and the \npublic of some highly disturbing information that I have just learned \nabout a broken agency within our Federal Government, something actually \nthat Senator Carper and I have been working on. I know he will have \ngreat interest in this issue. I am talking about the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, NOAA.\n  We all know Washington does not spend our money wisely, the money \nthey collect from individual citizens. They do not spend it wisely. But \nsometimes it is worth highlighting examples of the corruption and waste \nthat is actually taking place in the Federal Government.\n  Yesterday morning, I contacted the Commerce Department inspector \ngeneral to request a copy of their report on NOAA's purchase of a \n$300,000 luxury boat. It would be bad enough if they purchased this \nboat with taxpayer dollars, but they did not. They paid for it with \nmoney that should belong to our struggling fishermen. They paid for it \nout of fines fisherman pay into the pot when they mistakenly catch the \nwrong kinds of fish. Those dollars are supposed to stay in the fishing \ncommunity to help the fishermen.\n  I would like to point out--this is the boat. This is a photo of the \nactual boat that was purchased. For a government vessel, I would say \nthat is pretty flashy. Let's take a look inside this boat. This is a \nfully appointed bar, the latest onboard entertainment systems, the \nleather furniture complete with the\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\nice check and tackle rack. I think anyone would love to have a boat \nsuch as this. NOAA has this boat.\n  Furthermore, the fines fishermen have been paying are putting \nfishermen out of business. These stories will break your heart. This \nstory breaks my heart. It is something I speak about regularly when I \nam with my fishermen in Massachusetts. Let me describe the situation to \npeople who are listening in the gallery and also people who are \nwatching.\n  NOAA levied totally unreasonable fines against our fishermen. They \nused that money to buy themselves a luxury boat.\n  What else did the IG investigation find? Here we go:\n  According to the IG, NOAA had no reasonable official use for this \nboat. Let's start there. They didn't need it. Period. They had some \nstory about needing an ``undercover vessel'' to sneak up on \nwhalewatching vessels. Imagine that--armed Federal agents sneaking up \non school groups and tourists trying to learn about nature. The IG \nfound this to be as ridiculous. NOAA officials wanted this useless \nluxury boat. Then they-invented a reason to buy it with fishermen's \nhard-earned dollars.\n  So why did NOAA go to such lengths to ``manipulate'' and ``violate'' \nthe government purchasing rules to get this boat? NOAA already has many \nboats and more cars than it has agents, so why add this to the \ninventory? They apparently didn't need it for official purposes. We \nknow that because the IG says that it was never--I repeat--never--used \nfor official business.\n  The sad truth is that it was a fishermen-funded party boat for \nbureaucrats, Mr. President. That's right, while fishermen in Gloucester \nand New Bedford are struggling to put off foreclosure or mourning the \nloss of their livelihood because of NOAA's overzealous enforcement, the \nNOAA office was living the good life on their dime.\n  NOAA officials used the boat for the following: Trips to dockside \nrestaurants; Hamburger and hotdog BBQs and alcohol-fueled parties and \nwith family and friends; ``Pleasure cruises'' at high rates of speed, \nwith beer consumed on-board; Even though Federal rules ban non-\nemployees from being on vessels, a NOAA supervisor even told a \nsubordinate that his wife was welcome to ``kick back and watch TV'' on \nthe boat; They filed expense reports and reimbursed themselves for \nthese trips.\n  What excuse did NOAA employees give for this behavior? They needed to \ndo all these things to maintain the recreational appearance of this \n``undercover'' boat . . . that was never even used for the \n``undercover'' work that it was supposedly purchased for.\n  Mr. President, let's be serious: A booze cruise is a booze cruise. \nOne NOAA officer decided to take his family on a weekend trip to a posh \nresort. He took the undercover NOAA party boat to get there, but he was \nuntrained in how to operate it and blew out a $30,000 engine. Rather \nthan turn back and write the taxpayers a check, he simply abandoned it \nand took a marked NOAA law enforcement boat the rest of the way to \ntheir resort. Nothing could get between this NOAA employee and a good \ntime. When asked about that incident, the NOAA employee lied to the IG \nand said there was no family on board. That was just one of many \ninstances of NOAA employees deliberately misleading the IG.\n  Another NOAA officer used the undercover NOAA boat to take his wife \nto lunch in Seattle. On this trip, the boat engines stalled in a \nshipping lane because the boat ran out of fuel due to another operator \nerror. The guy didn't know how to switch the tanks. So they were stuck \ndrifting in a dangerous shipping lane. The officer and his wife \napparently found the situation comical. I don't think that the \nfishermen in New Bedford or Glouster or Fall River are laughing. Again, \nthe money that belonged to our hard-working fishermen is paying for all \nthis. I cannot fathom that type of behavior, especially in this tough \ntime when we are all in a fiscal emergency.\n\n  To this day, no one has been held accountable. No one has been \ndisciplined, fired or even reprimanded for anything having to do with \nthis boat.\n  As we see today, NOAA has a culture of corruption that has created a \nchasm of distrust between the agency and the fishing industry. That \ntrust is something that absolutely needs to be reestablished.\n  I would like to take 1 more minute. My question is addressed to the \nPresident--not the Presiding Officer, the real President, President \nObama, and to Dr. Lubchenco. What does it take to get fired from NOAA? \nWe have the abusive treatment of fishermen resulting in the decimation \nof the fleet; investigations motivated by money, shredding parties \ndestroying 75 to 80 percent of the required documents before an \ninvestigation, lying to the IG, discouraging cooperation with the IG, \nmisleading Members of the Congress, the $300,000 party boat purchases, \n$12,000 in party boat expenses paid with fishermen's fines, a $30,000 \nengine destroyed by a NOAA employee on his weekend vacation and no one \nis held accountable.\n  This needs to change. Accountability starts at the top. NOAA's \nleadership needs to change. I am calling one more time to have \nPresident Obama fire NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco, and if not now, \nwhen? If for not this, then for what? What does it take to get fired at \nNOAA? Our fishermen and the American taxpayers deserve better from the \nFederal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. I know we have been switching back and forth. As someone who \nhas the opportunity to preside more often than not on these kind of \ndays, I know they are anxious to speak as well. I will only take a \ncouple moments. I appreciate their courtesy.\n  A little earlier today we passed a conference report that extended \nthe payroll tax cut. While I am glad the payroll tax cut was extended, \nI voted against that conference report because, unfortunately, we did \nnot pay for that tax cut. I believe we could have found ways to pay for \nit--a surcharge on millionaires, tying this to a means test so it could \nhave been more coordinated. But also in that action for those parts of \nthe legislation that we passed that we did pay for, things such as \nunemployment benefits, we once again targeted a group that I think for \ntoo many in Congress becomes the payer of first resort, not payer of \nlast resort; that is, our Federal employees.\n  Over the last year and a half or so, I have continued a tradition \nthat was started by a colleague, Senator Ted Kaufman from Delaware, \nwhere on an occasional basis I come down and recognize the service of \nFederal employees who, too often, again as we have seen in recent \ndebates, receive the brunt of lots of comments when in reality they are \ngood folks who keep the operations of our Government working, who \npatrol our streets, catch the terrorists, and in some cases just \nrecently I recognized a Federal employee who actually helps keep the \nSenate operating on a regular basis.\n  As we think about how we get our debt and deficit under control and \npay for the programs that we will continue to initiate, we need to make \nsure we have a shared burden approach, where we look both to programs \nthat have outlived their usefulness and the revenue side. Yes, I know \nFederal employees will make their contribution as well, but as we have \nseen from their pay freeze, from the threat of repeated furloughs over \nthe last year and a half, and now adding to their pension contribution \nfor new Federal employees, that burden is not always shared with all.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Joseph Lawrence\n\n  I am continuing the tradition of recognizing great Federal employees.\n  Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor a recently retired great \nfederal employee, Joseph Lawrence. He most recently served as the \ndirector of transition in the Office of Naval Research within the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  During his time there, he oversaw a $1 billion research and \ndevelopment portfolio responsible for developing science and technology \nsolutions to problems discovered during war game exercises conducted by \nthe Marine Corps and the Navy.\n  For example, Mr. Lawrence oversaw the development and delivery of a \nnew type of dressing that can be applied to a battlefield wound to \nprevent bleeding during transportation to a hospital.\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\nThis innovation is now found in every Marine's individual first aid \nkit, as well as products used by U.S. Armed Forces and law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Other innovations include a system that protects tactical wheeled \nvehicles against rocket-propelled grenade and a crane that better \ntransfers containers between ships.\n  In December 2011, Mr. Lawrence retired after 45 year of service, \nwhich began at the U.S. Naval Research lab while he was in college. He \nhas played an important role in the protection of our country and the \nwell-being of our troops.\n  Dedicated civil servants such as Mr. Lawrence are the lifeblood of \nthe federal government. I admire their patriotism which drives them in \ntheir daily work. Too often, their service to the success of the United \nStates does not receive the proper recognition it deserves.\n  This has been recently exemplified in the systemic problems \nassociated with processing necessary paperwork prior to the \ndisbursement of retirement benefits to all federal employees. Earlier \nthis month, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee investigated problems within the Office of Personnel \nManagement surrounding the processing of retirement and survivor \nbenefits. Too many of our recently retired federal employees--the \ncurrent estimate is more than 62,000 people--are waiting for more than \nyear to receive earned retirement benefits.\n  We are not holding up our end of the bargain with people who commit \nto public service to their country. To make matters worse, this is not \nthe first time the Congress and OPM recognized the current processing \nsystem is broken. I am committed to helping resolve the issue with the \ncurrent OPM system. But, frankly, the current OPM system, which doesn't \nhave very good technology--when they have invested in technology \nresources, they have actually come up with goose eggs--is now currently \nprocessing these retirement requests with old-fashioned paper and \npencil. It makes no sense.\n\n  As a matter of fact, there are a number of agencies--the Department \nof State and others--as they send over the retirement information on an \nemployee to OPM, over 50 percent of the information they send over in \nterms of the case is not complete. So not only is this a problem at \nOPM, but this is a problem in terms of OPM being able to enforce the \nother 88 Federal agencies actually doing their job.\n  I believe we need to tackle and fix this problem to ensure that \nretired Federal employees, such as Mr. Lawrence, who have faithfully \nserved this great Nation, are able to enter retirement and receive that \nfor which they worked so hard.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Mr. Lawrence for the \nexcellent work he has done, and I hope they will join me in making sure \nthat when Federal employees retire, they get their retirement benefits \nin a timely and efficient manner.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for their courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Kansas for as much time as we may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S895-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S895-S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHILD LABOR IN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this week the Gallup poll came out with a \nsurvey that said 85 percent of small businesses in this country are not \nhiring. They just are not hiring. When asked why, 50 percent of those \nsmall businesses responded that it was the health care law and \ncomplying with Federal regulations that were preventing them from \nhiring. Well, there probably isn't any better example of the overreach, \noverkill, and excess when it comes to regulations than the Department \nof Labor regulation on child labor in agriculture. It was put out and \npublic comments were invited on the proposal last September.\n  Since that time, numerous Senators and outside interest groups have \nrequested a 60-day extension due to the timing of the harvest season, \nbut the Department of Labor only extended that comment period for 30 \ndays. Then 30 Senators--led by the Senator from Kansas who authored the \nletter--sent a letter that many of us signed onto, basically asking the \nSecretary of Labor, Hilda Solis, to withdraw those proposed regulations \nthat limit the ability of farmers and ranchers to hire young people to \nwork in agriculture. In February of this year, the Department of Labor \nannounced plans to repropose a portion of the regulation on child labor \nin agriculture interpreting the ``parental exception.'' But what is \ninteresting about it is there have been multiple efforts made to try to \nget a response to the letter, and the Department of Labor didn't \nrespond to a letter from 30 Senators.\n  It strikes me that with all of the issues that were raised in that \nletter and the impact this would have on the very heartland of our \ncountry and the ability of farmers and ranchers and their families to \nsustain themselves and to contribute to feeding the world, it seems \nthey would at least have the courtesy of responding to the points that \nwere raised in that letter. But we have not yet received a response to \nthat letter sent by the Senator from Kansas, Senator Moran, and 29 \nother Senators who signed onto that requesting a response to the \nvarious issues that were raised. We will get into those in a minute. It \nstrikes me as certainly odd, and perhaps I would have to say \ndemonstrating an arrogance, a power to not respond to 30 Senators who, \non behalf of their constituents, raised some issues that are very \nimportant to the economy of the heartland of the Midwest and the people \nI represent, and I know the Senator from Kansas represents.\n  When you look at what they are proposing and the prescriptive nature \nof that, the detail they go into in restricting the ability of young \npeople to work on family farm and ranch operations, you have to say: \nWhat were these people thinking and what world do they live in? Because \nthere seems to be a parallel universe to think that all of these \nvarious regulations and restrictions they would impose on young people \nworking in agriculture wouldn't undermine the very fabric, the very \nnature, the very foundation of American agriculture.\n  Farming and ranching is inherently a family enterprise. Young people \nhave contributed for generations in helping that family farm or ranch \noperation survive and prosper. They contribute. They grow up in that \nbusiness, and in many cases they take it over. It is amazing to me, and \nincomprehensible, to think that bureaucrats in Washington, DC, could \ntell family farmers and ranchers how to run their operations with the \nkind of detail and the incredible prescription of these regulations and \nthe very activities they would curtail for young people.\n  I wanted to engage my colleague from Kansas on this subject. As I \nsaid, he was the author of the letter that was sent, along with many of \nus--30 Senators in all--asking the Department of Labor to withdraw, in \nraising a number of points about various aspects of these regulations. \nAnd, as I said, we will touch on those in a minute.\n  I would ask my colleague from Kansas if he thinks that 85 pages of \nregulations, which is what this proposal is--do we need 85 pages of \nregulations that tell family farm and ranch operations and young people \nwho work on those family farm and ranch operations how to go about \ntheir business? Is it necessary? Do we have to get this bureaucratic \nand impose these kinds of regulations, these kinds of costs and these \nkinds of burdens upon American agriculture at a time when--as I \nmentioned before--there are so many other costs associated with doing \nbusiness in this country imposed by the government? The ObamaCare, the \nhealth care law, and as I mentioned earlier, the Gallup poll was \nmentioned by half of the small businesses who said it is one of the \nreasons why they are not hiring. All of these other regulations, many \nof which come from the EPA, but certainly the Department of Labor in \nthis particular case is guilty of making it more difficult and more \nexpensive to do business in this country and certainly inhibiting the \nvery nature and, from an operation standpoint, the very way that a \nfamily farm or ranch operation conducts itself.\n  I ask my colleague from Kansas his thoughts on this and whether he \nthinks\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\nit is necessary to have 85 pages of regulations having to regulate how \nfamily farm and ranch operations do their business.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I share the genuine concern expressed by \nthe Senator from South Dakota. Farmers have so many things to concern \nthemselves with in the ability to earn a living. The weather is not \nalways their friend. Is this the right crop to grow? What are market \nconditions going to be? How do we predict? How do we have risk \nmanagement? And always concerned about what the Federal Government, \nthrough its regulatory agencies and departments, is going to do, to \ncreate one more impediment toward the success of farms and ranches \nacross our Nation, to always be worried about the issues related to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. And now comes the Department of Labor \nwith a proposed set of rules that will fundamentally alter the nature \nof farming and ranching.\n  The Senator from South Dakota said it well when he said that \ninherently agriculture, farming and ranching, is a family operation, \nand that is certainly the way it is across the State of Kansas and \nacross the rural portions of America today. I have always been an \nadvocate for the success of farmers and ranchers during my time as a \nMember of the House of Representatives and now in the Senate. Certainly \npart of that is the economic viability of that is agriculture \ndetermines the ability for communities across my State to survive and \nto prosper and to bring another generation of young people back to \nrural communities, back to the rural part of America. But there is also \nsomething very special about agriculture. It is the way that \nhistorically in our Nation, in the history of our country, we have been \nable to transmit our character, our values, our integrity from one \ngeneration to the next. It is one of the few professions left in which \nsons and daughters work side by side with moms and dads, with \ngrandparents, and have that opportunity on an ongoing daily basis to \nwork, to learn something about what is important in life, about \npersonal responsibility, and that you cannot plan your day based upon \nyour own preferences; there are cattle to be fed; there are crops to be \nharvested; that there is something more important in life than just \nwhat you want to do.\n  Again, this is the way we live our lives. In the process of living \nthis kind of life, we pass on things that are so important to the \ncharacter of the individual, and over the history of our Nation, the \ncharacter of who we are as Americans has been molded by the fact that \nagriculture, farmers and ranchers, have played such an important \ncomponent in the way Americans have lived their lives.\n  The Department of Labor announced a few days ago that they are going \nto repropose a portion of the rule and that they are hoping Americans, \nfarmers and ranchers, Members of Congress look the other way, that they \nare doing something significant to change the onerous nature of the \nrules that are proposed. While they have agreed to repropose a portion \nof the rule related to the definition of family farms, there remain are \ntwo significant components important to the way we live our lives--that \nwe pass on to the next generation those inherent characteristics that \nwe desire so much and that we will lose the opportunity to entice a \nyoung person to decide agriculture is their means of earning a living \nas they grow older.\n  You have to have experience as a child to learn what opportunities \nare available for you. Students who become teachers have been enthused \nabout becoming a teacher because of an experience in a classroom. Well, \nit works the same way on a farm in Kansas or South Dakota or in \nArkansas. It is the experience that child has, that young person has in \nworking with their families, with neighboring farmers that causes them \nto think: When I grow up, I want to work on this family farm. I want to \nearn my living in agriculture.\n  While a portion of the rule is being reproposed, don't take your eye \noff the consequences of the remainder of the rule, even if we get a \ngood definition of a family farm in the reproposed rule. What remains \nis replacing the things that have a time-honored tradition and success \nin rural communities, in agriculture, in educating our kids--FFA, 4 H, \ncounty extension; those things are being replaced and the Department of \nLabor is going to become the decider of whether a young person has the \ncapabilities to work on a family farm.\n  The Department says that those things, FFA, 4 H, and county \nextension, are too local and that we have to have a nationally driven \npolicy from the Department of Labor to decide how we educate and train \nand make certain we have safety for young people working on farms.\n  The other part of the proposed rule that remains, that is not \ninvolved in any new modification and is working its way through the \nprocess--and we expect the Department of Labor to announce in a few \nmonths their final rule--is the definition of farming practices that \neven if the Department of Labor determines that this young person has \nthe right safety credentials to work on the farm, these things are \nstill prohibited--things such as working 6 feet off the ground. Six \nfeet off the ground is where you are when you are on a tractor or when \nyou are on a combine. So what the Department of Labor is doing is \ntaking away a whole segment of the things that are important to young \npeople on the farm. You cannot work with a wheelbarrow and a shovel to \nclean out a stall, you cannot herd cattle.\n  In fact, the proposed regulation says you cannot do anything in \nanimal husbandry that inflicts pain upon the animal. Those are things \nthat are pretty important, such as branding and breeding and dehorning \nand vaccinating. Certainly young people across Kansas and South Dakota \nhave the opportunity to do those things today and take them away, and \nit diminishes the opportunities that are important to them in earning a \nliving and saving money for their future, but also takes away those \nother invaluable characteristics of working side by side with farmers \nwho know the real meaning of life, with moms and dads, grandparents, \nand neighbors.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator from South Dakota and the \nsentiments he expressed.\n  Just another example to show the overreach of these regulations, one \nof the proposals by the Department of Labor has sought comments on \nwhether we should limit the exposure of direct sunlight if the \ntemperature reaches a certain limit once you factor in wind velocity \nand humidity. How is a farmer going to make a decision under those \ncircumstances--whether or not this young person could work on the farm \nbased upon daylight, humidity, temperature? We are going to have to \nhire a meteorologist to make a determination whether that day it is OK \nfor a 15-year-old to be working on the farm.\n\n  I have invited the Secretary of Labor to come to Kansas to experience \nfarm life. That invitation was not accepted. I don't begrudge the \nSecretary of that. It is not expected necessarily that the Secretary of \nLabor would come to my State and visit with farmers, although we would \nlove to tell her the story.\n  We had asked for an opportunity to have a conversation with the \nSecretary of Labor here in Washington, DC. I was happy to go to her \noffice. That also was denied.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota indicates, a letter from 30 Members \nof the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats--it wasn't a partisan \nissue. Senator Nelson of Nebraska was my colleague in asking the \nDepartment to extend the comment period so that farmers, during fall \nharvest, would have a greater opportunity to comment on this rule. It \nwas a bipartisan letter asking for certain information. We learned \nagain this week that the Department of Labor says that letter from 30 \nSenators--I don't mean this in an arrogant way, but we represent \nconstituents who have serious concerns with a regulation that we \nbelieve will fundamentally alter the way we live our lives in \nagriculture--the answer was, we are going to treat that just like any \nother letter, which means we are going to send a form letter really \ntelling, I would guess, not much of anything and certainly not \nanswering our questions.\n  We have asked folks across the country to take a look at the Web site \nkeepfamiliesfarming.com, and we are soliciting comments from folks \nacross\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\nthe country so we can try to submit these to the Department of Labor \nand make the case known. We would ask the American people, particularly \nthose who understand the importance of this issue, to rise and express \ntheir concern and tell the Secretary of Labor, tell the Department of \nLabor the tremendous consequences of a regulation that changes \nsomething that is so important to the character of rural America and \nthe character of our country nationwide.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to have a conversation with the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and would be glad to yield to him.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on that point, \nwhat the Senator has touched upon I think is something that perhaps \npeople who don't come from farm country don't appreciate as much as we \ndo, and that is just the very nature of farming. Farming is, as we \nsaid, very much a family operation. What we are talking about right now \nwith these regulations is, at a time when we have young people who want \nand need the opportunity to learn responsibility, who need to learn the \nvalue of hard work as well as, for that matter, earn a little extra \nspending money, this regulation would restrict their ability to do all \nthree. It would be really bad for family farming and ranching in the \nState of South Dakota. I know that.\n  It is also a regulation that I would say I don't think has gotten as \nmuch attention perhaps as some of the other ones that are out there but \none that would have profound consequences on production agriculture.\n  The Senator mentioned a couple of examples of operating farm \nequipment. If a person is on a tractor, that person probably, in most \ncases, would be higher than 6 feet, and this regulation would prevent \nthem from doing things at elevations higher than 6 feet. We could also \nargue some other things that would fall into that category. How about \nworking on a haystack? A farmer is going to be more than 6 feet above \nthe ground.\n  Some of the restrictions with regard to working with animals that are \nmore than 6 months old--as the Senator mentioned, being able to herd \ncattle on the back of a horse--these are all things under these \nregulations that would be restricted or prevented for many of these \nyoung people.\n  It seems pretty amazing that we would have a Washington bureaucracy \ndictating with this kind of specificity, with this kind of minutiae, \nhow farm and ranch operations would be conducted. I would argue that \nthe very organizations the Senator from Kansas mentioned--4 H, FFA, \nextension service--know full well and the families who operate farms \nknow full well what the risks are. They understand. They want to \nprotect their families.\n  Instead, we have a Washington bureaucracy that thinks it knows best \ntelling family farmers and ranchers how to go about their business in a \nway that will make it not only more difficult for them to make a living \nbut also I think more difficult for young people to learn the skills \nand get the experience they will need when hopefully that time comes \naround that they can take over that operation of farming, ranching in \nKansas, as it is in South Dakota. It is very much an intergenerational \noccupation. And it is more than just an occupation, more than just a \nvocation. It is a way of life. It is something where values are \ntransmitted from one generation to another--the values of hard work, \npersonal responsibility, integrity, honesty. There are so many \ncharacter qualities that we value and that young people learn on family \nfarms and ranches. So notwithstanding the economic impact on family \nfarms and ranches, there is certainly a cultural and social impact on \nour family farms and ranches, and the middle of this country is \ntremendously impacted by this regulation.\n  I hope the Senator from Kansas will continue to keep the heat on and \ncontinue to keep the pressure on in trying to get a response not only \nto the letter that he offered and that many of us signed but also to, \nif possible, get the Secretary of Labor to come to a State such as \nKansas or, for that matter, South Dakota and actually see a family farm \noperation and how it functions because I think they are operating in a \nbubble, in a vacuum out here where there is very little understanding \nof the implications of these types of decisions. This is really an \nexample of big government run amok. If we want an example of big \ngovernment that has completely lost touch with reality, this is \ncertainly an example of that.\n  I encourage the Senator from Kansas, and I will support his effort \n100 percent, to keep the pressure on and trying to get them to \nrecognize the impact of what they are doing and the impact it would \nhave on rural agriculture and all over the world.\n  Mr. MORAN. I appreciate those sentiments. I would say that these \nproposed rules did not come about as a result of Congress passing a \npiece of legislation or of there being congressional hearings finding a \nseries of problems in regard to safety with young people on farms. In \nfact, the Department of Labor admits they have no real academic, \nscientific studies that were compelling them to reach this conclusion. \nIn fact, there are studies out there that show that young people are \nsafer today on farms.\n\n  This is a matter that is so important to so many people. Yes, we are \nprobably a significant minority, but we need the help of our colleagues \nfrom urban and suburban America to help us hold back this intrusion \nthat will fundamentally alter American agriculture, farming and \nranching, and a rural way of life.\n  I have a letter from a young girl in Stockton, KS. Stockton is a town \nof probably about 1,500, 1,600 in population. Her point was this: I \ndidn't grow up on a farm, but I love agriculture, and I need a job. \nThere is only a convenience store and a bank and a grain elevator in my \ntown. In the absence of my ability to work on a farm in the \nneighborhood, my ability to have a job as a teenager is greatly \ndiminished. I think I might be interested in being a farmer or a \nrancher someday.\n  I think it is the dream of every farmer, every farm family to be able \nto say: We are going to pass this farm on to the next generation--to \nour own kids or to young people.\n  Farming is this way of life that farmers and ranchers are so proud of \nand believe they serve--and they do--they serve such a noble profession \nin feeding and clothing and providing energy to a hungry and cold and \ndifficult world. Agriculture certainly is about economics, but there is \nan understanding of what farmers and ranchers do that is important to \nthe world, and we need to make certain there is another generation, \nanother set of young people who can step into the shoes of an aging \npopulation of farmers and ranchers across the country.\n  Again, these proposed rules need to be totally withdrawn, and we \nought not accept the ruse of a portion of them being proposed.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if the Senator from Kansas will yield \nquickly in closing on one point, is the Senator aware of any group that \nwas consulted on this? Were there any farm organizations that were \nbrought into this or had any input into this? As the Senator mentioned, \nwas this solicited by anyone? Was there any rationale based upon data \ncollected about safety or that sort of thing that necessitated that \nthey use such a heavyhanded, big-government approach to addressing what \nthey perceived to be a problem?\n  Mr. MORAN. Everything I know about this topic suggests that it is \notherwise. In fact, the farm organizations and commodity groups of the \nwide array of those who advocate across the country on behalf of \nagricultural producers are aligned with us in opposition to these \nrules. So it can't be that they were involved in the process of \ndeveloping the rules because they--at least every organization I know \nthat is involved as a commodity group or a farm organization is \nadamantly opposed to what the Department is suggesting.\n  Mr. THUNE. I don't know what the Senator's average age of a farmer in \nKansas is, but my understanding is, at least nationally, the average \nage of a farmer in this country is nearing 60 years old, which means \none thing: somebody is going to have to fill those shoes. Somebody is \ngoing to have to come along and take over that farm or ranch operation. \nThis is going to make it increasingly difficult to prepare that next \ngeneration of farmers and ranchers.\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\n  Again, it occurs to me that this is just something that ought to be \nwithdrawn. I hope the Senator in his efforts and those of us who are \nsupporting that effort will succeed. This is a perfect example of a \nbig-government solution to a problem that doesn't exist.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S898-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on January 4, 2012, President Obama bypassed \nthe Senate's constitutional right to advise and consent to nominees \nand, instead, unilaterally made appointments to the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau and to the National Labor Relations Board. He \npurported to do so under the Constitution's recess appointments clause, \neven though at the time of the appointments the Senate was holding pro \nforma sessions roughly every 72 hours.\n  If allowed to stand, President Obama's unprecedented and \nunconstitutional recess appointments could result in Presidents of both \nparties routinely circumventing the Senate's advice-and-consent \nfunction and thus depriving the people and the people's representatives \nof an essential check on the executive branch.\n  President Obama's actions also violate the Constitution's fundamental \nsystem of separation of powers. He has asserted the unilateral power to \noverride Congress's own determination of when it is in session and when \nit is in recess. At an absolute minimum, the Senate's institutional \nprerogatives demand that we be allowed to make our own rules. Yet \nPresident Obama's actions would deprive our body of even that basic \nright.\n  In the past, I have given pretty broad deference to the President's \njudicial nominees. Both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of \nthe Senate, I have voted in favor of the vast majority of President \nObama's nominees, including many with whom I have fundamental \ndisagreements on various points.\n  But I can do so no more. The Founders expected that each branch of \nthe Federal Government would exercise the necessary constitutional \nmeans to resist any encroachments by the other branches. Among those \nconstitutional means is the Senate's advice-and-consent function, which \nI exercised today by voting against a nominee who otherwise might have \nreceived my support. Thirty-three other Senators did exactly the same.\n  The President cannot expect the Senate's full cooperation at the same \ntime he does violence to this body's constitutional prerogatives. The \nthreshold for confirming President Obama's nominees must change \naccordingly. Simply put, there is a new standard for confirmations as a \nresult of the President's own actions. I find this unfortunate but \nultimately necessary.\n  Both today and in the coming days, I will join with other Senators to \nact as a check and a balance on the President's unconstitutional \nconduct by voting against some nominees. I expect that many of my \nRepublican colleagues, and in time some of our Democratic counterparts, \nwill rise in defense of the Constitution and vote against President \nObama's nominees until such time as he takes actions to restore the \nSenate's full constitutional right to advise and consent to his \nnominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S898-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I now choose to turn to another topic--a \ntopic that is important to many Americans, a topic that relates to an \nimportant anniversary we are recognizing.\n  Today, we are highlighting the third anniversary of President Obama's \nfailed stimulus package.\n  The President promised 3 years ago that the stimulus would create \nwhat he characterized as millions of jobs. But today, unfortunately, \ndevastatingly, there are nearly 13 million people in America who are \nstill unemployed and many millions more have even given up on looking \nfor jobs.\n  Three years ago, the White House said that because of the stimulus \npackage, unemployment would not exceed 8 percent. That has not \nhappened. In fact, the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 \nstraight months now--the longest stretch of high unemployment since the \nGreat Depression. The Congressional Budget Office predicts it is going \nto go even longer. We will not see sub-8 percent unemployment, \naccording to the CBO, until 2014.\n  The President sold his stimulus package to the American people by \nclaiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized \nas ``shovel-ready'' jobs. But last June, the President acknowledged \nthat ``shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.'' \nNevertheless, a lot of money has been spent, as we have been waiting \nfor these jobs to materialize--jobs that never quite came about.\n  In fact, some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with \nstimulating the economy. For example, consider some of the ways in \nwhich this stimulus money has been spent. Mr. President, $760,000 was \nspent on interactive dance software; $1.2 million was spent on a train \nmuseum; $2 million was spent to study ant behavior; $762,000 was spent \nto study improvised music--I am not sure what that is, but I am sure it \nis lovely, not necessarily deserving of scarce Federal resources--\n$300,000 to track weather on other planets--great if one lives on \nanother planet, not so great if one lives on Earth in a country that \nhas accumulated an unprecedented debt exceeding $15 trillion--$153,000 \nfor an indoor water park; and $712,000 to develop a ``machine-generated \nhumor'' system--in other words, a joke machine.\n  This big joke is on the American taxpayer. Unfortunately, it is no \nlaughing matter.\n  In the last 3 years, we have added more than $4 trillion to the \nnational debt, we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in \nour Nation's history, and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit \nexceeding $1 trillion.\n  This week, the President submitted a budget that calls for adding $11 \ntrillion in new debt over the next decade. His own Treasury Secretary \ncalls the level of spending unsustainable, and it is.\n  Despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has \nfailed, the President has called for additional increases in spending.\n  I know the President is a good man. I also know he faced a difficult \neconomy when he took office. But the President is unwilling to tell the \ntruth to the American people about what lies ahead, about some of the \nchallenges we face. I think he needs to do so, and he needs to \nacknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can \navoid making similar mistakes in the future.\n  Today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the President's \nstimulus. Rather, we must lament a tremendous lost opportunity by this \nadministration to put this country back on the right track over these \nlast 3 years.\n  For the sake of future generations, I hope it is not too late to \nchange course.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto finish my speech regardless of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today, we were treated to some very \npartisan remarks from one of my colleagues on the preventive services \nmandate. That is the legal term. Here is what the mandate is in \npractice.\n  It is a mandate that will require religious individuals and \ninstitutions to purchase abortion-inducing drugs for their employees. \nIt will require that they purchase insurance coverage that provides for \nsterilizations and the morning-after pill. In doing so, it will require \nthat they violate their most\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\ndeeply held religious beliefs, in stark contrast to the first \namendment's guarantee of religious liberty.\n  You would not know that from hearing some on the other side talk. You \nwould think that opposition to this mandate was grounded in bigotry and \na lack of concern for our fellow citizens.\n  This is a serious charge--one deserving of a response. My colleague \nfrom California suggested earlier today that the reason Republicans are \nopposed to this mandate--and the reason tens of millions of Americans \nare opposed to this mandate--is because they are antiwoman.\n  With due respect, one would be hard pressed to concoct a more \ninsidious and misleading explanation of the opposition to this mandate.\n  People are opposed to this mandate for one simple reason--because \nthey are in favor of religious liberty. They are opposed to it because \nit is an affront to our constitutional government, to the first right \nlisted in our first amendment--the right to free exercise of religion.\n  We would not know that from my colleague's remarks. She did not even \nmention the Constitution--not once.\n  As Members of the Senate, we take an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution. But to hear members of the administration and some \nMembers of Congress talk, it is clear to me that providing abortion-\ninducing drugs, sterilizations, and the morning-after pill to women is \nmore important than the first amendment we are sworn to the Nation and \nour constituents to defend.\n  I do not shock easily, but the cavalier attitude of the President, \nhis administration, and many in Congress to this frontal assault on \nreligious liberty is truly shocking.\n  There was a time when both parties, liberals and conservatives, could \ncome together on the matter of religious liberty--but not any longer, \napparently.\n  I think it is because for many liberals, religion and the right to \npractice it freely are not the foundation of our Nation's liberties; \nrather, they are viewed as a threat to our Nation's liberties. They do \nnot understand religious people. I guess we should have seen this \ncoming when the President ran for the White House in 2008, and he \nreferred pejoratively to these American who cling to their Bibles.\n  But the fact is, it was people who clung to their Bibles who were at \nthe forefront of some of our Nation's greatest civil rights struggles \nand have been most committed to advancing the cause of personal \nliberty. They are at the forefront today serving as a solemn witness of \nthe importance of religious liberty, threatening civil disobedience \nagainst the President's unconstitutional abortion mandate that would \nforce them to violate their most cherished moral beliefs.\n  Instead of treating these powerful witnesses to our founding ideals \nwith the respect they deserve, they are looked at with contempt. This \nmorning, one of my colleagues referred to a panel testifying about this \nassault on religious liberty as full of ``dudes.''\n  Her suggestion was that the all-male composition of this panel \nsomehow serves as proof that the objection to this abortion mandate is \ndue to hostility to women. Give me a break. Let me tell you who these \nso called ``dudes'' were: the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bridgeport, CT; \nthe president of the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod; the Graves \nProfessor of Moral Philosophy at Union University; the director of the \nStraus Center for Torah and Western Thought at Yeshiva University, and \nthe chair of the Ethics Department at Southwestern Baptist Theological \nSeminary.\n  These men, whom my colleague refers to as ``dudes,'' came to Congress \nto testify about the grave impact this Obamacare rule poses to \nreligious freedom. My colleague from California does not mention these \nother names because they are inconvenient. She does not mention \nMargaret Brining, Mary Keys, and Nicole Garnett of the University of \nNotre Dame. She does not mention Harvard's Mary Ann Glendon or the \nUniversity of Chicago's Jean Bethke Elshtain or Maria Garlock of \nPrinceton University.\n  She does not mention Helen Alvare of George Mason University or Maria \nAguirre of the Catholic University of America. She does not mention the \nMother Superior of the Sisters for Life.\n  All of these women signed a letter, along with hundreds of other \nscholars and clergy, stating the obvious truth--that the President's \nso-called compromise is unacceptable.\n  Are they all antiwomen too?\n  These thoughtful citizens, scholars, and religious people deserve our \nattention not our ridicule. Here is the bottom line: Obamacare is an \nunconstitutional abomination. It is unconstitutional to its core. The \nindividual mandate is obviously unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court \nwill rule on that soon enough.\n  But what this episode shows is that Obamacare is unconstitutional in \nits very DNA. It transfers power over one-sixth of the American economy \nto the Federal Government, and the government has proven with this \nepisode that individual liberty is threatened by that transfer of \npower.\n  If the administration cannot be relied on to protect even religious \nliberty, the right of persons and churches and synagogues to practice \ntheir faith without interference from the State, then nobody is safe. \nIf they are willing to trammel on the first amendment, they are willing \nto trammel on anything. That is the story.\n  The story is that earlier this week, Secretary Sebelius acknowledged \nto me and to the Finance Committee that she never consulted the Roman \nCatholic bishops before announcing the politically driven compromise \nthat they would be forced to comply with.\n  The story is that Secretary Sebelius admitted that she never \nrequested any first amendment analysis of this rule from the Department \nof Justice. The administration has clearly decided this is a political \nloser for them, so they are trying to change the subject. They send out \ntheir surrogates with talking points designed to scare the public into \nthinking this fight is about contraception. It is not, and the American \npeople will not be fooled. They will not be tricked into thinking that \nthose who oppose this mandate are antiwoman.\n  Do those who are promoting this spin think we do not have mothers, \nwives, and daughters? Do they think the women in the Senate and the \nHouse representing millions of more women are antiwomen? This is beyond \nabsurd, and the American people will not be duped.\n  They know this rule exists because the administration is beholden to \nthe pro-abortion lobby. And I can tell you, there is one group that the \nmodern Democratic Party will never cross, never. They will never cross \nthe abortion lobby. So it is no surprise that the Nation's largest \nabortion provider, Planned Parenthood, came out in support of the so-\ncalled compromise.\n  The Catholic Church and millions of Americans, however, responded \nthat this is unacceptable. I agree with their assessment. The so-called \ncompromise is nothing of the sort. But as bad as this mandate is, keep \nin mind it is only the beginning. It is only the first step in a fresh \nassault on the constitutional liberties of the American people. Believe \nme, the tragedy of Obamacare is only beginning.\n  The other day, former Speaker Pelosi suggested that even the Roman \nCatholic Church itself should have to provide abortion-inducing drugs \nto their employees. Catholic bishops would be forced, in her regime, to \nsubsidize practices that the Church finds morally abhorrent. That is \nwhere this is going. The administration might feel cowed into providing \na weak exception to their rule for religious institutions right now, \nbut in the long run we know where they want to go. And the resulting \nloss of liberty would be bad for men and women alike.\n  Our Constitution protects all of us. By undermining religious \nliberty, this administration goes down a very dangerous path. In so \ndoing, the officers responsible for this decision, if they knew of the \nserious constitutional issues and still went ahead with this action for \npolitical reasons, violated their oath to uphold the Constitution.\n  The Congress and the American people are going to hold them \naccountable. The President and his reelection campaign would prefer \nthat this just go away. Hence, the admonition from the mainstream media \nthat we stop talking about this issue.\n  Well, I, for one, am not going to stop talking about it, and I am not \ngoing away. I am just getting warmed up. We have seen major countries \nslip down\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nthe road toward totalitarianism because they did not stand up for \nreligious liberty. This is not a question about contraception. This is \na question about religious liberty and where we are going to stand.\n  The fact is, once we start down the road of denying the individual \nrights of personal conscience and religious freedom, and begin to tell \nchurches and synagogues what they must believe, we are on the way to \nlosing the freedoms all of us hold dear.\n\n  Religious freedom is the first freedom mentioned in the Bill of \nRights. This is important stuff. I am not Catholic. But I would fight \nto my death for the Catholic people to be able to live their faith. My \nown faith feels the same way about many of these issues. No church or \nperson should be forced to make abortion-inducing drugs accessible, as \nthe President's mandate will require them to do.\n  I do not think any compromise has been suggested so far that would \nmeet the high bar set by our Constitution. There is only one option for \nthe President on this issue. He needs to rescind this unlawful \nregulation. There is no middle ground. When it comes to the first \namendment right to religious liberty, there can be no compromise.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have about 90 nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar. That is a lot of names--people who have set their \nlives aside, after having been asked by the President of the United \nStates to do good things for our country. The vast majority are not \ncontroversial. There is nothing so about their character, their \neducation, their background. They have, with rare exception, been \nreported from the committees unanimously. They are being held up out of \nspite. Nominations on the Executive Calendar have been pending an \naverage of 3 months waiting for the Senate to act. But the Senate can \nact on these, as we have done in years past, just like that.\n  Top Department Secretaries pending before the Senate--two to be \nspecific--are very important for their leadership roles at our Federal \nagencies. For example, Rebecca Blank will fill the No. 2 position at \nthe Department of Commerce. She has a Ph.D. in economics from MIT, one \nof the finest educational institutes in the world. She served as Acting \nCommerce Secretary when Secretary Locke left to become Ambassador to \nChina. The Commerce Committee approved her, of course, by voice vote. \nThat means unanimously. Her confirmation is urgently needed because the \nCommerce Department hasn't had a confirmed deputy since July of 2010 \nbecause of the obstructionism of the Republicans here in the Senate.\n  Maurice Jones has been nominated to be Deputy Secretary at Housing \nand Urban Affairs. He worked for then-Governor Mark Warner and at the \nTreasury Department in the Clinton administration. His nomination was \nvoted out of the Banking Committee last December by voice vote.\n  Wendy Spencer, President's nominee to lead the Corporation for \nNational and Community Service, has bipartisan support from a number of \nRepublican Senators, including Marco Rubio.\n  There are also Corporation for National and Community Servicemembers \non the calendar that have been waiting for a vote since July of last \nyear. We also have law enforcement positions awaiting confirmation, \nincluding Deputy Attorney General for Tax at the Department of Justice \nand the agency's inspector general. Other important officials at the \nState Department, Treasury Department, and Homeland Security are ready \nfor the Senate to act on their nominations.\n  Regrettably, Senate Republicans continue to either block, stall, or \nobstruct these and other well-qualified nominees. Since this past fall, \na Republican Senator has blocked two nominations at the Federal \nCommunications Commission, and today they will block nominees to the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  This week, Senator Bingaman asked consent to confirm the various \nDepartment of Energy nominees and the Republicans objected. This \nobstruction is not about the nominees themselves. They are qualified \nand noncontroversial. Many came out of committee, as I have indicated, \nby a voice vote or unanimously.\n  Senate Republicans are blocking nominees for political reasons--and \nvery weak political reasons. Not everything we do here in the Senate \nshould be a fight. Virtually every one of these nominees could be \napproved today if the Senate Republicans would cooperate.\n  As I indicated when I started this conversation, these people, with \nthese jobs, have put their lives aside to wait on their confirmation. I \nhave made no secret of the fact that I think the President did the \nminimal with his recess appointments--the minimal. I think he has \nwaited far too long. If something doesn't break here, I am going to \nrecommend to the President he recess-appoint all these people--every \none of them.\n  That is not unique. The power of the recess appointment is in our \nConstitution. Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, felt he was being \ntreated improperly by the Senate. He had 160 nominations that were \nbeing held for political reasons, and he did it in a minute--recess-\nappointed 160 different people. So it is not as if there isn't some way \nto respond to this.\n  We are going to have a week here that we will be in recess. And I \nrepeat, if we don't have some significant action during the next work \nperiod, I am going to ask the President to appoint them all. I can ask, \nif I want to. He doesn't have to respond affirmatively. We will do the \njudges. We will have the fight on the judges ourselves because they are \nrecommendations we make to the President. But these are the President's \nnominations and he should have the right to have these people working \nin his administration.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent on a large number \nof nominations. I have been told that on every one of these, the \nRepublicans will object. I was asked whether it was necessary that I \nhave a Republican come here and do it in person. That is not necessary. \nI take the word of my friend, the Republican leader, that that in fact \nis the case. So on every one of these I am going to object on behalf of \nthe Republicans. How do you like that?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. \n86, 258, 259, 261, 262, 263, 264, 338, 339, 340, 344, 345, 346, 403, \n422, 450, 456, 493, 494, 495, 496, 499, 500, 501, 502, 504, 505, 506, \n507, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, \n524, 525, 526, 527, 541, 542, 543, 544, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, \n553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, \n567, 571 and 572.\n  I am told those nominations that are before the Senate now dealing \nwith the Air Force, Army, Foreign Service, the Marine Corps, and the \nNavy will be agreed to. I hope that in fact is the case. It is not part \nof this request.\n  On the numbers I have read off, I ask unanimous consent that the \nnominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order to any of the nominations; \nthat any related statements be printed in the Record, that President \nObama be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate \nthen resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of the Republicans, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words of tribute today \non behalf of my friend Admiral Dick Camacho, on the occasion of his \nretirement from the private sector.\n  Admiral Camacho's ties to Hawaii go back to the 1870s, when his \nfamily emigrated from the Azores and began working on coffee and \nplantations on the Big Island and Oahu, respectively. His father went \nthrough the machinist apprentice program at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard \nand was working there as a supervisor when it was attacked on December \n7, 1941. Then eight-year-old Dick Camacho waited for two days before \nhearing from his father that he was okay and had been working around \nthe clock putting out fires and assessing the damage from the attack.\n  Dick left the Islands to attend the University of New Mexico via the \nNaval Reserve Officers program where he graduated with a degree in \nNaval Engineering. He did post-graduate work in Electrical Engineering \nat the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey and later completed \nHarvard Business School's Management Development Program.\n  Dick began his distinguished naval career as a junior officer on the \nUSS Requisite in about as different a climate as he could find from \nHawaii. The ship was deployed to the Arctic to engage on a mapping and \nsurvey mission. From there he was ordered to Submarine School in \nConnecticut.\n  After graduating from Submarine School, Dick returned to Hawaii to \nserve as an officer aboard the USS Gudgeon, which was home-ported at \nPearl Harbor. Admiral Camacho distinguished himself as a leader and was \npromoted. The Navy also increased his responsibilities, sending him to \nNaval Sea Systems Command, Submarine Forces Atlantic, Supervisor of \nShipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and Charleston \nNaval Shipyard where he served as the Shipyard Commander.\n  In 1984, Dick became the first son of Hawaii to assume command of the \nPearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. I had the pleasure of attending a welcome \nhome reception for Dick and his wife, Norma Jean, where over 1,000 \npeople were present, including members of Hawaii's Congressional \ndelegation and local government representatives. Dick was promoted to \nRear Admiral in 1985 and given the additional responsibilities of \nserving as the Supervisor of Shipbuilding and Commander of Naval Sea \nSystems West until his retirement in 1986.\n  Embarking on his private sector career, Dick took a position with a \nSan Diego-based company involved in the repair and modernization of \nNavy vessels. During this second career, which saw him open numerous \nshipyards around the country, Dick always stayed close to Hawaii. He \nreturned many times and led the effort to revitalize the State's \nprivate sector ship repair business. He convinced his company to \npurchase a local shipyard and make significant investments in the \nfacility through workforce training and equipment and an unparalleled \ncommitment to workplace safety.\n  Both the public and private sector owe a great deal to Admiral Dick \nCamacho and his amazing wife, Norma Jean. Hawaii is a better place for \nthe contributions of these two wonderful people. I wish them both fair \nwinds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S904-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S904-S905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE FAMILY & CHILDREN'S PLACE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend an organization \nin Kentucky that is working to build brighter futures for children by \nfighting the trauma of child abuse, violence and neglect. The Family & \nChildren's Place, based in my hometown of Louisville, KY, has provided \nsupport to families and children in the region for over 127 years.\n  And I am pleased to report that they are taking a big step forward in \nbeing able to accomplish their mission by the construction of a new \nChild Advocacy Center. This center will be a model for charities with \nsimilar missions throughout the southeastern United States by including \ncharity services, law enforcement, child protective services, and \nprosecutors all in one location.\n  The Family & Children's Place's mission is to strengthen the \ncommunity through research-based services that heal the trauma of \nabuse, violence, and neglect and promote safe, healthy and stable \nfamilies. They work to educate families to prevent abuse, respond to \nchildren on the very day that abuse comes to light, treat victims to \nreduce damage to their lives, and take steps to protect children from \nfurther maltreatment. They have created an array of services to \nprevent, end and treat these problems.\n  And they do all this thanks to the generous donations of many notable \nLouisville area businesses and sponsors, and under the leadership of \nthe group's president and chief executive officer Mr. Daniel Fox.\n  Mr. President, I wish to bestow the gratitude of this United States \nSenate on the Family & Children's Place of Louisville, KY, and wish \nthem continued success for many years to come. Their success can only \nbenefit the youngest and most vulnerable Kentuckians, who need their \nservices the most.\n  Recently, the newspaper the Louisville Courier-Journal published an \narticle highlighting the new Child Advocacy Center for the Family & \nChildren's Place, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord that particular article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Oct. 25, 2011]\n\n           Family & Children's Place Has Money for Big Center\n\n                         (By Sheldon S. Shafer)\n\n       Family & Children's Place, a charity dedicated to helping \n     sexually exploited children, has raised the money it needs to \n     proceed with plans for a Child Advocacy Center at the old \n     Salvation Army site near Fifth and Kentucky streets.\n       The Louisville Metro Police Department's Crimes Against \n     Children Unit and prosecutors from the Jefferson County \n     commonwealth's attorney's office also will have \n     representatives at the center, envisioned as the city's first \n     comprehensive site to help young victims of abuse or \n     violence.\n       The center ``will be a tremendous addition to the \n     neighborhood, a top-notch project, and it will be great for \n     the kids who come through here,'' said Daniel Fox, president \n     and chief executive officer of the Family & Children's Place.\n       The organization plans to move its existing Child Advocacy \n     Center from Fourth Street near Muhammad Ali Boulevard to a \n     site near the Old Louisville, Limerick and South Broadway \n     neighborhoods.\n       Police investigators, prosecutors and contract \n     pediatricians usually have to come to the current office, \n     which is small, to interview or help victims. At times, the \n     arrangement results in multiple interviews and extra stress \n     for the children, Fox said.\n       Consolidating services, including those of Family & \n     Children's Place's counselors, at the Kentucky Street site \n     should 14 mean help can often be provided more quickly, he \n     said.\n       ``The idea is to get everyone together at one location,'' \n     Fox said. ``We hope to make it a national model for dealing \n     with child sexual-abuse cases.''\n       The agency bought the property at 512 W. Kentucky St. from \n     the Salvation Army in 2009 for $450,000. The Salvation Army \n     left the site, which has a long history for use as a \n     hospital, rehab facility and command center, when it \n     purchased the old Male High School building four years ago.\n       Fox said plans call for gutting and refurbishing the \n     18,000-square-foot structure and building several additions, \n     increasing the space to 22,000 square feet.\n       The agency hopes to break ground by March and occupy the \n     renovated site by the end of 2012. The project will cost \n     about $4 million.\n       In addition, it is spending more than $700,000 to buy a \n     vacant tract southeast of Fifth and Kentucky streets, behind \n     the former Salvation Army property, from the National Society \n     of the Sons of the American Revolution.\n       The Family & Children's Place has worked out a land swap \n     with the commission that runs Memorial Auditorium. The \n     commission will give the children's agency a parcel (now an \n     auditorium parking lot) on the corner of Fifth and Kentucky \n     streets to be used for one of its additions.\n       The children's agency, in turn, will use part of the land \n     it is buying from the Sons of the Revolution to develop \n     parking for the auditorium.\n       Longer-range plans call for the Family & Children's Place \n     to use most of the rest of the land it is buying from the \n     Sons of the American Revolution to build a 10,000-square-foot \n     family-support center.\n       The timing of the family center is uncertain, Fox said, but \n     the plan is to move the children's agency's main offices and \n     staff from 2303 River Road to that location. The family \n     center's cost is estimated at more than $2 million, much of \n     which is yet to be raised.\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\n       So far the children's agency's Building Brighter Futures \n     campaign, which began 2008, has about $7.3 million in \n     donations and pledges, including $2 million from Kosair \n     Charities and $1 million from the James Graham Brown \n     Foundation. The eventual target is $11 million, including \n     money for operations and endowment.\n       Of the sum raised to date, nearly $5 million has been \n     earmarked for the Child Advocacy Center project, including \n     land acquisition, and just over $2 million for agency \n     operations. Most of the balance has been budgeted for the \n     endowment.\n       The children's agency plans to borrow against the pledges \n     to get enough construction money to start work, Fox said.\n       He said the agency has tried to keep neighbors apprised of \n     the plans as they have unfolded, including periodic \n     briefings.\n       Herb Fink, an Old Louisville neighborhood leader, said the \n     neighbors have been working with the children's agency for \n     several years. He said they opposed an initial plan, since \n     shelved, for the agency to use Ben Washer Park, on the north \n     side of Kentucky at Fifth, for part of its Project.\n       Renovation of the old Salvation Army site ``will improve \n     the neighborhood, save an old vacant building and cleanup an \n     eyesore. We want to be very supportive of this (children's \n     services) program that is of national significance,'' Fink \n     said.\n       Family & Children's Place provides direct services to about \n     1,000 exploited children annually.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S904-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S904-S905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE FAMILY & CHILDREN'S PLACE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

VANHOOSE & COMPANY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe most vital components of the American economy, the family-owned \nbusiness. For over a century, Kentucky's own F.S. VanHoose & Company \nhas persevered throughout the struggles that many small businesses \nface, and they are still on top. The company has a rich history of \nserving the Kentucky communities of Paintsville, Prestonsburg, Louisa, \nand the surrounding area. Although they have evolved and changed \nthroughout the years to keep up with their competitors, it is their \ndedication to the customer and to the employee that still lies at the \nheart of the organization. And that is something that has never \nchanged--not in the VanHoose family, and not in the VanHoose Company.\n  Frew S. VanHoose founded the lumber company in 1910. Frew's son \nHoward VanHoose, who worked briefly for the company after studying at \nthe Kentucky Military Institute, would answer the call to serve his \ncountry in 1943. Howard VanHoose was killed in action in Germany in \nApril of 1945, his son Joe Howard VanHoose aged only four at the time.\n  Frew VanHoose went on to spend 54 years running the company as \npresident and CEO, until he could not manage the business anymore due \nto his failing health. With the founder of the company stepping down, \nthe course of the company would dramatically change. After a brief 2-\nweek interlude, in 1964, Frew S. VanHoose's grandson Joe Howard \nVanHoose, then just 23 years old, became the new president of F.S. \nVanHoose & Company. In over a century of business, F.S. VanHoose & \nCompany has had only two presidents in its entirety.\n  Joe was perhaps inexperienced and not entirely ready to handle the \nmanagement of his family's company, which under his grandfather, had \ngrown to become a large, multi-faceted operation. In his own words, Joe \ndescribed himself as ``23 going on 18.''\n  ``I thought to myself, Joe, it's either sink or swim. I swam,'' Joe \nsaid.\n  Today, the company's sales rate is 30 times greater than it was in \nthe mid-1960s. Joe has spent 58 years as the company's president and \nCEO. The business is financially stable and annually injects great \namounts of out-of-county and out-of-state money into the local economy. \nVanHoose & Company has been listed by various national trade magazines \nin the top 400 businesses several times.\n  The secret to this small-town lumber company's success is simple. By \ntreating employees well and keeping turnover rates low, the employees \nare able and ready to stay at VanHoose & Company for the long haul.\n  Next, Joe relies heavily on the leadership of his fellow family \nmembers throughout the company. He believes it is up to them to carry \non the business in the future.\n  Also, every business needs to be able to change with the times--and \nsometimes even before the times. Joe remembers VanHoose & Company using \ncomputers long before they were the norm. Now he can hardly imagine \ngoing a day without them.\n  Last, but certainly not least, is pride. Each individual involved \nwith the organization cares deeply about the well-being of the company, \nand reveals it in their day-to-day display of upstanding character and \ncustomer service.\n  It is my hope that today, my fellow Senators will join me in \nrecognizing the contribution that this company has made and is \ncontinuing to make in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Success stories \nlike that of F.S. VanHoose & Company resonate as examples of what hard \nwork, perseverance, and dedication can lead to in our great country.\n  There was an article recently printed in the publication ``Discover \nthe Power of Southeast Kentucky,'' published by the Southeast Kentucky \nChamber of Commerce in the summer of 2011. I ask unanimous consent that \nit appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      [From Discover the Power of Southeast Kentucky, Summer 2011]\n\n\n                       VanHoose Lumber Since 1910\n\n       When you meet Joe Howard VanHoose, president and CEO of \n     F.S. VanHoose & Company, you notice first the smile, \n     contagious laughter and friendly demeanor. Under all this \n     congeniality he's a very good businessman who guided the \n     family business from financial straits in the mid-1960s to \n     the celebration of its 101st anniversary, making the company \n     one of the oldest continuing retail businesses in the tri-\n     state region. Joe VanHoose has seen the company through the \n     worst of times and the best of times, with more good times \n     than bad.\n       F.S. VanHoose & Company was founded in 1910 by Frew S. \n     VanHoose who ran the business until he was into his 80s. \n     ``Technically, we have had only two presidents of the company \n     in the 101 years of operation,'' Joe says with a smile. ``My \n     grandfather's failing health in the 1960s changed our course. \n     In 1964 I was nominated as president of our company. I was 23 \n     going on 18. Oh, we had an interim president for two weeks. \n     Frew gave one of his cronies the position with no money \n     changing hands. The man was to get his with what was to come \n     by turning the business around. A `falling out' over \n     something said to him got him to throw down his keys and go \n     home.\n       ``At that time we had a longtime secretary/treasurer of the \n     company named McKinley Baldwin, also a stockholder in the \n     business, who nominated me as president. I'm pretty sure he \n     was looking out for his own interest as well as the company's \n     when he did that. He knew I was so green and inexperienced I \n     would do whatever he said. I thought to myself, `Joe, It's \n     either sink or swim.' I swam!'' Then he added with a grin, \n     ``More out of fear than intelligence.''\n       Joe came from good stock. His father Howard VanHoose had \n     graduated from Paintsville High School in 1935 and attended \n     Kentucky Military Institute before joining his father in the \n     family lumber business as manager of the Louisa operation. He \n     was very active in civic affairs: a member of the Louisa City \n     Council, vice president of the Rotary Club, secretary/\n     treasurer of the Business Men's Club and a member of the \n     I.O.O.F. This was all interrupted in 1943 by a call to \n     service for WWII. Howard VanHoose was killed in action in \n     Germany in April 1945. Joe was but four years old.\n       When Joe assumed the leadership role, F.S. VanHoose & \n     Company had a hardware store, lumber yard and wholesale \n     department in Paintsville, a facility in Prestonsburg and a \n     lumber yard in Louisa. To get the company back on solid \n     ground, Joe said he shored up some things and put good \n     practices into place. ``We consolidated our Paintsville \n     operations and the Louisa yard.''\n       Joe attributes much of the success of the company to hiring \n     and retaining excellent employees. ``We give employees a good \n     benefits package. This is one reason we have so many long-\n     time employees. That, plus we treat them well. Low turnover \n     means a lot to us as well as to our customer base--friendly, \n     familiar faces. Besides our regular career employees, we have \n     family members who have been here a long time. My cousin \n     Scott Craft retired from here about six years ago. He was \n     vice president. His brother Mike retired about two months \n     ago. He was manager of our Prestonsburg operation as well as \n     secretary/treasurer. I have a son, Harry, in the business \n     now, and hopefully the family will carry the business on in \n     the future.''\n       Another crucial move on VanHoose's part was changing with \n     and sometimes before the times. His company utilized \n     computers before it became the norm. ``It's so common now,'' \n     he said ``that I wonder how companies ever operated without \n     them.''\n       At one point the growing trend of ``chain yards'' started \n     getting close to what was considered F.S. VanHoose & \n     Company's market area, which was a 75-to-100-mile radius \n     reaching into three states. ``They were getting into \n     Huntington, around the Ashland Oil plant near Catlettsburg \n     and in Ironton, Ohio. They were shifting into our market, and \n     I knew we had to do something. I knew it would be just a \n     matter of time before they were in our face.\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\n       ``The older way of doing business was by operating off \n     certain margins. We went through a gradual evolution from \n     margin to volume.''\n       Over the years some of the large chains have moved on up \n     the Big Sandy Valley into VanHoose's backdoor. Some stayed \n     around a little while, others longer. ``We have taken some \n     hard shots over the years, but we have managed. We have two \n     large sales each year--spring and fall. We promote these \n     sales in 25 newspapers with full-page ads. We use 10 to 12 \n     radio stations and two TV stations, also. We have no outside \n     sales, and this gets our name out there. It brings people in \n     from other markets. We've been doing these sales since the \n     early '70s.''\n       Joe said new facilities are planned for the Prestonsburg \n     store. ``Adjacent to where we are now, we are renovating a \n     large former Betsy Ross warehouse and plan a move into it \n     soon. Also in Prestonsburg, we have a new manager since Mike \n     retired. Calhoun Salyer from Paintsville had worked several \n     years for us while going to college . . . probably 25 years \n     ago. After he graduated from UK, he became secretary/\n     treasurer for us and stayed around about five years before \n     going elsewhere. He is back. He had been in management and \n     sales and has brought that expertise with him. He is a good \n     addition.\n       ``We are financially stable now. Sales are 30 times what \n     they were in the mid-1960s. We bring a lot of out-of-county \n     and out-of-state money into this area.''\n       Joe said that higher volume has required expansion of \n     equipment and personnel to handle it. ``Today, we have a \n     fleet of a dozen trucks and a maintenance department to keep \n     them running well, a boom truck to handle drywall, 10 \n     forklifts, and half a dozen piggyback trucks with forklifts \n     hanging off the back for special deliveries . . . all to \n     serve our customers. Our total personnel varies between 37 \n     and 50, depending on the economy.''\n       Another added value that has most certainly contributed to \n     the company's success is also a source of pride. ``The amount \n     of expertise that we have to offer to the customer that is \n     free is phenomenal,'' Joe said. ``If a professional \n     contractor wants to know something, he or she comes to us.''\n       ``In the 1980s and early '90s, national trade magazines had \n     our little company listed in the top 400 several years in a \n     row. No little feat considering the large amount of lumber \n     companies in this country and their sizes.''\n       Joe grinned, ``Can you imagine continuing 101 years in the \n     retail business and having only two presidents of the company \n     during that time?''\n       When asked how much longer he plans to work, he laughs and \n     answers, ``There was a man in Lewisburg, West Virginia, who \n     ran his lumber company and showed up every day until he \n     passed away at 103. I'd like to break his record.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S905-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S905-S906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING F.S. VANHOOSE & COMPANY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe most vital components of the American economy, the family-owned \nbusiness. For over a century, Kentucky's own F.S. VanHoose & Company \nhas persevered throughout the struggles that many small businesses \nface, and they are still on top. The company has a rich history of \nserving the Kentucky communities of Paintsville, Prestonsburg, Louisa, \nand the surrounding area. Although they have evolved and changed \nthroughout the years to keep up with their competitors, it is their \ndedication to the customer and to the employee that still lies at the \nheart of the organization. And that is something that has never \nchanged--not in the VanHoose family, and not in the VanHoose Company.\n  Frew S. VanHoose founded the lumber company in 1910. Frew's son \nHoward VanHoose, who worked briefly for the company after studying at \nthe Kentucky Military Institute, would answer the call to serve his \ncountry in 1943. Howard VanHoose was killed in action in Germany in \nApril of 1945, his son Joe Howard VanHoose aged only four at the time.\n  Frew VanHoose went on to spend 54 years running the company as \npresident and CEO, until he could not manage the business anymore due \nto his failing health.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nWhitney Elizabeth Houston who passed away on Saturday, February 11, \n2012. Whitney Houston was a shining star born in the great city of \nNewark, NJ, whose life will be celebrated locally and globally by her \nfamily and friends.\n  Whitney followed in the footsteps of her mother and began performing \nas a soloist in the junior gospel choir at the New Hope Baptist Church \nin Newark, where her first solo performance was ``Guide Me, O Thou \nGreat Jehovah.'' Later she became the first woman of color to grace the \ncover of Seventeen Magazine and was also featured in layouts in the \npages of Glamour, Cosmopolitan, and Young Miss.\n  In 1983, Clive Davis, head of Arista Records, helped start Whitney's \nrecording career, and she went on to begin her meteoric rise to fame, \nwith Rolling Stone praising her as ``one of the most exciting new \nvoices in years,'' while the New York Times called her debut, self-\ntitled album ``an impressive, musically conservative showcase for an \nexceptional vocal talent.''\n  In 1986, a year after the initial release of her debut album, Whitney \ntopped the Billboard 200 albums chart and stayed there for 14 weeks \nwith the final single, ``Greatest Love of All,'' which became one of \nher biggest hits. The album became the first album by a female to yield \nthree No. 1 hits.\n  Whitney Houston is recognized as the most awarded female musical \nartist of all time, having received 2 Emmy Awards, 6 Grammy Awards, 22 \nAmerican Music Awards, and 30 Billboard Music Awards. She also holds \nnumerous other distinctions, including the best selling single by a \nfemale artist in music history, first solo act to sell more than \n1,000,000 copies of an album within a 1-week period, the only artist to \nchart 7 consecutive No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits. She also had the best \nselling movie soundtrack of all time, ``The Bodyguard.''\n  Beyond her professional career, Whitney Houston demonstrated her \ncommitment to humanitarianism as a supporter of Nelson Mandela and the \nantiapartheid movement, refusing to do business with agencies that did \nbusiness with the then-apartheid South Africa. She also founded the \nWhitney Houston Foundation for Children, an organization that cared for \nthe homeless and children with cancer and AIDS. And during the 2009 \n2010 academic school year, the Whitney E. Houston Academy of Creative \nand Performing Arts became a thriving, arts-focused institution that \nprovides expanded educational opportunities for the student body and \nsurrounding community.\n  There are many reasons why America will never forget Whitney Houston, \nbut one of the most memorable was her performance of ``The Star \nSpangled Banner'' at Super Bowl XXV on January 27, 1991. That \nperformance was so powerful that it was later released as a commercial \nsingle and the video of her performance reached the top 20 on the \nBillboard Hot 100, making her the only person to turn the national \nanthem into a pop hit of that magnitude.\n  Mr. President, it is with immense sadness but great honor that I \nrecognize, commend, and celebrate the life and legacy of Whitney E. \nHouston, a star of New Jersey who went on to shine bright across the \nglobe. I extend my deepest condolences to Whitney's mother Cissy \nHouston, daughter Bobbi Kristina, her other family members and friends, \nand to her millions of fans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S906-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S906-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S906-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S906-S907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT DATED FEBRUARY 2012 WITH THE ANNUAL \n       REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS FOR 2012--PM 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Joint Economic Committee:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  One of the fundamental tenets of the American economy has been that \nif you work hard, you can do well enough to raise a family, own a home, \nsend your kids to college, and put a little money away for retirement. \nThat's the promise of America.\n  The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. We \ncan either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do \nvery well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can \nrestore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their \nfair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.\n  Long before the recession that began in December 2007, job growth was \ninsufficient for our growing population. Manufacturing jobs were \nleaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also \nmade some jobs obsolete. The few at the top saw their incomes rise like \nnever before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that \nwere growing, paychecks that were not, and personal debt that kept \npiling up.\n  In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had \nbeen sold to people who could not afford them or did not understand \nthem. Banks had made huge bets and doled out big bonuses with other \npeople's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or did not have \nthe authority to stop the bad behavior. It was wrong. It was \nirresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put \nmillions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent,\n\n[[Page S907]]\n\nhardworking Americans holding the bag.\n  In the year before I took office, we lost nearly 5 million private \nsector jobs. And we lost almost another 4 million before our policies \nwere in full effect.\n  Those are the facts. But so are these: In the last 23 months, \nbusinesses have created 3.7 million jobs. Last year, they created the \nmost jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating \njobs for the first time since the late 1990s. And we have put in place \nnew rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never \nhappens again.\n  Some, however, still advocate going back to the same economic \npolicies that stacked the deck against middle-class Americans for way \ntoo many years. And their philosophy is simple: We are better off when \neverybody is left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules.\n  That philosophy is wrong. The more Americans who succeed, the more \nAmerica succeeds. These are not Democratic values or Republican values. \nThey are American values. And we have to reclaim them.\n  This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and for all \nthose who are working to get into the middle class. It is a moment when \nwe can go back to the ways of the past--to growing deficits, stagnant \nincomes and job growth, declining opportunity, and rising inequality--\nor we can make a break from the past. We can build an economy by \nrestoring our greatest strengths: American manufacturing, American \nenergy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values--\nan economy built to last.\n  When it comes to the deficit, we have already agreed to more than $2 \ntrillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means \nmaking choices. Right now, we are poised to spend nearly $1 trillion \nmore on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the \nwealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and \nshelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax \nrates than millions of middle-class households. I believe that tax \nreform should follow the Buffett Rule. If you make more than $1 million \na year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. In fact, if \nyou are earning a million dollars a year, you should not get special \ntax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under \n$250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families do, your taxes \nshould not go up.\n  Americans know that this generation's success is only possible \nbecause past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to \nthe future of their country. Now it is our turn. Now it falls to us to \nlive up to that same sense of shared responsibility.\n  This year's Economic Report of the President, prepared by the Council \nof Economic Advisers, describes the emergency rescue measures taken to \nend the recession and support the ongoing recovery, and lays out a \nblueprint for an economy built to last. It explains how we are \nrestoring our strengths as a Nation--our innovative economy, our strong \nmanufacturing base, and our workers--by investing in the technologies \nof the future, in companies that create jobs here in America, and in \neducation and training programs that will prepare our workers for the \njobs of tomorrow. We must ensure that these investments benefit \neveryone and increase opportunity for all Americans or we risk \nthreatening one of the features that defines us as a Nation--that \nAmerica is a country in which anyone can do well, regardless of how \nthey start out.\n  No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because \nwe built it together. If we remember that truth today, join together in \ncommon purpose, and maintain our common resolve, then I am as confident \nas ever that our economic future is hopeful and strong.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S907-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 3630) to provide incentives for the creation of jobs, and for \nother purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S907-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2118.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2125. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmodify the designation of accreditation organizations for orthotics and \nprosthetics, to apply accreditation and licensure requirements to \nsuppliers of such devices and items for purposes of payment under the \nMedicare program, and to modify the payment rules for such devices and \nitems under such program to account for practitioner qualifications and \ncomplexity of care; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of patients, \npractitioners and the American taxpayer to introduce the Medicare \nOrthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2012 with my colleagues, \nSenators Snowe and Grassley.\n  The current orthotics and prosthetics, O, market is ripe for fraud \nand abuse. Unqualified and dishonest practitioners are taking advantage \nof patients and Medicare by providing substandard O products and \nmanipulating the Medicare payment system. No rule has been implemented \non the Federal level which would require these practitioners and \nproviders to be licensed or accredited, despite calls from Congress to \ndo so, and therefore all comers are able to bill Medicare on the \ntaxpayer's dime.\n  Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have \ntried to address this issue in the past, but have come up short. In \nboth 2000 and 2003, Congress passed legislation which should have \nincreased the qualification standards for these providers. \nUnfortunately, nothing came of these efforts and a decade later we have \na system in place that does little to discourage fraud and abuse in \nthese fields.\n  One department, however, has stepped up and taken the lead on this \nissue: the Department of Veterans Affairs. After a program evaluation \nshowed that VA O Laboratories did not meet quality standards they \nchanged their policy so that only accredited laboratories and \nindividuals may fabricate prostheses and orthoses.\n  The rest of the country must follow the VA's lead in order to ensure \nthat patients from Oregon to Maine have access to high quality \northotics and prosthetics from a trusted source. Our legislation \naccomplishes this goal through measures that would improve the \noversight of O practitioners.\n  The Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act would get rid \nof unqualified practitioners by prohibiting CMS from making any \nMedicare payment for orthotics and prosthetics to a practitioner who \nhas not secured a license in those states that require licensure. \nAgain, this requirement was issued by CMS in 2005 but has not yet been \nimplemented. Practitioners in states without licensure requirements \nwould need to become accredited in order to continue practicing. The \naccreditation standard would be identical to the standard adopted by \nthe Veterans Administration in 2004.\n  The legislation goes a step further by requiring that the Medicare \npayment is matched to the qualification of the provider and the \ncomplexity of the patient's needs and the device provided. This \nprovision will protect patients from suppliers with little or no \neducation and training to provide comprehensive O services, while \nrewarding providers who have secured more advanced training and \npractice on more complex patients.\n  These common sense reforms will benefit patients, qualified \npractitioners and taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to join Senators \nSnowe, Grassley and me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       Whereas the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     will immediately schedule a hearing to take place as soon as \n     the Senate reconvenes to assess the situation in Syria and \n     all the international options available to address this \n     crisis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly condemns the Government of Syria's brutal and \n     unjustifiable use of force against civilians, including \n     unarmed women and children and its violations of the \n     fundamental human rights and dignity of the people of Syria;\n       (2) expresses its solidarity with the people of Syria, who \n     have exhibited remarkable courage and determination in the \n     face of unspeakable violence to rid themselves of a brutal \n     dictatorship;\n       (3) expresses strong disappointment with the Governments of \n     the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China for \n     their veto of the United Nations Security Council resolution \n     condemning Bashar al-Assad and the violence in Syria and \n     urges them to reconsider their votes;\n       (4) encourages the members of the United Nations Security \n     Council to continue to pursue a resolution in support of a \n     political solution to the crisis in Syria;\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\n       (5) commends the League of Arab States' efforts to bring \n     about a peaceful resolution in Syria;\n       (6) regrets that the League of Arab States observer mission \n     was not able to monitor the full implementation of the League \n     of Arab States' Action Plan of November 2, 2011, due to the \n     escalating violence in Syria; and\n       (7) urges the international community to review legal \n     processes available to hold officials of the Government of \n     Syria accountable for crimes against humanity and gross \n     violations of human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/17/senate-section/article/S1021-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21 THROUGH MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.
