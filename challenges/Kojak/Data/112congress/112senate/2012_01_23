Mr. President, Winston Churchill said:\n\n       Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is \n     also what it takes to sit down and listen.\n\n  I know each of my colleagues in the Senate--regardless of political \nparty--has the courage to stand up and speak in defense of his or her \nprinciples. This year I hope we each find the courage and faith to \nlisten and cooperate as well.\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\n  The Founders, in their wisdom, when drafting our Constitution, \ncreated a divided government. That is what they did with this bicameral \nlegislature they envisioned. They also looked to see a robust debate on \nimportant issues. I do not believe they envisioned the obstructionism \nand gridlock that ground the Senate to a halt last year. Influenced by \nthe tea party voices, Republicans forced us to waste months on routine \nlegislation, they nearly shut down our government, and they held \nhostage the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  So I remind my Republican colleagues that not every discussion, every \nmatter we deal with, should collapse into a fight. We do not have to \nfight about everything. Every piece of legislation we consider should \nnot result in a political battle.\n\n  When we work together, we achieve greater results for the American \npeople. That is why this year Democrats and Republicans must seek \ncommon ground. We must also admit it when we find that common ground, \nand work on that common ground we have discovered.\n  We should all be able to agree that Congress must do whatever it \ntakes to help create jobs and strengthen our economy. Democrats believe \nit will take commonsense policies that protect the middle class and \nsmart investments that rebuild our roads, bridges, and schools, our \nwater and sewer systems.\n  We must combat income inequality now or the rich will keep getting \nricher and the poor getting poorer, while the middle class disappears. \nThat is not fiction; it is fact.\n  I watched on public television within the past week or so a wonderful \npiece on ``Bill Moyers Journal.'' I was so impressed with that, I \ncalled and spoke with him afterwards. I am not in the habit of calling \npeople like that very often, but over the years we have spoken a couple \ntimes--three or four times probably over the many years I have been \nhere.\n  The reason I was so impressed with what he said is that it reminded \nme I think of what a lot of people should be reminded. He talked about \ngoing to a public elementary school, he talked about going to a public \nhigh school, a State-supported university, and during all this time of \ngoing to libraries, public libraries.\n  We have to understand that government has been so helpful to most of \nus, and we cannot turn away from institutions of government which have \nbeen so important to us over the years.\n  So I repeat, we must combat income inequality and combat it now or \nthe rich will keep getting richer, the poor getting poorer, and the \nmiddle class being squeezed all the more. I repeat, that is not \nfiction; it is a fact.\n  We Democrats will continue to defend working Americans, and we hope \nRepublicans will join us in that regard. But if they allow the tea \nparty to turn every issue into an all-or-nothing battle, we cannot back \ndown--we should not back down--and we will always side with the middle \nclass.\n  We saw the results of Republican brinkmanship in December.\n  I was on a--well, I will not talk about TV shows--but as soon as we \nhad the vote here, I walked up to the press gallery, as I was requested \nto do, and complimented publicly my Republican colleague Senator \nMcConnell--and I was happy it did get some press--because Senator \nMcConnell and I made an arrangement here to complete this legislation, \nand he stuck by that. I know he had tremendous pressure, and I cannot \nunderstand all the pressure he did have. But I admire and appreciate \nwhat he did in sticking with what the Senate did. So we then refused to \ngive up on a tax cut for hard-working families, and it turned out well \nbecause Members of Congress came to the realization that the American \npeople said they could not afford a thousand-dollar tax hike. Putting \nmoney back in the pockets of 160 million American workers should not \nhave been so difficult. It should not have been a fight in the first \nplace. I hope we all learned a lesson in this battle.\n  It is time for us to stop fighting. I repeat, we do not have to fight \nabout everything. There comes a time--and that time is now--when we \nneed to have the courage to stand up and fight for what is right.\n  This year it will be as important that we summon the courage to sit \ndown and listen. Rather than standing up and fighting, we need to sit \ndown and listen more often.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S14-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           COLLEGE BASKETBALL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend starts, the Republican \nleader and I deal with a lot of issues that come up in the Senate, and \nsome of them are difficult. But the one thing we have that is kind of a \ndiversion for us is we follow college athletics in our respective \nStates. I have been very fortunate in Nevada that the University of \nNevada has had a very good football team the last 5 or 6 or 7 years. I \nwill not talk about the UNLV football item; it is not worth doing, as I \ntold the university president.\n  But we also have in Nevada--and this is always the way it is in \nKentucky; they always have good basketball teams--we have been doing \nvery well in recent years, especially at UNLV; and now what UNR has is, \nI believe, the longest winning record in Division I basketball. They \nhave only lost three games. UNLV has only lost 3 games.\n  So we have fun in our few minutes together talking about basketball. \nI have never seen a more avid fan of the University of Louisville. He, \nof course, follows the University of Kentucky, which is easy to follow, \nbecause their teams are always so good. But so is Louisville's team. \nAnd Louisville and UNLV have had, in recent years, some very tight \nbasketball battles.\n  So I want the Acting President pro tempore and everyone else to know \nSenator McConnell and I do, on occasion, divert from the business of \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S14-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I wish to begin my remarks today by simply stating the \nobvious: The jobs crisis we are in continues for millions of Americans. \nMany millions more are worried about the future. And Republicans are \nquite eager to work with the Democratic majority here in the Senate to \njump-start our economy and set our Nation on an entirely different \ncourse than the one we have been on the last few years.\n  Let's be clear: The reason our economy has gotten worse and our \nfuture more uncertain has nothing to do with what Republicans in \nCongress will not do at some point in the future and everything to do \nwith what this President has already done.\n  Americans are looking for an entirely new direction. It is one that \nfocuses on growing the economy, not growing our Nation's debt.\n  So we are happy to work with the Democratic majority in the Senate to \nachieve these goals. But based on some of the news stories I have read \nover the last few weeks, it does not appear they are all that \ninterested. Based on what I have read, it appears Democratic leaders \nright here in the Senate have gotten together with the White House\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\nand mapped out a plan to actually guarantee gridlock for the rest of \nthe year.\n  This is sort of a stunningly cynical strategy when you think about \nit. Millions of Americans cannot find work. The average length of \nunemployment is the longest it has ever been. Hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans who had a job when this President took office have simply \ndropped out of the workforce. And yet the Washington Democrats' plan \nfor this year is to sit on their hands and blame it on the other guy.\n  I certainly hope this was just a couple of overzealous staffers \nsaying this. I hope our Democratic friends have not decided this is how \nthey plan to spend the rest of this year. I hope they have not given up \non governing in favor of campaigning and complaining because, to borrow \na phrase, facing up to the economic crises we face cannot wait. \nDemocrats in Congress cannot simply throw in the towel because they are \nno longer getting everything they want.\n  The fact is, Democrats got everything they wanted for 2 years--for 2 \nyears after this President was elected. The American people decided to \nimpose a little balance in the November 2010 election, and they are \nstill waiting for this White House and Democratic leaders in Congress \nto work on a different approach. So it is about time we got started. \nPresident Obama's 3-year experiment with big government has made our \neconomy worse and our future more uncertain. Americans want a \ngovernment that is simpler, streamlined, and secure.\n  But we will not be able to achieve these things if Democrats refuse \nto even try, if they have decided to spend the next year on show votes \nand legislation that is designed for bus tours instead of bill \nsignings.\n  The No. 1 issue facing our country is jobs, and the No. 1 goal of \nRepublicans in 2012 is to continue to make it easier for American small \nbusiness to create jobs. We will accomplish this by focusing on three \nthings: fundamental tax reform, regulatory reform, and energy security. \nBut we will surely fail if the Democratic majority in the Senate \nrefuses to help.\n  So Republicans will continue to make the case for policies that will \nspark an economic revival and create new opportunities for struggling \nAmericans, and we hope the Democrats will join us. Tomorrow, the \nPresident will come to the Capitol to tell us what he thinks about the \nstate of our country and to outline his plans for the future. We \nwelcome him. We look forward to his address. We stand ready to work \nwith him as always on an agenda that will get our Nation moving again, \nnot an agenda to divide, not a repackaging of the same ideas that have \nmade our economy worse and our future more uncertain but a truly \nbipartisan agenda that gets us beyond past skirmishes and onto a \ndifferent path entirely. There is much we can and should do together. \nLet us focus on that and put the rest aside.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S15-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I rise to speak on behalf of an outstanding \nNebraskan, State Supreme Court Justice John Gerrard. His nomination to \nfill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for Nebraska is now before \nthe Senate.\n  John Gerrard has built an exceptional record in private practice and \non the Nebraska Supreme Court and will do an exemplary job as a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the District of Nebraska. I have known him for more \nthan 20 years and believe he has the experience, the intellect, and the \ntemperament needed on our Federal bench. I cannot think of anyone \nbetter qualified than John Gerrard.\n  I was very pleased the President nominated him. I have welcomed my \ncolleague Senator Johann's strong support, and I believe the Senate \nshould confirm him for the position of a U.S. district court judge.\n  John Gerrard, a native of Schuyler, NE, has served as a private \nattorney, a city attorney, counsel to several public school districts \nin Nebraska, and he has an outstanding public record as a judge. In \nprivate practice, Judge Gerrard tried dozens of cases, both civil and \ncriminal, to verdicts in State and Federal courts. He was highly \nrespected as a trial attorney earning an ``AV'' Martindale-Hubbell \nrating from his colleagues. He was elected to the American Board of \nTrial Advocates by his peers.\n  During my tenure as Governor, I appointed him, in 1995, to the \nNebraska Supreme Court. Nebraska voters have shown their confidence in \nhim by retaining him in office three times: in 1998, 2004, and 2010. He \nhas consistently received top ratings by the Nebraska State Bar \nAssociation in its biennial judicial evaluations, particularly in the \nareas of legal analysis, judicial temperament, and fair treatment of \nlitigants and their lawyers.\n  Furthermore, the Nebraska judicial system gave him its Distinguished \nJudge for Improvement of Judicial System Award in 2006. This was in \nrecognition of his work as cochair of the system's Minority Justice \nCommittee and the Interpreter Advisory Committee, as well as leading \ninitiatives promoting racial and ethnic fairness under the law.\n  Also, in 2008, the Nebraska State Bar Foundation gave him its Legal \nPioneer Award. This was for making the courts more user friendly for \ncitizens from all cultures by utilizing technology and other means to \nimprove both understanding and participation in the courts. I would \nnote that on the Nebraska Supreme Court, Judge Gerrard has authored \nmore than 450 opinions, and he is widely considered a leader on that \ncourt.\n  Judge Gerrard is held in the highest regard by both the bench and the \nbar in Nebraska, and the American Bar Association has deemed him \n``unanimously well qualified'' to serve as a U.S. district judge. Judge \nGerrard maintains the same even temperament off the bench as he does on \nthe bench. Clearly, he is an exemplary person who has contributed much \nto our society.\n  Furthermore, he and his wife Nancy have been married for 34 years and \nhave raised four exceptional children. I would also note that during my \nyears as Governor, I appointed 81 judges in the State of Nebraska, \nincluding the Nebraska State Supreme Court. Since I have been in the \nSenate, I voted on numerous judicial nominees. In all cases, I have \nsupported candidates for the judiciary who convinced me they would \nfollow the law and would not manipulate it to promote a personal or \nactivist agenda. This is a critical test for me and it is relevant \nconcerning Justice Gerrard. I am convinced he would not allow personal \nbeliefs to interfere with his judicial duties, nor would he bring an \nactivist agenda to the Federal bench. He has proven this beyond a doubt \nwith his disciplined approach to the law over the last 16\\1/2\\ years as \na judge on the Nebraska Supreme Court.\n  Questions, however, have been raised to Justice Gerrard on those \npoints, and I would like to address them now. He has been asked whether \na matter may be constitutional one day and not the next based on a \nchanging legal landscape. He has answered for the record that the U.S. \nSupreme Court and the circuit courts set the binding precedent on \nwhether a matter is constitutional, which he would follow as a district \njudge.\n  He has stated a Federal district court judge can conclude the law has \nchanged only by legislation or by a ruling by a higher court. Justice \nGerrard has a clear understanding of the limitations of a Federal \ndistrict court judge. He has demonstrated that understanding in the \ndeference he has given to the legislative branch and to higher court \nprecedent during his years on the Nebraska Supreme Court.\n  He has also been asked specifically whether he has personal beliefs \nthat would make him unable to carry out the death penalty. Again, he \nhas answered, for the record, that he does not. More to the point, \nNebraska carried out the death penalty while I was\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\nGovernor and Justice Gerrard was serving on the Nebraska Supreme Court. \nAs a matter of fact, the court has concurred in establishing an \nexecution date to take place this March 6 in the State of Nebraska.\n  Issuing and executing a death sentence is one of the most solemn \nresponsibilities the judicial and executive branches are entrusted \nwith. In every instance, Justice Gerrard has ruled on the death \npenalty, he has been balanced, even-handed and, most important, \nfaithful to the Constitution. In fact, Judge Gerrard has confirmed for \nthe record that the U.S. Supreme Court and the Nebraska Supreme Court \nhave repeatedly held that the death penalty is an acceptable punishment \nas long as the laws for imposing it are followed and the constitutional \nlimitations imposed by the U.S. Supreme Court are respected.\n  Finally, Judge Gerrard has stated, and the record shows, he has voted \nto confirm a number of sentences and convictions of those sentenced to \ndeath, and he has authored more than one State court opinion upholding \nthe constitutionality of Nebraska's death penalty law. In my view, \nJudge Gerrard's answers and his clear record more than adequately \naddress any concerns about his ability or willingness to both apply the \nlaw with impartiality and to carry out the law effectively .\n  To sum up, John Gerrard deserves to be confirmed by the Senate \nbecause he has an outstanding legal record, he possesses the proper \ntemperament needed on the Federal bench, and he will follow legal \nprecedent to carry out the law rather than interpret as he sees it. He \nhas been and will be an impartial judge, not an activist. So I urge his \nconfirmation by my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to rise in \nsupport of a man who has proven himself worthy to serve as a Federal \njudge on the U.S. district court.\n  Justice John Gerrard has experience, integrity, and respect for the \nConstitution--all of which are necessary for someone serving on our \nFederal bench.\n  He has earned the respect and the admiration of the people of \nNebraska. He consistently receives top ratings from the Nebraska State \nBar Association, and the people of Nebraska have expressed their \nconfidence in him not once, not twice, but three times, voting to \nretain him on the bench.\n  Justice Gerrard has authored hundreds of opinions throughout his 16 \nyears as a member of the Nebraska Supreme Court. These decisions reveal \nwith clarity his philosophy regarding the powers and limitations of a \njudge. They reflect his commitment to adhere to the Constitution and \nthe laws of our great Nation.\n  When asked about judicial restraint after his nomination to the U.S. \ndistrict court, Justice Gerrard responded:\n\n       I firmly believe that a judge should rely on the admissible \n     evidence and applicable law (and nothing else) when rendering \n     a decision.\n\n  He further responded:\n\n       I do not believe a judge should consider his or her own \n     values or policy preferences in determining what the law \n     means--and I have never done so at any time in my judicial \n     career.\n\n  This unequivocal statement says a lot. Justice Gerrard knows that his \nmore than 450 opinions are a matter of public record and that they are \nopen to everyone's scrutiny. He has welcomed that. He has welcomed it \nwith humility.\n  You will not hear him boast about being the youngest person ever \nappointed to my home State's high court, nor will you hear him boast \nabout his successful years as a private attorney and city attorney--and \nthey were successful. He is absolutely unassuming. He is reflective and \nhe is articulate. He speaks with great reverence about the oath he took \nto uphold the Constitution.\n  I did not know Justice Gerrard prior to his appointment to the \nNebraska Supreme Court, but he quickly developed a reputation as a \ndisciplined judge who renders very well researched opinions.\n  I believe Justice John Gerrard is a worthy member to join the U.S. \ndistrict court, and so I stand here today urging my colleagues to vote \nin favor of his confirmation.\n  I would also like to take a moment to talk about the process that \nbrought us here this afternoon. In this regard, I would like to offer \nmy appreciation and thanks to my colleague from Nebraska, the senior \nSenator, Ben Nelson. Senator Nelson called me before this nomination \nwas made and asked for my input. I took that opportunity to sit down \nwith Judge Gerrard and to talk to him. After our meeting and knowing \nwhat I knew about the justice, it was my decision to support his \nnomination to the U.S. district court. In fact, I would say, if I had \ntotal control of this nomination, I would do it all over again.\n  This is a fine man. This is a man who I hope will have strong \nbipartisan support this afternoon when we vote on making him a U.S. \ndistrict judge. He is a good man, and he deserves a strong bipartisan \nvote. He is going to adhere to the laws of our Nation with integrity, \nhumility, and a strict adherence to the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S16-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

GERRARD TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                        THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John M. \nGerrard, of Nebraska, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Nebraska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 90 minutes for debate, with 60 minutes divided in the usual \nform and 30 minutes under the control of the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified after 12 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, by all accounts, Judge Gerrard of the \nNebraska Supreme Court is a good man with a good family and many \nfriends, and he has done a pretty good job over the years--maybe a good \njob over the years--as a capable practicing jurist now on the Supreme \nCourt of Nebraska.\n  I will vote against that nomination, reluctantly. I really do not \nwant to in one sense, but his nomination raises an important issue \nabout the duty of a judge to be faithful to the law and to commit to \nserve under the law and under the Constitution, as the oath of a \nFederal judge requires. In other words, as a judge you are a servant to \nthe law.\n  You honor the law. You venerate the law. You follow the law whether \nor not you like it, whether or not you think it is a good idea, whether \nor not had you been at the Constitutional Convention in the 1700s, you \nwould have voted for that phrase or not voted for that phrase or \nwhether if you had been in the House or the Senate you would have \nworked to change the Constitution or change the law of the State of \nNebraska. Those are matters that are outside the province of a judge. \nIf judges choose to be involved in policy-setting, then they ought to \ninvest themselves in the policy-setting branches, the legislative and \nexecutive branches.\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\n  So judges are, as Justice Roberts said so wonderfully, ``neutral \numpires.'' They do not take sides in the game; they enforce the rules \nof the game. How those rules have been written and established and what \nmotivation caused the Congress to pass them is not the critical issue. \nSo there is a very troubling matter to me which reveals an activist \ntendency in this judge, and it was the case of State v. Moore.\n  The case of State v. Moore in Nebraska is very significant because it \nraises quite clearly these very issues. In the Moore case, Judge \nGerrard took an active role as one of the members of the court. Mr. \nMoore had been on death row since 1980. He had confessed to murdering \ntwo people. He had appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court three times. \nThree times the Nebraska Supreme Court had denied his appeals. He had \nquit appealing. In fact, he filed a motion and said he did not desire \nany more appeals. His pleading said he no longer wished to challenge \nhis sentence, and he was being set for an execution that by law he \ndeserved.\n  Judge Gerrard intervened on his own motion and stayed that execution \neven though no pleading had been filed. He did it on the basis that \nwhile Moore was set for electrocution, he was aware that another case \nthat was coming up to the Supreme Court of Nebraska dealt with the \nconstitutionality of the death by electrocution statute. Apparently the \njudge did not like the death by electrocution statute. But he stopped \nit. Technically, I am not sure that was correct. He was criticized by \nthree members of the court, but he did that.\n  Then the case came before the court, this other case, the Mata case. \nThe judge then confronted the fundamental question of whether the \nutilization of electrocution was a constitutional matter.\n  Now in Nebraska and in most States there are two types of \nconstitutions: the U.S. Constitution and the Nebraska Constitution. As \nis often the case, the exact same words with regard to the death \npenalty are in the U.S. and Nebraska Constitutions: that the \nConstitution prohibits the carrying out of a death penalty by cruel or \nunusual means. ``Cruel and unusual'' actually is the phrase. So it must \nbe cruel and it must be unusual to be unconstitutional, otherwise \nStates can all carry out death penalties as they choose.\n  In fact, at the time the Constitution was adopted, every colony, \nevery State that formed our Union had a death penalty. The U.S. \nGovernment had a death penalty. There are multiple references in the \nU.S. Constitution to the imposition of a death penalty. It says, for \nexample, that you cannot deny a person ``life'' without due process. It \nmakes reference to ``capital crimes,'' which are death penalty crimes. \nThere are several, multiple references to that. Implicit in the \nConstitution itself is a constitutional acceptance of the ability of \nthe Congress or the State legislatures to impose a death penalty.\n  The Constitution was in no way ever thought to be a document that \nwould have prohibited all death penalty cases. But there became a \nmovement in the middle of the last century and later that the death \npenalty was bad and that judges should overthrow it. Actually two \njudges on the Supreme Court opposed every death penalty case because \nthey said it was cruel and unusual.\n  That was not the Constitution. They were allowing their personal \nviews about the wisdom, or lack of it, of the death penalty to \ninfluence their judicial decisionmaking. How can we say the \nConstitution prohibits the death penalty when it makes multiple \nreferences to the death penalty? Every State and the Federal Government \nhave been utilizing the death penalty since the time the Republic was \nfounded.\n  So I am not debating the death penalty. I am not debating the death \npenalty. Good people can disagree. It ought to be brought up on the \nfloor of this Congress, on the floor of the legislatures of Nebraska, \nAlabama, Texas, and New York, and they can decide whether they want to \nhave one and how it will be carried out.\n  The Constitution does say, however, that we cannot use cruel and \nunusual methods of carrying out the death penalty because they \nunderstood that. They did not want people to be drawn and quartered and \nchopped up and things like that--burned in fires. The accepted penalty \nat that time was firing squad and hanging, generally. That is what was \napproved in most States. We still have States--at least one State \ntoday--that allows firing squad. I think we still have some that have \nhanging. But most States have gone more and more to lethal injection, \nand a number, quite a number, still have electrocution.\n  So the question of electrocution was brought up. The guy was \ndefending a person who had been sentenced to die as a result of his \ncrimes. They objected, saying electrocution was cruel and unusual in \n1890. In 1890 the Supreme Court ruled that it was not unconstitutional. \nThen again it was ruled in 1947 that electrocution was not cruel and \nunusual punishment. Since that time, up until recent years, most--I \nwould say perhaps even a majority of States--used electrocution as \nbeing less painful and more consistent with our values than a firing \nsquad or hanging. So it was seen as a reform, a better way to carry out \nthe severe penalty of death.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has since repeatedly denied \nappeals to seek to raise again electrocution as being unconstitutional.\n  This other case came up in Nebraska, State v. Mata. It squarely \nchallenged the constitutionality of electrocution as a method of \nexecution. Although he acknowledged the Nebraska Supreme Court had \nalways held that electrocution was not cruel and unusual, Judge Gerrard \nasserted in the Moore case that ``a changing legal landscape raises \nquestions regarding the continuing vitality of that conclusion.''\n  I am not aware of anything in the landscape that would justify any \nchange in that. I think 1 State in the United States out of 50 has held \nthat electrocution is not appropriate. I don't know how it violates the \ncruel and unusual clause. I am not sure how they possibly so ruled, but \nthey did. So it came up before this court. The Mata case came up before \nthe court and, to sum it up, let me just say they concluded, contrary \nto the previous rulings of the Nebraska Supreme Court, contrary to the \nrulings of the U.S. Supreme Court, that electrocution amounts to a \ncruel and unusual punishment and eliminated and stayed the execution of \ntwo individuals, Mr. Mata and Mr. Moore.\n  I guess what I will say is this: We all in this body have to make a \ndecision about whether judges make errors--which they sometimes do--and \nthen how serious those errors are and what those errors reflect about \nthe ability of the judge to fulfill the oath they take. The oath, \nremember, is to serve under the Constitution, under the laws of the \nUnited States, and to do equal justice to the rich and the poor and to \nfollow the law, in effect, whether you like it or not.\n  I think this was not a little bitty matter. I think the people of the \nUnited States and judges on the Supreme Court of the United States have \ndealt with death penalty cases for some time, and the American people \nhave been called upon on a number of occasions to eliminate death \npenalties in their States. A few have; most have not.\n  Mr. President, 30 minutes has been set aside for me, correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. The Senator has \nused just over 13 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask to be notified after 7 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is not a little bitty matter. These \nmatters have gone to the Supreme Court. Electrocution was passed by \nlegislatures and voters for one reason. They thought it was a way to \ncarry out a grim death penalty sentence in a way less painful than a \nfiring squad and hanging. That is why they did that. It was not any \nmore cruel and unusual but less cruel and unusual. Death is \ninstantaneous, and it is an effective method and is consistent with our \nConstitution, as the Supreme Court held and as the Nebraska Supreme \nCourt previously held.\n  Here we are in this body and we have heard the debates. A lot of good \npeople with very plausible arguments--I don't agree with them, but I \nrespect them--\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\nsay we should not have a death penalty. This is a debate we should have \nand talk about with the American citizens. It is not a matter for \njudges to effectively decide by altering the plain meaning and \nprinciples of the U.S. Constitution because they think it is not right. \nThey are not legislators. This is a big issue around the country and \npeople are tired of it. They say people are not happy with the judges \nand they don't understand the law. Well, they understand the death \npenalty. They have considered it. Their elected representatives have \nvoted on it. It has been approved in most States. They expect their \njudges to carry out the law, unless it plainly violates the \nConstitution of their State or the Nation.\n  I just suggest that I believe this decision was a product of an ill \nwill or a bias against the death penalty, consistent with the effort of \na lot of people working around the legal system every day. I was the \nattorney general of Alabama, chief prosecutor in the State. I was a \nU.S. attorney for 12 years. So I have wrestled with these issues. I \nknow how the deal works. Everybody in the system understands what this \nis.\n  For the Supreme Court of Nebraska to hold that electrocution violates \nthe cruel and unusual clause of the Constitution of Nebraska or the \nConstitution of the United States--they said in this case, Nebraska, \nwhich has exactly the same language as the U.S. Constitution; for them \nto rule that way, I believe, is outside the bounds of what I am willing \nto accept. We have people saying the evolving standards of decency, \nevolving legal principles, and evolving national and international law \nsays we ought to change. No, the American people rule and they elect \ntheir representatives and they pass laws; and judges have one \nobligation, which is to enforce the law, unless it is plainly contrary \nto the Constitution. My opinion, as someone who has been in the \nlegislature and had to defend death penalties as the attorney general \nof the State of Alabama--my opinion is that declaring electrocution to \nbe an unconstitutional method of imposing the death penalty steps out \nof objective, neutral judging and evidences a plain activist tendency \nto promote a result.\n\n  I think it is compounded by the fact that the judge went out of his \nway, contrary to other judges' wishes on the court, to lead an effort \nto stay one execution until they could take up this case and then to \nrule over the Chief Judge's dissent that it was indeed \nunconstitutional.\n  Mr. Moore remains now, since 1980, even today, still on death row. \nPeople are unhappy about that. They rightly think the law is not \nworking and that there is too much politics in it, and people are \nundermining duly enacted law. There was no question of this defendant's \nguilt. He murdered two people and he confessed to it.\n  That is the way I feel about this. I can see a lot of other people \nsaying Judge Gerrard is a good man, a smart lawyer, and he will do a \ngood job on the bench--and I hope he does--but I am not voting for \njudges, as I have said before, who will not establish that they are \nwilling to follow the law even if they don't like it. Particularly, I \nam very reluctant to support judges who, I believe, in this most \ncontroversial area where much debate has occurred, in one form or \nanother, take extraordinary, unlawful steps in my view, to undermine \nthe death penalty because they don't like it.\n  You say: Somebody else said that may have been a mistake, but it is \nnot disqualifying. I respect other people's opinions. I am not calling \non other people to reject Judge Gerrard. As I said, by all accounts, he \nis a good man. I am saying I don't feel comfortable voting for someone \nbased on a legal issue such as this that I personally dealt with over \nthe years. I would not oppose him if he personally opposes the death \npenalty. That is fine. But as a judge he is required to carry it out in \nan effective way. We have had far too much obstruction of the death \npenalty, and I hope we will see an end to it and get judges on the \nbench who will follow the law.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from Alabama will \nyield me 3 minutes to speak on Judge Gerrard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will. I appreciate my colleague's interest in this \nmatter. I believe there is considerable time left on the other side. He \ncan certainly have that on my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield what time I have to the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nyielding the time. One thing I wish to say, to start out with, is that \nthe Senator from Alabama and I would almost always agree about judicial \nappointments. It is a very unusual situation that we would be in any \nkind of disagreement. Many times I come to the floor and seek out the \nSenator from Alabama and ask his thoughts on things or to tell me more \nabout a nominee. I am here this afternoon with great respect for the \nSenator from Alabama and his views of judicial nominees.\n  I have very strong feelings, though, about Justice Gerrard. I have \nhad an opportunity to watch this man on the Nebraska Supreme Court for \nmany years. In my view--and I doubt there would be many who would \ndisagree with this--judges, especially Federal judges, should follow \nthe law and not their own inclinations or personal preferences or their \nown personal feelings on a matter or controversy before them. I think \nwe need to examine this issue very carefully.\n  There has been some suggestion that Justice Gerrard might seek to \ncraft his own preferred outcomes instead of following the law. I wish \nto respond to that. The concerns, of course, relate to a case out of \nNebraska, State of Nebraska v. Moore.\n  In that case, Justice Gerrard ordered a stay of a death warrant \npending the outcome of another case the Nebraska Supreme Court was \nconsidering. At issue in the second case was whether the death penalty \nby electrocution, as provided by Nebraska statute, was consistent with \nthe Nebraska Constitution. Because the defendant in Moore was scheduled \nto die by electrocution, Justice Gerrard stayed the warrant pending the \ncourt's decision in that second case. In the majority opinion in Moore, \nJustice Gerrard noted that the court was using its inherent authority \nto stay the warrant.\n  If I might, let me take a moment to explain what Justice Gerrard was \nsaying there.\n  Some have concluded that what he was saying was he was calling on \nsome nebulous, indistinct legal authority merely to cloak his own \nwishes. But I would suggest respectfully that Justice Gerrard has fully \nand very satisfactorily explained exactly what he meant by the specific \nchoice of those words. He was, in fact, carefully using authorities \ngranted to him by Nebraska law. As the judge explained in a letter, \nNebraska law provides that the Nebraska Supreme Court is directly \nresponsible for issuing the order of execution of prisoners sentenced \nto death. So when Judge Gerrard used his inherent authority to stay the \nexecution at issue in Moore, he was using authority granted by Nebraska \nstatute to order the execution in the first place. In other words, the \nNebraska Supreme Court, by Nebraska law, has the power to issue the \norder and then deal with that order in the future.\n  This is what Judge Gerrard said in his letter in a series of \nquestions that were posed to him relative to his nomination for the \nU.S. district court:\n\n       The ``inherent authority'' referred to in the Moore order \n     was only the court's inherent authority to control the \n     implementation of its own orders, just as any court, at any \n     level, can control its own orders.\n\n  I should note also that Judge Gerrard makes plain that he considers \nthe death penalty to be the law of the land, one that he must uphold.\n  On the question of whether the death penalty is constitutional, \nJustice Gerrard writes:\n\n       I am aware of no authority, nor any persuasive evidence, \n     supporting the conclusion that the death penalty itself is \n     unconstitutional. Our court has concluded in multiple cases \n     that the death penalty itself is constitutional, and I have \n     joined in (and authored many) of those decisions.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have indicated in my remarks in support of this \nnominee, I do believe Judge Gerrard will base his decisions on the \nevidence before him and the applicable law. I have\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\nhad an opportunity to watch him do that for years and years. That is \nwhat he will do. He will base his decisions on the evidence before him \nand the applicable law and nothing else. Furthermore, he has earned the \nrespect and support of Nebraskans, who three times voted to return him \nto the bench. I believe he is well qualified to serve our Nation in the \nFederal courts as a district judge. Justice Gerrard's nomination \ndeserves our support, and I again urge my colleagues to support him \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the Senator from \nNebraska for his comments. I totally agree with him.\n  As last year drew to a close, I spoke about the Senate's lost \nopportunity to take long overdue steps to address the serious vacancies \ncrisis on Federal courts throughout the country. With nearly one out of \nevery 10 Federal judgeships vacant, the Senate should not have \nadjourned with 21 judicial nominations on the calendar and stalled from \nhaving a vote. Regrettably, Senate Republicans chose to end last year \nusing the same obstructionist tactic that they used the year before. \nThey continue to delay final confirmation votes on consensus judicial \nnominees for no good reason. Such delaying tactics are a disservice to \nthe American people and prevent the Senate from doing its \nconstitutional duty and ensuring the ability of our Federal courts to \nprovide justice to Americans around the country.\n  The result of the Senate Republicans' inaction is that the people of \nNew York, California, West Virginia, Florida, Nebraska, Missouri, \nWashington, Utah, the District of Columbia, Nevada, Louisiana, and \nTexas are without the judges they need. The result is that judicial \nemergency vacancies in Florida, Utah, California, Nevada and Texas \nremain unfilled. Last year it took us until June to make up the ground \nwe lost when Senate Republicans refused to complete action on judicial \nnominees at the end of 2010. The Senate starts this year with 19 \njudicial nominees awaiting final Senate action, all but one of them \nreported with significant bipartisan support, 16 of them unanimously. \nThey should have been confirmed last year.\n  By repeating its obstruction and refusing to consent to votes on \nconsensus nominees before the end of the year, Senate Republicans have \nagain ratcheted up the partisanship in connection with filling judicial \nvacancies. While once Republican Senators threatened to blow up the \nSenate to force votes on a handful of President Bush's most extreme \nideological picks, Senate Republicans now stall and block even \nPresident Obama's mainstream, consensus nominees across the board. \nThose they delayed are the kind of qualified, consensus nominees who in \nthe past would have been considered and confirmed by the Senate within \ndays of being reported with the support of their home state Senators \nand the support of both Democrats and Republican on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Last year, final consideration of qualified, consensus judicial \nnominees took months because Senate Republicans refused to consent to \nconfirmation votes. They took this to a new extreme by ending the year \nby refusing to hold votes on any judicial nominees. Meanwhile, the \nmillions of Americans who are served by the Federal courts in those \ndistricts and circuits whose vacancies could be filled with qualified, \nconsensus nominees are left with overburdened courts and unnecessary \ndelays in having their cases determined.\n  I thank the Majority Leader for arranging for final consideration of \nJustice John Gerrard's nomination. Since 1995, Justice Gerrard has \nserved on the Supreme Court of Nebraska, and his nomination received \nthe highest possible rating from the ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary, unanimously ``well qualified.'' He received a near-\nunanimous vote before the Senate Judiciary Committee back in mid-\nOctober last year and has had the support of his home state Senators, a \nDemocrat and a Republican, from the outset. Recently, the senior \nSenator from Nebraska announced that this will be his last year in the \nSenate. I have always enjoyed working with Senator Nelson. He has \nworked hard and represented the people of his state well. He has been \ndiligent with respect to judicial nominations for vacancies in Nebraska \nand tirelessly pressed to fill vacancies there to ensure that cases \nbefore the Federal courts in Nebraska were not needlessly delayed. I am \nsorry that confirmation of this judicial nomination, one he has so \nstrongly supported, has been needlessly delayed more than three months \nwhile the Federal trial court for the District of Nebraska remains \noverburdened.\n  More than half of all Americans live in districts or circuits that \nhave a judicial vacancy that could be filled today if Senate \nRepublicans just agreed to vote on the nominations that have been voted \nout of the Senate Judiciary Committee and have been awaiting a final \nconfirmation vote by the Senate since last year. It is wrong to delay \nvotes on these qualified, consensus judicial nominees. The Senate \nshould be helping to fill these numerous, extended judicial vacancies, \nnot delaying final action for no good reason.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who are \nseeking their day in Federal court to suffer unnecessary delays. When \nan injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait for three years before a judge \nhears the case. When two small business owners disagree over a \ncontract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve \ntheir dispute. With one in 10 Federal judgeships currently vacant, the \nSenate should have come together to address the serious judicial \nvacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country.\n  Professor Carl Tobias makes the point in his column at the end of \nlast year entitled, ``Judicial Openings Erode U.S. Justice System.'' He \ncorrectly observed: ``The Senate recessed without considering any of \nthe 21 nominees, 16 of whom the Committee unanimously reported, on its \ncalendar because Republicans refused to debate and vote on them.'' He \ngoes on to describe some of the slowdown tactics Senate Republicans \nhave employed and concludes: ``Most problematic has been Republican \nrefusal to vote on uncontroversial nominees.'' I ask consent that a \ncopy of Professor Tobias' column be included at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  In his 2010 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, Chief Justice \nRoberts rightly called attention to the problem of overburdened courts \nacross the country. Indeed, the workload in our Federal trial courts \nhas increased 5 percent during President Obama's term in office and 22 \npercent over the last 10 years. Senate Republicans have shown no \ninterest in adding the judgeships that the Judicial Conference, Chief \nJustice Rehnquist and Chief Justice Roberts have requested. To the \ncontrary, they have been stalling needed Federal judges and keeping \njudicial vacancies at historically high levels for unprecedented \nlengths of time. Unfortunately, the unprecedented obstruction of \nconsensus judicial nominations by Senate Republicans continues. They \nhave dramatically departed from the Senate's longstanding tradition of \nregularly considering consensus, noncontroversial nominations. Their \nobstruction marks a new, dark chapter in what Chief Justice Roberts had \ncalled the ``persistent problem of judicial vacancies in critically \noverworked districts.''\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist had chastised Senate Republicans for their \nstalling tactics on judicial nominees during the Clinton \nadministration. In his 2001 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, \nChief Justice Rehnquist reiterated his critical comments from 1997 and \n1998 when Senate Republicans were responsible for stalling scores of \nqualified, needed judicial appointments. By the next year, Senate \nDemocrats had completed confirmations of 100 of President Bush's \nnominees and reduced judicial vacancies throughout the country to 60. \nBy the end of the third year of the Bush administration, the Chief \nJustice reported that he was pleased by the progress being made filling \nvacancies and focused his attention on seeking to raise judicial \nsalaries. With respect to judicial vacancies, he\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nnoted that the Federal trial courts had only 27 vacancies.\n  Regrettably, that progress is not being replicated despite President \nObama's efforts to work with home state Republican Senators and to \nnominate qualified, mainstream candidates. A New York Times editorial \nfrom January 4, 2011, properly noted that Senate Republicans' ``refusal \nto give prompt consideration to noncontroversial nominees'' in 2010 was \na ``terrible precedent.'' Regrettably, Senate Republicans continued \nthat tactic through 2011. They replicated the blockade of consensus \njudicial nominees they had conducted at the end of 2010 by again \nblocking consensus nominees across the board at the end of 2011. At the \nend of 2010, they blocked 17 judicial nominees who should have been \nconfirmed in 2010 but had to be carried over for months before finally \nbeing acted upon by the Senate. In 2011, Senate Republicans ended the \nyear needlessly stalling another 19 judicial nominees, including 18 who \nwere by any measure consensus nominees, who should have been confirmed.\n  Their partisan tactics are at odds with the professed concern about \ncaseloads that Republican Senators contended justified their filibuster \nof Caitlin Halligan and prevented a vote on her nomination to the D.C. \nCircuit. The Washington Times' banner headline last December 7th \ncorrectly proclaimed that with the Senate Republican filibuster of that \nnomination ``GOP Ends Truce on Judicial Hopefuls.'' Of course, if \ncaseloads were really what mattered to Senate Republicans, they would \nnot have blocked the Senate from voting to confirm consensus nominees \nto fill judicial emergency vacancies around the country.\n  If caseloads were really what mattered to Senate Republicans, they \nwould have consented to consider the nomination of Judge Adalberto \nJordan of Florida, which was reported unanimously last October, to fill \na judicial emergency vacancy on the Eleventh Circuit. If they were \nreally concerned with caseloads, they would have consented to move \nforward to confirm Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California, a well-\nqualified nominee to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth \nCircuit, the busiest Federal appeals court in the country. Judge Nguyen \nis nominated to fill the judicial emergency vacancy that remains after \nanother Republican filibuster, that against the nomination of Goodwin \nLiu, now a Supreme Court Justice in California. If they cared about \ncaseloads, they should also have consented to votes on the nominations \nof Michael Fitzgerald to the Central District of California, David \nNuffer to the District of Utah, Miranda Du to the District of Nevada, \nGregg Costa to the Southern District of Texas, and David Guaderrama to \nthe Western District of Texas, all nominations to fill judicial \nemergency vacancies in our Federal trial courts.\n  If Republican Senators were concerned about ensuring that our courts \nhave the judges they need to administer justice for the American \npeople, they would not have refused consent for the Senate to consider \nqualified, consensus judicial nominees. Republicans' consent is what \nwas needed to vote to fill these judicial vacancies and support the \nFederal judiciary, to help them deal with what Chief Justice Roberts \ncalls ``demanding dockets'' and to further public confidence in the \nintegrity and responsiveness of our Federal justice system. Instead, \nSenate Republicans' refusal to confirm 18 qualified, consensus judicial \nnominees before adjourning last year, reminds me of the Republican \npocket filibusters that blocked more than 60 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominations from Senate consideration.\n  When I became Chairman in 2001 and made the Committee blue slip \nprocess public for the first time and worked to confirm 100 judicial \nnominees of a conservative Republican President in 17 months, I hoped \nwe had gotten past these partisan tactics. I am disappointed after \nworking for more than a decade to restore transparency and fairness to \nthe process of considering judicial nominations that Senate Republicans \nare again using partisan holds to block progress at filling judicial \nvacancies.\n  If Republican Senators were concerned about ensuring that our courts \nhave the judges they need to administer justice for the American \npeople, they would do what Democrats did during President Bush's first \nterm. During President Bush's first term we reduced the number of \njudicial vacancies by almost 75 percent. When I became Chairman in the \nsummer of 2001, there were 110 vacancies. By the time Americans went to \nthe polls in November 2004 there were only 28 vacancies. Despite 2004 \nbeing an election year, we were able to reduce vacancies to the lowest \nlevel in the last 20 years.\n  In November of 2008, when I was Chairman with a Republican president, \nwe again reduced judicial vacancies to only 37. I was willing to \naccommodate Senate Republicans and held expedited hearings and votes on \njudicial nominations, even as late as September 2008. By working \ntogether, even in an election year, we were able to reduce the number \nof judicial vacancies.\n  It is wrong to dismiss the delays resulting from the Senate \nRepublicans' obstruction as merely tit for tat. This is a new and \ndamaging tactic Senate Republicans have devised. They are stalling \naction on noncontroversial nominees and have been doing so for the last \nthree years. Meanwhile, millions of Americans across the country who \nare harmed by delays in overburdened courts bear the cost of this \nobstruction.\n  I had hoped and urged that such damaging obstruction not be repeated. \nI had urged that before the Senate adjourned last year at least the 18 \njudicial nominees voted on by the Judiciary Committee who are by any \nmeasure consensus nominees be confirmed. With vacancies continuing at \nharmfully high levels, the American people and our Federal courts \ncannot afford these unnecessary and damaging delays. So while I am \npleased to see John Gerrard's nomination voted on today, there remain \nanother 17 qualified, consensus judicial nominees still being stalled \nfrom last year.\n  For the last two years in a row, Republicans have rejected the \nSenate's traditional, longstanding practice of taking final action on \nconsensus nominations before the end of the Senate session. Senate \nDemocrats consented to consider all of the consensus nominations at the \nend of President Reagan's third year in office and President George \nH.W. Bush's third year in office, when no judicial nominations were \nleft pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. That is also what the \nSenate did at the end of the 1995 session, President Clinton's third \nyear in office, when only a single nomination was left pending on the \nSenate calendar.\n  That is also what we did at the end of President George W. Bush's \nthird year. Although some judicial nominations were left pending, they \nwere among the most controversial, extreme and ideological of President \nBush's nominees. They had previously been debated extensively by the \nSenate. The standard then was that noncontroversial judicial nominees \nreported by the Judiciary Committee were confirmed by the Senate before \nthe end of the year. That is the standard we should have followed in \n2010 and 2011, but Senate Republicans would not. They set a new and \ndestructive standard to hold up qualified, consensus judicial nominees \nfor no good reason.\n  The Senate remains far behind where we should be in considering \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations. Three years into his first \nterm, the Senate has confirmed a lower percentage of President Obama's \njudicial nominees than those of any President in the last 35 years. The \nSenate has confirmed just over 70 percent of President Obama's circuit \nand district nominees, with more than one in four not confirmed. In \nstark contrast, the Senate confirmed nearly 87 percent of President \nGeorge W. Bush's nominees, nearly nine out of every 10 nominees he sent \nto the Senate over two terms. That was a higher percentage of judicial \nnominees confirmed than President Clinton achieved and is far higher \npercentage than for President Obama's nominees, most of whom are \nmainstream, consensus choices.\n  We remain well behind the pace set by the Senate during President \nBush's first term. By the end of his first term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 205 district and circuit nominees. At the beginning of his \nfourth year in office, the Senate had lowered judicial vacancies to 46 \nand already confirmed 168 of his judicial nominees. In contrast, the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nhas confirmed only 124 of President Obama's district and circuit \nnominees, leaving judicial vacancies at more than 80. The vacancy rate \nremains nearly double what it had been reduced to by this point in the \nBush administration.\n  Senate Republicans have returned to the strategy of across-the-board \ndelays and obstruction of the President's judicial nominations, again \nleading to persistently high judicial vacancies. In 2009, the Senate \nwas allowed to confirm only 12 Federal circuit and district court \njudges, the lowest total in 50 years. In 2010, the Senate was allowed \nto confirm 48 Federal circuit and district judges. That has led to the \nlowest confirmation total for the first two years of a new presidency \nin 35 years. As a result, judicial vacancies rose again over 110 and \nstayed at about 90 for the longest period of historically high \nvacancies in 35 years.\n  Last year, we worked hard to overcome filibusters and delays and \nimprove the number of confirmations. They included 17 confirmations \nthat should have taken place in 2010 but were delayed. That resulted in \nonly 47 judicial nomination confirmations from hearings conducted last \nyear. Even including the 17 confirmations in last year's total that \nshould not have been delayed from the previous year, the total lags far \nbehind the total in President Bush's second year in office when the \nSenate Democratic majority confirmed 72 Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges. It was lower than the total in President Bush's third \nyear in office, when Senate Democrats worked with the Senate Republican \nmajority to confirm 68 Federal judges. And it was lower than the 66 \nFederal judges the Senate Democratic majority confirmed in the last \nyear of President George H.W. Bush's presidency during a presidential \nelection year.\n  The Senate starts this year with 18 qualified, consensus judicial \nnominations that should have been confirmed last year. Senate action on \nthose 18 qualified, consensus judicial nominations would have gone a \nlong way to helping resolve the longstanding judicial vacancies that \nare delaying justice for so many Americans in our Federal courts across \nthe country. I urge Senate Republicans to abandon these destructive \npractices and join with us to confirm the qualified, consensus judicial \nnominations they have stalled. This cycle of unnecessary delays must \nend.\n  Mr. President, I ask to proceed in morning business to speak about an \nimportant effort to help the American economic recovery and preserve \nAmerican jobs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         PROTECT IP ACT, S. 968\n\n  Mr. President, rogue websites, primarily based overseas, are stealing \nAmerican property, harming American consumers, hurting the American \neconomic recovery and costing us American jobs. Stealing and \ncounterfeiting are wrong. They are harmful. The Institute for Policy \nInnovation estimates that copyright infringement alone costs more than \n$50 billion a year, and the sale of counterfeits online is estimated to \nbe several times more costly. The AFL-CIO estimates that hundreds of \nthousands of jobs are lost to these forms of theft.\n  And this is not just an economic and jobs problem for Americans. This \nis a consumer safety issue. According to a study released earlier this \nyear, a couple dozen websites selling counterfeit prescription drugs \nhad more than 141,000 visits per day, on average. Counterfeit \nmedication, brake linings and other products threaten Americans' \nsafety. These are serious concerns. These are the concerns I have kept \nin mind over the last several years as I have worked with Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle to help resolve these serious problems.\n  I admire and respect the marvelous advances of technology and, in \nparticular, those represented by the Internet. I have promoted its \ndemocratizing impact around the world. I have fought to keep the \nInternet free and open, as it has become the incredible force that it \nis today. I have promoted its potential for access in rural areas, for \ndistance learning, for increasing points of view and allowing all \nvoices to be heard and as a means for small start ups and firms in \nVermont and elsewhere to market quality products. Nor is this a \nnewfound interest or passing fancy. I started and chaired a Judiciary \nCommittee panel two decades ago on technology and the law and was a \nfounder of the bipartisan, bicameral congressional Internet Caucus. \nYesterday, The Washington Post got it right in its editorial entitled \n``Freedom on the Internet'':\n\n       A free and viable Internet is essential to nurturing and \n     sustaining the kinds of revolutionary innovations that have \n     touched every aspect of modern life. But freedom and \n     lawlessness are not synonymous. The Constitution does not \n     protect the right to steal, and that is true whether it is in \n     a bricks-and-mortar store or online.''\n  Last week, a Wall Street Journal editorial was like-minded, noting:\n\n       The Internet has been a tremendous engine for commercial \n     and democratic exchange, but that makes it all the more \n     important to police the abusers who hijack its architecture.\n       . . . Without rights that protect the creativity and \n     innovation that bring fresh ideas and products to market, \n     there will be far fewer ideas and products to steal.''\n\n  Two years ago, I announced a bipartisan effort to target the worst-\nof-the-worst of the foreign rogue websites that profited from piracy, \nstealing and counterfeiting, while also ensuring that we protect the \nInternet. I have been working since that time to do just that. In 2010, \nthe bill that Senator Hatch and I introduced was reported unanimously \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n  I took seriously the views of all concerned. I reached out to the \nadministration. We incorporated revised definitions suggested by \nSenator Wyden. We held additional hearings to which we invited Google \nand Yahoo!. And we redrafted the legislative measure and reintroduced \nit as The Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and \nTheft of Intellectual Property Act, more commonly known as the PROTECT \nIP Act. Senator Grassley joined as an original cosponsor. I continued \nto work with all who showed interest. The measure was reported \nunanimously from the Judiciary Committee in May 2011, and 40 Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle have cosponsored it. It is rare that \neditorial boards with divergent viewpoints such as The Wall Street \nJournal and The Washington Post agree on a problem and legislative \napproach. As I have already noted, this problem of foreign rogue \nwebsites engaging in piracy, theft and counterfeiting is one such time. \nI ask that copies of the recent editorials from The Washington Post and \nThe Wall Street Journal be included in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Few issues unite the United States Chamber of Commerce and \nthe AFL-CIO; the National Association of Manufacturers and the \nTeamsters; the cable industry and the broadcast industry. By targeting \nthe worst-of-the-worst and protecting the integrity of the Internet, we \nhave been able to create a broad ranging coalition of support of the \nPROTECT IP Act. Along with law enforcement groups, more than 400 \ncompanies, associations, and unions have come together to support this \ntargeted, bipartisan legislation to combat foreign rogue websites.\n  Protecting American intellectual property and the American jobs that \ndepend on it is important. Last year we were able to reform our patent \nlaws to unleash American innovators and help boost our economic \nrecovery. Now we need to confront the threat to our economic recovery \nposed by Internet piracy.\n  As I have demonstrated throughout my service in the Senate and again \nduring the last two years, I have remained flexible in terms of the \nlegislative language in order to best meet our goals of stemming the \ncriminality when protecting legitimate activities and guarding against \ndoing anything to undercut innovation or fetter free discussion. I have \nurged those with concerns to come forward and to work with us. We \nadjusted the very definitions in the bill to narrow them as Senator \nWyden had suggested. I announced two weeks ago that I took seriously \nthe concerns about the domain name system provisions and would fix it \nas part of a manager's amendment when the bill was considered by the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\n  I regret that the Senate will not be proceeding this week to debate \nthe legislation, and any proposed amendments. I thank the Majority \nLeader for seeking to schedule that debate on this serious economic \nthreat. I understand that when the Republican leader recently objected \nand Republican Senators who had cosponsored and long supported this \neffort jumped ship, he was faced with a difficult decision. My hope is \nthat after a brief delay, we will, together, confront this problem. \nEveryone says they want to stop the Internet piracy. Everyone says that \nthey recognize that stealing and counterfeiting are criminal and \nserious matters. This is the opportunity for those who want changes in \nthe bill to come forward, join with us and work with us. This is the \ntime to suggest improvements that will better achieve our goals. The \nPROTECT IP Act is a measure that has been years in the making, and \nwhich has been twice reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to better enforce American intellectual property rights and \nprotect American consumers. It has been awaiting Senate action since \nlast May. Today the rogue foreign websites based in Russia that are \nstealing Americans' property are delighted to continue their operations \nand counterfeiting sweatshops in China are the beneficiaries of Senate \ndelay. People need to understand that the PROTECT IP Act would only \naffect websites that have been judged by a federal court to have no \nsignificant use other than engaging in theft whether through stolen \ncontent or the selling of counterfeits. It is narrowly targeted at the \nworst-of-the-worst. Websites that have some infringing content on their \nsites but have uses other than profiting from infringement are not \ncovered by the legislation. Websites like Wikipedia and YouTube that \nhave obvious and significant uses are among those that would not be \nsubject to the provisions of the bill. That Wikipedia and some other \nwebsites decided to ``go dark'' on January 18 was their choice, self \nimposed and was not caused by the legislation and could not be.\n  It was disappointing that sites linked to descriptions of this \nlegislation that were misleading and one-sided. The Internet should be \na place for discussion, for all to be heard and for different points of \nview to be expressed. That is how truth emerges and democracy is \nserved. Last week, however, many were subjected to false and incendiary \ncharges and sloganeering designed to inflame emotions. I am concerned \nthat while critics of this legislation engage in hyperbole about what \nthe bill plainly does not do, organized crime elements in Russia, in \nChina, and elsewhere who do nothing but peddle in counterfeit products \nand stolen American content are laughing at their good fortune that \ncongressional action is being delayed.\n  Nothing in PROTECT IP can be used to cut off access to a blog. \nNothing in PROTECT IP can be used to shut off access to sites like \nYouTube, Twitter, Facebook or eBay. Nothing in PROTECT IP requires \nanyone to monitor their networks. Nothing in PROTECT IP criminalizes \nlinks to other websites. Nothing in PROTECT IP imposes liability on \nanyone. Nothing in PROTECT IP can be required without a court order, \nfirst, and without providing the full due process of our Federal court \nsystem to the defendants before a final judgment is rendered. I also \nnote that the guarantees of due process provided in the PROTECT IP Act \nare those likewise provided every defendant in every Federal court \nproceeding in the United States, no less. The PROTECT IP Act requires \nnotice to the defendant. If the plaintiff seeks an injunction, the \ncourt must apply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, which is the \nstandard for all courts in determining whether to issue an injunction, \nincluding whether to issue the injunction as a temporary restraining \norder for a limited period of time. When stealing of copyrights are \ninvolved, such court orders can be made if, upon a factual showing, a \ncourt finds that serious harm would otherwise occur and it is in the \npublic interest to do so while the case is more fully considered.\n  The PROTECT IP Act is directed at the foreign websites that are the \nworst-of-the-worst thieves of American intellectual property and \noperate from outside the United States and the jurisdiction of our \ncourts. These website operators prey on American consumers, steal from \nour creators and economy, but are currently beyond the jurisdiction of \nU.S. courts.\n  The Obama administrative officials were right in a recent post saying \n``existing tools are not strong enough to root out the worst online \npirates beyond our borders.'' They called on Congress ``to pass sound \nlegislation this year that provides prosecutors and rights-holders new \nlegal tools to combat online piracy originating beyond U.S. borders \nwhile staying true to the principles outlined. . . . We should never \nlet criminals hide behind a hollow embrace of legitimate American \nvalues.'' That is what we are trying to do with the PROTECT IP Act.\n  What the PROTECT IP Act does is provide tools to prevent websites \noperated overseas that do nothing but traffic in infringing material or \ncounterfeits from continuing to profit from piracy with impunity. The \nInternet needs to be free, but not a lawless marketplace for stolen \ncommerce and not a haven for criminal activities.\n  In the flash of interest surrounding this bill last week, those who \nwere forgotten were the millions of individual artists, the creators \nand the companies in Vermont and elsewhere who work hard every day only \nto find their works available online for free, without their consent. \nThere are factory workers whose wages are cut or jobs are lost when \nlow-quality counterfeit goods are sold in place of the real thing they \nworked so diligently to produce. There are men and women of our \nNational Guard and military who put their lives on the line for all of \nus every day, and for whom a counterfeit part can literally be a matter \nof life and death. There are the seniors who are struggling to be able \nto afford medications and order from what appears to them to be a \nreputable site, only to find that a foreign website has sent them an \nuntested counterfeit drug that will not control their blood pressure or \ndiabetes or heart problem.\n  At the end of the day, this debate boils down to a simple question. \nShould Americans and American companies profit from what they produce \nand be able to provide American jobs, or do we want to continue to let \nthieves operating overseas steal that property and sell it to \nunsuspecting American consumers? I hope that in the coming days the \nSenate will focus on stopping that theft that is undercutting our \neconomic recovery. I remain committed to confronting this problem. And \nI appreciate the efforts of Senator Kyl, Senator Alexander and others \nwho want to continue to work in a thoughtful manner with all interested \nparties to find an effective solution to eliminate online theft by \nforeign rogue websites. I thank those Senators who called me in Vermont \nand back here this past week when I got back to Washington to offer \ntheir help--Senators on both sides of the aisle. It means a lot.\n  I know the senior Senator from Nebraska is waiting to speak about the \njudicial nominee from his State. I will say what I said to him \nprivately because I know this is his last year in the Senate. I have \nalways enjoyed working with him. He has worked hard. He has represented \nthe people of his State well. He has been very honest in his dealings \nwith me. He has been diligent with respect to judicial nominations for \nvacancies in Nebraska. He has tirelessly pressed to fill vacancies \nthere to ensure cases before the Federal court are not needlessly \ndelayed. He did that to protect everybody in Nebraska, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to make sure the courts are open for them.\n  I am sorry the confirmation of Justice Gerrard, one he so strongly \nsupported, has been so needlessly delayed for more than 3 months, but I \nsay to the people of Nebraska they are very fortunate to have been \nrepresented by the senior Senator from Nebraska, my friend Ben Nelson, \nwho has been there fighting for them. He fought for the people of \nNebraska every day from the day he took the oath of office. This may be \nhis last year here, but based on past performance I think it is safe to \nsay he will fight for Nebraska right up until the moment that \nadjournment bell sounds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a January 19 article from the \nWall Street Journal and a January 22 article from the Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 19, 2012]\n\n                       Brake the Internet Pirates\n\n       Wikipedia and many other websites are shutting down today \n     to oppose a proposal in Congress on foreign Internet piracy, \n     and the White House is seconding the protest. The covert \n     lobbying war between Silicon Valley and most other companies \n     in the business of intellectual property is now in the open, \n     and this fight could define--or reinvent--copyright in the \n     digital era.\n       Everyone agrees, or at least claims to agree, that the \n     illegal sale of copyrighted and trademarked products has \n     become a world-wide, multibillion-dollar industry and a \n     legitimate and growing economic problem. This isn't college \n     kids swapping MP3s, as in the 1990s. Rather, rogue websites \n     set up shop overseas and sell U.S. consumers bootleg movies, \n     TV shows, software, video games, books and music, as well as \n     pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fashion, jewelry and more.\n       Often consumers think they're buying copies or streams from \n     legitimate retail enterprises, sometimes not. Either way, the \n     technical term for this is theft.\n       The tech industry says it wants to stop such crimes, but it \n     also calls any tangible effort to do so censorship that would \n     ``break the Internet.'' Wikipedia has never blacked itself \n     out before on any other political issue, nor have websites \n     like Mozilla or the social news aggregator Reddit. How's that \n     for irony: Companies supposedly devoted to the free flow of \n     information are gagging themselves, and the only practical \n     effect will be to enable fraudsters. They've taken no \n     comparable action against, say, Chinese repression.\n       Meanwhile, the White House let it be known over the weekend \n     in a blog post--how fitting--that it won't support \n     legislation that ``reduces freedom of expression'' or damages \n     ``the dynamic, innovative global Internet,'' as if this \n     describes the reality of Internet theft. President Obama has \n     finally found a regulation he doesn't like, which must mean \n     that the campaign contributions of Google and the Stanford \n     alumni club are paying dividends.\n       The House bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, or \n     SOPA, and its Senate counterpart are far more modest than \n     this cyber tantrum suggests. By our reading they would create \n     new tools to target the worst-of-the-worst black markets. The \n     notion that a SOPA dragnet will catch a stray Facebook post \n     or Twitter link is false.\n       Under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1998, U.S. \n     prosecutors and rights-holders can and do obtain warrants to \n     shut down rogue websites and confiscate their domain names \n     under asset-seizure laws. Such powers stop at the water's \n     edge, however. SOPA is meant to target the international \n     pirates that are currently beyond the reach of U.S. law.\n       The bill would allow the Attorney General to sue infringers \n     and requires the Justice Department to prove in court that a \n     foreign site is dedicated to the wholesale violation of \n     copyright under the same standards that apply to domestic \n     sites. In rare circumstances private plaintiffs can also sue \n     for remedies, not for damages, and their legal tools are far \n     more limited than the AG's.\n       If any such case succeeds after due process under federal \n     civil procedure, SOPA requires third parties to make it \n     harder to traffic in stolen online content. Search engines \n     would be required to screen out links, just as they remove \n     domestic piracy or child pornography sites from their \n     indexes. Credit card and other online financial service \n     companies couldn't complete transactions.\n       (Obligatory housekeeping: We at the Journal are in the \n     intellectual property business, and our parent company, News \n     Corp., supports the bills as do most other media content \n     companies.)\n       Moreover, SOPA is already in its 3.0 version to address the \n     major objections. Compromises have narrowed several vague and \n     overly broad provisions. The bill's drafters also removed a \n     feature requiring Internet service providers to filter the \n     domain name system for thieves--which would have meant \n     basically removing them from the Internet's phone book to \n     deny consumer access. But the anti-SOPA activists don't care \n     about these crucial details.\n       The e-vangelists seem to believe that anybody is entitled \n     to access to any content at any time at no cost--open source. \n     Their real ideological objection is to the concept of \n     copyright itself, and they oppose any legal regime that \n     values original creative work. The offline analogue is Occupy \n     Wall Street.\n       Information and content may want to be free, or not, but \n     that's for their owners to decide, not Movie2k.to or \n     LibraryPirate.me or MusicMP3.ru. The Founders recognized the \n     economic benefits of intellectual property, which is why the \n     Constitution tells Congress to ``promote the Progress of \n     Science and useful Arts by securing for limited Times to \n     Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective \n     Writings and Discoveries'' (Article I, Section 8).\n       The Internet has been a tremendous engine for commercial \n     and democratic exchange, but that makes it all the more \n     important to police the abusers who hijack its architecture. \n     SOPA merely adapts the current avenues of legal recourse for \n     infringement and counterfeiting to new realities. Without \n     rights that protect the creativity and innovation that bring \n     fresh ideas and products to market, there will be far fewer \n     ideas and products to steal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 2012]\n\n         Megaupload Shows Online Copyright Protection Is Needed\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       By most measures, the Web site Megaupload was a 21st-\n     century success story, with 50 million daily visitors and \n     $175 million in profits. According to the Obama \n     administration, it was also an ``international organized \n     crime enterprise.''\n       In an indictment last week, the Justice Department accused \n     the company and several of its principals of conspiracy, \n     racketeering and vast violations of copyright law. The loss \n     to copyright owners of movies, television programs, \n     entertainment software and other content: some $500 million. \n     The government calls this the largest criminal copyright case \n     in the nation's history.\n       Megaupload maintained servers in the United States and \n     relied on U.S.-registered domain names, allowing U.S. \n     prosecutors to tap domestic laws to shutter the business. But \n     what if the Web site had been run using only foreign-based \n     servers and foreign-registered domain names? U.S. law \n     enforcers would have had a difficult if not impossible time \n     stopping the alleged wrongdoing.\n       That reality, of course, is what gave rise to the Protect \n     IP Act (PIPA) and its House counterpart, the Stop Online \n     Piracy Act (SOPA), which proposed to give the Justice \n     Department and copyright owners the legal reach and muscle to \n     thwart overseas theft of American intellectual property. SOPA \n     was fatally flawed, with vague provisions that could have \n     made legitimate Web sites vulnerable to sanctions. PIPA was \n     more measured, allowing action against a site only if a \n     federal judge concluded it was ``dedicated to'' profiting \n     from the unauthorized peddling of others' work.\n       Still, Internet giants such as Google railed against the \n     bills, arguing they sanctioned government censorship and \n     threatened the viability and security of the Internet. The \n     protests culminated last week in a remarkable, largely \n     unprecedented protest during which sites such as Wikipedia \n     temporarily went dark. Millions of individuals--many of them \n     armed with distorted descriptions of the bills--phoned, e-\n     mailed and used social networks to demand that they be \n     quashed.\n       Whether it was democracy in action or spinelessness by \n     cowed lawmakers, the campaign worked. House and Senate \n     leaders said they would pull back the bills for further \n     consideration. While a temporary breather may be helpful, \n     lawmakers should not abandon the quest to curb the \n     multibillion-dollar problem that is overseas online piracy.\n       Some opponents will fight any regulation of the Internet. \n     This should not be acceptable. A free and viable Internet is \n     essential to nurturing and sustaining the kinds of \n     revolutionary innovations that have touched every aspect of \n     modern life. But freedom and lawlessness are not synonymous. \n     The Constitution does not protect the right to steal, and \n     that is true whether it is in a bricks-and-mortar store or \n     online.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague, the esteemed chair, for \nsuch kind remarks. I wish they were universally believed by all. This \nis the kind of introduction my father would have enjoyed but my mother \nwould have believed. I appreciate so very much his kind comments.\n  The Nebraska Supreme Court temporarily stayed the execution of one \nprisoner, a Carey Dean Moore, because a full evidentiary record was \nbefore it in another immediately pending case, State v. Mata, which was \nreferred to by my friend and colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions. \nThat case challenged the constitutionality of electrocution as a method \nof execution. It did not challenge, it did not deal with, and was not \nassociated with whether or not to have a death penalty. It was not \nchallenging the death penalty but the methodology of a death penalty.\n  The court had to determine whether a prisoner should be executed \ndepending on whether that question was soon answered. The temporary \nstay was issued and the other case decided as a matter of State \nconstitutional law. The court, by a vote of 6 to 1, determined that \nexecution as a method--and I emphasize ``a method'' of electrocution--\nviolated prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment, which is \nthe purview of the court to make that determination where there is a \nquestion of dealing with the Constitution.\n  The court was clear that the death penalty remained valid in \nNebraska. No writ of certiorari had been taken. The Nebraska \nLegislature changed the method of execution to lethal injection, and \nthe execution of Moore, Mata, and others will be carried out \naccordingly.\n  As a matter of fact, the court has set a date of execution for a \nprisoner to be executed on March 6. This same court set dates of \nexecution while I was Governor on three occasions, and they were \ncarried out. Judge Gerrard was a\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\nmember of the court at that time and had no objections to the \nexecutions. It is the methodology that the court dealt with.\n  It is important to recognize that in the Moore case the issue was not \nwhether the death penalty itself was constitutional; it was whether a \nparticular means of execution was constitutional. Those are completely \ndifferent questions.\n  Senator Sessions claims that Judge Gerrard stayed the defendant's \nexecution in the light of ``a changing legal landscape.'' However, it \nis not uncommon for a court, when presented with different cases \ninvolving related issues, to withhold ruling on any one case until all \nof the related issues are resolved. Therefore, the Moore order reflects \na pragmatic decision to wait until both cases could be resolved.\n  I agree with Senator Sessions that this is about the duty of a judge \nto be faithful to the law and to serve under the law. However, I \nstrongly disagree with Senator Sessions' characterization of Judge \nGerrard as an activist judge. Judge Gerrard has written 450 opinions in \nhis 15-plus years on the Nebraska Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court \nconcluded in a previous case that the U.S. Supreme Court and the \nNebraska Supreme Court have held in a related matter that the death \npenalty is not cruel and unusual. Judge Gerrard would have no \ndifficulty following that binding precedent. As a matter of fact, he \nhas. He has no personal beliefs that would prevent him from enforcing \nthe death penalty. In fact, he has authored several opinions and voted \nto affirm the convictions and sentences of defendants who have actually \nbeen sentenced to death.\n  Judge Gerrard believes the death penalty is an acceptable form of \npunishment. He understands the significant difference between a judge \non a court of last resort interpreting State court constitutional law \nand a Federal district judge who follows U.S. Supreme Court precedent.\n  I reiterate for the record, Judge Gerrard is held in the highest \nregard by both the bench and the bar in Nebraska. He has earned an \n``AV'' Martindale-Hubbell rating from his colleagues, and the American \nBar Association has deemed him ``unanimously well-qualified'' to serve \non the U.S. district court.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Johanns from Nebraska, for his support \nand his comments which I think were also very supportive, clearly \nsupportive, of Judge Gerrard and the decisions. Clearly, he is not an \nactivist judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          recess appointments\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, just over a month ago, on December 17, \nthe Senate entered into a unanimous consent agreement to consider the \nnomination of John M. Gerrard, of Nebraska, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Nebraska. We are proceeding with \nthis nomination, which I will support, despite the President's actions \non recess appointments. During the last session we acted responsibly in \nconsidering the President's nominees. Even the Majority Leader \nacknowledged this. He stated, ``We have done a good job on nominations \nthe last couple of months. Actually, in the last 3 months, we have \naccomplished quite a bit.''\n  I will have more to say about the recess appointments. But with \nregard to this nomination I hope my colleagues understand that even \nthough we are proceeding under regular order today, it is only because \nthis unanimous consent agreement was locked in before the President \ndemonstrated his monarchy mentality by making those appointments. I am \nnot going to hold this nominee accountable for the outrageous actions \nof the President.\n  However, as this is a matter of concern to my Republican colleagues, \nas it should be for all Senators, we must consider how we will respond \nto the President and restore a Constitutional balance. Since the \nadoption of the unanimous consent agreement governing the nomination \nbefore us, President Obama has upset the nominations process. Article \nII, Section 2 of the Constitution provides for only two ways in which \nPresidents may appoint certain officers.\n  First, it provides that the President nominates, and by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate, appoints various officers. Second, it \npermits the President to make temporary appointments when a vacancy in \none of those offices happens when the Senate is in recess. On January \n4, the President made four appointments. They were purportedly based on \nthe Recess Appointments Clause. He took this action even though the \nSenate was not in recess. This action is of the utmost seriousness to \nall Americans.\n  These appointments were blatantly unconstitutional. They were not \nmade with the advice and consent of the Senate. And they were not made \n``during the recess of the Senate.''\n  Between the end of December and today, the Senate has been holding \nsessions every 3 days. It did so precisely to prevent the President \nfrom making recess appointments. It followed the same procedure as it \nhad during the term of President Bush. Honoring the Constitution and \nthe desire of the Senate President Bush declined to make recess \nappointments during these periods. But President Obama chose to make \nrecess appointments despite the existence of these Senate sessions.\n  In addition to being unconstitutional, these so-called recess \nappointments break a longstanding tradition. They represent an \nattempted presidential power grab against this body.\n  A President has not attempted to make a recess appointment when \nCongress has not been in recess for more than 3 days in many decades. \nIn fact, for decades, the Senate has been in recess at least 10 days \nbefore the President has invoked this power.\n  Other parts of the Constitution beyond Article II, Section 2 show \nthat these purported appointments are invalid. Article I, Section 5 \nprovides, ``Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. . . \n.''\n  In December and January, we provided that we would be in session \nevery 3 days. The Senate was open and provided the opportunity to \nconduct business. That business included passing legislation and \nconfirming nominations. In fact, the Senate did pass legislation, which \nthe President signed. According to the Constitution--each House--not \nthe President determines whether that House is in session. The Senate \nsaid we were in session. The President recognized that fact by signing \nlegislation passed during the session.\n  Article I, Section 5 also states, ``Neither House, shall, during the \nsession of Congress, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more \nthan 3 days. . . .'' The other body did not consent to our recess for \nmore than 3 days. No concurrent resolution authorizing an adjournment \nwas passed by both chambers. Under the Constitution, we could not \nrecess for more than 3 days. We did not do so. The President's \nerroneous belief that he can determine whether the Senate was in \nsession would place us in the position of acting unconstitutionally. If \nhe is right, we recessed for more than 3 days without the consent of \nthe other body. By claiming we were in recess, the President \neffectively dares us to say that we failed to comply with our oath to \nadhere to the Constitution. Yet, it is the President who made \nappointments without the advice and consent of the Senate while the \nSenate was in session. It is the President who has violated the \nConstitution.\n  Of course, the President does not admit that he violated the \nConstitution. He has obtained a legal opinion from the Office of Legal \nCounsel at his own Department of Justice.\n  That opinion reached the incredible conclusion that the President \ncould make these appointments, notwithstanding our December and January \nsessions. That opinion is entirely unconvincing. For instance, to reach \nits conclusion that the Senate was not available as a practical matter \nto give advice and consent, it relies on such unpersuasive material as \nstatements from individual Senators.\n  The text of the Constitution is clear. It allows no room for the \nDepartment to interpret it in any so-called ``practical'' way that \ndeparts from its terms.\n  The Justice Department also misapplied a Judiciary Committee report \nfrom 1905 on the subject of recess appointments. That report said that \na Senate ``recess'' occurs when ``the Senate is not sitting in regular \nor extraordinary session as a branch of the Congress, or in \nextraordinary session for the discharge of executive functions;\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nwhen its Members owe no duty of attendance; when its Chamber is empty; \nwhen, because of its absence, it can not receive communications from \nthe President or participate as a body in making appointments.''\n  Obviously, that report does not support the Department of Justice. \nDuring these days, the Senate was sitting in session. It could \ndischarge executive functions. The Chamber was not empty. It could \nreceive communications. It could participate as a body in making \nappointments. In fact, it sat in regular session and passed \nlegislation.\n  There is nothing in the 1905 report that justifies the President \nsubstituting his judgment for the Senate's regarding whether the Senate \nis in session. In any event, a Senate Judiciary Committee report from \n1905 does not govern the United States Senate; in 2012. The Senate; as \nconstituted today; decides its rules and proceedings.\n  The Department is on shaky legal ground when it claims that ``whether \nthe House has consented to the Senate's adjournment of more than 3 days \ndoes not determine the Senate's practical availability during a period \nof pro forma sessions and thus does not determine the existence of a \n`Recess' under the Recess Appointments Clause.''\n  There is no basis--none--for treating the same pro forma sessions \ndifferently for the purposes of the 2 clauses. The Department simply \ncannot have it both ways.\n  The Justice Department's opinion contains other equally preposterous \narguments. For instance, the opinion claims that the Administration's \nprior statements to the Supreme Court--through former Solicitor General \nElena Kagan--that recess appointments can be made only if the Senate is \nin recess for more than 3 days are somehow distinguishable from its \ncurrent opinion, or that the pocket veto cases do not apply.\n  Or even if they did, the ``fundamental rights'' of individuals that \nthe courts described in those cases include the right of the President \nto make recess appointments.\n  There was a time when Presidents believed that they could take action \nonly when the law gave them the power to do so. They obtained advice \nfrom the Justice Department on the question whether there was legal \nauthority to justify the action they wished to take. But Theodore \nRoosevelt started to change the way Presidents viewed power. He \nbelieved that the President could do anything so long as the \nConstitution did not explicitly preclude him from acting. When he used \nthat theory to create wildlife refuges against a rapidly expanding \nindustrial base, there was no objection. But a dangerous precedent was \nset. When he claimed that he could make recess appointments during a \n``constructive recess'' of the Senate, the Senate rejected this view in \nthat 1905 report.\n  When a President thinks he can do anything the Constitution does not \nexpressly prohibit, the danger arises that his advisers will feel \npressure to say that the Constitution does not stand in the way. At \nthat point, a President is no longer a constitutional figure with \nlimited powers as the founders intended. Quite the contrary, the \nPresident looks more and more like a king that the Constitution was \ndesigned to replace.\n  This OLC opinion reflects the changes that have occurred in the \nrelationship between the Justice Department and the President on the \nquestion of presidential power. Formerly, the Justice Department gave \nlegal advice to the President based on an objective reading of texts \nand judicial opinions. It was not an offshoot of the White House \nCounsel's office.\n  This more objective view of the limits of Presidential power also \nprovided a level of protection for individual liberty, the principle at \nthe core of our constitutional separation of powers. The President \nmight refuse to accept the advice. He might choose to fire the officer \nwho gave him advice with which he disagreed. He could seek to appoint a \nnew officer who would provide the advice he preferred. But he risked \npaying a political price for doing so. An official who thought that \nloyalty to the Constitution exceeded his loyalty to the President could \nrefuse to comply, at great personal risk. That is what Elliot \nRichardson did during the Saturday Night Massacre of the Watergate era.\n  During the Reagan Administration, OLC issued opinions that concluded \nthat the President lacked the power to undertake certain acts to \nimplement some of his preferred policies. The President did not \nundertake those unilateral actions.\n  President Obama originally submitted a nominee for OLC that was \nwholly objectionable. The Senate had good reason to believe that she \nwould not interpret the law without regard to ideology. We refused to \nconfirm her.\n  The President ultimately withdrew her nomination and nominated \ninstead Virginia Seitz. We asked important questions at her \nconfirmation hearing and thorough questions for the record.\n  Ms. Seitz responded that OLC should adhere to its prior decisions in \naccordance with the doctrine of stare decisis. And she stated that if \nthe administration contemplated taking action that she believed was \nunconstitutional, she would not stand idly by. Relying on those \nassurances, the Senate confirmed Ms. Seitz.\n  Ms. Seitz is the author of this wholly erroneous opinion that takes \nan unprecedented view of the Recess Appointments Clause. And I suppose \nit is literally true that Ms. Seitz did not stand idly by when the \nadministration took unconstitutional action: rather, she actively \nbecame a lackey for the administration. She wrote a poorly reasoned \nopinion that placed loyalty to the President over loyalty to the rule \nof law.\n  That opinion, and her total deviation from the statements she made \nduring her confirmation process, show extreme disrespect for the \ninstitution of the Senate and the constitutional separation of powers. \nI gave the President and Ms. Seitz the benefit of the doubt in voting \nto confirm her nomination. However, after reading this misguided and \ndangerous legal opinion, I am sorry the Senate confirmed her. It's \nlikely to be the last confirmation she ever experiences.\n  The Constitution outlines various powers that are divided among the \ndifferent branches of our Federal government. Some of these powers are \nvested in only one branch, such as granting pardons or conducting \nimpeachment proceedings. Other powers are shared, such as passing and \nsigning or vetoing bills. The appointment power is a shared power \nbetween the President and the Congress. When one party turns a shared \npower into a unilateral power, the fabric of the Constitution is itself \nviolated, and a response is called for.\n  In Federalist 51, Madison wrote that the separation of powers is more \nthan a philosophical construct. He wrote that the ``separate and \ndistinct exercise of the different powers of government'' is \n``essential to the preservation of liberty.''\n  The Framers of the Constitution wrote a document that originally \ncontained no Bill of Rights. They believed that liberty would best be \nprotected by preventing government from harming liberty in the first \nplace. That was the reason for the separation of powers. They designed \na working separation of powers through checks and balances to ensure a \nlimited government that protected individual rights. Madison wrote, \n``Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man \nmust be connected with the constitutional rights of the place.''\n  That is what the Framers intended in a case such as this. When the \nPresident unconstitutionally usurped the power of the Senate, the \nSenate's ambition would check the President's. In this way, the \nConstitution is preserved. The power of the government is limited. And \nthe liberties of the people are protected. But the Framers did not \nanticipate the modern Presidency. It took Justice Jackson's famous \nconcurrence in the Youngstown case to address presidential powers in \ntoday's world. When the Judiciary Committee held its confirmation \nhearings on President Bush's Supreme Court nominations, my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle posed many questions about the Jackson \nconcurrence. That opinion sheds light on these so-called recess \nappointments.\n\n  For instance, President Obama argued in a nationally televised rally \nthat his actions were justified because ``[e]very day that Richard \n[Cordray] waited to be confirmed . . . was another day when millions of \nAmericans were left unprotected. . . . And I refuse to take `no' for an \nanswer.''\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\n  Justice Jackson anticipated these hyperbolic statements. He wrote: \n``The tendency is strong to emphasize the transient results upon \npolicies. . . . and lose sight of enduring consequences upon the \nbalanced power structure of our Republic.'' President Obama has \ndefinitely let transient policy goals overtake the Constitution. His \nargument is that the end justifies the means.\n  His argument is that he can say no to the Constitution. Or, in \nessence, that the Constitution does not apply to him. But the \nConstitution demands that the means justify the ends, and that \nadherence to established procedure is the best protection for liberty. \nA monarch or a king could say no to the Constitution. But under our \nConstitution, the President may not. It is the Constitution, and not \nthe President, that refuses to take no for an answer.\n  Justice Jackson was also aware that the modern President's actions \n``overshadow any others [and] that, almost alone, he fills the public \neye and ear.'' By virtue of his influence on public opinion, he wrote, \nthe President ``exerts a leverage upon those who are supposed to check \nand balance his power which often cancels their effectiveness.''\n  Some people believe that President Obama challenged the Senate for \npartisan purposes. But Justice Jackson understood the true partisan \ndynamic that is now playing out. He recognized that the President's \npowers are political as well as legal. Many presidential powers derive \nfrom his position as head of a political party. Jackson wrote: ``Party \nloyalties and interests sometimes more binding than law, extend his \neffective control into branches of government other than his own, and \nhe often may win, as a political leader, what he cannot command under \nthe Constitution.'' Finally, he concluded, ``[O]nly Congress itself can \nprevent power from slipping through its fingers.''\n\n  Outside these walls, in the reception room, are portraits of great \nSenators of the past. The original portraits were selected by a \ncommittee that was headed by then Senator John F. Kennedy. They \nincluded such figures as Webster, Clay, Calhoun, LaFollette, and Taft. \nYes, these Senators were partisans. But they were selected because of \nthe role they played in maintaining the unique institution that is the \nSenate in our constitutional system. In particular, they protected the \nSenate and the country from the excessive claims of presidential power \nthat were made by the chief executives of their time. Where are such \nMembers today?\n  Where is a member of the President's party today who is like a more \nrecent Senate institutionalist--Robert C. Byrd? He defended the powers \nof the Senate when Presidents overreached--even Presidents of his own \nparty. Where are the Members who recognized that our sessions every 3 \ndays rightly prevented President Bush from making recess appointments \nbut who stand idly by as President Obama makes recess appointments \nwithout a recess?\n  I remind my colleagues of my experiences as chairman or ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee. I refused to process nominees to \npositions that passed through that committee to whom President Bush \ngave recess appointments. That is how I used the authority that I had \nto protect the rights of the Senate.\n  I do not believe we should let the powers vested in the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people slip through our fingers because \nwe place partisan interests above the Constitution. I have shown how \nthe Framers understood that supposedly expedient departures from the \nConstitution risked individual liberty. The constitutional text in this \nsituation is clear. It must be upheld. We must take appropriate action \nto see that it is done.\n  Nor should we wait for the courts.\n  Although the NLRB appointments are already the subject of litigation, \nwe should take action ourselves rather than rely on others. The stakes \nare too high. On the other hand, even the OLC opinion recognizes, as it \nmust, the litigation risk to the President.\n  For more than 200 years, Presidents have made very expansive claims \nof power under the Recess Appointments Clause. The President and the \nSenate have worked out differences to form a working government.\n  Now, the Obama administration seeks to upend these precedents and \nthat working relationship. It may well find, as did the Bush \nadministration, that when overbroad claims of presidential power find \ntheir way to court, that not only does the President lose, but that \nexpansive arguments of presidential power that had long been a part of \nthe public discourse can no longer be made.\n  Although I believe that this ironic result will ultimately occur here \nas well, the Senate must defend its constitutional role on its own, as \nintended by the framers of the Constitution that we all swore an oath \nto uphold.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, important questions have been raised about \nJudge Gerrard's willingness to follow established precedent in a \nreasoned way in death-penalty cases. Too often, the Senate has \nconfirmed nominees who are hostile to the death penalty, and who then \nabuse their authority and twist the law to block the execution of \nlegally sound capital sentences that have been entered by State courts. \nIn his December 15, 2011, written response to questions posed to him by \nSenator Sessions, however, Judge Gerrard assured the Senate that he \n``would have no difficulty'' in following ``binding precedent'' in \ncapital cases, and that he has ``no personal beliefs that would prevent \n[him] from enforcing the death penalty.'' I take Judge Gerrard at his \nword and thus will vote in favor of confirming his nomination to be a \nUnited States district judge.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, John M. Gerrard is nominated to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Nebraska. Judge \nGerrard received his B.S. degree from Nebraska Wesleyan University in \n1975 and his J.D. from Pacific McGeorge School of Law in 1981.\n  He began his legal career in private practice as an associate for the \nNebraska law firm of Jewell, Otte, Gatz, Collins & Domina. A year \nlater, Judge Gerrard joined in a new law firm where he conducted \nprimarily a general litigation practice. In 1990, Judge Gerrard and two \npartners formed a new law office. For the next 5 years, before being \nappointed to the bench, he engaged in an active trial practice and \nadministrative law/school law practice.\n  In 1995, then-Governor Nelson appointed Judge Gerrard to the Nebraska \nSupreme Court.

A lot of things have been \nexchanged about what we did back home during the break, but the focal \npoint of most conversations on the floor this evening has been, \nrightfully, about my colleague, Senator Mark Kirk. Most everybody knows \nnow he suffered a stroke over the weekend, and he underwent surgery in \nChicago at Northeastern Hospital last night.\n  All that I know about this comes from a press conference his surgeon \ngave in Chicago today. We want to make it clear to Mark that he is in \nour thoughts and prayers, as is his family. We all feel, to a person, \nthat he will make a strong recovery. He is young and in good condition. \nHe prides himself on his service in the Naval Reserve and stays fit to \nserve our country in that capacity, as well as in the Senate.

The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Durbin speaks for every Member of \nthe Senate. Senator Kirk is such a decent, caring, and thoughtful man, \nand all of us enjoy working with him in the Senate on various kinds of \nbills. Godspeed, Senator Kirk, for a healthy recovery.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes with Senator \nMoran tonight to reflect on the events of the last few days with \nrespect to the Internet legislation. I want to begin by thanking \nMajority Leader Harry Reid for reopening the debate on \nanticounterfeiting and copyright protection legislation. In pulling the \nProtect IP Act from the floor, Leader Reid has given the Senate an \nopportunity to get this policy right. The Senate now has the \nopportunity to consult all of the stakeholders, including the millions \nof Internet users who were heard last week. The Senate has the \nopportunity to ensure that those exercising their first amendment \nrights through the Internet, those offering innovative products and \nservices, and those looking for new mediums for sharing and expression, \nhave their voices heard.\n  I also express my appreciation to Senator Moran. He is an impassioned \nadvocate for job creation and innovation on the Net--the first on the \nother side of the aisle to join me in this cause. My colleague, Senator \nCantwell from Washington State, who is as knowledgeable as anybody in \npublic service about technology, and Senator Rand Paul, who is a \nchampion of the Internet as a place where those who look at the Net as \na marketplace of ideas, stand together and approach policy in an \ninnovative way.\n  Last week, tens of millions of Americans empowered by the Internet \neffected political change here in Washington. The Congress was on a \ntrajectory to pass legislation that would change the Internet as we \nknow it. It would reshape the Internet in a way, in my view, that would \nhave been harmful to our economy, our democracy, and our national \nsecurity interests.\n  When Americans learned about all this, they said no. The Internet \nenables people from all walks of life to learn about the legislation \nand then take collective action to urge their representatives in \nWashington to stop it.\n  So everybody asked, come Wednesday, what would happen? In fact, the \nAmerican people stopped this legislation. Their voices counted more \nthan all the political lobbying, more than all of the advertising, more \nthan all of the phone calls that were made by the heads and the \nexecutives of the movie\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\nstudios. Their voices were heard loud and clear.\n  Last week, the Congress did what the American people called for \ninstead of what the Washington insiders wanted. That is what I call \nreal change. It was a grassroots victory for the history books, and, as \none commentator said, now we are in unexplored territory. Here is why. \nEight million of 162 million who visited Wikipedia took action to \ninfluence their Member of Congress; 7 million Americans signed Google's \npetition to block consideration of PIPA; hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans called the Congress. In all, in just 1 day, more than 15 \nmillion Americans communicated with Congress and urged it to reject the \nHollywood proposal to censor and censure the Internet.\n  The 15 million Americans who took action, who signed petitions, who \nprovided their e-mail addresses and ZIP Codes in a desire to be \ninformed are now going to be watching us like never before. The 15 \nmillion who looked up and spoke up are not faceless and they are not \nanonymous. They are people such as Frances Stewart of Maryland, Nancy \nLinton from Oregon, Debbie Kearns from East Hartford, CT, and John \nJewett of Colorado, who gave their names to Web sites around the \ncountry. They are joined by millions of other Americans who were \nraising concerns for months before last week's Web blackout and \nsupporting the filibuster I announced here in the Senate almost 1\\1/2\\ \nyears ago.\n  These 15 million citizen activists were not the only ones saying the \nPROTECT IP Act took the wrong approach. The New York Times and the Los \nAngeles Times--the hometown newspapers for the content industry--both \nwrote editorials saying the legislation overreached. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record copies of those articles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, June 7, 2011]\n\n                         Policing the Internet\n\n       A Senate bill aims to cut off support for any site found by \n     the courts to be `dedicated' to copyright or trademark \n     infringement. Its goals are laudable, but its details are \n     problematic.\n       Hollywood studios, record labels and other U.S. copyright \n     and trademark owners are pushing Congress to give them more \n     protection against parasitical foreign websites that are \n     profiting from counterfeit or bootlegged goods. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee has responded with a bill (S 968) that \n     would force online advertising networks, credit card \n     companies and search engines to cut off support for any site \n     found by the courts to be ``dedicated'' to copyright or \n     trademark infringement. Its goals are laudable, but its \n     details are problematic.\n       The global nature of the Internet has spawned a profusion \n     of websites in countries that can't or won't enforce \n     intellectual property law. Under S 968, if a website were \n     deemed by a court to be dedicated to infringing activities, \n     federal agents could then tell the U.S. companies that direct \n     traffic, process payments, serve advertisements and locate \n     information online to end their support for the site in \n     question. Copyright and trademark owners would be able to \n     follow up those court orders by seeking injunctions against \n     payment processors and advertising networks that do not \n     comply.\n       Cutting off the financial lifeblood of companies dedicated \n     to piracy and counterfeiting makes sense. A similar approach \n     to illegal online gambling has shown that it is technically \n     feasible for payment processors to stop directing dollars \n     from U.S. bettors to gambling sites anywhere in the world. \n     The operators of the largest online advertising networks say \n     they can do the same, although they object to the bill's \n     proposal to let copyright and trademark owners seek \n     injunctions against them.\n       The main problem with the bill is in its effort to render \n     sites invisible as well as unprofitable. Once a court \n     determines that a site is dedicated to infringing, the \n     measure would require the companies that operate domain-name \n     servers to steer Internet users away from it. This \n     misdirection, however, wouldn't stop people from going to the \n     site, because it would still be accessible via its underlying \n     numerical address or through overseas domain-name servers.\n       A group of leading Internet engineers has warned that the \n     bill's attempt to hide piracy-oriented sites could hurt some \n     legitimate sites because of the way domain names can be \n     shared or have unpredictable mutual dependencies. And by \n     encouraging Web consumers to use foreign or underground \n     servers, the measure could undermine efforts to create a more \n     reliable and fraud-resistant domain-name system. These risks \n     argue for Congress to take a more measured approach to the \n     problem of overseas rogue sites.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 26, 2011]\n\n                        Going After the Pirates\n\n       Online piracy is the bane of the Internet. Still, bills \n     proposed in the House and the Senate have overreached. The \n     legislation needs to be tightened to protect intellectual \n     property without hindering online speech and innovation.\n       Forty billion music files were shared illegally in 2008, \n     according to the International Federation of the Phonographic \n     Industry, amounting to 95 percent of all music downloads \n     worldwide. Three-quarters of the video games released in late \n     2010 and early 2011 were shared illegally.\n       Musicians, moviemakers, authors and software designers are \n     not the only victims. Piracy's cost is measured in less \n     innovation and less economic activity, as creators lose hope \n     of making a living from their creations. Still, the \n     definition of wrongdoing in the ``Stop Online Piracy Act'' \n     introduced in the House is too broad.\n       Under the bill, copyright owners could direct payment \n     providers like Visa and advertising networks like Google's to \n     cut off business to a Web site simply by filing notice that \n     the site--or ``a portion'' of it--``engages in, enables or \n     facilitates'' intellectual property infringement or is being \n     willfully blind to it.\n       Accused Web sites would have only five days to assert their \n     innocence. And the payment providers and ad networks could \n     not be sued by sites that were wrongly cut off, so their \n     easiest course of action might be to just comply with \n     copyright owners' requests. If copyright owners could starve \n     a Web site of money simply by telling a payment processor \n     that the site was infringing on intellectual property, the \n     bill could stymie legitimate speech.\n       The purpose of the legislation is to stop business flowing \n     to foreign rogue Web sites like the Pirate Bay in Sweden. But \n     these provisions could affect domestic Web sites that are \n     already covered by the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. \n     That act has safe harbors protecting sites, like YouTube, \n     that may unknowingly host pirated content, as long as they \n     take it down when notified.\n       Another provision would allow the attorney general to sue \n     foreign sites that ``facilitate'' piracy, and to demand that \n     domestic search engines stop linking to them and that \n     Internet service providers redirect traffic. Experts have \n     said this measure could be easily overcome by users and warn \n     that it could undermine an industrywide effort to reduce \n     hacking. Legislators should also think hard about the message \n     it would send to autocratic regimes like China's, which \n     outinely block political Web sites.\n       The House bill is right to focus on payment systems and ad \n     networks to cut off the money to rogue Web sites. But like \n     its Senate companion, the ``Protect IP'' bill, it has serious \n     problems that must be fixed.\n       The bill should be made to stipulate clearly that all of \n     its provisions are aimed only at rogue Web sites overseas. \n     Foreign sites must be granted the same safe harbor immunity--\n     and the bill must not open the door to punishments for \n     domestic sites that abide by the 1998 digital copyright law. \n     And rather than encouraging credit card companies and \n     advertising networks to pre-emptively cut off business to Web \n     sites accused of wrongdoing, a court order should be required \n     before they take action.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 8, 2011]\n\n                   Internet Piracy and How To Stop It\n\n       Online piracy is a huge business. A recent study found that \n     Web sites offering pirated digital content or counterfeit \n     goods, like illicit movie downloads or bootleg software, \n     record 53 billion hits per year. That robs the industries \n     that create and sell intellectual products of hundreds of \n     billions of dollars.\n       The problem is particularly hard to crack because the \n     villains are often in faraway countries. Bad apples can be \n     difficult to pin down in the sea of Web sites, and pirates \n     can evade countervailing measures as easily as tweaking the \n     name of a Web site.\n       Commendably, the Senate Judiciary Committee is trying to \n     bolster the government's power to enforce intellectual \n     property protections. Last month, the committee approved the \n     Protect IP Act, which creates new tools to disrupt illegal \n     online commerce.\n       The bill is not perfect. Its definition of wrongdoing is \n     broad and could be abused by companies seeking to use the law \n     to quickly hinder Web sites. Some proposed remedies could \n     also unintentionally reduce the safety of the Internet. \n     Senator Ron Wyden put a hold on the bill over these issues, \n     which, he argued, could infringe on the right to free speech. \n     The legislation is, therefore, in limbo, but it should be \n     fixed, not discarded.\n       The bill defines infringing Web sites as those that have \n     ``no significant use other than engaging in, enabling, or \n     facilitating'' the illegal copying or distribution of \n     copyrighted material in ``substantially complete form''--\n     entire movies or songs, not just snippets.\n       If the offender can't be found to answer the accusation (a \n     likely occurrence given that most Web sites targeted will be \n     overseas), the government or a private party can seek an \n     injunction from a judge to compel advertising networks and \n     payment systems like MasterCard or PayPal to stop doing \n     business with the site.\n       The government--but not private parties--can use the \n     injunction to compel Internet service providers to redirect \n     traffic by not translating a Web address into the numerical\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\n     language that computers understand. And they could force \n     search engines to stop linking to them.\n       The broadness of the definition is particularly worrisome \n     because private companies are given a right to take action \n     under the bill. In one notorious case, a record label \n     demanded that YouTube take down a home video of a toddler \n     jiggling in the kitchen to a tune by Prince, claiming it \n     violated copyright law. Allowing firms to go after a Web site \n     that ``facilitates'' intellectual property theft might \n     encourage that kind of overreaching--and allow the government \n     to black out a site.\n       Some of the remedies are problematic. A group of Internet \n     safety experts cautioned that the procedure to redirect \n     Internet traffic from offending Web sites would mimic what \n     hackers do when they take over a domain. If it occurred on a \n     large enough scale it could impair efforts to enhance the \n     safety of the domain name system.\n       This kind of blocking is unlikely to be very effective. \n     Users could reach offending Web sites simply by writing the \n     numerical I.P. address in the navigator box, rather than the \n     URL. The Web sites could distribute free plug-ins to \n     translate addresses into numbers automatically.\n       The bill before the Senate is an important step toward \n     making piracy less profitable. But it shouldn't pass as is. \n     If protecting intellectual property is important, so is \n     protecting the Internet from overzealous enforcement.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 18, 2012]\n\n                 Online Piracy and Political Overreach\n\n       For months, it seemed as if Congress would pass an online \n     antipiracy bill, even though its main weapons--cutting off \n     the financing of pirate Web sites and making them harder to \n     find--risk censoring legitimate speech and undermining the \n     security of the Internet. But the unmovable corporations \n     behind those bills have run into an unstoppable force: an \n     outcry by Internet companies led by Google and Wikipedia that \n     culminated in an extraordinary online protest on Wednesday.\n       Lawmakers have begun peeling away from the bills, notably \n     Senators Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who cosponsored \n     the Senate version, and John Cornyn, the powerful Texas \n     conservative. They dropped out after Wikipedia's English \n     language site went dark and Google put a black bar on its \n     homepage on Wednesday.\n       The Protect I.P. Act would have easily passed the Senate \n     last summer if not for a hold placed by Senator Ron Wyden, a \n     Democrat of Oregon. The Stop Online Piracy Act, introduced in \n     the House in October, has also lost some of its initial \n     backers. And on Saturday, the White House released a \n     statement warning that it would ``not support legislation \n     that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity \n     risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global \n     Internet.''\n       Though we are encouraged by legislators' newfound caution \n     about the potential consequences of the bills, Congress must \n     keep working on ways to curtail the growing business of \n     foreign rogue Web sites trafficking in counterfeit goods and \n     stolen intellectual property.\n       The Internet industry was pitted against some of the best-\n     honed lobbying groups, including Hollywood and the recording \n     studios, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the \n     A.F.L.-C.I.O. The industry has made a good case that some of \n     the definitions of wrongdoing--like ``facilitating'' \n     intellectual property infringement--were overly broad. They \n     said allowing property rights owners to direct payment \n     companies like Visa and ad networks like Google's to stop \n     doing business with sites they deemed infringing--with no \n     penalties if they were proved wrong--could stymie legitimate \n     online expression.\n       They made the case that the proposal to make infringing Web \n     sites ``disappear'' from the Internet by forbidding search \n     engines from finding them or redirecting their Web addresses \n     to other Internet domains was easy to get around and could \n     potentially undermine efforts to stop hackers from doing \n     exactly the same thing.\n       The Internet companies now have the responsibility to come \n     up with a workable alternative that gives owners of \n     intellectual property rights better tools to stop piracy by \n     Web sites located in faraway countries. These sites get some \n     53 billion visits a year, more than Google or Wikipedia. Yet \n     they are outside the grasp of American law.\n       The focus on cutting the financing of online pirates, which \n     features in the House and Senate bills, is the right way to \n     go. Sponsors of both bills have moved to delete, at least \n     temporarily, provisions to make rogue Web sites disappear. \n     The legislation could be further amended to narrow the \n     definition of criminality and clarify that it is only aimed \n     at foreign sites. And it could tighten guarantees of due \n     process. Private parties must first get a court order to \n     block business with a Web site they deem infringing on their \n     copyrights.\n       We are happy that the drive to pass antipiracy legislation \n     has slowed enough that Congress might actually consider all \n     its implications carefully. Lawmakers can now act wisely to \n     create tools that can help combat the scourge of online \n     piracy without excessive collateral damage.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, while the 15 million are no doubt pleased, \nas I am, that Majority Leader Reid pulled PIPA, they are waiting to see \nif we will now retrench into the old ways of doing things--the old way \nwhere Senators went behind closed doors and wrote legislation with the \nhelp of well-healed lobbyists, the old way that has eroded the trust \nAmerica has with the Congress and the confidence that we are here on \ntheir behalf--or will the Congress instead construct legislation in a \ntransparent way that responds to our broad collective interests? The \nAmerican people want just that, and they deserve it. Among the lessons \nwe should have learned from the events of the past few weeks is the \nimportance of letting the public in on what we are doing.\n  There are serious unintended consequences when Members of Congress \nand staff think they have all the answers and rush to construct and \npass legislation. There are clear virtues in prudence, deliberation, \nand even a little humility. I believe that is what our constitutional \nFramers had in mind for the Senate.\n  I know my colleagues are waiting, and I want to close with this. I \nharbor no doubt that this Congress on a bipartisan basis can and should \nconstruct legislation to combat international commerce in counterfeit \nmerchandise and content that infringes on copyrights. There is no \nquestion that selling fake Nikes or movies you don't own is a problem \nthat needs to be addressed, but it can be done in ways that do not \nthreaten speech, that allow for the legitimate sharing of information \nand protect the architecture and value of the Internet. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues and a broad cross-section of stakeholders \nto do that.\n  I have proposed an alternative with Senator Moran and Senator \nCantwell here in the Senate. Chairman Issa and Congresswoman Lofgren \nhave proposed exactly that kind of alternative in the House. It is \ncalled the OPEN Act. It is bipartisan. It is bicameral. It would allow \nus to go after the problem of these rogue foreign Web sites while at \nthe same time protecting what we value so greatly about the Internet.\n  We are going to have more discussions about this legislation and \nother approaches in the future, but we now have an opportunity to get \nthis right. To a great extent, that is possible because of my colleague \nfrom Kansas who has joined me in this effort, the first on the other \nside of the aisle to step up and join our efforts. I am very \nappreciative of what he has done, and I look forward to his comments.\n  I also thank the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, for his courtesies \nso that Senator Moran and I, because of our bipartisan work, could make \nthese brief remarks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the remarks of the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  It was a significant moment in my brief time as a Member of the \nSenate when, 3 months ago, Senator Wyden and I had a conversation here \non the Senate floor about this legislation, about PIPA and about SOPA \nand about the open Internet, and it was a moment in which Senator Wyden \nfound me looking for ways in which I could be engaged in the process of \ntrying to create an environment in which entrepreneurship flourished in \nthe United States.\n  I had been discouraged or disillusioned a bit by the lack of \nCongress's and the President's ability to find ways to reduce spending \nand to balance the budget, and while I don't intend ever to walk away \nfrom those important issues, it became clear to me that another way we \ncan reach a more balanced budget is to have a growing economy. I \nstarted looking at research that would suggest how we get there. When \nSenator Wyden presented this thought to me about engaging on this \nissue, it was one that made so much sense to me, and I am very grateful \nfor the partnership we have developed.\n  Senator Wyden and I, as he said, intended to speak this evening about \nour concerns about the PROTECT IP Act prior to the bill being \nconsidered this week on the Senate floor. But because of the actions of \nmillions of Americans in voicing their concerns about this legislation, \nit is no longer necessary for us to throw procedural obstacles in the \nway of the PROTECT IP Act, and I\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\nappreciate the majority leader withdrawing his plan to hold a vote \ntomorrow on this legislation.\n  Last week's events in which we all received so much input is a very \ngood reminder of what a powerful tool the Internet can be. It was \nencouraging to see so many Americans get involved, particularly young \nAmericans who often choose not to be involved in the process. But they \nsaw something important to them, and they knew exactly how to \ncommunicate with elected officials. What became clear last week was \nthat Congress, in this issue and its far-reaching implications, was not \nfully yet understood, and so to take a pause, to take a step back and \nto reconsider the direction we were going seems so appropriate to me.\n  Congress has the responsibility to remain engaged and up to speed on \nall issues, particularly those that so directly impact our economy. It \nis no easy task given that technology is constantly evolving, but it is \nan important task. Technology holds incredible promise, from \nstrengthening education, to delivering health care more efficiently, to \nallowing entrepreneurs to develop products that have yet to be \ninvented. By remaining more engaged, Congress will also be better able \nto enact public policies that encourage Americans to innovate, create \nnew products, and strengthen the economy.\n  Last week's decision to delay consideration of PIPA was an important \nmoment for many innovators and entrepreneurs across America, and it was \nan outcome that my colleagues and I--Senator Wyden and others--sought \nto see occur. It is important also not just to entrepreneurs, though, \nbut to people who are concerned about freedom and about the opportunity \nto use the Internet to communicate, the opportunity for free speech. \nAnd certainly we had concerns about national security. My concerns \nabout the PROTECT IP Act can be summed up like this: Certain provisions \nin this legislation will threaten free speech, innovation, and our \nnational security.\n  I am adamantly opposed to legislation that tampers with the Internet \nsecurity, specifically the Domain Name System. Internet engineers have \nworked for 15 years to develop a way to authenticate the sites we visit \nto make sure they are secure and to enhance commerce on the Internet. \nAt a time when our Nation faces increasing numbers of cyber attacks \nfrom abroad, PIPA and SOPA would create significant security risks and \nset America back more than a decade.\n  Second, both PIPA and SOPA would create new liabilities because of \nvague definitions in the bills that would drag companies into \nunnecessary and prolonged litigation. We don't need more legal battles. \nCongress should not put in place a system that would force law-abiding \ninnovators to utilize their limited resources in the courtroom to \ndefend themselves rather than invest in their companies, develop new \nproducts, and hire new workers.\n\n  America is a country of innovation that was founded on freedom and \nopportunity, and that has been true since the birth of our Nation when \nentrepreneurs have strengthened our country and its economy by creating \nnew products and sharing them around the world. Americans today still \nwant the opportunity to develop new products and to innovate in the \nmarketplace. Because of the power of technology, ideas that were once \nonly imaginable have now become a reality.\n  About 1 year ago, Google announced that it was accepting applications \nfrom cities across the United States to deploy a 1-gigabit Internet \nconnection, which is roughly 100 times faster than what most users \ncould experience today. Last March, much to my delight and the delight \nof many Kansans, Google chose Kansas City as the Nation's first Google \nGigabyte City. In fact, Kansas City was selected from more than 1,100 \ncities that had applied and competed.\n  Many people in the Kansas City area were soon asking: What is \nactually possible with a gigabit Internet connection? What happens when \nyou connect an entire community with a gigabit Internet connection?\n  An organization called Think Big Partners wanted to know the answer \nto those questions, so they put together a competition called Gigabit \nChallenge. The Gigabit Challenge was a project based on an idea and a \nprediction. They predicted that when Americans are given access to \ncutting-edge technology--in this case, one of the fastest bandwidths in \nthe world--new innovations, new applications, and new products would be \ncreated. So they challenged entrepreneurs and innovators to come up \nwith products that will leverage this new network capacity and offered \nsignificant cash prizes for the three best ideas.\n  The response was overwhelming. Mr. President, 113 ideas were \nsubmitted from 5 continents, 7 countries, and 22 States. The list was \neventually narrowed down to 17 companies that presented last week to a \ndistinguished panel of judges. I had the opportunity to join Think Big \nPartners in Kansas City last week for part of that event, and I was \nimpressed, so impressed, by what I saw. I congratulate the prize \nwinners tonight who competed, and I congratulate all who competed and \nbrought new ideas to the table.\n  The Gigabit Challenge underscores the fact that Americans want to \ninnovate, and Congress should encourage innovation rather than create \nnew hurdles for American creators and innovators. One of the most \nimportant things Congress can do to encourage innovation is to make it \neasier for entrepreneurs to start a business.\n  Last month, Senator Warner and I introduced bipartisan legislation \ncalled the Startup Act to jump-start the economy through creation and \ngrowth of new businesses. Data from the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas \nCity shows that between 1980 and 2005, nearly all of the net jobs that \nwere created in the United States were created by companies less than 5 \nyears old. In fact, new businesses create about 3 million jobs each \nyear.\n  The Startup Act recognizes the job-creating potential of \nentrepreneurs and is based upon five progrowth principles:\n  First, the Startup Act will reduce the regulatory burden on new \nbusinesses and startups.\n  New businesses, which are almost always small, face a tough challenge \ncomplying with the various rules and regulations that govern business \nbehavior. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, \ncompanies with fewer than 20 employees spend 36 percent more per \nemployee than larger firms to comply with Federal regulations.\n  The president and CEO of the National Association for the Self-\nEmployed, who endorsed the Startup Act, said this:\n\n       The majority of small businesses are enterprises of 1-2 \n     people. . . . Cutting down on some of the unnecessary red \n     tape that new businesses must face means that the owner can \n     spend more time growing their business, hiring employees, and \n     helping to turn our Nation's economy back around. The Startup \n     Act would help address these regulatory burdens faced by new \n     companies.\n\n  Reducing regulatory burdens means entrepreneurs will have more time \nand money to invest in their business and to hire more workers.\n  Secondly, the Startup Act creates tax incentives to help facilitate \nthe financing of new businesses so they can get off the ground and grow \nmore quickly.\n  One of the greatest challenges for startups is accessing the \nnecessary capital to grow their business. The Startup Act provides \ncapital gains and income tax incentives to facilitate financing the new \nbusiness at its critical juncture of firm growth. Helping entrepreneurs \nattract investment and retain greater share of the company's profits \nwill lead to job growth.\n  Third, the Startup Act recognizes that innovation drives the American \neconomy.\n  Some of the best minds in the world work and study at American \nuniversities. The innovation that occurs on campuses across the Nation \ncontribute to the strength and vitality of our economy. To speed up the \nmovement of new technologies to the marketplace where they can propel \neconomic growth, the Startup Act uses a portion of existing Federal \nresearch and development funding to support innovative projects at \nAmerican universities in order to accelerate and improve the \ncommercialization of cutting-edge technologies developed through \nfaculty research. When more good ideas make their way out of the \nlaboratory and into the marketplace, more businesses and more jobs are \ncreated.\n  Fourth, the Startup Act encourages pro-growth State and local \npolicies through the publication of reports on\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\nnew business formation and the entrepreneurial environment in States.\n  I am proud that Kansas City leaders recognize the importance of \npolicies that support entrepreneurs. Last year, area leaders declared \nthat Kansas City should be called ``America's Most Entrepreneurial \nCity,'' given their efforts to encourage entrepreneurship.\n  Better policies at the State and local level will create more \nopportunities for entrepreneurs to open businesses and put Americans to \nwork.\n  Finally, the Startup Act will help win the global battle for talent \nby keeping entrepreneurial-minded and highly skilled workers in the \nUnited States.\n  For too long, our Nation's immigration policies have turned away \nAmerican-educated talent and sent highly-skilled individuals back to \ntheir home country where they competed against America. Rather than \nlose that talent, we need to keep those highly-skilled individuals and \npotential job creators in the United States.\n  The Startup Act recognizes the job-creating potential of \nentrepreneurial and highly-skilled immigrants, and provides additional \nopportunities for those who are here legally on a temporary basis to \nstay if they have the high-tech skills our economy needs or are willing \nand able to create jobs for Americans.\n  Highly-skilled workers will fuel growth at technology startups and \nentrepreneurial immigrants will employ Americans.\n  Business and industry leaders across the country are speaking out \nabout the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship. Gary Shapiro, \nthe President and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, said \nthis:\n\n       As a country we must do more to support and foster \n     innovation and entrepreneurialism, and the introduction of \n     the Startup Act is an important step forward.\n\n  Dr. Robert Atkinson, the President and Founder of the Information \nTechnology & Innovation Foundation echoed those remarks. He said:\n\n       The United States is at risk of losing its economic \n     leadership and vitality and it is essential for policymakers \n     to unite in practical ways to reverse this trend. The Startup \n     Act is a commendable example of what is needed to restore \n     U.S. innovation-based competitiveness.\n\n  The millions of Americans who spoke out last week against a bill that \nwould stifle innovation on the Internet understand the importance of \nthis too.\n  Fostering innovation and promoting entrepreneurship are not \nRepublican or Democrat ideas they are American values.\n  What occurred last week is a reminder to all of us in this Senate \nabout the leadership that is necessary. Again, I congratulate Senator \nWyden for providing that leadership. With good leaders in Washington, \nDC, and with the American people who understand in many instances \nbetter than we often do the value of entrepreneurship, of free speech \nand an open Internet, great things can once again happen in the United \nStates of America. Our economy can flourish and grow.\n  It is so important that what occurred this week, with the legislation \nnot proceeding, sets the stage for greater opportunities for Americans \nacross our country to have a dream, to pursue it, to succeed, to spend \ntheir time pursuing that dream, and in achieving their dreams they have \nthe opportunity to create success for others.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me. Let us work together. Our \ncountry cannot wait until after another election to get the economy \ngrowing again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to observe that tomorrow night the \nPresident of the United States will make his annual State of the Union \nAddress to Congress. This signals, of course, the beginning of the \nannual budget and appropriations process. But what has not happened for \ntoo long is the Senate passing a budget for the Federal Government. In \nfact, tomorrow, the same day the President will speak to the Nation, it \nwill be the 1,000th day since the budget was passed by the Senate. That \nday was April 29, 2009. As the facts would reveal, it is our Democratic \nfriends, led by the majority leader, Senator Reid, who have resisted \nbringing a budget to the floor for amendment and debate and a vote.\n  I believe with all my heart that is one of the reasons why the \nAmerican people hold the Congress in such low regard. It is because we \nhave failed in our most basic responsibilities, now for more than 1,000 \ndays. None of us can imagine a family or small business operating \nwithout a budget. It is unthinkable. I suspect there are not many, if \nany, small businesses that do not sit down and do the hard work of \nworking out a budget. A budget, after all, is a matter of priorities. \nAs the distinguished occupant of the chair knows as a former Governor, \nthere is no way a State, a city, a county, a small business, or a \nfamily can get by without a budget because it is the discipline that \ncomes with a budget where you decide what is absolutely essential, you \ndecide what you want to have that you maybe could put off for another \nday, and it forces you to reach the conclusion in some instances that \nthings you would like to do are simply unaffordable. Unfortunately, the \nmajority leader has simply resisted those hard decisions. That is \nregrettable.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I was especially disappointed \nthat the Budget Committee, the very purpose of which is to debate and \npass a budget, did not debate one this last year. The majority leader, \nwhen asked about this in the press, said that it would be foolish for \nthe majority to produce a budget. I suspect he wanted to protect his \nDemocratic Members from some tough votes and tough decisions. But that \nis what we were sent here for, to make hard but important decisions on \nbehalf of our constituents and the American people, even if they are \ntough votes and even if they are unpopular decisions. That is our \nresponsibility. But under the leadership of Senator Reid the Senate has \ncompletely abdicated that responsibility for now 1,000 days.\n  Nothing could be more foolish or foolhardy than refusing to provide \nthe Nation's job creators, investors, and, yes, the taxpayers, with a \nblueprint for our fiscal future. How is it that the majority can \ncontinue to shrink from the most basic responsibilities of governing? I \nam amazed sometimes. People say they want to serve in public office. \nThey like the prestige, perhaps, the visibility, the power that goes \nalong with it. Yet when it comes to actually discharging their \nresponsibilities and making tough decisions, they may say, no, I don't \nwant to make anybody mad.\n  But that is what we were sent here for. It is our responsibility. It \nis plain fact that the American people cannot afford to have this body \ncontinue paying just lip service to fiscal sanity while seeing our \nfiscal ship so off keel.\n  It should come as no surprise that during this period of time we have \nnot had a budget for the Federal Government, the Nation has spent $9.4 \ntrillion. And $4.1 trillion has been added to the national debt, if you \naccount for the fact that the President recently asked for another $1.2 \ntrillion in additional borrowing authority. The national debt has grown \nto more than $15 trillion and is now larger than the whole U.S. \neconomy, our gross domestic product. Government spending has reached a \npost-World War II record and now makes up 25 percent of the economy. \nThat is just government spending alone. The average has been somewhere \naround 20 percent of our gross domestic product. Now it is up to about \n25 percent.\n  Unfortunately, because the economy is so depressed, revenues are \naround 15 percent, hence a 10-percent annual\n\n[[Page S32]]\n\nbudget deficit which, as it accumulates, adds to our national debt.\n  As we all know, our Nation has lost its triple-A credit rating from \nStandard & Poor's, casting further doubt about the solvency of the U.S. \nGovernment and our commitment to pay our debts. All three major rating \nagencies have assigned a negative outlook, something short of a \ndowngrade, but they have issued a warning to those who lend money to \nthe U.S. Government that they have a negative outlook on the Nation's \nlong-term rating. This is a signal too that future downgrades are more \nlikely in the near future. You know what happens when the rating \nagencies downgrade our debt; it is more expensive for the Federal \nGovernment to borrow money.\n  Indeed, I have read that over a 10-year period of time, a 1-percent \nincrease in the cost of paying China or somebody to buy our debt, in \nterms of a return on that investment, a 1-percent increase over 10 \nyears is roughly $1.3 trillion. So even if we were to cut $1.3 \ntrillion, suffering a 1.3-percent increase in the cost of persuading \nsomebody to buy our debt would negate and wipe out any savings by a \ncut.\n  I fear the failure to pass a budget is simply a recipe for more debt \nand more out-of-control spending. While the majority has abdicated its \nresponsibility to pass a budget, as required by law, and even refused \nto bring it to the floor, the House has acted responsibly and has \npassed its own budget. But instead of offering their own blueprint in \nthe Senate, the majority leader and the majority party have simply \ndemagogued the House budget.\n\n  We have seen that from the President of the United States. \nUltimately, Senator Reid brought the House budget up for a vote on the \nfloor, knowing it would fail because it actually reduced spending, it \ncontinued much-needed tax relief, and it put the Government on a diet, \nsomething the Federal Government sorely needs.\n  The Senate also had an opportunity to finally vote on the budget \nsubmitted by the President last year. This was something that was \nprompted by action of Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, because \nour friends across the aisle did not, apparently, even want to vote on \nthe President's proposed budget. But while there was support for the \nHouse budget, not one Senator on either side of the aisle supported the \nPresident's budget. It went down 97 to 0, which was quite a remarkable \nvote. Even my colleagues on the other side of the aisle realized that \nthe budget submitted by the President was an irresponsible budget, one \nthat would increase taxes, increase spending, and increase debt.\n  We know that higher debt leads to slower economic growth. Economic \nstudies have shown that high levels of government debt inhibit economic \ngrowth by creating economic uncertainty about the economy, about tax \nincreases, and it actually crowds out or displaces investment in the \nprivate sector. Slower economic growth means fewer jobs. According to \nChristina Romer, former chair of the White House Council of Economic \nAdvisers, a 1-percent change in gross domestic product growth is \nequivalent to 1 million jobs a year.\n  I would recall, back during the time the administration proposed its \nstimulus to try to get the economy moving again--$787 billion plus \ninterest, roughly $1 trillion--they projected growth of the economy \nduring 2011-2012 to be roughly 4.3 percent of gross domestic product, a \n4.3-percent growth. Unfortunately, in the third quarter of 2010, which \nis the last quarter for which some numbers are available, the economy \ngrew at a rate of 1.8 percent--not 4.3 percent but 1.8 percent.\n  So the warning sound has clearly been heard. The fiscal tsunami that \nmany budget experts predicted could suddenly arise is fast approaching. \nIt is a challenge that faces the country today, not tomorrow, and we \nneed solutions today. But it takes leadership and it takes courage. All \nwe have to do is look across the Atlantic Ocean and watch what many of \nour European friends are going through today to see what happens when \ngovernment spending and debt are allowed to grow unchecked. When \ngovernments and nations live beyond their means and continue to rack up \ndebt, passing it on to their children and grandchildren, at some point \nthe creditors of that nation, the holders of that sovereign debt, lose \nconfidence in the ability of those nations to actually pay it back and \nwe see the kind of sovereign debt crisis like we are seeing in Europe \ntoday.\n  All of these challenges require Presidential leadership, but I am \nconfident we will not hear the President talking about these issues \ntomorrow. The President has had multiple opportunities to embrace \nbipartisan fiscal overhaul plans such as the one produced by his own \nbipartisan debt commission, the Simpson-Bowles commission. \nUnfortunately, the President has chosen to ignore the work of his own \ndebt commission.\n  Over the past 2 years we have also noted an explosion in the number \nof Federal regulations which have further created uncertainty in the \neconomy and caused the entrepreneurs and job creators to sit on the \nsidelines not knowing what the cost is going to be of their doing \nbusiness, whether their business model will actually work or whether in \naddition to taxes, regulation, and the cost of health care they can \nactually break even, much less make a profit. Well, it is no \ncoincidence because of the higher debt, runaway regulations, and the \nthreat of higher taxes that we have experienced the weakest economic \nrecovery since World War II, leaving millions of Americans without \njobs.\n  My constituents--all 25 million of them in Texas--and everyone in \nAmerica deserve better, and they are telling us in unequivocal terms \nthat they think the country is on the wrong track. How could they \npossibly believe otherwise? When my constituents know Washington \nborrows 40 cents out of every dollar it spends and knows the national \ndebt is a job-killing economic liability for the country, how would \nthey say the country is on the right track when clearly it is not. \nEvery man, woman, and child in my State and across the country is \nroughly $49,000 in debt, and that has increased by almost 40 percent \nsince President Obama took office in 2009.\n  The unemployment rate in Texas, while, thankfully, is lower than the \nnational rate, consistently remains above what it was since the last \ntime the Senate passed a budget. The unemployment rate in Texas is 20 \npercent higher than it was when the administration told Texans that its \nstimulus plan would make sure the national rate would not go above 8 \npercent.\n  Well, if we go back and look at the projections--they said it would \nnot go above 8 percent, and by the first quarter in 2012 it would be 6 \npercent--clearly, they were off the mark, and the stimulus failed to \nmeet the administration's own stated goals.\n  My constituents also believe, with some justification, the national \ndebt is a national security risk. ADM Mike Mullen, former Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the debt is the single biggest threat \nto our national security. It struck me as unusual to hear the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying it is our financial condition that \nis our national security threat. But when we think about it, if America \ncannot pay its debt back, if we experience a sovereign debt crisis, if \nthe interest demanded by our creditors goes through the roof--as we \nhave seen for Italian bonds and other bonds over in Europe--it means we \nwill not have the money to pay not only for the safety net programs \nthat are important for the most vulnerable of Americans and keep our \ncommitments for Social Security and Medicare, it means we will not be \nable to protect the national security of the United States, which is \nthe No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the debt ``undermines our \ncapacity to act in our own interest . . . and it also sends a message \nof weakness internationally.''\n  My constituents know that successful debt reduction measures must \nrely on spending cuts, not tax increases, and that economic growth is \none of the main goals. Right now, if we don't act before the end of the \nyear, due to expiring tax provisions we will see the single highest tax \nbill in American history, almost $5 trillion more by some estimates.\n  For example, the State and local sales tax deduction--my State \ndoesn't have an income tax, and income taxes are deductible under \nFederal tax law,\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\nbut State sales taxes are not right now but for the provision that will \nexpire by the end of the year. This is an important issue to my \nconstituents and a matter of fundamental fairness.\n  In 2009, 2.1 million taxpayers in Texas claimed almost $4 billion in \ndeductions. According to tax comptroller Susan Combs, extending the \nsales tax deduction will benefit millions of Texans who are working \nhard to keep our Nation's economy vibrant.\n  I am proud my State has been a beacon from the economic standpoint of \nopportunity where people have voted with their feet, and they have \nmoved from places where they don't have jobs and don't have \nopportunities to Texas where they do. It is no coincidence that as a \nresult of the most recent reapportionment, Texas got four new \ncongressional seats. This is primarily due to people moving to where \nthe opportunity is. It makes perfect sense.\n  Why would we want to do anything that would threaten the economy of \nTexas or any other State of the Union? We know the President will give \nanother speech to the American people tomorrow night, and he will send \nhis budget--as required by law--to Congress early next month. At this \ntime, the American people will be able to see for themselves if we have \na leader who possesses the audacity to bring us together to right the \nship or one who will lead us down a path that has brought the economies \nof Europe to the brink of economic disaster and a permanent lower \nstandard of life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CROIX BRIDGE\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we are about to pass unanimously the \nSt. Croix bill. It is something we have been working on very hard--the \ntwo Senators from Minnesota, myself, Senator Franken, Senator Johnson, \nas well as Senator Kohl--to get through the Senate.\n  This bill allows a bridge to be built that has been waiting for 30 \nyears. It is a bridge that exists now and is a beautiful bridge, but it \nis falling apart. Pieces of the bridge have fallen into the St. Croix \nRiver. It is a bridge that is expected to take 18,000 cars a day, and \nthe Department of Transportation and the State of Minnesota believe \nvery strongly we need a new bridge.\n  This legislation allows the bridge to move forward. I appreciate all \nof the help from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. They have \nhelped me to work on this legislation over the last few months. Senator \nCoburn had some changes at the end, and we worked with every single \nSenator to get this done.\n  The bill now moves to the House where it also enjoys bipartisan \nsupport, and both Governors of both States support this bill. They will \nthen be allowed to build the bridge they want.\n  There has been questions raised about whether this creates some kind \nof precedent under the Scenic Rivers Act. This is a very unique \nsituation. It has taken us a year to pass. We are in a situation where \nany new bridge would need an exemption to the Scenic Rivers Act.\n  We are pleased this bill is getting passed today. I don't believe \nanyone believed we could have done this unanimously after 30 years of \nwork, but tonight we are getting it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S33-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ADRIENNE POWERS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Although her stylistic genius and sensitivity to the \nintegrity and history of the walls and floors of the Capitol will be \nmissed, she has left an indelible mark that will not be forgotten.\n  In 1984, after receiving her Bachelor's degree in interior design \nfrom American University, Adrienne began her career as an interior \ndesigner with the Architect of the Capitol. Her first assignment was to \nstyle the legendary Senator Moynihan's third floor office in the \nRussell Senate Office Building. After impressing Senator Moynihan with \nher ornate style and keen eye for fine art, other Senators quickly \nsought her services for their offices as well. This trend continued \nuntil she recently retired, making her one of the most popular figures \namong Members on both sides of the aisle and Capitol.\n  One would struggle to find some part of the Capitol that has not been \nimproved by Adrienne's immense talent and impeccable taste. After 27 \nremarkable years balancing history and purpose, she leaves behind an \nindebted community on Capitol Hill that will forever remember her \nfriendship, professionalism and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S33-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE FINANCIAL GUIDANCE CENTER\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor a true American \nCowboy, Jhett Johnson. At the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in Las \nVegas, Jhett and his teammate, Turtle Powell, took home the gold buckle \nin the team roping competition after 10 rounds of competition against \nthe best of the best.\n  Those of us in Wyoming talk about the Code of the West. As a sixth-\ngeneration Wyoming rancher and now a world champion rodeo cowboy, Jhett \nJohnson personifies the code. He lives each day with courage, takes \npride in his work, and rides for the brand. Jhett has demonstrated this \nin all aspects of his life, not just his rodeo career. When still in \nhis twenties, Jhett survived cancer. He approached his illness, and his \nrecovery, by living the code. He wanted to finish what he started, and \nhe intended to do what needed to be done. He knew that there were \nhundreds of rodeos ahead of him, and he wasn't going to let cancer slow \nhim down.\n  We can all learn from Jhett Johnson and his teammate, Turtle Powell. \nTeam roping is not an individual sport. You must trust your partner. \nTeam roping takes in incredible amount of practice and skill, but you \nmust acknowledge that sometimes you catch one and sometimes you don't. \nCompeting requires miles and miles of travel to rodeos across our great \nNation, which means time away from family and loved ones.\n  When he is not rodeoing, Jhett enjoys training horses on the family \nranch near Casper, WY. He is the devoted husband to Jenny and father to \nthree sons, Kellan, Carson, and Cress.\n  Mr. President, join me in congratulating Wyoming's world champion \ncowboy, Jhett Johnson, on his terrific accomplishments.\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S34-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S34]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HAWAIIAN VOLCANO OBSERVATORY\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \ncentennial anniversary of the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano \nObservatory, HVO, on the island of Hawaii on January 17, 1912. \nCurrently situated on the northwest rim of the caldera of Kilauea, one \nof Earth's most active--and most studied--volcanoes, HVO has \ncollaborated with top scientists from around the world to achieve its \nmission: to create a detailed account of Hawaii's volcanic activity. \nDuring its 100 years of operation, HVO's pursuit of this mission has \nnot only led to great strides in the study of volcanology, it has made \nliving near these volcanoes safer for island residents.\n  Established by the late visionary geologist Thomas A. Jaggar, Jr., \nthe observatory has been continuously monitoring Kilauea and other \nHawaiian volcanoes for the past century, collecting data critical to \nthe understanding of volcanic activity. Jaggar's work built on the \npioneering contributions of the world-renowned American volcanologist, \nFrank A. Perret, who made his first observations on the volcanic \nactivity at Kilauea in 1911. Jaggar used Perret's work to successfully \nsolicit initial support and funding for the project from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Hawaii, and \nthe Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory. Jaggar also received essential \ncontributions from several local businessmen, who pledged significant \nsums to establish the observatory at Kilauea.\n  Over time, the sponsorship and operation of HVO has been administered \nthrough various Federal agencies, including the United States Weather \nBureau from 1919 to 1924; the United States Geological Survey, USGS, \nfrom 1924 to 1935; the National Park Service, NPS, from 1935 to 1947; \nand the USGS again from 1947 to the present. Throughout HVO's history, \nit has worked with local interests to further public safety, education \nand outreach, and geological science. HVO has enjoyed a longtime \npartnership with University of Hawaii's Hilo and Manoa campuses, as \nwell as close working relationships with NPS at Hawaii Volcanoes \nNational Park, the County of Hawaii, and Hawaii's news media.\n  The observations made from HVO have led to groundbreaking \ncontributions in modern geological science through their precision and \ndiligence in data collection, thorough analysis of the observatory's \nvast record, and innovation in monitoring devices and techniques. \nToday, HVO scientists analyze data collected from more than 100 field \nstations, which include seismic, deformation, volcanic-gas, geologic, \nand other monitoring tools. These stations transmit data to HVO around \nthe clock, with a single instrument sending as much as 60 terabytes of \ndata each year. As a result, HVO-guided efforts have successfully \ndiverted or stopped lava flows threatening Hilo and neighboring \ncommunities, mitigated the damage caused by tsunamis by providing \nreliable wave predictions, and have painted a rich, detailed account of \nthe activity of some of the world's most volatile volcanoes.\n  Finally, I wish HVO and USGS the best of luck and continued successes \nas they carry on their important work. I know that they are excited to \nbegin the next hundred years of the observatory's work, and I look \nforward to the advances that will result from their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S34-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S34]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING JIM CAPOOT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

In 2002, she began her career \nat the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Office as a booking clerk in the \ncounty jail. As her knowledge and love of law enforcement grew, Officer \nDonahou eventually became a crime scene technician and dutifully served \nthe citizens and communities of Stanislaus County with great \ncommitment, integrity, and valor. Her devotion to helping others, along \nwith her passion for law enforcement, enabled her to become a respected \nmember of the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department.\n  Those who knew Officer Donahou will always remember her as a caring, \nkind, and devoted mother, colleague, and friend. She fulfilled her oath \nas an officer of the law with honor, bravery, and dedication. Her \ncontributions to public safety and commitment to the citizens she \nserved will never be forgotten and will be an example to others who \nhope to one day protect and serve the public.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to Officer Donahou's son, Jake Lewis \nHassler; her parents, Janice and Robert Pence and Jack and Mary \nDonahou; and her sisters, Jennifer Horne, Melinda Donahou-Sneed, Lori \nDonahou and Teresa Brockman.\n  We shall always be grateful for Officer Donahou's heroic service and \nthe sacrifices she made while serving the community and the people she \nloved.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the life and legacy of Warren Hellman, a San Francisco \nfinancier, philanthropist, and community leader who died last month at \nage 77 from complications of leukemia.\n  In addition to its spectacular beauty, the City of San Francisco is \nknown around the world for its great heart and free spirit, its \ncelebration of diversity, and its charm. In recent years, perhaps no \nSan Franciscan has embodied his beloved city more than Warren Hellman. \nHe was a fantastically successful businessman and investor who liked to \ndress casually, ride horses, run 100-mile races, and play bluegrass \nbanjo.\n  Here is how Warren was remembered by the Bay Citizen, the free \nnewspaper he founded when he felt that local news coverage was in \ndecline:\n\n       A rugged iconoclast whose views on life rarely failed to \n     surprise, Hellman was a lifelong Republican who supported \n     labor unions, an investment banker whose greatest joy was \n     playing songs of the working class in a bluegrass band, and a \n     billionaire who wanted to pay more taxes and preferred the \n     company of crooners and horsemen who shared his love of music \n     and cross-country `ride and tie' racing.\n\n  Warren Hellman was born in New York and raised in San Francisco. He \ngraduated from the University of California, Berkeley and earned an MBA \nat Harvard Business School. After becoming the youngest director in the \nhistory of Lehman Brothers, Warren moved home to California and co-\nfounded the private equity firm of Hellman & Friedman. Though he made a \nlot of money, he much preferred giving it away. Warren said that money \nwas ``like manure: If you spread it around, good things will grow--and \nif you pile it up, it just smells bad.''\n\n[[Page S35]]\n\n  Among the many institutions Warren helped grow were the San Francisco \nFree Clinic, the Hellman Fellows Program at UC Berkeley, and his Hardly \nStrictly Bluegrass festival, where more than half a million people come \neach year to hear free concerts from top entertainers and from Warren's \nband, the Wronglers.\n  He served as chairman and trustee emeritus of The San Francisco \nFoundation; advisory board member of the Walter A. Haas School of \nBusiness at UC Berkeley; trustee of the UC Berkeley Foundation; trustee \nemeritus of The Brookings Institution; board member of the Committee on \nJOBS; member of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee of the \nJewish Community Federation; chairman of the Jewish Community Endowment \nFund; board member of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and the Bay \nArea Council; and chairman of Voice of Dance.\n  Warren also led many efforts to support civic initiatives in San \nFrancisco, from the underground parking garage that saved two major \nmuseums in Golden Gate Park to the broad-based campaign to reform San \nFrancisco's city employee pension system.\n  On behalf of the people of California, who have benefitted so much \nfrom Warren Hellman's great generosity and public sprit, I send my \ndeepest gratitude and condolences to his wife, Patricia Christina \n``Chris'' Hellman; son Marco ``Mick'' Hellman; daughters Frances \nHellman, Judith Hellman, and Patricia Hellman Gibbs; his sister, Nancy \nHellman Bechtle; and his 12 grandchildren. Warren's passing is a great \nloss to his family, his friends, and the city he loved and served so \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S35-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S35]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE ANNENBERG RETREAT AT SUNNYLANDS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this year the late Walter and \nLeonore Annenberg's legendary California estate, Sunnylands, will open \nits doors to the public as the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring the Annenbergs' remarkable legacy \nand saluting the new institution's noble goals.\n  Sunnylands was designed and built in the mid-1960s as the Annenbergs' \ndesert home in Rancho Mirage. It served as their winter residence and \nas a tranquil retreat and meeting place for Presidents of the United \nStates, U.S. Supreme Court Justices, scholars, historians, former \ndiplomats, Governors, State legislators as well as bipartisan \ncoalitions of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Among many \nother notable guests, President Nixon wrote his 1974 State of the Union \nspeech there, and Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles visited in \n1983.\n  In 2001, the Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands was founded to \ncontinue Sunnylands' role as a conference center and retreat for \nnational and international leaders to address the world's most pressing \nconcerns. Throughout their lifetimes, Ambassador and Mrs. Annenberg \nhosted and sponsored a number of solution-driven retreats that fostered \npositive diplomatic, judicial, and legislative progress.\n  Now, the new Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands will be available for \nthe President of the United States and the Secretary of State to bring \ntogether world leaders to promote and facilitate peaceful international \nagreements; for the President and the Cabinet, the Supreme Court, and \nthe bipartisan leadership of the Congress to meet to focus on ways to \nimprove the functioning of the three branches of government; and for \nleaders of major social institutions, such as universities, colleges, \npublic schools, charities, and government agencies, to meet and \ndetermine how these institutions might better serve the public good.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nAnnenberg Retreat at Sunnylands for realizing the Annenbergs' dream of \ncreating a world-class center that provides our leaders with an \natmosphere to discuss vital issues, promote cooperation, and craft \nsolutions for our Nation and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S35-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S35]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO LILY TOMLIN AND JANE WAGNER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on March 16th, two of the Nation's \ngreat theatrical talents will be recognized when my friends Lily Tomlin \nand Jane Wagner are added to the Palm Springs Walk of Stars.\n  As we all know, Lily Tomlin is a dazzling star of stage, screen, and \ntelevision. She first won the hearts of millions of Americans more than \n40 years ago on ``Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,'' where she created \nunforgettable characters such as the world famous telephone operator \nErnestine and the precocious young child Edith Ann. Lily said of these \ncharacters, ``I don't necessarily admire them, but I do them all with \nlove.'' From the beginning, audiences fell in love with Lily Tomlin.\n  In 1971, Lily began working on an Edith Ann comedy album with a \nbrilliant, award-winning young playwright named Jane Wagner. They \nproduced acclaimed hit recordings and television specials and went on \nto further triumphs on Broadway and in Hollywood.\n  It is fitting that Lily and Jane will be honored together on the Palm \nSprings Walk of Stars, not only because of their long personal and \nprofessional partnership, but because they have formed one of the most \nfruitful creative collaborations in the history of American performing \narts. Over the past four decades, Jane Wagner has created unforgettable \ncharacters, and Lily has inhabited these characters and brought them \nfully to life.\n  Since 1985, much of their creative energy has focused on various \nproductions of Jane's play ``The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life \nin the Universe''. Through this timeless yet dynamic work of art--with \ninsight, humor, and love for all that makes us human--these two \nextraordinary artists have expanded both the bounds of performance art \nand our understanding of the human condition.\n  I have known Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner for many years. I am pleased \nto call them my friends, and I will be honored to join the Palm Springs \nWalk of Stars next month in paying tribute to their tremendous \ncontributions to the Palm Springs area and to American culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S35-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S35-S36]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO STEVEN D.

Garbarino of Owings Mills, MD, on the \ncompletion of a highly successful 27-year career as a civilian employee \nwithin the Department of the Army, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nBaltimore District, on January 31, 2012. Mr. Garbarino's entire career \nwas marked by his daily demonstration of the Army's values. His \nperformance reflected a strong loyalty to the organization and its \nmembers; a selfless dedication to duty, his customers and the Corps' \npublic service mission; and a no-nonsense ``can-do'' attitude built \nupon honor, integrity, superior competence, and the personal courage to \nstrive for excellence in his job performance. I applaud his commitment \nto public service and recognize the sacrifices he has made for the good \nof our Nation. Mr. Garbarino highlights the importance of hard-working \nFederal workers who strive to keep us healthy, safe, informed, and free \nto enjoy the lifestyle that we, as Americans, have grown to appreciate \nand expect. He is a model Federal employee who readily deserves \nrecognition for his distinguished career as a professional member of \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  As a project manager, Mr. Garbarino made significant personal efforts \nto become a subject matter expert on policy, procedures, and processes \nassociated with the Civil Works Program and projects. This expertise \nled him to serve as a mentor to project team members and other Civil \nWorks project managers.\n  Mr. Garbarino has also authored several environmental technical \nreport/papers and made numerous presentations related to his work. \nForums for these presentations have included numerous workshops, \nconferences, public meetings, televised interviews, radio talk shows, \nand the United Nations 1995 conference on environmental restoration. \nOver his career he has developed a strong public speaking presence and \nis recognized for his outstanding professional representation of the \nCorps.\n  I also want to thank Diane, Steve's wife of over 30 years, and their \ntwo\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\nsons, Garret and Zachery. The families of outstanding Federal employees \nhave to make sacrifices, too, as they share their loved ones with a job \nserving the American people. I know they join me in my best wishes to \nSteve for a happy and well-earned retirement.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere pleasure to congratulate Mr. \nGarbarino on the occasion of his retirement. He was a highly valued \nemployee of the Baltimore District and well deserves recognition in \n2012 for his outstanding public service career as a distinguished \nmember of the Federal workforce. He is an outstanding example of the \nFederal workforce who worked tirelessly day in and day out for the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S36-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S36]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING ROGER DOUGLAS KOTTER\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nRoger Kotter, a husband, father, community leader, businessman, and \nexemplary Idahoan.\n  At the core of Roger Kotter's accomplishments were his dedication to \nfamily, strong sense of community, and his ability to connect with his \ncustomers. Roger served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints in Santiago, Chile, from 1966 to 1968, married his \nwife of 43 years, Karen, and graduated from Brigham Young University in \n1971. After graduating, Roger moved back to Nampa and started working \nfor Stone Lumber in 1972 and became part owner in 1980. Stone Lumber \nhas been a staple of Nampa since 1906, and under the direction of Roger \nand Monte Schlerf, it has continued in the tradition of providing jobs \nand exceptional customer service. Roger also devoted decades of service \nand was involved in various organizations, including Nampa Exchange \nClub past president--Nampa Boys and Girls Club, Nampa Schools \nFoundation, Boy Scouts of America, and, through Stone Lumber, worked \nwith Habitat for Humanity. Roger was active in supporting the local \nHispanic community acting as a mentor and teaching English. He was also \nactively involved with his church and served in stake presidencies, \nbishoprics, and was most recently a counselor in the Boise Idaho \nMission presidency. Roger has been recognized for his commendable \nskills through honors, such as his selection as Idaho Businessman of \nthe Year in 2000.\n  I join Rogers's wife Karen; five children, Kristin, Jason, Brent, \nMatthew, and Amy; 12 grandchildren; father, James; 6 siblings; other \nfamily members; many friends; the Nampa community, and the numerous \npeople he inspired in mourning his loss and expressing gratitude for \nhis contribution. Roger Kotter will be missed, and his legacy of \ndevotion to his family and community will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S36-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S36]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL KAREN A. FLAHERTY\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great \nAmerican and a true military visionary who has humbly served our \ncountry for close to 40 years in the Navy Nurse Corps, both Active and \nReserve components: RADM Karen A. Flaherty. A native of Winsted, CT, \nshe joined the U.S. Navy as a Nurse Corps candidate in July 1973. Upon \ngraduation from Skidmore College, she attended Officer Indoctrination \nSchool in Newport, RI, in August 1974.\n  Admiral Flaherty's first assignment was Quantico Naval Hospital, \nwhere she served as a staff nurse and charge nurse of the Surgical \nWard, Orthopedic Ward, and the Maximum Care Unit. Upon transfer to the \nPhiladelphia Naval Medical Center in 1977, she assumed the duties as \ncharge nurse for the General Surgery Unit and the Obstetrics and \nGynecology Clinic. Admiral Flaherty reported for duty as the officer \nprograms officer for Naval Recruiting Command, Navy Recruiting District \nNew Jersey in 1979. She transitioned to the Naval Reserve in 1982.\n  Admiral Flaherty's subsequent reserve tours included assignments to \nnumerous naval hospitals and fleet hospital commands. In her \ndistinguished career she has served as commanding officer, Fleet \nHospital, Fort Dix, executive officer, director of nursing services, \nofficer-in-charge, and training officer. In February 1991, she was \nrecalled to serve with Fleet Hospital 15, Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia, in \nsupport of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. She served as commanding \nofficer of the OPNAV 093 Reserve Unit prior to assuming Flag duties as \nthe Deputy Commander Force Integration National Capital Area and the \ndeputy chief for health care operations at the Bureau of Medicine and \nSurgery. In each assignment, she excelled and overcame every challenge \nand was rewarded with greater responsibility and opportunities.\n  Admiral Flaherty has served at the Navy Bureau of Medicine and \nSurgery as the deputy surgeon general, deputy chief, wounded, ill, and \ninjured, and the 22nd director of the Navy Nurse Corps. Her visionary \nleadership and executive management skills have played vital roles in \nforging new frontiers between the Department of Defense, Veterans \nAffairs, and the private sector to improve care for sailors, marines, \nveterans, and their families.\n  Admiral Flaherty received her master of science degree from the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania and has held senior executive leadership \npositions at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA, \nSt. Francis Hospital in Wilmington, DE, and the Philadelphia Veterans \nAffairs Medical Center in Philadelphia, PA.\n  Admiral Flaherty's career has encompassed the full spectrum of \npublic, private, academic, and military service. Focusing on quality, \naccess, and reliability of wounded warrior care, she is the embodiment \nof joint, interagency, academic, public, and private collaboration. \nThrough far-reaching vision, dedication, and inspired leadership she \nimproved health care operations across Navy Medicine and built \nrelationships between Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of \nDefense Health Systems. Her sustained performance reflects greatly on \nherself, the Department of Defense, and the United States of America. I \nextend my deepest appreciation on behalf of a grateful nation for her \ndedicated military service. Rear Admiral Flaherty, on the occasion of \nyour retirement, I congratulate and thank you for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S36-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S36-S37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING CHARLES M. PALLESEN, JR.\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to pay \ntribute to a good friend who can quite aptly be called a gentleman and \na scholar, as well as one very likeable person who touched the lives of \nmany of my fellow Nebraskans. Charles M. ``Chuck'' Pallesen, Jr., \npassed away on November 26, 2011, at the age of 74.\n  First and foremost a loving husband and father, Chuck married his \ncollege sweetheart, Lorraine Sysel; and two sons, Mike and Ed, together \nwith their families, blessed this union. He was also a former Boy \nScout; a U.S. Army veteran who served in the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps; and a partner for more than 40 years in a successful law \npractice--Cline Williams Wright Johnson & Oldfather, L.L.P.--\nspecializing in health care and business law.\n  Chuck was one of the most active people in civic and political \nmatters that I have ever met. He was engaged in the Nebraska efforts of \nevery Presidential campaign from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. He \nwas a key adviser not only to me, but also to former Nebraska Governors \nand Senators Jim Exon and Bob Kerrey.\n  Yet Chuck was so much more than his resume. A good friend of his, \nGerry Finnegan, said recently that:\n\n       Chuck was at his best, both professionally and politically, \n     lodged between disagreeing parties coaxing them to resolve \n     their conflict--a masterful mediator blessed with an innate \n     sense of how much ground each adversary could give and how \n     hard he could push for a resolution.\n\n  This ability, combined with an outgoing personality and a keen eye \nfor details, made him invaluable to Senators Exon, Kerrey, and myself.\n  Always a very busy guy, Chuck and a colleague, former Judge Samuel \nVan Pelt, Jr., had been in the process of authoring a book about \nSenator Exon. Chuck spoke to me several times, both for and about his \nupcoming book. Those interviews were extremely enjoyable, and I looked \nforward to every opportunity to walk down memory lane and swap stories \nabout ``Big Jim,''\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\none of the greatest Nebraskans to ever serve my home State. Chuck's \nuntimely passing has made me look forward even more to reading his \nlabor of love when it is published, and when I do, I will be \nremembering not only the great J. James Exon, but Charles Pallesen, \nJr., as well--on every page and throughout every chapter.\n  In closing, Chuck Pallesen was a man who will be missed by all who \nknew him and remembered as an individual who served his community, \nState and country well. A true statesman, we are all the better for \nChuck's countless contributions, his enthusiasm, his dedication, and \nmost of all, his compassion. He was truly a giant among men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S37-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President today, I would like to recognize and \nhonor the valuable contributions of Catholic schools in educating our \nyoung people throughout our great Nation. This year from January 29 to \nFebruary 5, we will celebrate Catholic Schools Week to recognize the \nexceptional work of Catholic education programs across the country.\n  Our Nation's Catholic schools have received international praise for \nacademic excellence and have provided students with lessons that extend \nfar beyond the classroom. These schools have continued to impart \ncomprehensive curriculums that emphasize moral, intellectual, and \nphysical development in young people.\n  In Louisiana, our Catholic schools maintain high academic standards, \nfoster a healthy learning environment for students, and encourage \nfamily involvement in the ongoing education of children.\n  Today, more than two million students attend Catholic schools in the \nUnited States, and Catholic schools nationally graduate 99 percent of \nstudents with more than 97 percent pursuing college degrees.\n  The National Conference of Catholic Bishops stated, ``Education is \none of the most important ways by which the Church fulfills its \ncommitment to the dignity of the person and building of community. \nCommunity is central to education ministry, both as a necessary \ncondition and an ardently desired goal. The educational efforts of the \nChurch, therefore, must be directed to forming persons-in-community; \nfor the education of the individual Christian is important not only to \nhis solitary destiny, but also the destinies of the many communities in \nwhich he lives.''\n  This statement not only stresses the importance of education as part \nof the mission of the Catholic Church, but also the importance of \ncommunity and schools in shaping our young people as they go out in to \nthe world to become valuable members of society and their community.\n  This week, we recognize the students, their families, teachers, \nadministrators, all of our parish leaders, and our communities for \ntheir efforts to support our Catholic schools and continued achievement \ntowards the education of our young people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S37-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S37-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S37-4", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO THE DEBT LIMIT, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE \n                   SENATE ON JANUARY 12, 2012--PM 36\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, January 12, 2012.\n     Hon.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to end the \ncostly derivatives blended rate loophole, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the coming year is certain to be focused on \ntwo problems: the need to restore prosperity for American working \nfamilies, and the need to reduce our budget deficit. Our challenge is \nto accomplish these goals together, and not to pursue one at the \nexpense of the other. As I have said repeatedly to this Senate, I \nbelieve the only way we can successfully achieve both goals is to \npursue deficit reduction strategies that do not rely solely on slashing \nfederal spending and attacking programs that help build opportunity for \nthe middle class. We must recognize that revenue, as well as spending \ncuts, must be part of our strategy, and we must ensure that the \nsacrifices that surely will be needed to reduce the deficit fall not \njust on middle-class Americans, but are spread equitably, and ask for \ncontributions from those who have benefitted so greatly from policies \nenacted in the past.\n  Today I introduce the Closing the Derivatives Blended Rate Loophole \nAct. This bill meets the twin tests of helping to reduce the deficit \nwhile promoting the interests of American families. It would put an end \nto a tax loophole that epitomizes how our tax code too often favors \nshort-term speculation over investment in economic growth and job \ncreation. This loophole showers benefits on short-term traders of \ncertain financial instruments, but does nothing to promote economic \ngrowth and raises the tax burden on American families.\n  What is the derivatives blended rate? It's an example of how the \ncomplexities of the tax code can grant breaks for the few at the \nexpense of the many. Here is how it works.\n  Generally speaking, taxpayers are allowed to claim the lower long-\nterm capital gains tax rate on earnings only if those earnings come \nfrom the sale of assets that they have held for more than a year. The \nreason is simple: we tax longterm capital gains at a lower rate because \nwe want to encourage the long-term investment that helps our economy \ngrow.\n  But under Section 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code, traders in \ncertain derivatives contracts have managed to win themselves an \nexemption from the distinction between short-term and long-term capital \ngains. Under this section, traders in those derivatives can claim 60 \npercent of their income as long-term capital gains, no matter how \nbriefly they hold the asset. This ``blended'' tax rate applies if the \ntrader holds the asset for 11 months or 11 hours.\n  The details may be complex, but the bottom line is that this \ntreatment bestows a substantial tax break on those who typically hold \nthe covered derivatives for only a brief period. It encourages and \nrewards short-term speculation in complicated financial products and \ndoes little, if anything, to help our economy grow and create jobs. In \nfact, the increasing focus of our financial markets on short-term \nprofit through trades that last just minutes or seconds threatens real \ndamage to our economy. This speculation is hardly the sort of activity \nthat our tax code should subsidize.\n  We also lose significant tax revenue by allowing this tax break--a \nrevenue loss that means we must either ask for more from American \nfamilies, or add to the deficit. What's more, this misguided policy \ncontributes to the basic unfairness that characterizes too much of our \ntax code, by providing an unusual and unnecessary tax break to a small \ngroup of financial speculators. Instead of encouraging growth and \ninvestment, these loopholes contribute to what Warren Buffett has \ncalled the ``coddling'' of the wealthy and well-placed.\n  Closing this loophole is a common-sense, mainstream idea. I ask my \ncolleagues to heed the advice of the tax experts at the American Bar \nAssociation's Tax Section, who wrote in December to the tax-writing \ncommittees of the House and Senate:\n\n       We are aware of no policy reason to provide preferential \n     treatment for these gains and losses. Lower capital gains \n     rates are intended to encourage long-term investments in \n     capital assets such as stock. Whatever the merits of \n     extending preferential rates to derivative financial \n     instruments generally, we do not believe that there is a \n     policy basis for providing those preferential rates to \n     taxpayers who have not made such long-term investments.\n\n  Ending this loophole by passage of the Closing the Derivatives \nBlended Rate Loophole Act would not solve all the problems in our tax \ncode, nor end our deficit dilemma. But it would be another important \nstep toward a saner, fairer tax code. It would demonstrate that \nCongress shares the concerns of so many Americans that the tax system \nis too often stacked against the interests of working families and in \nfavor of the privileged few. It would end a policy that encourages \nshort-term speculation over long-term investment in growth. It would \nprovide a down-payment on the revenue we need to restore if we are to \nengage in serious deficit reduction and avoid slashing critical \nprograms. I urge my colleagues to join me in the effort to pass it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Lee, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Moran, Mr. \n        Alexander, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Coats, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Burr, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \n        Boozman, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McCain, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Kirk, and Mr. Graham):\n  S.J.

Res. 352\n\n       Whereas, since 1993, research has shown tens of thousands \n     of women and girls have been victims of sexual or gender-\n     based violence in Haiti, particularly in times of conflict or \n     natural disaster;\n       Whereas approximately 50 percent of the victims are \n     adolescent girls under the age of 18, with many of the cases \n     involving the use of weapons, gang rape, and death threats \n     for reporting the crime;\n       Whereas members of many medical professions are \n     insufficiently trained to attend to the special needs of \n     victims of gender-based violence, whether they be children or \n     adults;\n       Whereas some medical providers report as many as 20 percent \n     of adolescent victims they have treated for sexual violence \n     become pregnant from their rape;\n       Whereas some women's rights groups in Haiti have witnessed \n     dramatic increases in rates of sexual violence in many of the \n     displacement camps formed after the earthquake;\n       Whereas the January 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti increased \n     the economic and social vulnerabilities of many women who are \n     now unable to protect their young children from sexual \n     predators, thereby increasing their risk for sexual violence;\n       Whereas, according to data from public interest law firms \n     litigating cases of sexual violence, significant gender-based \n     barriers to justice continue to exist at all levels of the \n     justice system in Haiti;\n       Whereas an effective, transparent, and impartial judicial \n     system is key to the administration of justice, and the \n     failure to ensure\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\n     proper investigations and prosecutions hampers the ability to \n     hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes and \n     discourages victims from formally seeking justice;\n       Whereas inadequate financial, human, and technical \n     resources, as well as a lack of forensic and technical \n     expertise, have impeded the arrest and prosecution of \n     suspects;\n       Whereas members of the police, prosecutors, and judges are \n     insufficiently trained to attend to either the special needs \n     of women and girl victims of gender-based violence, or the \n     special needs of boys and girls who are victims of other \n     abuses such as forced labor, beatings, or violence;\n       Whereas the lack of protection measures discourages women \n     and girls in Haiti from pursuing prosecution of perpetrators \n     of sexual violence, for fear of reprisal or stigmatization;\n       Whereas rape and other forms of gender-based violence in \n     Haiti threaten the physical and psychological health of both \n     the victims and their families;\n       Whereas many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean \n     face significant challenges in combating violence against \n     women and girls, and violence against children, and \n     international cooperation is essential in addressing this \n     serious issue;\n       Whereas the Government of Haiti has undertaken efforts to \n     prevent violence against women, as evidenced by its \n     ratification of the United Nations Convention on the \n     Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, \n     adopted December 18, 1979; the Inter-American Convention on \n     the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence \n     Against Women, adopted at Belem Do Para, Brazil, June 9, \n     1994; and other international human rights treaties, and the \n     enactment of laws and the creation of state institutions to \n     promote and protect the rights of women;\n       Whereas the Government of Haiti has been a signatory of the \n     United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted \n     November 20, 1989, since December 29, 1994;\n       Whereas the Haitian National Police and the United Nations \n     Mission for Stabilization of Haiti have created special \n     police units to address sexual and other forms of gender-\n     based violence in Haiti;\n       Whereas the special police unit to address gender-based \n     violence within the Haitian National Police remains \n     significantly under-resourced, rendering it practically \n     ineffective to carry out its mandate;\n       Whereas, in March 2009, the Inter-American Commission on \n     Human Rights issued a report recognizing Haiti's history of \n     gender discrimination that fuels gender-based violence and \n     gives rise to a climate of impunity;\n       Whereas, in December 2010, the Inter-American Commission \n     detailed steps the Government of Haiti must take to protect \n     women and girls from increased risk of gender-based violence \n     in post-earthquake Haiti;\n       Whereas, in 2012, the Ministry for the Status of Women and \n     Women's Rights in Haiti plans to unveil a comprehensive draft \n     law that calls for the prevention, punishment, and \n     elimination of violence against women;\n       Whereas the United Nations and donor countries, such as the \n     United States, continue to have a prominent economic and \n     leadership role in the stabilization and reconstruction of \n     Haiti;\n       Whereas few mechanisms exist in Haiti to protect the rights \n     of young children not living at home, such as restaveks, who \n     are engaged in forced labor or are victims to other forms of \n     violence; and\n       Whereas the lack of protection for women and girls and \n     continuing impunity for crimes against women is a threat to \n     the rule of law, democracy, and stability in Haiti: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) sympathizes with the families of women and children \n     victimized by sexual and other forms of gender-based violence \n     in Haiti;\n       (2) urges the treatment of the issue of violence against \n     women and children as a priority for the United States \n     Government's humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in \n     Haiti;\n       (3) asserts its support for the passage of Haiti's first \n     comprehensive law on the prevention, punishment, and \n     elimination of all forms of gender-based violence;\n       (4) calls on the Government of Haiti to establish urgent \n     plans that address the needs of vulnerable and unprotected \n     children who are in situations of sexual exploitation, forced \n     labor, or face sexual and or domestic violence, and to take \n     steps to immediately implement those plans, in consultation \n     with grassroots organizations working specifically on the \n     protection and promotion of the rights of children;\n       (5) calls on the Government of Haiti to take steps to \n     implement the recommendations of the Inter-American \n     Commission on Human Rights issued in response to increased \n     levels of sexual violence in camps for internally-displaced \n     persons on December 22, 2010, including--\n       (A) ensuring participation and leadership of grassroots \n     women's groups in planning and implementing policies and \n     practices to combat and prevent sexual violence and other \n     forms of violence in the camps;\n       (B) ensuring provision of comprehensive, affordable, \n     adequate, and appropriate medical and psychological care in \n     locations accessible to victims of sexual violence in camps \n     for those internally displaced, including, in particular \n     ensuring--\n       (i) privacy during examinations;\n       (ii) availability of female medical staff members, with a \n     cultural sensitivity and experience with victims of sexual \n     violence;\n       (iii) timely issuance of free medical certificates;\n       (iv) availability of HIV prophylaxis, and\n       (v) sexual reproductive health and emergency contraception;\n       (C) implementing effective security measures in \n     displacement camps, such as providing street lighting, \n     adequate patrolling in and around the camps, and a greater \n     number of female security forces in police patrols in the \n     camps and in police stations in proximity to the camps;\n       (D) ensuring that public officials, such as police \n     officers, prosecutors, and judges, responsible for responding \n     to incidents of sexual violence receive specialized training \n     from experienced Haitian and international women's \n     organizations with a proven track record in gender-sensitive \n     protection enabling them to respond adequately to complaints \n     of sexual violence with appropriate sensitivity and in a \n     nondiscriminatory manner; and\n       (E) maintaining effective special units within the police \n     and the prosecutor's office investigating cases of rape and \n     other forms of violence against women and girls;\n       (6) asserts its commitment to support the Haitian Ministry \n     of Women's Affairs in its efforts to--\n       (A) build ministry capacity and facilitate gender-based \n     violence sub-cluster meetings and initiatives as it \n     transitions over to the Government of Haiti;\n       (B) perform decentralized meetings, consultations, and \n     outreach to women's movements and community groups;\n       (C) address issues of gender-based violence country-wide, \n     including violence in internally displaced person camps, \n     rural peasant communities, and among children; and\n       (D) strengthen gender assessments, gender budgets, and \n     gender planning in collaboration with other Haitian \n     ministries, the Haitian Parliament, the ruling administration \n     in Haiti, the United Nations, the Inter-American Commission \n     on Human Rights, donors, and international nongovernmental \n     organizations within the reconstruction process; and\n       (7) asserts its support for the Government of Haiti, \n     especially the Ministry of Women's Affairs, in its efforts to \n     assess, amend, and renew its 5-year gender protection plan, \n     which expired in October 2011, which includes support for the \n     Government of Haiti in its efforts--\n       (A) to thoroughly assess the impact of the previous 5-year \n     protection plan, including both pre and post-earthquake \n     analyses and perform diversified assessments in consultation \n     with local, regional, and national women's groups throughout \n     the country, that will help gather decentralized data in both \n     urban and rural zones;\n       (B) to perform specialized surveys and interviews in a \n     significant sampling of internally displaced person camps and \n     impoverished neighborhoods with high rates of gender-based \n     violence with victims of rape and violence, the community \n     groups that support them, and local officials in order to \n     fully understand the needs and recommendations of these \n     different populations and integrate these findings into a \n     revised protection plan;\n       (C) to revise the existing Haitian protection plan based on \n     the results of diversified and decentralized assessments and \n     in direct consultation with national, regional, and local \n     government officials and grassroots organizations, including \n     women's groups and international institutions that focus on \n     solutions to gender-based violence; and\n       (D) to amend, reintroduce, and pass into law a revised \n     Haiti gender protection plan that reflects current post-\n     earthquake realities, the needs and recommendations of \n     victims of gender-based violence and the community groups \n     that support them, integrates provisions for judicial and \n     medical services for gender-based violence victims, and \n     reflects key findings of decentralized assessments in both \n     urban and rural zones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/23/senate-section/article/S46-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S46]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1468.
