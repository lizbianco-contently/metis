Madam President, later today the President is expected \nto speak in El Paso about our Nation's immigration policy. Getting \nimmigration policy right is one of the more difficult challenges we \nface as a nation, and Republicans are committed to meeting it. As with \nmost serious challenges, however, the only way we will make progress is \nby working on a solution that is acceptable to both parties. For \nRepublicans, that means the President will have to present a plan that \ntakes amnesty off the table and focuses instead on making a real \ncommitment to border and internal security. If the President does these \ntwo things, he will find strong bipartisan support. If he doesn't, he \nwon't.\n  Another difficult challenge we are solving only by working together \nis bringing down the Nation's debt. To that end, Members of both \nparties met with the Vice President last week at Blair House. The \nparticipants had what all sides agreed was a productive meeting, and \nthey will meet again this afternoon. Unfortunately, there still seems \nto be a serious disconnect between the two parties on this issue. There \nare still those on the other side who think we can put off difficult \ndecisions until after the next Presidential election or even beyond. \nRepublicans strongly disagree. In our view, doing nothing about the \ndebt would be far more dangerous in the long run than failing to raise \nthe debt ceiling. I have said this before, and Speaker Boehner \nreiterated the point yesterday in New York. The warning bells are \nsimply too loud to ignore this crisis any longer, and the debt limit \ndebate presents us with a prime opportunity for meaningful, positive \naction.\n  If the last financial crisis taught us anything, it is that we can't \nafford to play with fire when it comes to economic forces this great. \nWe need to get serious now before the crisis we know\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\nis coming. That means entitlement reform needs to be on the table. This \nis a serious crisis. We must do something serious. Entitlement reform \nneeds to be a part of it. That is the only way we will send a message \nto the world that we are actually willing to make the tough decisions \nneeded to get our fiscal house in order. That is the only way the \nmarkets, the American people, and the rest of the world--especially \nthose who hold so much of our debt--will believe we are on the right \ntrack.\n  As we prepare for a second round of talks, I would renew the call to \nget serious about this looming crisis and do something serious. I renew \nmy pledge this morning to do what it takes to make sure we avert it \nwithout raising taxes or building in automatic tax increases in the \nfuture which would only destroy jobs. We can avert this crisis without \ndoing harm to the economy or slowing down any economic recovery. That \nmeans no tax hikes now, and it means not rewarding the failure of a \nfuture Congress with automatic access to more taxpayer dollars. Above \nall, it means serious reforms. We need to summon the courage to make \nsome tough decisions right now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2816-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, briefly, first to comment on immigration \nreform, we have spent a great deal of time on the Senate floor the last \ntwo Congresses dealing with immigration reform. We worked hard in \ncoming up with a solution, and we have a solution. We were working with \nPresident Bush toward coming up with a solution to immigration reform. \nThe problem was that even President Bush--even President Bush--could \nnot get his Republican colleagues to join with us in doing something \nabout immigration reform.\n  Our immigration system is broken, and it needs to be fixed. But it is \nso important that the President in El Paso today talks about the need \nfor immigration reform because he knows and we all know, as even \nPresident Bush knew, that immigration reform is necessary. The problem \nis that we can't get Republicans here in the Senate to help us. It is \nquite simple.\n  We know we have to do something about border security. We have done a \nlot in that regard. Have we done enough? No. There is more that can be \ndone, but we have done a lot in that direction, and rightfully so. Just \nwithin the last year or so, we provided $650 billion for more border \nsecurity. That was on a bipartisan basis. We passed that. That was \nimportant.\n  We also have to do something about our guest worker program. At any \none given time, we have thousands and thousands of guest workers here. \nWhy? Because it is necessary, and it has been for a long time. Take the \nChesapeake Bay. We have learned that we have people who come in--\nseasonal workers--who can do the work on the clams and the stuff on the \ngreat Chesapeake Bay. We have about 1.5 million agricultural workers in \nour country, and we have a system that doesn't work even for them. We \nhave to do this. Our agricultural industry depends on it.\n  We also have in our country today 11 million people who are \nundocumented. There isn't anybody with an ounce of common sense who \nthinks we can deport 11 million people. We can't do it fiscally, and we \ncan't do it physically. Therefore, we should do something about the 11 \nmillion people who are here. How should we do that? Put them on a \npathway to legalization. It doesn't mean amnesty. It means that they \nwould pay penalties and fines, that they would go to the back of the \nline, not the front of the line. They would have to learn English. They \nwould have to stay out of trouble. They would have to pay taxes. There \nare certain things they would be required to do.\n  Finally, we have to do something about the unworkable employer \nsanction provision that was put into the 1986 law. It hasn't worked. \nPrior to that time, the burden was on the government to make sure \npeople who came to work throughout America were legal. We shifted that \nresponsibility to employers. They can't do that. It is a catch-22 now. \nThe way the law is set up now simply doesn't work. We have, since 1986, \ncomputerization which has taken over much of the world, and through \nthat we can work toward having an employer sanction program in our \ncountry that will work.\n  My point is that President Obama should be commended for talking \nabout immigration reform. It is necessary.\n  My friend the Republican leader should also understand that we have \ntried, and for our Republican people to talk about immigration reform \nand not vote accordingly is something the people of America have \nwitnessed now for many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2816-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2816-S2817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OIL COMPANY SUBSIDIES\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, saving money requires a lot of very \ndifficult choices: Which programs do we cut in these tough times? Which \npriorities are more important than others? As we have seen in the \nSenate and across the country over the last few months, a lot of people \nhave a lot of different answers to these questions.\n  Democrats believe we have to get our spending under control, and we \nhave to look at what needs to be cut. But we need to have a fair \nprogram, one that looks at what we are going to do long term with the \nequities of our spending programs. We have to look at what we do with \nrevenues to make sure they are fair and balanced. So there are a lot of \nchoices.\n  My friend, the Speaker of the House, gave a speech last night in New \nYork. He talked about raising the debt limit and some of the things he \nthinks would be necessary in order to get that done. But I would direct \nthe attention of my friend, the Speaker, to one way it would go very \nquickly to solving some of these problems. We know there is waste in \nthe Federal budget and the Tax Code, but what I want to direct the \nattention of my friend, the Speaker, to is these five big oil \ncompanies.\n  We, as taxpayers, are giving billions and billions of dollars every \nyear to these companies--billions every year. Every cent of it is \ntaxpayer money to oil companies that already are more than successful.\n  These oil companies made $36 billion in profits during the first \nquarter of this year. I repeat that: $36 billion in profits during the \nfirst quarter of this year. ExxonMobil alone made 70 percent more this \nyear than they did last year. Exxon holds the record for making more \nthan any corporation in the history of our country in years past. These \noil companies, I repeat, made $36 billion in the first quarter.\n  The industry's $36 billion in quarterly profits means they are making \nabout $12 billion a month or $4 billion a week, and yet the U.S. \nGovernment is giving these companies billions of dollars in corporate \nwelfare every year. That is unnecessary. Why are taxpayers on the hook \nfor oil companies that are doing just fine on their own?\n  If we are serious about reducing the deficit, what an easy place to \nstart, I say to my friend, the Speaker of the House of Representatives. \nIt is a no-brainer. Let's use these savings from these taxpayer \ngiveaways to drive down the deficit, not drive up the profits of oil \ncompanies.\n  We need to make one thing very clear: Wasteful subsidies have nothing \nto do with gas prices. These oil handouts have existed for decades. \nPrices have continued to rise. Oil executives' paychecks have also \ncontinued to rise.\n  In the State of Alaska they are paying $8 or $9 a gallon for \ngasoline. In the State of California, there are places where you pay as \nmuch as $5 a gallon for gasoline. Here at an Exxon station along the \nwaterfront, I looked out the other day, and the gas prices there were \nwithin a few cents of being $5 a gallon. That is in our Nation's \nCapital. So that money Americans are paying at the pump is not related \nto those subsidies I have talked about, but those profits are proof \nenough they do not need them. The companies do not need those \nsubsidies. Even big oil CEOs, such as the head of Shell, and \nRepublicans in Congress--even my friend, the Speaker--have said on \noccasion these subsidies are not necessary.\n  Some of our conservative colleagues have a hard time stomaching \ngiving a hand to those who need it the most. But we should all agree--\nin the interest of fairness, common sense, and saving taxpayer money--\nthat we cannot continue with this corporate welfare to those big oil \ncompanies that need it the least. That is a good place to start.\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2817-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise in support of the comments made \nby the majority leader. I was in Chicago over the weekend, and \ndownstate as well in Illinois, and saw these gasoline prices and \nunderstand the hardship they cause. At a BP filling station in Chicago \nnear Lawrence and Lake Shore Drive, I ran into a man who is a plumber \nwho has a van and goes from job to job. He said it is not unusual now \nfor him to spend over $100 a week on gasoline. Of course, that is \ntaking away money he could have brought home for his family. It is a \nreal hardship on him.\n  He kind of smiled and chuckled and said: They do it to us every year, \ndon't they.\n  That is true, Madam President. Whether we are talking about the \nsituation in New Hampshire or Illinois, we can predict the rights of \nspring in America: the opening of the baseball season, Easter egg \nhunts, Seder dinners for Passover, and skyrocketing gasoline prices.\n  Then there are the excuses. There is always an excuse: Oh, we had to \nswitch from winter to summer. We didn't see that coming. Oh, there is a \nproblem in the Middle East. Whatever it is, any excuse will do, and the \ngasoline prices go up.\n  We can do something about it, and we should. The majority leader is \nright. We accept the challenge of Speaker John Boehner who said in New \nYork: Let's make a serious effort to deal with this deficit. Well, we \nhave a great downpayment: $21 billion we can take off the deficit. We \ncan take it away from a group that does not need it. We are talking \nabout the oil companies that are registering record profits--$36 \nbillion. If we decide to take away the subsidies that are now being \ngiven to these extremely profitable companies, it will save taxpayers \n$21 billion over 10 years.\n  Let's get started there. That ought to be the easy part because right \nnow we know what is going on. We are paying for these high gasoline \nprices three times: First, when we fill up our tanks. Oh, they hit us \nhard there--$60, $80, $100 just to fill up the tank. Second, because we \nare giving $4 billion a year in subsidies to the oil companies, \ntaxpayers are being hit again. It is not just what we pay at the gas \npump, it is what we pay on April 15. Part of that is going to the oil \ncompanies.\n  But there is a third hit. Do you know where we get the money to pay \nthe subsidies to the oil companies? We borrow it from China--the \nlargest creditor of the United States. We are borrowing 40 cents for \nevery $1 we spend. So out of the $4 billion we are talking about that \nis going annually to these oil companies, 40 percent of it--about $1.6 \nbillion--is being borrowed every single year from countries such as \nChina. So the third way we pay is, ultimately, on the debt to China and \nthe interest on that debt.\n  Can we afford that? At a time when Americans are sacrificing, can't \nwe ask the oil companies, with record profits, to sacrifice their \nFederal subsidies? That is all we are trying to do. I know Senator \nSchumer from New York is going to take the floor momentarily and talk \nabout this issue. We will have a bill on the Senate floor. For those \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who have given impassioned speeches \nabout reducing the deficit, here is their chance. It is a put-up-or-\nshut-up moment. If we believe in reducing the deficit, here is $21 \nbillion of low-hanging fruit. Let's pick it. Let's pick it for the \ntaxpayers. Let's take these savings and put it right on deficit \nreduction. I hope that is something on which both sides of the aisle \ncan agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2817-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2817-S2818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me say a word very quickly about the \nPresident's speech today in El Paso.\n  I have said on the Senate floor many times, because it is a source of \npride to me, I am a first generation American. One hundred years ago, \nmy mother was brought to this country as an infant, 2 years of age. My \ngrandmother brought her over from Lithuania, and they landed in \nBaltimore in 1911--100 years ago. How they made it--the four of them, \nat that point: my aunt, uncle, grandmother, and mother--how they made \nit from Baltimore to East St. Louis, IL, I do not have a clue because I \nam sure they did not speak but a handful of words in English.\n  They made it like other immigrants made it: because they were \ndetermined to come to this country. They were prepared to leave \neverything behind in their lives--their homes, their churches, their \nrelatives, their friends, their languages, their cultures--and come to \nthis great Nation and take the risk, the risk of opportunity. Think \nabout that story and multiply it millions of times, and that is the \nstory of America.\n  The people who hate immigration are turning their back on the heart \nand essence of this great Nation. We are an immigrant nation of people \nof extraordinary courage who picked up and moved and said: We are going \nto try our best in a new place with a new language. When most of them \narrived--I am sure it was the case with many who were on the boat with \nmy mom--there were folks standing on the shoreline saying: No, not more \nof those people. Don't we have enough of them? They don't speak our \nlanguage. They don't look like us. They don't dress like us. They eat \nfunny food. They hang out with one another. We don't need more of those \npeople.\n  For as long as immigrants have been coming to these shores, there \nhave been people standing on the shores saying: Please, pull up the \nladder. We don't need any more of those folks. But we do. We need them \nnot only because they work hard, we need them because they have a \nspirit and a determination which makes us a different nation.\n  The DNA each of us shares from those immigrant parents and \ngrandparents gives us a drive and a determination to make this a better \nnation. When we close the doors to immigration--orderly, legal \nimmigration--we are closing the doors of opportunity in this country.\n  The President will speak to immigration today. He has been a loyal \nfriend of mine for a long time. He was a cosponsor of the DREAM Act, \nwhich I introduced 10 years ago, and I would not be surprised if he \nbrought it up today in El Paso. He did last week in the White House. I \nknow he is committed, as I am, to make sure children who were brought \nto the United States as infants and youngsters, who had no voice in the \ndecision to come here, who have lived a good life here, worked hard and \nwent to school, said the Pledge of Allegiance every morning in the \nclassroom and know no other flag but the U.S. flag, children who want \nto become tomorrow's adults and tomorrow's leaders deserve a chance. \nThe DREAM Act will give them that chance. They can choose to enlist in \nour military and become citizens of the United States, or they can \nchoose to complete college, at least 2 years of it, and find a path to \ncitizenship. That is reasonable, it is compassionate, and it is fair. I \nhope as part of immigration reform we include it.\n  I plead with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Do not \nturn your back on America's heritage. Do not turn your back on fairness \nand compassion. Join us in real immigration reform. Join us in passing \nthe DREAM Act.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I commend my colleague and \nfriend from Illinois for his outstanding remarks on both subjects, the \ndeficit and on immigration. I am here to talk about the deficit, but I \nwill just touch on immigration.\n  People are saying, well, why is the President going to El Paso when \nwe\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\nhave not made enough progress on immigration? They bring up a point, \nbut the President's point is the right one. He is bringing the message \nto the country on why we need real immigration reform.\n  I think there is one point on which 100 Members of this Chamber would \nagree: our present immigration system is broken, badly broken. We turn \naway lots of people who should be here. We also do not have a rational \nsystem for who should come here, and America is the lesser for it. As \nthe Senator from Illinois pointed out, immigration is part of our proud \nheritage, and immigrants help America.\n  One of the reasons we are doing a lot better than Europe is we have \nwelcomed new people into this country, and we integrate them and say: \nAs quickly as you can, become Americans. We all came from somewhere \nelse originally.\n  Now, I am still very hopeful that as the President sets the table and \nlet's America know how important this is, we can get bipartisan \nimmigration reform done in this Chamber, on the floor of the Senate, \nand even over in the House. It is hard, no question, but I believe, \nfirst, to get comprehensive reform we need bipartisan support. That is \nobvious. But, secondly, that people see enough need to do it that we \ncan actually get it done, particularly if the President goes around the \ncountry, as he is beginning to do today in El Paso and as he has done \nin the past, and talks about the need for immigration reform, setting \nthe table so we can actually get something real done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2818-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now, let me speak to the issue I came here to speak \nabout, which is the deficit.\n  Speaker Boehner was in my hometown of New York City last night, and \nhe talked about how important it is to get a handle on this deficit. On \nthat issue, my colleagues on this side of the aisle and I certainly \nhave no problem. Neither does President Obama. The President has \nproposed $4 trillion in cuts--a huge amount of cutting, $4 trillion--to \nclose the deficit both on the spending side and the tax side. So anyone \nwho thinks one side wants to cut the deficit and the other does not has \nnot looked at the facts. But, obviously, we have to come together.\n  If each side sticks to its own position, nothing will happen. There \nshould be one obvious place where Speaker Boehner and his colleagues \ncan show some goodwill; that is, on these subsidies to big oil. No one \ncan defend them--no one. Oil companies are making record profits. Gas \nprices are at an all-time or close to an all-time high, and we, the \ntaxpayers, are continuing to subsidize the five big oil companies.\n  You could not write a more ridiculous scenario. Senator Menendez, \nalong with Senators Brown and McCaskill, later today will introduce \nlegislation that our side agrees with, which will say take all that \nmoney and put it to deficit reduction. There are some who would have \npreferred to put the money into encouraging independence from \nparticularly foreign oil. But because the deficit is such a huge \nproblem and because we might have a dispute with our friends on the \nother side as to where the money ought to go, everybody can agree it \nwould be worthwhile to take a little bit of the burden off of the \ntaxpayers, have the oil companies pay their fair share, and stop these \nridiculous tax breaks and subsidies to the five big oil companies.\n  So I ask Speaker Boehner to show some good faith. Some on his side \nhave already said these subsidies don't belong. They were created at a \ntime when oil was $17 a barrel, when we worried about production here. \nOil was hovering at just over $100 a barrel again yesterday. You don't \nhave to worry about their desire to explore. They are looking every \nplace they can. They don't have to have a subsidy to do it.\n  Some might argue: What about the small and middle-size companies? \nMany of us believe they too should not get the tax breaks. But this \nbill Senator Menendez will be introducing shortly doesn't even touch \nthem--just the five big oil companies and just the tax breaks they now \nget. Why not? It is a perfect way to start this debate and show some \ngood will.\n  Democrats have agreed to cuts--lots of cuts. People on the other side \nof the aisle can show some agreement on revenues. This area of \nrevenues, which almost nobody can dispute, should not be there. So the \ntime to repeal these giveaways is now. We would most prefer to do it in \na bipartisan way. Speaker Boehner, and those on his side of the aisle, \ncan show some good faith that they are not dug in and saying that only \nmy way will lead to the kind of scenario that many tremble at, which is \nthe debt ceiling not being approved.\n  We on this side of the aisle don't believe that should happen. Many \non the other side have said they don't. The first good step that could \nbe taken on the other side to show little give is to eliminate these \nbig tax subsidies to big oil. I urge my colleagues to support it. I \nurge Speaker Boehner to pivot on his speech from yesterday and support \nthis proposal. It would create a great deal of good will and put us in \nthe direction of reducing the deficit that we all so much want to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2818-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2818-S2820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it has been called to my attention that \nthere are some people who are trying to respond to the fact that we \nhave such high prices of gasoline at the pumps in a totally unrealistic \nway, in a way that is class warfare, in a way that doesn't make any \nsense to anyone, when we have a solution to this problem we have been \ntalking about for a long period of time.\n  There are some who are trying to say we are going to have to do \nsomething about the subsidies that are given to oil companies, about \nwhat they have been doing over the years, and all of a sudden they are \nthe ones who are responsible for the high price of gas at the pumps.\n  A CRS report was requested by my colleague, Lisa Murkowski, that grew \nout of frustration with the Democrats' refrain that ``America has only \n3 percent of the global oil reserves.'' Therefore, under this view, \nmore drilling and production at home is futile. As President Obama has \nsaid many times, ``with 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, the U.S. \ncannot drill its way to energy security.''\n  Well, it can, because it is not 3 percent. A CRS report came out \nlater and showed--and this is something people don't want to believe, \nbut it is out there and it is a fact--the United States of America has \nthe largest recoverable reserves of oil, gas, and coal of any country \nin the world--more than China, Saudi Arabia, or anyone else. Our \nproblem is a political one--this administration. It goes down \nDemocratic and Republican lines. The Democrats put 83 percent of \nAmerica's Federal lands off limits to drilling. Of course, that is fine \nfor the administration, because they have made some statements, which I \nwill read in a minute, to demonstrate clearly that they want to \nincrease the price of gas at the pumps.\n  On the idea that you can do this through regulation and through \ntrying to further tax the oil industry, CRS stated that tax changes \noutlined in the President's budget proposal--I am quoting from CRS, \nwhich everyone knows is completely nonpartisan--``would make oil and \nnatural gas more expensive for U.S. consumers and likely increase \nforeign dependence.''\n  I was very proud of a couple of Democrats--the only two who were \noutspoken. Senator Landrieu, from Louisiana, said:\n\n       The administration has put forward draconian taxes on the \n     oil and gas industry. . . . It seems very contrary to our \n     stated goal of being more energy sufficient in the United \n     States. Taxing this domestic industry will instead cut jobs \n     and increase our dependence on foreign oil. So I want you to \n     deliver that message again to the administration. We have \n     bipartisan opposition to increasing taxes on this industry.\n\n  Senator Mark Begich from Alaska said:\n\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\n\n       [The President's proposal] would cost thousands of jobs in \n     Alaska and across the country. Energy companies are among the \n     businesses investing and creating jobs at a time when our \n     country needs both. I will fight any measure to end these \n     incentives.\n\n  It should be obvious that without these two Democrats coming in--I \nappreciate the fact they did. We are not going to be able to reduce the \nprice of oil at the pumps by further taxing the oil and gas industry. \nIt is ludicrous to even think that anyone would suggest we could \nincrease taxes on the oil industry and gas industry and somehow we are \ngoing to have energy more available and are going to reduce the cost of \ngas at the pump.\n  There is a way of doing this that I think is so simple. There is not \na person in this country--certainly no one who serves in this body--\nwho, back during his or her elementary education, did not learn about \nsupply and demand. Here we are in the United States of America sitting \non more gas and oil than any other country in the world, and we are the \nonly country that does not exploit its own natural resources. We are \nthe only country. If we did, we would be completely independent from \nthe Middle East. We would not have to go outside this continent to \nsupply our needs.\n  People say: If you do that, you start developing. Then it is going to \ntake a long time. It is going to be maybe 8 or 10 years. That would be \nfine. They were saying that 8 or 10 years ago, and we could have done \nit then. That is not quite true because the economists have said that \nif we announce we are going to areas where we are not exploiting our \nresources--I am talking about the gulf, the east coast, the west coast, \nthe North Slope in ANWR, Alaska. I am talking about the public lands \nwhere 83 percent of our public lands are off limits for drilling. If we \nwere to announce today that we were going to open drilling and \nexploration and production in the United States of America, that price \nwould drop tomorrow. It would drop immediately because people would \nknow we are going to use our own resources.\n  I hate to say this, but somebody has to say it. We have an \nadministration that is so wrapped up in saying that one of these days, \nwe are going to have to have all this green energy, and they themselves \nare on record saying they want to increase the price of oil and gas.\n  Let's look at what happened.\n  Alan Krueger with the Department of Treasury said:\n\n       The administration believes that it is no longer sufficient \n     to address our nation's energy needs by finding more fossil \n     fuels.\n\n  The Obama Treasury Department said:\n\n       To the extent the lower tax rate encourages overproduction \n     of oil and gas, it is detrimental to long-term energy \n     security.\n\n  Therefore, we want to do away with oil and gas.\n  Here is the best one. President Obama's Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, \nsaid:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  We have an administration that wants to increase the price of \ngasoline at the pumps to be comparable to Europe, which is between \n$7.50 and $8 a gallon. Obviously, people know this is true. It was not \nlong ago that President Obama gave his energy speech. In his energy \nspeech, he said there is all this abundance of clean gas we can use. \nThen at the end of the speech he said: But we have some problems in \ngetting the gas out of the ground. He is talking about natural gas in \nthis case, not about oil. I happened to give a response on one of the \nTV stations. He said he wants natural gas. At the same time, he says he \nwants to end hydraulic fracturing.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic \nfracturing started in the State of Oklahoma, my State, in 1948. It is a \nway of pumping fluids and water primarily into these tight formations. \nThese tight formations mostly are down about 1 mile to 2 to 3 miles \nunder the surface. That will allow them to go in and get the gas. We \nhave enough natural gas to take care of our needs for the next 100 \nyears; we just need to use these systems. If we do away with hydraulic \nfracturing, then that means we are not going to be able to get any of \nthe natural gas. We cannot produce 1 cubic foot of natural gas without \nusing hydraulic fracturing. What did we find out last week? Secretary \nChu is going to be in charge of a study to see how dangerous hydraulic \nfracturing is. This is the same guy who said that somehow we have to \nfigure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n  I will only say this. We actually have three problems. We have the \nproblem of, we have this abundance of resources we are not going after, \nand hydraulic fracturing. Then keep in mind that what we get, we have \nto refine. That is where the EPA comes in.\n  I have stood at this podium for 9 years talking about the problems we \nhave with cap and trade, the fact that we can't have a cap-and-trade \nsystem that is going to have the effect of costing the American \npeople--the estimates are between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. \nThat is supposedly for greenhouse gases.\n  We had the Kyoto treaty back in the nineties, and then they tried \nseven different times on the Senate floor to pass legislation that \nwould have the same type of cap and trade we would have had if we had \nbecome a party to and ratified the Kyoto treaty. The problem with that \nis, even if there are people out there--and there are. A very large \npercentage of the people in America, some 40 percent, believe that \nsomehow greenhouse gases are causing catastrophic global warming. Even \nif that were true, which it is not, but if it were true, it does not \nmake any difference what we do in the United States of America.\n  I admire the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, \nLisa Jackson, who was appointed by President Obama. Yes, she is way off \nin the leftwing. She is liberal and all of that. When you ask her a \ndirect question, she gives an honest answer. She gave honest answers. I \nasked a question--I think at that time it was the Markey bill. It was \none of the cap-and-trade bills. I said: In the event we were to pass a \ncap-and-trade bill in the United States, would that reduce emissions? \nHer response was, no, it will not, because that would only affect the \nUnited States of America.\n  That is not where the problem is. The problem is in India, Mexico, \nand China. Right now, China is cranking out two coal-fired generating \nplants every week. It is going to continue there. In fact, one could \nargue that it would even be more expensive or more polluting--if one \ncalls CO2 a pollution--because our jobs would go to places \nsuch as China where they do have this problem. They do not have any \nemissions control.\n  We have the problem of refining the gas once we get it. I see my good \nfriend is on the floor and is going to be speaking perhaps to the same \nissue. I only want to mention one thing. With regard to the cap-and-\ntrade agenda, since they are not able to get it passed, they are trying \nto do it through the Environmental Protection Agency through \nregulations.\n  Lion Oil, based in El Dorado, AR, recently testified before the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee that it commenced a $2 million expansion \nof its El Dorado refinery in 2007, with 2,000 construction jobs, but \nits completion has since been stalled. As Lion Oil vice president Steve \nCousins explained:\n\n       The uncertainty and the potentiality of prohibitive costs \n     associated with possible cap-and-trade legislation and EPA's \n     greenhouse gas regulations were a critical factor leading us \n     to delay the completion of the expansion.\n\n  What I am saying is, if we are--and I believe we are--going to break \ndown this barrier and overcome this mentality that we should not be \ndeveloping our own resources, then we also have to have a way of \nrefining it. We can do it. It is within our reach. We can bring down \nthe price of oil and gas and certainly gasoline at the pump by \ntomorrow. If we were to announce we were going to stop being the only \ncountry in the world that does not exploit its own resources, if we go \nafter the oil and gas that is available in the gulf, the east coast, \nwest coast, our public lands, as well as the North Slope of Alaska, we \ncould be independent from any dependency on the Middle East. I believe \nthe American people understand that point. It goes right back to our \nelementary school education. It is supply and demand. We have the \nsupply in the United States of America. We have to open up that supply \nso we can use it, and obviously that would lower the price of gas at \nthe pumps.\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I am \npleased to be back on that committee with him. I share very much the \nsubstance of his views about the need to produce more oil and gas. It \nkeeps money in the United States, creates jobs in the United States, \nand creates tax revenues for the United States. Offshore oil and gas in \nour gulf produces billions of dollars for States and the Federal \nGovernment.

Madam President, I wish to make a few remarks about the \nbudget circumstances in which we find ourselves.\n  Yesterday, we learned that the President has scheduled two summit \nmeetings on the budget this week. The President will meet with Senate \nDemocrats on Wednesday and Republicans on Thursday. By calling this \nsummit, it would seem the President has effectively canceled this \nweek's planned unveiling of a Democratic Senate budget in the Senate \nBudget Committee that was planned earlier. First it was going to be \nMonday, then Tuesday, then Wednesday. It looks as if maybe it will not \nbe held this week at all. It might be that Senator Conrad could do \nthat, but somehow, with this event occurring, he may not.\n  Regardless of this new discussion period, it is my expectation and \nbelief that the American people should be given a Senate budget plan so \nit can be examined and we can know what is in it and see what it is \nabout. The American public deserves to know where our elected leaders \nstand.\n  I hate to say that we have gone 700-plus days without a budget for \nthe United States of America during a time of the greatest debt \nincrease we have ever faced. We will have doubled the debt of the \nUnited States, I believe, by next year in 4 years. We will add $13 \ntrillion to the debt over the 10 years presented by President Obama's \nbudget that he sent to us in February.\n  There have been all kinds of discussions and talks and a lot of \nspeeches. The President created a fiscal commission. They came forward \nwith a serious proposal that was worthy of real insight and study. They \nspent a lot of time on it. It did not go far enough, in my opinion, to \nreduce our surging growth in spending, but it was intellectually \nhonest, and it offered us some very real suggestions about how we could \ndo better.\n  Then we started hearing that after the President's budget was \nsubmitted and it was received very badly--in fact, it was not helpful \nat all but actually made the debt trajectory we are on worse. We had a \ngang of six Senators who tried to work together to establish a budget \nplan that might work for us. They met in secret and had ideas. I was \ninterested in what they had to say, but somehow that seems to have gone \non the back burner.\n  Then we had Vice President Biden. He is going to lead a discussion \nwith House and Senate Republicans and Democrats, and he is going to \nwork out something.\n  Now, just yesterday, we heard that the President is going to have \nanother meeting at the White House and talk to us. I hope it is not \nlike the one to which he invited the House Budget Committee chairman, \nPaul Ryan, and criticized him, sitting right there in front of him, for \nproducing what I think is a historic budget that would put us on a \nsound path if followed.\n  Here we are. We have not gotten a plan or a commitment as to what \nthis administration intends to advocate for. They submitted their \nbudget. It was alleged to have reduced the deficit by $2 trillion, but \nwhen the Congressional Budget Office, our objective analyst, took the \ndocument they submitted and studied it in detail, they concluded it \nwould add $2.7 trillion. In other words, it would create more debt over \nthe next 10 years by $2.7 trillion than was projected to accrue without \nthe budget. That is not what financial experts are telling us, that is \nnot what economists and professors are telling us we need to do. It is \nunacceptable.\n\n  That budget was criticized, and we hadn't heard much about it since. \nWell, the President, for a week or so, tried to propose that it would \nhave us live within our means and help pay down the debt. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the lowest deficit in 10 years would \nbe over $700 billion, and the President said this was going to have us \nliving within our means? Apparently, desiring to back off that, the \nPresident made a speech and he said he is now going to save $4 \ntrillion.\n  Well, the budget staff--I am ranking Republican on the Budget \nCommittee--looked at what he said in the speech and noticed a couple of \nthings. We noticed the President had moved the budget period from 10 \nyears to 12 years, and that made the numbers look a lot better compared \nto a 10-year savings plan. If we save a little each year and we go 12 \nyears, it looks better than 10, when everybody was talking about 10. It \nis kind of a little gimmick, you see, to make the numbers look better. \nThen they incorrectly took credit for every dollar that was saved when \nthe Republicans in the House negotiated with the Senate on the CR and \nreduced spending about $75 billion a year below what the President had \nasked for. They took credit for that. That was about $800 billion of \nthe savings.\n  The net result is, it was not any different than the budget plan he \nhad proposed, except it took credit for the House reduction in \nspending.\n  I have to say, the House Republicans--Paul Ryan--stood and faced the \nAmerican people and revealed in advance the core of their plan. I \nattended one press conference in which Paul Ryan announced the budget \nhe was moving forward with. He had a series of press briefings. He \nbasically said: This is my plan and I am ready to hear any exceptions \nyou have to it, I am prepared to answer your questions, and I am \nprepared to defend what it is we have done. It was an honest, direct, \nand responsible approach.\n  The Ryan budget dealt with the long-term financial threats to America \nas well as the immediate. The numbers he proposed get us to the point \nwhere we can certainly say we are not on the same debt trajectory that \nput us in such great risk. I believe it is probably the most serious \neffort I have seen, in the 14 years I have been in the Senate, to \naddress the significant fiscal challenges we face.\n  We face not only a short-term problem, but we face a long-term, \nsystemic problem. We have an aging population--people drawing more \nSocial Security for longer periods and Medicare for longer periods. We \nhave other entitlement programs. We have been spending extraordinarily. \nSo all that has to be a part of our discussion about how to put this \ncountry on a sound path. Senator Conrad, our Democratic chairman, has \ndone a good job in calling good witnesses. Every expert who has \ntestified before the Budget Committee has told us the truth about the \ngrim circumstances we find ourselves in. They have told us: If you \ndon't act, we could have a debt crisis. They have told us the debt we \nhave already accrued, and which continues to increase, is right now \npulling down our economy; that our growth is not what it would be had \nwe not incurred this much debt.\n  It is uncontroversial that this much debt slows down the economy. \nWhen I asked Treasury Secretary Geithner, he agreed with the Rogoff-\nReinhart study that says when debt reaches 90 percent of GDP it pulls \ndown economic growth 1 percent. Secretary Geithner said: Yes, that is \nan excellent study, and I would add one more thing. He said: When we \nget that much debt, we run the risk of having a debt crisis that could \nthrow us back into some sort of recession or financial problem such as \nwe have had. That was President Obama's Secretary of the Treasury. We \nknow we have a serious problem. We need to do something about it.\n  The President submitted a budget that has basically been rejected. I \ncan't imagine the Senate would bring it forward as the Senate \nDemocratic budget. The House of Representatives, in accordance with the \nlaw and the timeframes of the Budget Act, has produced a budget, showed \nit publicly before they voted on it, and has defended it since. We \nhaven't had one in the Senate. The Senate, by law, should have produced \nits budget and started its markup 6 weeks ago. The law says we\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\nare supposed to have passed a budget by April 15--tax day. We haven't \neven begun to mark it up.\n  People are attempting, politically, to explain. The Democratic \nspinmasters are attempting to explain what it is all about. Why are we \ndoing these things? Why hasn't a real budget been produced? They say \nRepublicans are divided. They say: Oh, tea party people and Republicans \nare all divided. The Republican House has passed a budget. Where is the \nDemocratic Senate? Who is divided? Why can't they produce a document? \nWhy do we have to have the Vice President and the President having \nmeetings and the President giving speeches? Why don't we see a real \nbudget that the American people can see in advance and be able to \nevaluate and Senators standing, as we are paid to do, and casting votes \nfor or against it? That is what we need to be doing.\n  I don't agree with the fact that the President is leading. I wish I \ncould say that. Maybe he will surprise us on Thursday with something. I \nhope so. But I don't sense any leadership at all, because the budget he \nproduced will not do the job. That is the only one we have in the \nSenate at this point. Indeed, Mr. Erskine Bowles, the man the President \nchose to head his fiscal commission, said the President's budget came \nnowhere near doing what is necessary. Actually, what he said was the \nPresident's budget goes nowhere near where they will have to go to \nresolve our fiscal nightmare.\n  I am wondering what is happening. The American people get it. They \nsent a message in the elections last November. They sent 64 new Members \nto the House of Representatives, and every single one of them promised \nto do something about reckless spending in Washington.\n  What about this budget the President has submitted to us? It is the \nonly one we have in the Senate. The Senate Democratic leadership hasn't \npresented one. The President's budget called for a 10.5-percent \nincrease in education, a 9.5-percent increase in energy, a 10.5-percent \nin the State Department's budget, and a 62-percent increase in the \ntransportation budget. Well, we don't have the money. Forty cents of \nevery $1 we spend is borrowed. That cannot be continued. We are on an \nunsustainable path. The American people know it. Every expert has told \nus. We know it. Where are our leaders in the Senate?\n  Senator Conrad, apparently, made a presentation of his budget, and \nthe Republicans have asked Senator Conrad to present it to us 72 hours \nbefore the committee meets. He said he is not going to do that. He made \na presentation to the Democratic conference and, apparently, it didn't \ngo well. Senator Conrad apparently proposed reducing spending more than \nthey liked to hear. The Democratic leader, Senator Reid, was sort of \ncritical, actually. He said it was a nice bunch of charts. Obviously, \nhe wasn't happy.\n  When are we going to see a budget? Are we going to go another 700 \ndays? Are we not going to have a budget this year? The way things \nshould work is like this: The Senate should come forward--the \nDemocratic Senate, because they have the majority and we can pass a \nbudget with a simple majority--and propose a budget that hopefully will \nget bipartisan support. If not, they stand and say what they believe in \nand how this budget reflects their vision for America. The House has \ndone that. Then we go to conference committee. After it comes to the \nfloor and is voted on, it goes to the conference committee and \ndifferences are worked out. Then it comes back and we have to vote on \nfinal passage of an agreed-upon budget.\n  We have to have a budget. It is time for this country to begin to \nreverse the reckless trend we are on because we are placing our Nation \nat risk. Mr. Bowles and Senator Alan Simpson, when they testified \nbefore the Budget Committee, warned us we have to do something \nsignificant. In the written statement they both signed, they said we \nare facing the most predictable economic crisis in our history. When \nasked when that could occur, Mr. Bowles said 2 years, maybe. Alan \nSimpson said: I think maybe 1. We are not talking about our \ngrandchildren. I am talking about now.\n  What I would just say is, I think it is time for us to go back to \nregular order. We have tried a lot of different approaches to confront \nthis crisis we face. It seems to me our leadership in the Senate is \ndesperately seeking to avoid having to do what is responsible; that is, \nto stand and produce a budget. If they aren't prepared to stand before \nthe American people and tell them how they think the country ought to \nbe run and where the money ought to be spent and how much ought to be \ncollected, then they are not leading, it seems to me.\n  I am very disappointed in the President's leadership. He has been \nroundly criticized because the only proposal he has sent to us is \nirresponsible. It in no way comes close, as Mr. Bowles said, to doing \nwhat is necessary to avoid our fiscal nightmare, and that is the path \nwe are headed toward. It is not a matter of dispute. We will not reach \n10, 15 years down the road spending like we are because we will have a \ncatastrophe before then.\n  Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, said he \nthought maybe some sort of compromise would be reached that would be \ngood for the country. The only question, he said, was whether it would \nbe before or after a debt crisis occurs. This was a few weeks ago that \nAlan Greenspan was saying this.\n  It is a challenge for us and a challenge for the leadership in this \nSenate to come before the American people and produce their plan and \nseek support on the floor of the Senate. Let's debate it. Let's have \namendments offered. Let's go to conference, and somehow, some way \nhammer out a budget that will put this country on a better path. We \nhave no other choice. It is the defining moment for this Congress. We \nhave no higher duty than to confront the dangerous fiscal path we are \non.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2821-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I will speak in morning business for 10 \nminutes or less. Let me talk about a couple things this morning. First, \nI wish to talk about something my State has been going through since \nmid-March and has continued to the present day. We have been battered \nby tornadoes and high winds and now flooding. We see this in a photo \nthat was taken a few days ago, late last week, of one of the areas in \nour State underwater. We have had many towns that have been evacuated, \nmany counties have been declared disaster areas. In fact, the Corps of \nEngineers showed me a map on Friday when I met with them. They have a \nmap that is a large overview that starts down near Dallas, TX, pretty \nmuch through all the State of Arkansas, then a little bit of Missouri \nand Tennessee and Illinois and even, I think, a little bit into \nKentucky.\n  The folks in those areas in that oval have received six times the \nnormal rainfall. When we have six times the normal rainfall, this is \nwhat we get. This is a photo where we can see the water is in the house \nand up on the front porch. These folks are underwater, similar to a lot \nof people in our State.\n  I will say this. The Governor of our State is doing all any Governor \ncan do. He is doing a great job. Even though we have Interstate 40 \nunderwater right now in one area where the White River goes under \nInterstate 40, they are trying very hard to get that open, maybe even \ntoday if the water will cooperate. We are seeing a lot of emergency \nresponse in our State, seeing neighbor helping neighbor, churches are \nrolling out, we have seen folks doing everything they can to make this \nwork.\n  Also, I thank the Corps of Engineers. It is easy for us to beat up on \nthe Corps\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\nof Engineers sometimes, but the truth is probably 95 or more percent of \nthe time they do things right. They do things the right way. If it \nweren't for the Corps of Engineers, a lot of east Arkansas would be \nunderwater and maybe a lot more. The system they designed and built has \nworked. Even though this is a 100-year flood or even worse, it is \nworking and it is saving billions of dollars in damages and hardship. I \nthank the Corps and I also thank FEMA. FEMA has been on the ground in \nArkansas for 3 or 4 weeks now, probably, with different teams going \naround the State helping in different ways and they have been very \nhelpful.\n  I wish to go to my second topic, and I wish to emphasize what we are \nseeing happening in the State right now is not impacted by what I am \nabout to talk about. But I think this FEMA administration is still \ncleaning up some of the mess from the previous FEMA administration. A \nfew years ago, we had another series of floods in our State. Now we are \nseeing FEMA trying to recoup that money against people in our State. \nLet me give a little background.\n  Three years ago, in an area around Mountain View, AR, the White River \nflooded. FEMA came and they actually went to a woman's house--I wish to \ntalk about her and her husband. They went to this couple's house. They \nare on Social Security. They retired. FEMA assured them they would be \neligible for assistance. FEMA took pictures. They verified the damage. \nThey gave them the paperwork--even kind of coaxed them through some of \nthe paperwork. They assured them repeatedly that they would qualify for \nsome assistance from FEMA.\n  They did end up getting $27,000 for home repairs and that is exactly \nwhat they spent it for. They played by the rules. They filled out all \nthe paperwork. FEMA was physically on their premises. They got the \ncheck, plowed it right back into the house, exactly like they said they \nwould, and it helped them stay in their house.\n  Fast forward 3 years. We see FEMA writes them a letter, what I would \ncall a demand letter, where they are requesting that they repay all \nthis money, that they have 30 days to repay the balance of the debt \nthey owe FEMA. This, of course, is a big shock to them because they \nwere assured, repeatedly, that they had a legitimate claim. FEMA \nencouraged them to file this claim, they got the money, and they \nthought everything was great.\n  What has happened is, this couple, similar to many others in our \nState, built their home down on the river. They knew it could possibly \nflood one day. When they built it, they bought flood insurance. After \nyears of paying the flood insurance, it never flooded. But after years \nof paying the flood insurance, the flood insurance company said they \nwould not cover flood insurance anymore. They actually went to Lloyd's \nof London and paid for that for a number of years. Eventually, Lloyd's \nof London said: We are not doing flood insurance anymore. They \ndesperately tried to find flood insurance and could never find it.\n  FEMA has a rule that in order for anyone to get flood insurance \nthrough the National Flood Insurance Program, the county or the city \nhas to pass an ordinance. That is necessary in order for them, the \npeople in the community, to get flood insurance. FEMA knew this \nparticular county, Stone County, had not passed this ordnance. \nNonetheless, they assured this couple, repeatedly, they were entitled \nto this money. So in a very real sense, these people and many others in \nour State are twice the victim. They are the victim of the storm and \nthe flood, but then they are a victim of their government because their \nown government has injured them by the way they have handled all this--\ngiving out the money and then demanding recoupment for the money 3 \nyears after the fact, when they get the notice of debt.\n  FEMA, by the way, did not just send it out to this one couple; they \nsent it out to 35 families around the State. Three years later, when \nthey get this notice of debt, they have no means to pay it back. These \nfolks are on Social Security. In fact, they would not have qualified \nfor the payment had they had substantial resources. So one of the \nironies is, what we are doing is we are telling the poorer people they \nneed to pay FEMA back. The poorer folks owe FEMA the most money. That \nis the way the program works.\n  I think if we had Director Fugate, who again I think is doing a good \njob running FEMA--if we had him here today, I don't know exactly what \nhe would say about the situation, but I think he would say the statute \nties his hands, and he doesn't have much flexibility under the statute. \nWhether he agrees with the hardship of the situation or the equity of \nthe situation, he doesn't have a lot of leeway in trying to deal with \nthis. I am offering a solution. I am offering it in the Homeland \nSecurity Committee this week. I hope Members of the Senate will look at \nmy legislation. It is only four pages long. We are asking Congress to \ngive FEMA some flexibility when it comes to the recoupment process and \nto allow leniency for some individuals under certain circumstances. I \nthink our couple in Arkansas fits those circumstances exactly. \nBasically, they have played by the rules, they have done all they can \ndo and they continue to play by the rules and do all they can do.\n  I filed a bill that is going to be in the Homeland Security Committee \nthis week. I would love to have my colleagues look at it and support \nit, if they see fit. It does three things. No. 1, it says FEMA may \nwaive a debt owed to the United States in cases where funds were \ndistributed purely by FEMA error, which is the case here, because FEMA \nknew this particular county had not passed this ordinance. FEMA knew no \none in this county was entitled to any assistance under this particular \nprovision of the disaster relief law because the county had not passed \nthe ordinance. FEMA knew that for the entire county. In fact, they have \na list of every county--every ZIP Code in the country where people do \nnot qualify. This woman of the couple from Arkansas was very clear \nabout her location as she went through this process.\n  FEMA, whether they admit it--we can produce the documentation--FEMA \nwas clearly in error in giving out this check, in assuring her she was \nentitled to it, and assisting her through this process. They were \nclearly in error. I think it is a case of the left hand not knowing \nwhat the right hand is doing.\n  Again, I think this FEMA administration has cleaned up this problem. \nMy guess is we will not see this type of problem in the future, \nespecially not out of this FEMA administration.\n  The second thing it does is it says they have to waive a debt owed to \nthe United States in cases where the rationale for recoupment was \nfailure to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. Again, \nwhat this will do is acknowledge that FEMA made some mistakes 3 years \nago. It is kind of competence 101 that they would know which counties \nand which residents would be entitled to this particular relief, but \nsomehow, some way, they dropped the ball. This would make it very \nclear, from 2005 to 2010--again, this is the limited duration of this \nbill, this is a relief bill to help a specific group of people--that \nbecause of FEMA's mistake and because the folks here could not \nparticipate in the flood insurance program, no matter how much they \nwanted to--and this particular couple did want to participate in the \nFEMA flood insurance program, they could not do it--this would \nbasically say we cannot now punish them and come back on them for that \nmoney.\n  The third thing it does, it makes clear that Congress is not giving \nany waivers in cases of fraud or misrepresentation or false claims or \nanything of that nature. This is purely for mistakes and errors made by \nthe Federal Government when the Federal Government is trying to come \nback in and recoup moneys they wrongly paid.\n  Let me run through a couple other things, and I will be glad to yield \nthe floor in just a few minutes. These communities that have not passed \nthis ordinance and, therefore, are not entitled to participate in the \nflood insurance program, they are called sanctioned communities. That \nis what FEMA calls them. They are called sanctioned communities. There \nwas a lawsuit a few years ago that basically challenged FEMA's ability \nto do certain things. It is too long and involved to talk about, but \nthe court found there are 168,000 cases. Mostly these go back to the \nhurricanes of Katrina, Rita, et cetera--the biggest bulk of them. Of \nthe 168,000 cases that FEMA has to revisit and\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nmaybe recoup some money from people, so far they have only done 5,000 \nof these cases. Out of the 5,000 cases they have reviewed, only 18 \ncases, 18 total out of 5,000--out of 5,500 cases--would be impacted by \nmy bill.\n  So we are talking a very small percentage. We are talking three-\ntenths of 1 percent is what we are talking about here. This is a very \ntiny, very narrow exception. I am for recoupment as much as anybody. I \nthink it is very important that the government do it right and do it \nright the first time. If there is some sort of fraud or some sort of \nmisrepresentation, then the government absolutely should go after that \nmoney and try to recoup as much of that as possible.\n  What we are talking about here is in 99.7 percent of the cases they \ncan pursue recoupment. But based on the numbers we have today, it is \nthree-tenths of 1 percent of the time where the mistake is completely \non FEMA's side of the equation, and we would say no, as a matter of \nfairness and as a matter of equity, then they cannot seek recoupment in \nthese cases.\n  To me this is a matter of equity. This is a situation where this \nparticular couple in Arkansas--and we have other couples, we have other \nfamilies too--we know of a total of four in our State who fall into \nthis category. So we only have four out of how ever many thousands have \nreceived FEMA payments over the years. But nonetheless, this is a \nmatter of equity because if you look at this couple I am talking about \nhere in Arkansas near Mountain View, they basically would never have \ndone this. They would have made other arrangements 3 years ago.\n  I do not know if they would have gone to the bank. I do not know if \nthey would have gotten a second mortgage. I do not know if they would \nhave sold the property and moved out. I do not know. They do not want \nto think about it. Because this FEMA check actually allowed them to \nstay in their house.\n  Now they are coming back in a worse condition than they were before \nbecause FEMA says, you have 30 days to pay this back. The fact they \nhave not paid it back yet and that they filed an appeal with FEMA to \ntry to work this process to get some relief, which FEMA, apparently, \nvery seldom if ever grants--the fact that they filed this paperwork \nmeans that they have a little extension on the principle load. But it \nis very clear from the correspondence from FEMA that now interest is \naccruing. So interest is accruing on these folks.\n  Again, I think they are in a worse situation today than they would \nbeen had FEMA said no 3 years ago as they should have done. To me this \nis a matter of equity. I think if we were in a court, you might use the \nword estoppel. I think the Federal Government should be estopped in \nthis situation from pursuing this money, because there was detrimental \nreliance on the part of the family.\n  They did not ask for this. FEMA showed up at their house. FEMA took \npictures. FEMA helped them fill out the paperwork. FEMA walked them \nthrough the process. They do exactly what they are supposed to do. They \nput it in the house. It saves their house and gives them the ability to \nstay there. And now 3 years later, they get a letter basically saying, \nnotice of debt, you owe FEMA $27,000. Well, you can imagine, this is \ndevastating for a family on Social Security who has very few other \nmeans. Again, if they qualified for this in the first place, you know \nthey are not high-income folks. And $27,000 at this stage of life for \nthem is a lot of money. It is a mountain that is too tall to climb.\n  What I would love for my colleagues to do is look at what we are \ngoing to offer in the committee. I hope you can support it. We will be \nglad to answer any questions if any of my colleagues want to talk about \nit today or in the hallways here in the Senate over the next couple of \ndays as we are working through this.\n  I certainly want to thank Senator Lieberman for allowing us to put it \non the markup. I think folks around here rightly are in a recoupment \nmode. They want to recoup money that has been wrongly paid out. And, \nagain, I am for that 100 percent. In fact, we had a hearing in one of \nthe Homeland Security subcommittees the other day about recoupment. We \nhave talked about this. This is very important that we stop the \nbleeding and the government not pay out more money than they should. \nBut in this particular case, I think the principle of equity and \nfairness is certainly on the side of these folks who again, as I said, \nare twice the victims. They were first victimized by the storm, and \nsecond they are victimized by their own government.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced two bills on a \nsubject of great importance--two different subjects--related to our \nnational energy policy. The two bills were the Oil and Gas Facilitation \nAct of 2011. The second was the Outer Continental Shelf Reform Act of \n2011.\n  Both of these bills are based on bipartisan, largely consensus work, \nthat was done in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during \nthe last Congress. I should note that these important issues are being \naddressed in separate bills very consciously and for a reason. In the \npast we have crafted comprehensive energy bills that attempted to \naddress all of the energy policy issues of the day in a single piece of \nlegislation. There are obvious advantages to that. But there are well-\ndocumented disadvantages as well. I wish to avoid those disadvantages \nthis year in furtherance of completing our important work.\n  There is no disagreement in the Senate about the need to have robust \nand responsible domestic production of oil and gas. At the same time, \nthere is probably considerable disagreement about how best to address \nthat issue. We need to begin work on that. However, ensuring the safety \nand viability of our operations on the Outer Continental Shelf is a \nseparate matter which deserves attention on its own. The question of \nhow we undertake oil and gas exploration and production on the Outer \nContinental Shelf appropriately, in my view, stands apart from the \nquestion of where we undertake those activities.\n\n  I do not believe it would make sense to try to trade off safety or \nenvironmental protections against the issue of access, for example. I \nbelieve the Congress should set an appropriate level of safety and \nenvironmental compliance, regardless of where the oil and gas \nexploration and production is occurring.\n  I will also observe that there was much greater consensus on the need \nto reform the rules governing Outer Continental Shelf production in the \nlast Congress than on other issues such as those related to access to \nparticular areas. So conflating these separate issues in the one bill \nis not likely to be the best path to success in enacting a bill into \npublic law. Accordingly, we have introduced two bills.\n  That is not to say we don't have a responsibility to address both \nissues. We do. I believe they should be addressed on parallel tracks \nand not in combination. I hope to be able to move forward in the \ncommittee with consideration of both of these bills later this month.\n  The first of the bills, the Oil and Gas Facilitation Act, is intended \nto enhance sufficient and appropriate domestic production of oil and \ngas and to limit the dependence of the United States on foreign sources \nof oil.\n  The last 2 years have been a time of real success in increasing our \ndomestic production of both oil and gas and in reducing our reliance on \nimported oil. We are currently the third largest producer of oil in the \nworld. The percentage of the oil we use that is imported has declined \nfrom 60 percent in 2008 to about 51.5 percent in 2009 and to about 49 \npercent in 2010. We want to be sure we continue this progress while \nprotecting our other natural resources and our communities' health and \nsafety.\n  This bill, the Oil and Gas Facilitation Act, addresses production \nissues in\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\na variety of ways. It requires a comprehensive inventory of the oil and \nnatural gas under the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf to inform \ndecisions about where leasing is likely to be most productive. To \nimprove the efficiency of the permitting process for development on \nFederal lands and waters, permit coordination offices are reauthorized, \nand a new coordination office is established for the Alaska region of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Two provisions facilitate the transportation of Alaska's abundant oil \nand gas resources. The amount of Federal guarantee instruments is \nincreased to support the construction of an Alaska natural gas pipeline \nand the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline system is exempted from certain \nrequirements that unnecessarily slow the permitting process.\n  Coproduction of geothermal energy by existing oil and gas \nleaseholders is encouraged by making leases available for that purpose \non a noncompetitive basis.\n  Finally, the bill will potentially contribute millions to the Federal \nTreasury by repealing the current law that requires the Secretary of \nthe Interior to give relief from royalty payments to certain offshore \noil and gas production. This bill would allow the Secretary to provide \nsuch relief in appropriate circumstances, but it would not require such \nrelief. This avoids inappropriate giveaways of taxpayer-owned oil and \ngas resources to industry when it is unnecessary for us to maintain \nrobust domestic production.\n  These provisions are drawn almost verbatim from S. 1462 which was \nreported by our committee on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress. \nThe one significant change is that certain funding for the offshore oil \nand gas inventory provided by S. 1462 is redirected by the committee in \nsubsequent legislation to be used for research on safety issues related \nto offshore oil and gas drilling. To avoid spending the same money \ntwice, we have eliminated that funding here so it could be included in \noffshore safety legislation. At the same time, the bill retains the \nauthorization of significant appropriations to be used for this oil and \ngas inventory.\n  The Outer Continental Shelf Reform Act is the other bill I am \nintroducing. It is a verbatim reproduction of S. 3516 which was \nreported unanimously by our Energy Committee in the last Congress. \nBecause of the widespread support for this bill, I have reintroduced it \nexactly as reported, since I believe it is a good place to begin our \nwork this year. It will need a bit of updating as we move forward. A \nfew of the provisions have largely been overtaken by events and we have \nlearned from the President's Oil Spill Commission and others about some \nrefinements we should make in this legislation.\n  I have been having discussions with Senator Murkowski and others who \nsupported last year's bill and I will continue those discussions as we \nmove forward. I hope we will have the same strong bipartisan support \nfor these efforts as we did last year when we reported this bill during \nthe midst of the worst oilspill in our Nation's history. Our commitment \nto responsible operations in the gulf and protection of our citizens \nand communities should be well understood by all.\n  This bill is intended to respect those who lost their lives in the \nDeepwater Horizon accident and respect the people of the gulf who have \nsuffered serious economic and emotional harm by doing what we can to \ncreate a better future for them. It is the particular responsibility of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to look at the future of \nthe regulatory agency and the industry it regulates. As I said last \nyear when we introduced this bill, our goal must be, of course, to \nprevent future disasters, but we can and must do more than that. \nCongress should create organizational resources and a set of \nrequirements that will have safety and environmental protection and \ninnovation at their core. We should require that both industry and \nagency employees have the expertise, the experience, and the commitment \nto quality that is necessary to handle the complex issues involved, and \nwe should set principles in place to create a culture of excellence for \nthe regulatory agency and for the industry that will be a model for the \nentire world.\n  Thus, this bill reforms the structure of the offices of the \nDepartment of the Interior dealing with offshore oil and gas leasing \nand development to avoid organizational conflicts of interest. It \nclarifies the breadth of the Department's responsibilities in managing \nthe resources of the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  It increases the safety requirements for exploration and well \ndrilling and production. It mandates use of best available technology, \nan evidentiary safety case, and a risk management system that \nidentifies and addresses hazards in advance and manages for change. It \nprovides for third-party review by qualified parties outside the agency \nof key equipment and well design.\n  It addresses the essential need for the Department of the Interior to \nhave in-house research capacity on both the safety and the marine \nenvironment issues necessary for the exercise of its regulatory \nauthority. Research departments in these areas will no longer be \noptional, but are required, and funding is redirected from other areas \nof research to ensure this will happen.\n  In order to ensure that the rules are enforced, the bill requires the \ncollection of fees from industry to fully fund the necessary teams of \ninspectors. It provides for independent investigations of accidents and \nthe sharing of data so that all can learn from mistakes. It also \nprovides the Department of the Interior with adequate time to carry out \nnecessary reviews and it makes the input of other Federal agencies \noccur in a transparent way. And it increases the civil and criminal \npenalties applicable to violations of the law and regulations.\n  I believe these policies and resources can set us on a new and \nconstructive path toward managing the incredible natural resources we \nhave on the Outer Continental Shelf. We must commit ourselves to the \ngoal of excellence in this important endeavor. The fact that oil is no \nlonger gushing into the Gulf of Mexico in no way diminishes the \nimportance of this work.\n  Both of these bills address issues of great national importance. We \nwill shortly be scheduling the necessary hearings and preparing these \nbills for committee consideration. If at all possible, we will do so \nbefore the Memorial Day recess. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and in the \nrest of the Senate on a bipartisan basis as we have in the past to \naddress the vital issues presented by both of these bills.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are on the nomination; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nMagistrate Judge Chen, the President's\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\nnominee for the Northern District of California. Before I address Judge \nChen's nomination, I wish to say a few words about our progress on \njudicial nominations.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I told the chairman that I would \nwork with him to process consensus nominees at a fair and reasonable \npace. Thus far this Congress, I have worked very hard and in good faith \nto do just what I promised. We have confirmed consensus nominees with a \nparticular focus on nominees in so-called judicial emergencies. I made \nthat commitment to the chairman, and I have kept it.\n  The Senate has been in session for only 46 days this Congress. In \nthat short period, we have confirmed 20 judges. We confirmed three \njudges last week. In fact, thus far we have taken positive action on 43 \nof 71 nominees who have been submitted to this Congress by the \nPresident--20 have been confirmed, 13 have been reported out of \ncommittee, and 10 have had hearings in the committee. All totaled, we \nhave taken positive action, then, on 61 percent of the judicial \nnominees submitted by the President during this Congress.\n  Despite my good-faith efforts, my colleagues from the other side \ncontinue to accuse us of not moving quickly enough. And, I might add, \nthe White House Counsel continues to state publicly that we are not \nmoving fast enough. Recently, the President's top lawyers spoke to a \ngroup of ABA members and asked them to ``bring home the impact or the \neffects of gridlock.'' The President's lawyer neglected to tell the \nAmerican Bar Association that the problem begins at the White House. In \nother words, the Senate cannot act on nominees for judicial \nappointments if the President has not processed them and sent them to \nthe Senate. The President has failed to send to the Senate a nomination \nfor 50 percent of the current judicial nominees. Yet we have his White \nHouse Counsel telling the American Bar Association: Get on top of the \nSenate and tell them to get their job done, when we have processed 61 \npercent of the ones who are up here and done it in the 46 days we have \nbeen in session. Somehow they expect us to process nominees who have \nnot been submitted to the Congress. That is not possible. This \nstatistic certainly does not indicate a sense of urgency on the part of \nthe White House--in other words, the fact that the Senate has not even \nreceived 50 percent of the nominees for those vacancies.\n  Notwithstanding my efforts to work together, the majority insists on \ntaking detours and throwing up roadblocks to this cooperative effort. \nFor example, last week, after moving forward with two district court \njudges, the majority leader filed cloture on one of President Obama's \nmost controversial nominees, Mr. Jack McConnell. This week, the \nmajority leader has turned to two more of the President's controversial \nnominees. Last night, we defeated a cloture motion for Mr. Cole, the \nPresident's nominee for Deputy Attorney General, and today we turn to \nJudge Chen. Of course there are noncontroversial nominees the Senate \ncould turn to. We could confirm additional district judges as we have \nbeen doing. But rather than continuing to move forward with the \nconsensus nominees, the other side has chosen to turn to the \nPresident's most controversial nominees.\n  I must say this makes it extremely difficult to continue to work in a \ngood-faith effort to move forward on noncontroversial nominees. From \nour perspective, it appears that the more we try to work with the \nmajority, the more we are accused of not moving fast enough. The test, \nI guess, is in the pudding and the general counsel for the White House \ntelling the American Bar Association lawyers to get on the Senate to \nget more nominees confirmed. The more we try to move consensus \nnominees, the more the other side insists on moving the President's \nmost objectionable nominees.\n  Judge Chen is not a consensus nominee. His nomination was considered \nduring the last Congress and was voted out of committee on a party-line \nvote. The nomination was returned to the President on more than one \noccasion. Despite our repeated and consistent opposition, the \nnomination was resubmitted this year. Again it was reported out on a \n10-to-8 party-line vote. Yet, despite the unanimous Republican \nopposition to the nominee, we have agreed to a short time agreement \nrather than engage in extended debate on this nomination.\n  With that, I have some remarks regarding Judge Chen's nomination. At \nthe outset, let me emphasize the basis of my opposition. It is based on \nMr. Chen's judicial philosophy, on his own statements, and on his \nrecord. It is absolutely critical that our judges remain impartial. \nThat is the independence of the judiciary. That is why it is \nindependent. Their job is to interpret law, not to make law. Our system \ndepends upon this independence and impartiality. For that reason, when \njudges put on a robe for the first time, they take a solemn oath that \nthey will remain impartial. They swear that they will \nadminister justice ``without respect to persons and do equal right to \nthe poor and to the rich.'' That is why we want to make sure judges we \nconfirm will set aside their personal opinions. We do not want their \npersonal views to influence how they do their job. They are supposed to \ndecide cases based on facts and on law and nothing else.\n\n  Unfortunately, there are some who believe that this notion of \nimpartiality is somehow just plain old-fashioned and outdated. They \nbelieve judges should not be limited to the facts and the law. Instead, \nthey believe judges should look at the litigants themselves. The \nPresident seems to take this view. This is the heart of the so-called \nempathy standard. The problem, of course, is that empathy for one \nlitigant is a bias against the other. But Mr. Chen appears ready and \nwilling to adopt and to apply the so-called empathy standard. He \nappears to be a member of the camp who believes that being completely \nimpartial is just an old-fashioned view of judging.\n  In 2003, as a sitting Federal magistrate judge, he wrote an article \nthat summed up his view, and I want to quote it. It is fairly long.\n\n       Judges have to make determinations that draw not so much \n     upon legal acumen, but on an understanding of people and of \n     human experiences. Such experiences inform assumptions that \n     affect legal decisions. . . . Simply put, a judge's life \n     experiences affect the willingness to credit testimony or \n     understand the human impact of legal rules upon which the \n     judge must decide. These determinations require a judge to \n     draw upon something that is not found in case reports that \n     line the walls of our chambers. Rather, judges draw upon the \n     breadth and the depth of their own life experience, upon the \n     knowledge and understanding of people, and of human nature.\n\n  I am sure John Marshall would turn over in his grave if he heard that \nabout modern 20th-century and 21st-century judges.\n  The problem with this approach is that it is the exact opposite of \nwhat judges are supposed to be. Judges are supposed to determine the \nfacts and apply the law. That is what their oath demands, and that is \nwhat judges must do for our judicial system to remain independent and \nimpartial.\n  In addition to allowing empathy to affect his decisionmaking, Judge \nChen appears willing to inject his personal views into judging. Both \nhis writing and public comments while as a magistrate judge suggest \nthat Judge Chen believes judges should interpret the law according to \ntheir personal understandings and preferences. This is a classic \ndefinition of judicial activism.\n  For example, in discussing his work as a magistrate judge, he stated \nin a speech in 2007 before the American Constitution Society that he \nfinds ``most rewarding . . . contributing to the development of the law \nvia published opinion, especially if it comports with my view of \njustice.'' Again, the problem here is that a judge's view of justice is \nvery irrelevant. Judges are not policymakers. That is what we are in \nthe Congress of the United States. Judges are called on to decide the \nfacts and to apply the law. Their own view of justice is simply not \nrelevant.\n  Given that Judge Chen believes a judge's personal views and \nexperiences impact their decisions, it becomes important for us to \nunderstand his views and how they were shaped. Prior to becoming a \nmagistrate judge, Judge Chen worked as a staff attorney at the ACLU for \nover 15 years. He was a advocate for the ACLU. He took very liberal \npositions on a variety of issues. I would like to name just a few. He \nopposed private drug testing, he opposed antigang injunctions, he \ndefended affirmative action, he harshly criticized English-\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\nonly measures, and he argued that Alabama should be forced to give \ndriving tests in languages other than English.\n  Those who have defended Judge Chen's nomination have argued that we \nshould not consider his work for the ACLU. As I said, we have confirmed \nother nominees with strongly held personal views. But when a nominee \nsays that personal views and experiences should and will influence how \nthey approach cases, it becomes difficult to overlook their work on \nbehalf of an organization such as the ACLU.\n  Judge Chen's advocacy on behalf of the ACLU is not disqualifying in \nand of itself. But it is hard to imagine why Judge Chen would devote so \nmuch of his professional career to the ACLU causes if he did not \nbelieve in them deeply. More importantly, given that in Judge Chen's \nview, personal views and personal experiences should influence how a \njudge decides cases, we have no choice but to examine Judge Chen's \npersonal views and experiences, including his work at that \norganization.\n  For these reasons and others, I oppose this nomination. If Judge Chen \nis confirmed today, I sincerely hope he will prove me wrong. I \nsincerely hope he will set aside his personal views and make decisions \nbased solely on the facts and on the law. But based on the record \nbefore this Senator, I fear he will not be able to do so. Therefore, I \nwill vote no on his confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Tennessee Flooding\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on Friday, I visited Memphis to see the \nflooding along the Mississippi River myself, to meet with volunteers \nwho were helping, and to see the tremendously well coordinated efforts \nof emergency workers who are meeting and working every day, long into \nthe evenings, and have been doing so for the last few weeks and will \ncontinue to do so for the next several weeks.\n  I want to make sure that as the Federal Government's role for helping \narrives, we are doing everything we should be doing. It is quite a \nsight in Memphis. The Mississippi River today is 14 feet above flood \nstage. It is at a level that nearly equals the level in 1937. The river \nis normally a half mile wide. Today it is 3 miles wide. A great many \npeople in Tennessee and Arkansas have been evacuated because their \nhomes are flooded with water.\n  As we saw a year ago in the Tennessee floods, which stretched from \nNashville to Memphis, and as I saw last Monday in Hamilton County near \nChattanooga, Tennesseans know how to respond to this kind of tragedy. \nThey are doing it again by helping one another and helping to clean up \nrather than complaining and looting. It is an impressive sight. Bob \nNations, who is the director of the Shelby County Emergency Management \nAgency, presides over daily meetings of maybe 50 or 60 people from a \nvariety of volunteer and governmental organizations, who are carefully \ncoordinated to deal with everything from watching the levees, to \nlooking for sand boils, to helping people evacuate, to dealing with \nutilities that may be threatened by flooding. He is doing a tremendous \njob.\n  COL Vernie Reichling, commander of the Memphis District Corps of \nEngineers, was there on Friday. He has had a tough couple of weeks. He \nwas the one who had to blow up a levee in Missouri which hurt families \nin that area but saved towns, whole towns that are down river along the \nMississippi River from irreparable damage, in northwest Tennessee and \nalso in Missouri. He was there providing us with the latest \ninformation. Overall the Corps' work has been exemplary. So far none of \nthe levees around Memphis has been breached, and it appears none will \nbe breached, despite the high water.\n  The National Weather Service, both State and local officials have \nbeen an important part of the efforts. The University of Memphis has \ncontributed daily maps that will predict where the water will go, which \nhave proved to be fairly accurate, which is enormously helpful to \nvolunteers and others as they find a way to help people evacuate when \nthey need to be evacuated, or before they need to be evacuated.\n  I visited with volunteers who were filling sandbags near the Pyramid. \nThese included off-duty military personnel from the Navy base nearby. \nThese included people from land that is going to stay dry in other \nparts of Shelby County. They knew someone needed to help. I traveled to \nMud Island where the flood waters were continuing to rise. Officials \npredict as many as 3,000 properties and 6 schools may be affected by \nthe flooding. One of the most impressive stories is that of Hope \nPresbyterian Church and its pastor, Dr. Craig Strickland. The church \nhas organized up to 13 shelters, each of which could hold 150 to 200 \nindividuals. Two of them were filled when I was there on Friday. More \nof them are filling up. All of this is being done without any cost to \nthe government, without any cost to the individuals who are being \nsheltered there. It is all being provided by the churches and \nsynagogues of Memphis. Reverend Strickland and Hope Presbyterian Church \ndeserve enormous credit for the role they are playing, along with \nothers, in Shelby County.\n  The Federal Government, through the efforts of the Corps, is leading \nthe fight. This is the largest flood in the history of the Mississippi \nRiver and Tributaries project. The Mississippi is the third largest \nwatershed. The problem is it received 600 percent more rainfall than it \nnormally does in a span of 2 weeks. The Corps says it came in all the \nwrong places. Over 4 million people are protected by the comprehensive \nMississippi River and Tributaries Project. It is being tested in ways \nthat it never has before. But the system so far is performing as \ndesigned. The Corps has made some tough choices that I talked about \nearlier. It is going to continue to need to make tough choices as the \nwater moves south.\n  The Memphis District has been fighting the flood since the 24th day \nof April, relying on 500 people working 24 hours a day around the \nclock. The Federal Government, through FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, is also helping State and local officials evacuate \nthose in harm's way in advance of the floodwaters.\n  Governor Haslam of Tennessee requested, and our entire delegation has \nsupported, our State's request for emergency evacuation assistance to \nhelp move residents in Dyer, Lake, Shelby, and Stewart Counties to \nhigher ground.\n  The President responded quickly, and we thank him for that. Over the \nweekend, the congressional delegation also supported Governor Haslam's \nrequest for Federal assistance to help victims in 15 counties recover \nfrom the flood and severe storms that began impacting our State on \nApril 19.\n  Actually this is a different sort of request. The first was \nevacuations; this is to help those recover. The record rainfall and \nflooding has only added to the devastation caused by the storms. Last \nnight I learned the President has approved Tennessee's request to make \nindividual and public assistance available to families in the hardest \nhit areas.\n  I would say to the Tennesseans who are affected by this, now that the \nPresident has approved opportunities for individual assistance, I hope \nthey will take advantage of this. There is a telephone number to call. \nIt is 1-800-621-FEMA. That is 1-800-621-3362. Unfortunately, we have \nhad some experience with this telephone number in Tennessee in the last \nyear. The floods that came exactly a year ago, which hit counties from \nNashville to Memphis, produced enormous devastation, $2 billion alone \nin Davidson County. What we found with FEMA, once the President had \ngranted the assistance, that Tennesseans who called that telephone \nnumber got a quick response, usually had an inspector there within a \nfew days, and in most cases where there was damage, received a check of \nup to $30,000 within a few days. We hope that happens again, although \nwe understand there is terrible devastation in hundreds of counties \nright now around the country, especially in Alabama and the eastern \npart of Tennessee. But I want to make sure that residents and neighbors \nin Tennessee know that the FEMA number, 1-800-621-FEMA, is available \nnow to be called.\n  The first thing they will do is ask for your ZIP code. After that, \nthey will have a chance to provide help. The most important thing that \nTennesseans can do in preparation for that is to document the loss.\n  This flood will impact our State for weeks. The river only crested \nlast night, the second highest flood stage\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\never recorded. It will take days for the waters to recede. Only then \nwill we know the true extent of the damage. The volunteers and the \nemergency crews and the church shelters will be open for a long time \nafter today.\n  I am proud of the Tennesseans who are responding, from the Corps of \nEngineers' personnel, to the Hope Presbyterian Church shelters, to the \nprofessionals with Mr. Nations. It is an admirable sight.\n  Senator Corker and I and our entire delegation are working together \nto make sure that we do all we can to expedite Federal help in response \nto this historic disaster that has occurred in the western part of our \nState.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters I am passing to the desk be \nprinted in the Congressional Record immediately following my remarks. \nThey are the two letters our delegation has sent to the President \nmaking a request for a declaration for disaster assistance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2011.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the State of Tennessee, we \n     urge you to approve Governor Bill Haslam's request to declare \n     a major disaster due to severe storms, straight-line winds, \n     tornadoes, flash flooding and river flooding that began on \n     April 19, 2011.\n       Residents all across our State are faced with devastation \n     from multiple disasters, and Governor Haslam has determined \n     that this incident has caused so much damage that federal \n     assistance is necessary. Flooding along the Mississippi River \n     has compounded the impact of the storms that swept across the \n     Southeast, and will continue to impact our State for weeks. \n     Thousands of our constituents are now dealing with the \n     challenge of rebuilding their homes, while many in West \n     Tennessee are still under the threat of catastrophic \n     flooding.\n       The Governor's request specifically seeks Public Assistance \n     for all categories, under the provisions of Section 401 of \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act, for Benton, Carroll, Crockett, Dyer, Gibson, \n     Henderson, Henry, Houston, Lake, Lauderdale, Madison, \n     Montgomery, Obion, Shelby and Stewart Counties, as well as \n     state-wide assistance through the Hazard Mitigation Grant \n     program. This assistance is critical to help local \n     governments begin debris removal and start putting their \n     communities back together.\n       In addition, the State is seeking Individual Assistance for \n     Dyer, Lake, Obion, Shelby and Stewart Counties, making \n     residents of these counties eligible for the Individuals and \n     Households Program, Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Crisis \n     Counseling, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, \n     Disaster Legal Services and Small Business Administration \n     disaster loans. Without this federal assistance, many \n     families will simply not be able to recover.\n       Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency have \n     been working with State and local officials since the \n     beginning of this incident, and we are grateful for their \n     efforts to respond to Tennessee's needs. We ask that you \n     consider our State's request as soon as possible, and our \n     offices can provide you with any additional information \n     should you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n         Lamar Alexander, U.S. Senator; Bob Corker, U.S. Senator; \n           Steve Cohen, Congressman; Marsha Blackburn, \n           Congresswoman; Jim Cooper, Congressman; Chuck \n           Fleischmann, Congressman; Phil Roe, Congressman; \n           Stephen L.

Heavy rainfall across the region has \n     also caused major flooding along the Tennessee and Cumberland \n     Rivers, In Tiptonville, which has been under a voluntary \n     evacuation order since last week, the Mississippi River is \n     forecast to reach the highest flood stage ever recorded. In \n     the City of Memphis, the forecasted crest has been increased \n     to 48 feet, and residents are being told to prepare for the \n     worst. Those living along the Cumberland River in Stewart \n     County, many of whom are still recovering from last year's \n     floods, are also beginning to evacuate.\n       Governor Bill Haslam and the Tennessee Emergency Management \n     Agency are working in cooperation with local officials to \n     meet the needs of our citizens, but they need federal help. \n     The requested funds are critical to support our state's \n     evacuation efforts, which may be extensive, and we cannot \n     afford to delay.\n       In light of the need to begin evacuations quickly, we urge \n     you to consider our State's request as soon as possible, and \n     we will provide you with any additional information about our \n     State's needs should you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n         Lamar Alexander, U.S. Senator; Bob Corker, U.S. Senator; \n           Steve Cohen, Congressman; Marsha Blackburn, \n           Congresswoman; Jim Cooper, Congressman; Chuck \n           Fleischmann, Congressman; Phil Roe, Congressman; \n           Stephen L. Fincher, Congressman; Diane Black, \n           Congresswoman; Scott DesJarlais, Congressman; John J. \n           Duncan, Jr., Congressman.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my honor to be here to support the \nnomination of Judge Edward Chen to the Northern District of California. \nI congratulate Judge Chen and I congratulate his family on this \nmomentous day that is long overdue. I wish to thank Senator Feinstein \nfor her hard work and her leadership in support of Judge Chen's \nnomination.\n  I think the way we do our judge recommendations in California is \nexemplary. What we do is, we each have a committee that advises us, and \nthey come up with the names of a few people who they think are the top \nchoices. Then, each of us makes that recommendation to the President. \nJudge Chen was her nominee.\n  Judge Chen has had a distinguished career. He enjoys broad support \nand respect in California's legal community. When I heard the remarks \nof my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, it broke my heart because \nit doesn't sound to me as though he knows Judge Chen. He seems to be \ncriticizing someone else--someone who sets aside the law. That is not \nJudge Chen. Judge Chen will make an outstanding addition to the Federal \nbench.\n  Since 2001, Judge Chen has served as a magistrate judge in the \nNorthern District of California, where he has issued over 350 published \nlegal opinions. Before coming to the bench, Judge Chen was a respected \ncivil rights lawyer and part of the trial team that successfully \noverturned the wartime conviction of Fred Korematsu. He made history \nwhen he became the first Asian-American magistrate judge to serve in \nthe Northern District. Today, Judge Chen takes another history-making \nstep if he is confirmed--and I surely hope he will be--because when he \nis confirmed, he will be only the second Asian American in the 150-year \nhistory of the Northern District to be confirmed as a judge.\n  In our great Nation, we are a melting pot. I don't believe we can \nhave the kind of justice our Founders envisioned unless we have juries \nof our peers and we have judges who also represent the broad quilt that \nis America. I think this is something to talk about, not to ignore.\n  While I am proud we are finally going to vote on the confirmation of \nJudge Chen, I have to again express frustration that it took so long to \nreach this point. Judge Chen was nominated over 21 months ago. I ask \neveryone to think about this--the family, everybody waiting for this \nmoment, years and years on the bench with an outstanding record. I \nremember attending Judge Chen's confirmation hearing in September 2009. \nHe was nominated for a judicial emergency seat, one that has been \nvacant since April 2008. That is a judicial emergency. We don't have \nenough judges. So one would think we would move quickly on this. \nFollowing his hearing, his nomination was held up by an unprecedented \ncampaign of obstruction, unfortunately, by my friends in the Republican \nParty. They refused to allow an up-or-down vote, and they forced the \nWhite House to renominate Judge Chen, not once, not twice, not three \ntimes but four times--\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\nfour times. I tell my colleagues, I have read their objections, and \nthey boil down to this: They object because once he worked as a staff \nattorney for the ACLU handling civil rights cases.\n  This is a man who received the highest rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. They gave him the ``well qualified'' rating. So I have to \nask my colleagues why they would object to someone who did a good job \ndefending the Constitution. By the way, I don't agree with the ACLU all \nthe time, believe me. I am surprised at this objection. For example, \nthe ACLU and the tea party in my State right now--in northern \nCalifornia--are working together to oppose free speech restrictions in \nfront of the Redding Library. In fact, the ACLU and the tea party filed \nparallel lawsuits to strike down the restrictions.\n  So my friends on the other side who give the tea party a tremendous \namount of support, I am a little surprised they would go after the \nACLU, which is partnering with the tea party in defending the \nConstitution. It is hard for me to believe that because Ed Chen was \nonce a staff attorney for the ACLU, he would come under this kind of \nfire.\n  They never objected to anything from his 9 years as a magistrate \njudge, not one complaint about any of the opinions he has written. \nJudge Chen's record as a fair and impartial judge since 2001 \ndemonstrates clearly that he understands the difference between being \nan advocate and being a judge.\n  So I don't think we should say anyone who was ever the staff attorney \nfor this organization or that organization is barred from getting \npromoted. That is a sad thing. I don't think people should be voted \ndown or voted against because they stand for equal rights and civil \nrights. If anything, we ought to say: That is great, because we all \nwant our civil rights protected. We all want our rights that are \nguaranteed to us in the Constitution protected.\n  Judge Roberts, the Chief Justice, has called on Senators to stop \nplaying politics with judicial nominees. I have to say, to me, this \nsounds like politics. You don't like an organization, so then you say \nsomeone who has been a judge for 9 years--you have no complaints about \nhim--go back 10 years and now say because you don't like that \norganization, they can't be promoted.\n  Chief Justice Roberts has warned that delays in filling vacancies has \ncreated acute difficulties in some judicial districts. That is a quote. \nLet me read it. The delays in filling vacancies ``has created acute \ndifficulties in some judicial districts.'' Certainly, we know in this \ndistrict we have been in an emergency situation.\n  It is time to get Judge Chen seated so he can continue serving the \npeople of northern California as a district court judge. I commend \nJudge Chen for his strength and his perseverance over the past 21 \nmonths. This has not been an easy process. I commend his family for \nstanding by him. I again commend Senator Feinstein for fighting for \nhim, and I commend everybody here who was able to somehow hammer out an \nagreement to have an up-or-down vote on this very talented man.\n  I close with great hopes that we are going to get this nominee \nconfirmed. In advance of that--and I hope I am right in doing this--I \nwish to congratulate Judge Chen and his family.\n  I urge my colleagues to cast their votes to confirm this highly \nqualified and respected nominee to the Northern District and make \nhistory in doing so and be proud in doing so and know that when we put \nqualified people on the court who bring a different background to the \ncourt, we are doing something very positive for America. That is what \nAmerica is. I am a first-generation American on my mother's side, and I \ncan tell my colleagues what I learned from her: that we should kiss the \nground in this country. As I grew up, I realized that one of the great \nthings about our country is we are such an experiment in democracy. \nPeople from every background, every religion, differences, but we \nbelieve in one thing; that is, protection of our rights and the belief \nin freedoms we get from this Nation and we vow to protect those \nfreedoms. Part of protecting those freedoms is putting people on the \nbench who understand that. As Benjamin Franklin once said: You have a \nRepublic if you can keep it. The way to keep it is not to bar people \nfrom getting these up-or-down votes. Put good people on this bench. You \ncan vote no. You can vote yes. Yes, there are times when we say we want \na supermajority, but for Ed Chen, I can tell my colleagues right now, \nthis isn't one of those times. I look forward to his positive vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time that is unused \nduring the quorum calls be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Egypt's Political Future\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, more than 2 months ago, a popular uprising \nin Egypt swept President Hosni Mubarak from power after 30 years in \noffice. The Egyptian military is now charged with reforming that \ncountry's political system in preparation for parliamentary and \nPresidential elections.\n  History teaches us this sort of transition happens in three phases, \nnot two. First, the dictator falls. Next follows a weak interim \ngovernment. Only then does a final permanent government enter the \nscene.\n  We remember the French Revolution with the fall of Louis XVI, then \nthe hopefulness of the French First Republic, and then finally the rise \nof Napoleon.\n  We remember the October Revolution--first the fall of the czar, then \nthe hopefulness of the interim Kerensky government, and finally the \nrise of the Soviet Union. Most recently we remember Iran--first the \nfall of the shah, then the hopefulness of the interim Bakhtiar \ngovernment, and finally the rise of Khomeini.\n  Today we are watching this sequence play out in Egypt. First Mubarak \nfell, then came the jubilation of Tahrir Square and the hopefulness of \nan interim military government, and now we are left to wonder what act \n3 will bring.\n  Will Egypt remain a strong U.S. ally in the region; will it uphold \nthe Camp David peace treaty with Israel; will it commit to the rule of \nlaw and human rights at home; or will Egypt fall into the hands of the \nradical Muslim Brotherhood; will it drift toward Iran and embrace the \nenemies of Israel?\n  Unfortunately, recent developments indicate Egypt is moving in the \nwrong direction. The Muslim Brotherhood is gaining additional influence \nand may soon gain significant legislative power.\n  According to a poll released on April 25 by the Pew Research Center, \n78 percent of Egyptians hold a favorable view of the Muslim \nBrotherhood--and that is better than the youth-led ``April 6 Movement'' \nthat removed Mubarak from power. In September's planned elections, the \nMuslim Brotherhood plans to contest anywhere between 30 to 50 percent \nof all parliamentary seats.\n  Meanwhile, Egypt's foreign policy is shifting away from the United \nStates and our allies and toward the Islamic Republic of Iran and its \nterrorist proxies. On April 18, Iran announced the appointment of the \ncountry's first ambassador to Egypt in 30 years. On April 27, Egyptian \nForeign Minister Nabil Elaraby said he will meet with the Iranian \nForeign Minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, in Indonesia on the sidelines of \nthe Non-Aligned Movement Summit. The two officials will discuss next \nsteps for the Iranian-Egyptian relationship. On May 3, Iran's Foreign \nMinister announced he would send his deputy to visit Egypt in the \ncoming days.\n  Egyptian authorities helped negotiate the recent reconciliation \nagreement between the terrorist movement Hamas and Fatah--a major \nsetback to Israeli-Palestinian peace. When asked to comment on Hamas \nbeing a terrorist organization, Egypt's Foreign Minister said:\n\n       [We must] allow someone who is fighting for a cause to see \n     the light of day at the end of the tunnel and enter into \n     peace.\n\n  On March 28, Hamas submitted a request to the Egyptian Government to\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\nreopen its Embassy in the Gaza Strip. On April 28, Egypt's Foreign \nMinister announced plans to reopen the Rafah border with Hamas on a \npermanent basis--a potential boon to the Hamas terrorist organization. \nOn April 30, Al Hayat reported that Hamas would be relocating its \noffices from Damascus--sending the terrorist group's No. 2 man, Musa \nAbu Marzouk, to Egypt.\n  Meanwhile, Egypt's commitment to democracy and human rights has \nsuffered a serious setback following recent attacks on the country's \nCoptic Christian community that left scores dead and hundreds more \ninjured. This follows the interim government's move to dismiss the \nCoptic governor of the city of Quena only days after his appointment--\ncaving to mass demonstrations organized by the Muslim Brotherhood.\n  As one Coptic bishop told AFP:\n\n       They are led by Salafis and the Muslim Brotherhood, and \n     they are chanting: ``We won't leave until the Christians \n     leave.''\n\n  Finally, on March 28, Dr. Maikel Nabil Sanad, a 25-year-old blogger, \nwas arrested for ``insulting the military,'' and ``disturbing public \nsecurity'' after posting comments on his blog that were critical of the \nmilitary's role in the protests. This arrest clearly violated the \nInternational Covenant on International and Political Rights and the \nnew government's commitment to the fundamental freedoms of its people. \nIf Egyptians could freely express their views in Tahrir Square, they \nshould have the freedom to express their views online.\n  Mr. President, the trajectory of Egypt's revolution now faces two \ndistinct scenarios: It could become a secular American ally that \nrespects the rule of law, diversity, and a peace treaty with Israel; or \nit could become a Muslim Brotherhood-controlled ally of Iran that \nembraces terrorist groups such as Hamas, persecutes its own religious \nminorities, and rejects peace with Israel.\n  We must do everything in our power to support the secular forces of \nEgypt or face the prospect of a strategic setback on the scale of Iran \nin 1979, laying the foundation for potentially yet another war in the \nMiddle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, am I correct that we are now on the \nnomination of Ed Chen to the District Court for the Northern District \nof California?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate will finally consider \nthe nomination of Judge Edward Chen to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the District Court for the Northern District of California. \nSince 2001, Judge Chen has been a well-respected Federal Magistrate \nJudge on the court to which he is now nominated to serve as a Federal \nDistrict Judge. His nomination has received the strong and consistent \nsupport of his home state Senators, Senator Feinstein and Senator \nBoxer, since he was first nominated over 21 months ago. When he is \nconfirmed, Judge Chen will be only the second Asian Pacific American to \nserve on the district court bench in the 150-year history of the \nNorthern District of California. The debate and vote we have today are \nlong overdue.\n  We are finally able to consider Judge Chen's nomination because of \nthe vote the Senate took last week toward restoring a longstanding \ntradition of deference to home state Senators with regard to Federal \nDistrict Court nominations. The Senate turned away from a precipice \nwhen 11 Republican Senators joined in voting to end a filibuster of the \nnomination of Jack McConnell to the District Court for the District of \nRhode Island. In doing so, a super majority of the Senate came together \nto reject a new standard, which I believe is being unfairly applied to \nPresident Obama's district court nominees. Now, nearly 20 months after \nhis confirmation hearing, and after having had his nomination reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee four times, Judge Chen's \nnomination will at last have an up-or-down vote in the Senate.\n  We should have taken up and confirmed his nomination when it was \nfirst reported favorably by the committee nearly 19 months ago. The \nsupposed ``controversy'' that has delayed and obstructed this \nnomination is in my view entirely misplaced, the result of applying a \npartisan litmus test. This should be an easy nomination to confirm. It \nis no surprise that Judge Chen's nomination received the highest \npossible rating from the American Bar Association's Standing Committee \non the Federal Judiciary, unanimously ``well qualified,'' since he has \nhad a distinguished legal career and has issued over 350 judicial \nopinions in his decade as a Federal magistrate judge.\n  Judge Chen's nomination has received broad, bipartisan support from \nthe judicial and legal community in California and from numerous bar \nassociations, including the National Asian Pacific Bar Association, \nwhich has been a vocal proponent of this nomination. Judge Chen's \nnomination also has significant support from local law enforcement in \nthe district he currently serves and would continue to serve if \nconfirmed. Michael Hennessey, sheriff for the city and county of San \nFrancisco, wrote: ``Judge Chen's solid record as a U.S. Magistrate \nJudge speaks for itself. He has published over three-hundred judicial \nopinions which are indicative of his work ethic and his thoughtful \nintellect as a respected magistrate judge.'' This praise is \nrepresentative of the scores of letters of support we have received.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for her strong advocacy for Judge Chen's \nnomination the four times it has been considered and favorably reported \nby the Judiciary Committee. Any fair minded person who listened to the \nimpassioned speeches Senator Feinstein has made about Ed Chen in the \ncommittee would have to be impressed. Senator Feinstein is right to be \nproud of her recommendation of Ed Chen to President Obama. As Senator \nFeinstein has explained, Judge Chen was the recommendation of her \nbipartisan Judicial Advisory Committee in California, putting the lie \nto the caricature from the far right that this was a partisan \nnomination. This is a fine man with sterling legal credentials and all \nthe qualifications needed to be an outstanding Federal judge.\n  The approach taken by opponents of Judge Chen's nomination threatens \nto take the Senate down a dangerous path of imposing partisan litmus \ntests in place of our constitutional duty to offer advice and consent \non nominations. The debate in our committee on Judge Chen's nomination \nwas ugly. One Republican Senator in explaining his opposition said that \nJudge Chen has the ``ACLU gene.'' I hope that we do not hear such a \npreposterous notion repeated today on the floor of the Senate. This is \na distinguished Federal magistrate judge who has demonstrated that he \nknows how to be a fair and impartial judge.\n  Our legal system is an adversary system, predicated upon legal \nadvocacy for both sides. Certainly defending civil liberties is no \nvice. The other side appears to be suggesting that Judge Chen's work as \na staff attorney at the ACLU many years ago, primarily representing \nindividuals in discrimination and civil rights matters, somehow renders \nhim unfit to be a judge. Since when do we impose a litmus test for \nnominees that they can never have been legal advocates? If we were to \ndo that, we would have no judges. Almost every nominee who had been a \npracticing lawyer would be disqualified by one side or the other.\n  Surely Judge Chen's work while in private practice as a member of the \nlegal team that represented Fred Korematsu in a lawsuit that \nsuccessfully overturned his prior conviction for violating the Japanese \nInternment Order during World War II does not render Judge Chen unfit \nto be a judge. In my view, that important advocacy to right a wrong \nfrom one of the dark chapters in our history serves as proof that \nPresident Obama made a wise choice in nominating Judge Chen for the \nFederal bench. Indeed, just a few years ago this Senate passed a \nresolution acknowledging that wrong and seeking to help right it.\n  The question for me about this nominee is the same question I have \nasked about every judicial nominee, whether\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\nnominated by a Democratic or a Republican president whether he or she \nwill have judicial independence. Does the nominee understand the role \nof a judge, and how it differs from the role of an advocate?\n  With this nominee, Judge Chen, that is not a hard question to answer. \nWe know that he understands the role of a judge because he has been \ndoing it for 10 years on the court to which he has now been nominated. \nAs Judge Chen said in response to a question from Senator Sessions: \n``The role of a judge is to be fair, neutral, and evenhanded in \napplying the law and finding facts\n. . . without regard to personal preferences.'' His 10 years as a \nFederal magistrate judge resoundingly have answered any concerns about \nbias or partisanship on his part. His testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee reflects his understanding of the proper role of a judge.\n  There was no need for the delays that plagued this nomination. There \nwere no ``extraordinary circumstances'' that held up this nomination \nfor nearly 2 years. With judicial vacancies at crisis levels, affecting \nthe ability of courts to provide justice to Americans around the \ncountry, we should be debating and voting on each of the 12 judicial \nnominations reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending \non the Senate's Executive Calendar, in addition to Judge Chen. No one \nshould be playing partisan games and obstructing while vacancies remain \nabove 90 in the Federal courts around the country.\n  Judge Chen, born and raised in Oakland, CA, as the son of two Chinese \nimmigrants, spent much of his childhood helping his mother and siblings \nsupport a small family business after his father passed away. After \nearning his A.B. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1975, \nand his law degree from Boalt Hall School of Law in 1979, Judge Chen \nclerked for Judge Charles Renfrew on the court to which he has now been \nnominated, the Northern District of California, and then for Judge \nJames Browning on the Ninth Circuit. After a distinguished career in \nprivate practice and as a staff attorney for the American Civil \nLiberties Union Foundation of Northern California, Judge Chen was \nselected to serve as a Federal Magistrate Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of California, having since been reappointed upon the \nrecommendation of the nonpartisan Merit Selection Review Panel. His \nstory is a moving reminder of what it is possible to achieve in this \ngreat Nation through hard work.\n  I congratulate Judge Edward Chen and his family on his confirmation \ntoday. I commend Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer for their \nsteadfast support of his nomination.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. Is time being \ndivided?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided \nduring the quorum call.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Senate Daily Digest proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom California on the floor. I will yield, of course, to her. She has \nbeen indefatigable in her support of Judge Chen in the committee, in \nthe Halls of the Senate, and in her steadfast work with the leadership \nto get this nominee before us. I can brag about all the work she has \ndone easier than she might, but I hope Judge Chen and his family know \nthey had as strong and as stalwart a supporter on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee as they could possibly have with Senator Feinstein.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Senate Daily Digest proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to thank Chairman Leahy for \nhis leadership on this particular judgeship. I believe he is accurate \nin everything he said, and I very much appreciate his stalwart support.\n  I rise to add my support to the nomination of U.S. Magistrate Judge \nEdward Chen to become a U.S. district judge in the Northern District of \nCalifornia. I recommended Judge Chen to the President, so obviously he \nhas my strong support.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues a little bit about him. He was born and \nraised in Oakland, and he is the son of Chinese immigrants. His father \nimmigrated to the United States in the 1920s, and that was followed by \nhis mother in the 1930s. He attended public schools in Oakland and then \nwent on to the University of California at Berkeley, where he received \nhis undergraduate degree with great distinction, and then on to Boalt \nHall School of Law, where he graduated in the top 10 percent of his \nclass.\n  He was a law clerk to District Judge Charles Renfrew on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California, as well as to \nCircuit Judge James Browning on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. He then began his legal career as a litigator, first at the \nprivate law firm of Coblentz, Patch, Duffy, and Bass and later as a \nstaff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n  In 2001, he was appointed to be a U.S. magistrate judge for the \nNorthern District of California, and he has served in that capacity for \nthe past 10 years.\n  So today Judge Chen is a solid, tested, and respected judge with over \na decade of experience on the Federal bench. In these 10 years as a \njudge, he has written more than 350 published opinions. I would point \nout that not one of those opinions has been criticized by anyone in the \n20 months this nomination has been awaiting action in the Senate. Nor \nhas there been any criticism of any of his published opinions.\n\n  In fact, there is a broad consensus among those who have reviewed his \njudicial record that he is indeed a very good judge.\n  He was recommended to me by a bipartisan judicial advisory committee. \nThat committee reviewed his record, and spoke with judges, attorneys, \nand litigants who knew his work as a judge. The committee unanimously \nrecommended that I forward his name to the President, and I did.\n  The San Francisco Bar Association has rated him ``exceptionally well \nqualified.'' The American Bar Association has rated him ``well \nqualified''--their highest rating. And in 2009, a merit selection \nreview panel, appointed by the U.S. District Court, thoroughly reviewed \nhis record and recommended him for reappointment as a magistrate judge. \nThat panel consisted of seven lawyers appointed by the district court. \nThey solicited public comments on Chen's work as a judge. Only positive \ninformation was forthcoming.\n  They talked to Federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office. \nAgain, the reports were uniformly favorable. Prosecutors called Chen's \nanalytical skills ``exemplary'' and said his rulings were ``balanced \nand well reasoned.''\n  Defense attorneys were similarly positive. They described Chen as \n``respectful'' and ``considered'' in his judgments.\n  Partners with large law firms called Chen ``prompt,'' ``well-\nprepared,'' ``very intelligent'' and ``decisive.''\n  Overall, the panel recommended unequivocally that Chen be reappointed \nfor a second 8-year term as a magistrate judge. Obviously, he has \nserved 2 years of that second term.\n  I have the panel's full report here and would be pleased to share it \nwith any Senator who wishes to review it.\n  Since Chen's nomination for the district court, the reports we have \nreceived in the Senate from those who know Chen's work as a judge have \nbeen similarly positive.\n  We have received letters urging Chen's confirmation from Republicans \nand Democrats, public officials and law enforcement, judges, civil \nrights groups, business leaders, and private lawyers. Let me share a \nfew with you.\n  Judge Lowell Jensen, whom I have followed for decades, was appointed \nto the U.S. District Court by President\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\nReagan. He also served as second in charge of the Department of Justice \nduring the Reagan administration. He has worked closely with Chen on \nthe Federal bench and had this to say about him, and this is a direct \nquote:\n\n       I have found Judge Chen to be both an excellent jurist and \n     a person of high character. He brings a conscientious, \n     careful, and impartial approach to every issue and every \n     party. The decisions he makes reflect not only good judgment \n     but a complete commitment to the principles of fair trial and \n     the application of the rule of law. I support his \n     confirmation without reservation.\n\n  I can say that Judge Jensen is one of the most distinguished judges \nin California.\n  Former U.S. District Judge Fern Smith was also appointed by President \nReagan to the Federal court. She writes:\n\n       Both in my own dealings with [Judge Chen] and based on his \n     reputation among my former colleagues, I can attest to his \n     intellectual competence, his respect for the law, his \n     judicial temperament, and his integrity. I have no doubt that \n     Ed Chen would do honor to any of our 94 United States \n     District Courts.\n\n  We have a letter from the president of the San Francisco Police \nCommission, a lifelong Republican, Thomas Mazzucco. He published an op-\ned in the Roll Call urging the Senate to confirm Chen and calling him \n``an experienced judge who understands the distinction between personal \npreference and judicial obligation, and who has always based his \nrulings--more than 300 decisions over eight years--solely on the law \nand the merits of a case.''\n  The San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs Association said this:\n\n       Chen has earned a reputation as an evenhanded jurist who is \n     constantly mindful of the role that judges such as himself \n     fulfill in our society: as keepers of the rule of law and \n     public trust in our system of justice.\n\n  I have over 50 more letters, if anyone wishes to read them. They come \nfrom the mayors of San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose; the sheriff, \ncity attorney, former chief of police, and former U.S. Marshal of San \nFrancisco; the last 10 presidents of the bar association of San \nFrancisco; the congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus; the \nNational Asian Pacific American Bar; and many others.\n  The judgment is clear: Ed Chen is fair. He is impartial. He is an \nexcellent jurist, and has been for 10 years, and he deserves to be \nconfirmed.\n  You come back to Washington and what happens? Here is the story. \nDespite this long judicial track record and broad bipartisan support, \nthis nomination has been sitting in the Senate for more than 600 days.\n  The President first nominated Chen on August 6, 2009. That was 643 \ndays ago. Since that time, the minority has required the nomination to \nbe sent back to the President three different times. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee has had to consider the nomination four different \ntimes.\n  This is extraordinary--but then the Republicans have an extraordinary \nsearch engine. I will talk about that in a minute.\n  This is a district court nominee with 10 years of judicial \nexperience, with not a blemish on it. When other judicial nominees have \ncome before the Senate, they have been criticized because they didn't \nhave judicial experience or because there was no judicial track record \nto review. Well, here is a nominee who has both. Ten years on the \nbench; bipartisan support and uniformly positive reviews; more than 350 \npublished opinions, and there has not been a single criticism of a \nsingle one. But his nomination has been sitting in the Senate for 600 \ndays and sent back to the President 3 separate times.\n  I find this to be a deeply disappointing testament to the situation \nwe face in the Senate today. Let me pose the question that Police \nCommissioner Mazzucco--a Republican--asked in his op-ed:\n\n       If Judge Chen--an experienced judge whose judicial record \n     proves he is committed to the rule of law, without bias or \n     favor, and who is widely respected by the bar that has \n     practiced before him--isn't qualified for the Federal bench, \n     then who is?\n\n  I echo that.\n  So what happened here? Well, let me take a few moments to address a \ncouple of the attacks that have been made on Judge Chen.\n  First, Judge Chen has been criticized because he worked as a staff \nattorney for the ACLU long before becoming a judge. No one disputes \nthat. Chen was once an advocate, and that is a fact. But he also has a \n10-year record to prove that he has made the transition. He was once an \nadvocate. He is now a judge--and a darn good judge.\n  As a coalition of Northern California Asian American Bar Associations \nwrote:\n\n       Chen has made a successful transition from a zealous \n     advocate to a balanced and conscientious adjudicator who is \n     committed to the impartial and active administration of \n     justice.\n\n  Former Federal prosecutors from the Northern District of California \nmade the same point. They wrote:\n\n       Judge Chen consistently treats all sides evenly and \n     impartially, and conducts himself with the utmost propriety, \n     as is fitting for a judge. . . . While we are aware of his \n     previous position as a staff attorney at the ACLU of northern \n     California, Judge Chen does not show favoritism toward the \n     parties or issues before him.\n\n  The record is available. The evidence is in. Chen understands the \nunique role of the impartial adjudicator. He knows what it means to \ndecide cases evenhandedly. He has been doing it for more than 10 years.\n  Let me turn then to some speeches that the ``search engine'' turned \nup. Since 2009, the Washington Times and others have used a handful of \nquotes from speeches Chen has given to try to paint him as someone he \nis not. As happens far too often, those quotes have been cut, spliced, \nand taken out of context. Let me give you an example.\n  The effort to label Chen as a ``radical'' is based on a speech he \ngave to students following the funeral of a man by the name of Fred \nKorematsu. I want to take a moment to explain Korematsu and the case. \nSome of you may be too young to remember Mr. Korematsu and his fight \nagainst Japanese internment during World War II, but I am not.\n  One of the singular experiences of my lifetime was when my father \ntook me, as a small child, to the Tanforan Racetrack. That racetrack \nwas a few miles south of San Francisco. During World War II, it was \ntaken out of action as a racetrack and turned into an internment camp. \nIt was fenced with barbed wire. Small buildings lined the center \nportion of the track. This is a photo of it. Here is the racetrack and \nhere are the buildings. This is where Japanese Americans were \nessentially incarcerated for the remainder of World War II.\n  Let me show you this. This is the order, which is from the Western \nDefense Command and Fourth Army Wartime Civil Control Administration--\ninstructions to all Americans of Japanese ancestry living in the \nfollowing area, which is the city and county of San Francisco, lying \ngenerally west of the north-south line, and it describes that. It says:\n\n       All Japanese persons, both alien and non-alien, will be \n     evacuated from the designated area by twelve o'clock on \n     Tuesday, April 7, 1942. No Japanese person will be permitted \n     to enter or leave the above-described area after 8 a.m. \n     Thursday, April 7--\n\n  That is over half of the city of San Francisco.\n\n     without obtaining special permission from the provost marshal \n     at the Civil Control Administration.\n\n  Then they are told where they are to report--to the Civil Control \nStation--to receive further instructions. This must be done between 8 \na.m. and 5 p.m., Thursday, April 2, or between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., \nFriday, April 3.\n  That is their notice. They turn up, get in a bus, and then this is \nwhere they go, and where they remained until the end of the war.\n  One young Californian, Fred Korematsu, challenged the internment. He \ntook his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and he argued that \nthe U.S. Constitution did not permit loyal American citizens to be \nforced into these camps solely because of their Japanese-American \nheritage, which was the case here. The Supreme Court heard his case, \nbut he lost in a decision that is considered by many to be a black \nstain on the jurisprudence of our Supreme Court.\n  Decades later, in 1983, Korematsu challenged his conviction again. \nThis time, he was represented by a team of volunteer lawyers, including \nEdward Chen. This team put forward newly discovered evidence that \ndemonstrated that prosecutors in Korematsu's original case had withheld \nevidence, specifically, U.S. Government intelligence at the time \nindicating the internment was not justified.\n  This time they won. So four decades after the original internment \norder,\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\nFred Korematsu's conviction was overturned by the district court, and, \nfour years later in 1987, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the \nCivil Liberties Act, issuing a formal, national apology for the \nJapanese internment.\n  So this was the context of the speech in which Chen was speaking to a \ngroup of students and reflecting on the funeral of Fred Korematsu. He \nsaid in the speech that, at times, he had experienced ``feelings of \nambivalence and cynicism when confronted by appeals to patriotism.'' He \nwas referring to the internment of Japanese-American citizens for no \ncause other than they happened to be of Japanese heritage. I would \nthink you could get a bit cynical about that. People who did not see \nthis do not believe it ever happened. But it did happen, and it \nhappened here. This was the condition in which people were kept. It is \nnot right.\n  But critics have picked out this line--``feelings of ambivalence and \ncynicism when confronted by appeals to patriotism''--and tried to use \nto paint Chen as unpatriotic. But they did not know the context. \nSometimes things that have monumental importance at the time, such as \nthe internment of Japanese-American citizens without due process, fade \ntoo quickly from our historical memory. I thought I would bring it back \nso this body could understand the total context.\n  This was a very big deal. It was not a proud moment for our country. \nCongress and President Reagan rightfully issued a formal apology for \nthe injustice that was done years later.\n  To take a quote from a speech after Fred Korematsu's funeral and to \nuse it to try to imply that Edward Chen does not love his country--it \nis shameful. It is also flatly inconsistent with the rest of the \nspeech. Chen went on to say that when the congregation sang ``America \nthe Beautiful'' at Korematsu's funeral, he was moved to tears because \n``the song described the America that Fred envisioned, the America \nwhose promised beauty he sought to fulfill, an America true to its \nfounding principles.''\n  Fred Korematsu is no longer with us, but his daughter Karen sent me a \nletter about Edward Chen. Here are some of her words:\n\n       My father's belief in our Constitution was unwavering, even \n     when he was treated unfairly. Like my father, Judge Chen is \n     adamant about upholding the Constitution, without bias or \n     prejudice.\n\n  In my view, Edward Chen is a judicial nominee who has been treated \nextraordinarily unfairly. But he remains steadfast in his commitment to \nserving our country as a Federal judge, and he has a 10-year \nunblemished judicial track record to show that he will serve us \nexceedingly well.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the nomination of Judge Edward \nChen to be a district judge for the Northern District of California.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  All time has expired.

Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation I am \nproud to cosponsor--to finally end the taxpayer handouts to the world's \nlargest oil companies--as they rake in record profits. This measure is \nabout accountability. It is about responsibility. It is about fairness.\n  When I got off the tractor from planting last weekend and went to \nfill my tank, it was $3.69 in Big Sandy, MT--almost a dollar higher \nthan just a few months ago. But while I am paying close to $4 gallon at \nthe pump, like other working Americans, oil company executives are \npadding their stock options and bonuses. They are diminishing their \ninvestment here in America, choosing instead to use tax loopholes to \noffshore their production.\n  I would like to make just three quick points today about the over $4 \nbillion in tax earmarks that the biggest oil companies in America are \nreceiving today.\n  First, they never asked for them.\n  Second, they don't need them.\n  And finally, they are not good for America--or our economy.\n  These taxpayer handouts are running up our national debt, taking our \njobs overseas, and they expose us to higher gas prices.\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\n  In 2005, the CEOs of the five largest oil companies testified in the \nSenate about these subsidies. When asked directly about these oil and \ngas tax breaks, all five executives said they did not ask for them.\n  They agreed with President Bush--that with the price of oil over $55 \nper barrel, they didn't need tax incentives. And today, oil is $109 per \nbarrel.\n  The CEO of Chevron told the committee that ending these breaks ``will \nhave a minimal impact on our company, minimal.''\n  Let me be as clear as those executives were then: This bill has \nnothing to do with Chevron's or Conoco's or Exxon's ability to operate \nrefineries or put folks to work here at home.\n  It has everything to do with holding their top-level executives \naccountable to all American taxpayers as they rake in billions of \ndollars in profits every year. Right now Big Oil executives are writing \noff the royalties they pay to foreign countries as taxes, and until we \nfix it, all of us are paying for it.\n  That means you and I are footing the bill every time one of these big \ncompanies writes a check to the government of Saudi Arabia or Nigeria. \nAnd they are telling us they don't want it or need it. We should do the \nfiscally responsible thing and close these loopholes.\n  Instead, we should use that $8.5 billion to pay down our deficit. And \nthat is what this bill does.\n  Special tax breaks are supposed to make companies more competitive \nand get new technologies into the market. But for major oil companies \nwe have written a privileged tax code just for them.\n  Some of these provisions have been on the books since 1913. I don't \nknow what companies after 98 years still need a subsidy, but if it \ndoes, either it isn't very effective or the system is being abused.\n  As you will hear again and again this week--because it is just an \nastonishing number--as gas surpasses $4 per gallon, oil companies are \ngetting $4 billion annually in tax breaks.\n  The big five oil companies have made nearly $1 trillion in profits in \nthe last decade. Nearly $32 billion of that came in the first 3 months \nof this year alone.\n  But what is happening to gas prices?\n  Rather than bringing down prices at the pump, these giveaways merely \nline the executives' pockets and run up the deficit. All the while, gas \nprices have gone up.\n  For example, Exxon, the biggest of the oil companies in the U.S. made \nmore than $9 billion dollars in profit last year--just their U.S. \noperations. And how much did they pay in taxes? Just $39 million.\n  That is 0.4 percent.\n  But this is more fair than in 2009, when Exxon received a $156 \nmillion tax refund from the IRS.\n  That means we as taxpayers are paying them. The Tax Code is broken \nand this bill will help fix it.\n  Right now, we are making tough choices about how to get a handle on \nour Nation's debt. We have tough debates ahead about heating homes in \nrural America, and investing in crumbling highways, and strengthening \nthe future of Medicare.\n  All the while, we are still literally writing checks to our biggest \noil companies who don't need them.\n  After causing the largest offshore oil spill in American history, BP \nstill managed to rake in more than $7 billion in profits, up 17 percent \nfrom the year before.\n  But most of these big companies are not developing their onshore \nresources here at home.\n  How do I look the oil worker in Montana's Bakken Field in the face \nand say: We are giving the largest oil companies a billion dollars a \nyear to go drill overseas, taking your opportunities offshore.\n  Dual Capacity, the most egregious of these tax provisions, subsidizes \n$1 billion each year in royalty payments to foreign governments that \ndon't like us very much. We don't let companies producing in America \ncredit royalty payments to their taxes, so why would we do that for \ncompanies that produce outside of the U.S.?\n  And does this make us safer? Does it bring stability to the market? \nAbsolutely not.\n  As we have all watched in the last few months, turmoil in the Middle \nEast has driven up speculation and driven up prices.\n  Oil prices fell about 10 percent last week--though not enough to \nrelieve hardworking Montanans with any changes in prices at the pump.\n  Prices didn't fall because of the discovery of a new oil field or a \nnew technology. It happened because some folks on Wall Street moved \nsome numbers around on paper.\n  There is no accountability in that. And that is why we're trying to \nchange it.\n  But unlike on Wall Street, there are places where folks are doing the \nhard work of oil discovery and developing the technology to lower the \ncost of oil.\n  A lot of that has to do with the ``small guys'' in the oil business. \nAnd they are successful. In fact, domestic production is going strong--\nat its highest level in almost a decade.\n  They are making risks and getting new technology into the field, like \nin eastern Montana.\n  My State is home to likely the most productive domestic onshore \noilfield in the United States. And small oil companies are doing good, \nresponsible in securing America's energy future.\n  The Bakken Field is estimated to hold nearly 4 billion barrels of \noil. They are leading the way in developing new technology for oil \nfield development.\n  Where is Exxon? They aren't reinvesting the last quarter's $11 \nbillion back in U.S. exploration.\n  In fact, in 2009, they paid their shareholders 90 percent of the \nprofits to shareholders, leaving just 10 percent to invest in their \nworkforce, research and development, exploration, safety and the \nexpanding energy frontier.\n  Contrary to what some of my colleagues are saying, eliminating these \nwasteful subsidies won't raise gas prices. I want to repeat that:\n  Eliminating wasteful subsidies will not raise gas prices.\n  Many of these handouts have been on the books for decades as prices \nhave continued to rise.\n  It is time to close these loopholes for big oil in order to \nstrengthen our national security--and our energy future. It is time to \nend the taxpayer handouts to Big Oil.\n  This bill returns us to a responsible path toward energy development \nthat benefits taxpayers and consumers. And it starts addressing the \ndebt and deficit. It is the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2833-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF INTELLECTUAL & DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nKentuckian who for much of his life was\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\ncontent to remain an unsung hero. But let there be no doubt now that \nMr. Vernard Hughes Webb, who passed away last year, leaves behind a \nlegacy of great accomplishment and service to his Nation. You see, for \nmany years, Mr. Webb was a pioneer in secret reconnaissance and \nsatellite technology that was crucial to America's efforts in the Cold \nWar. He was one of the developers on the top secret CORONA project, a \nspy satellite effort, and was awarded a medal of achievement for his \nlife's work by the Vice President of the United States.\n  Mr. Webb was born and raised in Letcher County, KY, and became the \nfirst in his family to go to college, graduating from Berea College in \n1940. The day after the Pearl Harbor attack, he joined the Army Air \nCorps. Becoming a bombardier on a B-17, he flew 30 combat missions over \nEurope during World War II.\n  Later in the war, Mr. Webb developed the crucial idea that would \nchange the course of not only his career, but perhaps his country as \nwell. Assigned to a combat mapping squadron that was tasked with taking \nreconnaissance pictures over the Philippines, he came up with an idea \nto greatly increase the accuracy and efficiency of the cameras.\n  Mr. Webb ran his idea past his Air Force superiors, and in their \ninfinite wisdom, they said no. So Mr. Webb did it anyway. He spent his \nown money to create a new camera. And when Vernard's superiors finally \nrealized the worth of his invention, they asked him to implement it \nacross the Air Force.\n  Vernard Webb eventually rose to the rank of major and became one of \nthis country's leading developers of cameras and aircraft for \nsurveillance purposes. He and his colleagues were in a race with the \nSoviets. By the 1950s, Vernard realized that his technology could be \nused not just in airplanes, but in satellites.\n  In 1958, Mr. Webb was assigned to the CORONA project, America's first \nefforts to develop a spy satellite. In 1960 the project accomplished \nits first success, gaining valuable intelligence on the Soviet Union \nand China. But for all those years Mr. Webb could only tell his friends \nand even his wife that he was an unimportant bureaucrat or engineer.\n  In 1995 the CIA declassified many documents pertaining to the CORONA \nproject, and only then were Mr. Webb's accomplishments made clear. \nAround that same time, Vice President Al Gore declared that ``the \nCORONA project represents a crucial development in aiding the national \nsecurity efforts of the United States.''\n  Vernard Webb passed away last Veterans Day. I extend my greatest \ncondolences to his wife Katie Louis Webb, their children and \ngrandchildren, other members of the Webb family and friends for their \nloss.\n  It is only fitting that after a lifetime of service to his country, \nmost of it under a cloak of secrecy that preventing him from receiving \nthe gratitude that he so richly deserved, that Mr. Vernard Webb will be \ninterred at Arlington National Cemetery later this month with full \nmilitary honors.\n  And I know my colleagues will join me in extending to the Webb family \nthis Senate's thanks and appreciation for Vernard Webb's sacrifice and \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article illustrating \nMr. Webb's heroic life and career be printed in today's Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Berea College Magazine, Summer 1996]\n\n               The Secret's Out: Webb was a Space Pioneer\n\n       A year ago, Vernard Webb could have gone to prison for \n     telling you about his coffee table.\n       The piece of furniture, which resembles a kettle drum with \n     a glass top, is made of gold-plated titanium.\n       Thirty years ago, during the height of the Cold War, the \n     table was the shell for a spy satellite used by the Air Force \n     and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to peek behind the \n     Iron Curtain. It is one of four such satellite ``buckets'' \n     still in existence. The other three are in the Smithsonian \n     institution.\n       For decades, Webb, a member of Berea's Class of 1940, could \n     only pass himself off as a pencil-pusher for the Air Force, \n     or an engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency. But \n     by no means was Webb telling the whole truth and nothing but \n     the truth.\n       Webb's wife, Katie Lou Chambers Webb, class of 1942, had \n     her suspicions. After three decades of relocation from one \n     Air Force Base to another and her husband's extended official \n     trips to places he wouldn't identify, she was certain that \n     whatever the government had him working on was very \n     important.\n       Then, in late 1995, the CIA declassified tens of thousands \n     of documents and it was evident. Webb was a major player in \n     the top secret CORONA project, America's first spy satellite \n     program, from 1957 until 1972. Webb, in fact, is a pioneer in \n     reconnaissance and satellite technology.\n       Before the CIA's declassification of CORONA documents in \n     August 1995, Webb and other members of the CORONA team were \n     called to the Pentagon for a medal presentation ceremony \n     which itself was classified. He was awarded a medal of \n     achievement by Vice President Al Gore and CIA officials. \n     However, no citation accompanies the medal, since the mission \n     for which he was being honored was still top secret at the \n     time.\n       ``We were not allowed to even speak with our spouses about \n     the classified projects,'' Webb said. ``It was for their own \n     protection, if anything else.''\n       Joining the Army the day after Pearl Harbor (Dec. 8, 1941), \n     Webb went into what was then the Army Air Corps. Because he \n     had been a photographer for the Berea College student \n     newspaper and listed ``photography'' as one of his skills on \n     a military questionnaire, it was assumed that Webb would be \n     capable with any sort of optical instrument, such as bomb \n     sights and some navigational equipment. He was assigned as a \n     bombardier on a B-17 and flew 30 combat missions over Europe, \n     bombing Axis petroleum sites, mostly in Germany, and dropping \n     supplies to the French Resistance.\n       Late in the war, Webb was assigned to a combat mapping \n     squadron flying reconnaissance missions from the Philippines. \n     While stationed there, he came up with an innovation that \n     would help shape the remainder of his career.\n       ``We used large cameras mounted in planes that were once \n     used as bombers,'' he said. ``On a typical mission, somewhere \n     between 30 and 40 percent of the film that was used on these \n     cameras would be useless, because we had failed to photograph \n     the target correctly.\n       ``It occurred to me that if one of our cameras were mounted \n     to a Norden bomb sight, it would greatly increase the \n     accuracy of the camera and the efficiency of the equipment. \n     There was a great similarity between the bomb sight and the \n     control of aerial cameras. They both operated on the same \n     principles. The variable on the operation of both was the \n     ratio between the velocity of the airplane and its height \n     above the ground. I thought it would be convenient to combine \n     the two.''\n       Webb's proposal was found unorthodox by Air Force officials \n     and permission to make the camera-bomb sight combination was \n     denied. Still, Webb was convinced it was a good idea.\n       ``I circumvented the red tape by buying a Norden bombsight \n     with my own money,'' he said. ``The U.S. government had given \n     the Philippine government some Norden sights, and I was able \n     to purchase one of them from the Philippine Air Force. I then \n     mounted the camera on the sight, and we started flying \n     missions with this device. The combination proved to be a \n     `natural.' ''\n       While the average reconnaissance mission had an accuracy of \n     photographing a specific site ``on target'' only 60 to 70 \n     percent at that time, an inspector general took notice of the \n     consistent 100 percent success rate of the flights using \n     Webb's camera-bomb sight combination.\n       ``The Air Force officials were always looking at air crew \n     effectiveness,'' he recalled. ``When they saw that we had no \n     rejected aerial photography for a period of months, they \n     began to look into the reasons why. I showed them how we had \n     used the camera and they earmarked me to introduce that \n     technology to the rest of the Air Force.\n       ``I was then transferred to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base \n     in Dayton, Ohio, where a team of engineers had been working \n     for almost a year to come up with something like the camera-\n     bomb sight combination I had put together. They ended up \n     scrapping their entire project as a result.''\n       The official testing of Webb's invention was conducted at \n     Rainey Air Force Base near Wichita, Kan. The Air Force's top \n     test pilot, Chuck Yeager, was assigned to try out the camera \n     system in an RB-50 observation plane and the results were, \n     according to Webb, outstanding. And the die was cast for his \n     career.\n       ``For the next 40 years or so of my career, I would be \n     associated with the reconnaissance efforts of the U.S. Air \n     Force and the Central Intelligence Agency,'' he said.\n       The following years saw Webb on various projects \n     surrounding the development of cameras and aircraft for \n     surveillance purposes. The RB-36, U-2 and SR-171 spy planes \n     used by the Air Force were fitted with cameras designed by \n     Webb and his team, who were headquartered at Wright-Patterson \n     Air Force Base until the late 1950s.\n       ``The U.S. Air Force continued to develop faster, higher-\n     flying aircraft, which was in response to the development of \n     faster and more accurate anti-aircraft weapons and fighter \n     aircraft developed by the Soviets. It was in the early 1950s \n     that we began to consider certain theories on using orbiting \n     satellites as a platform for reconnaissance work,'' Webb \n     said.\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\n       ``But we had some big hurdles to jump before we got that \n     far.''\n       ``There were four Air Force officers, Lt. Col. Charles Hoy, \n     Capt. Bernard Quinn, Capt. Louis E. Watson and I [Webb was a \n     major], stationed at Wright-Patterson, who met to analyze \n     what would be the future of our efforts. I had been flying \n     the high-altitude tests on the RB-36, up to 55,000 feet, and \n     we knew that we would have to fly higher and higher altitudes \n     due to the increased capability of Soviet lighter aircraft.\n       ``We knew the answer to our problem would be the altitude \n     of the aircraft or source of observation. We analyzed what \n     problems would result if we could attain an observation point \n     above the atmosphere. These, we narrowed down to three key \n     areas.\n       ``First, we knew that we needed to build better cameras. \n     Our ground resolution couldn't be accurate if we took the \n     cameras we were using then to a much higher altitude. Next, \n     we needed better film with a much higher resolution. Third, \n     we needed a better means to process the film. The \n     administration at Wright-Pat in those days was dominated by \n     civilian engineers, who didn't take kindly to such \n     suggestions from Air Force officers.''\n       In a historic move, Webb and the three officers maneuvered \n     themselves toward reassignment at the Air Force's Air \n     Research Development Command in Baltimore. The office was \n     administered by Gen. Marvin Dent, who supervised contracted \n     development of reconnaissance systems for the Air Force and \n     was a much more sympathetic listener to Webb and his \n     associates.\n       ``We were able to write the specifications for photographic \n     systems the Air Force required of the industrial contractors \n     then managing the projects at Wright-Pat,'' Webb recalled. \n     ``A meeting was called by the Air Force to speak with \n     industry representatives in Cincinnati regarding the Air \n     Force's needs. Gen. Dent gave the keynote speech. He \n     basically told industry representatives that the current \n     technology being used for reconnaissance was becoming quickly \n     outmoded and he strongly suggested that they work with our \n     group of officers in developing future reconnaissance \n     projects.''\n       The speech by Dent, made in 1955, led to the development by \n     Air Force-contracted private industry of the first \n     spacecraft-based cameras.\n       ``Within a week of the General's speech, we were visited by \n     representatives of three different contractors,'' Webb said. \n     ``One was a representative of Fairchild Camera and Instrument \n     Corporation, another was from Eastman Kodak and the third was \n     one of the most brilliant optical designers this country has \n     ever produced, Dr. James Baker. Fairchild said they could \n     build the camera, Kodak would handle the processing and Baker \n     would design the lenses required.\n       ``These individuals had done their homework and told us \n     they were confident that they could build a photographic \n     system that could meet our specifications. We had the camera \n     system from them in a year.''\n       The photographic equipment, which was originally designed \n     for the U-2 spy plane, was meant to operate at an altitude of \n     approximately 84,000 feet. The camera system designed by the \n     Fairchild-Kodak-Baker partnership had a 24-inch lens and a \n     better resolution than any other visual reconnaissance system \n     used at that time. However, the Soviet development of \n     satellite technology would change the nature of Webb's work \n     forever.\n       ``When we originally had the Fairchild camera developed, we \n     were still thinking airplanes,'' Webb recalled. ``But, the \n     development of Sputnik forced us to take the resulting \n     technology into space. When the Soviets successfully orbited \n     Sputnik, the first satellite in 1957, most of America was \n     horrified that we no longer had a technological edge in the \n     Cold War. With my team, we were exhilarated that it had been \n     proven a satellite could be successfully orbited. It gave us \n     an additional step toward our research goals.''\n       Webb and his co-workers already had an interest in \n     utilizing a space-based camera system for observation. Using \n     some foresight, Webb was able to get transferred to a unit \n     dedicated to guided missile research and incorporated what he \n     learned there into the great body of reconnaissance knowledge \n     he already possessed.\n       ``I was no longer influenced by people who knew only \n     airplanes,'' he said. ``We were now looking at using a camera \n     system that needed to produce high-quality photos from an \n     orbit of 100 miles, instead of 85,000 feet. But the \n     development of the Fairchild camera laid the groundwork for \n     what we would be using later on. The lens we used with the \n     CORONA system was a slight variation of Dr. Baker's 24-inch \n     lens used on the U-2.''\n       The CORONA program began in 1955 with numerous experiments \n     at a classified site near Palo Alto, California. Webb was \n     assigned to the program, the United States' first efforts at \n     using a spy satellite, in the fall of 1958. ``Our program's \n     cover name, which was operated under scientific pretenses, \n     was Discoverer,'' Webb said. ``We already had a lot of \n     ballistic information that had been done by the guided \n     missile people at Lockheed, the primary contractor of the \n     program.''\n       The early months of the CORONA program were frustrating for \n     Webb and the Lockheed team. Rocket failures, camera problems \n     and film difficulties all combined to serve as an expensive \n     tutor for the group. The CORONA system consisted of a large \n     orbiting camera, which would be linked to a ``bucket'' \n     containing approximately 4,000 feet of film. After receiving \n     radio commands from Webb and his associates, the satellite \n     was designed to photograph designated areas with the film \n     spooling back into the bucket. The bucket would then detach \n     from the camera and plunge back through Earth's atmosphere \n     where it would be recovered by aircraft upon a parachute \n     reentry.\n       On August 18, 1960, the first fully successful CORONA \n     mission was accomplished, with the satellite photographing \n     areas in the Soviet Union and China. An American flag, stowed \n     in the satellite's bucket, was presented to President Dwight \n     D. Eisenhower in a secret White House ceremony later that \n     month.\n       The White House, however, was even more pleased with the \n     photographs obtained by CORONA. ``That single mission \n     obtained more photos from behind the Iron Curtain than all \n     the combined U-2 missions flown up to that time,'' Webb said. \n     ``It was considered an outstanding success, and we were in \n     business.''\n       The CORONA project was utilized successfully during the \n     Cuban Missile Crisis, most of the Vietnam War and an \n     important period of the Cold War. Portions of the project's \n     development and results are still classified, but many of the \n     spy photos have been made available to the public on the \n     Internet by the CIA and Air Force.\n       ``The CORONA project represents a crucial development in \n     aiding the national security efforts of the United States,'' \n     said Vice President Gore in a ceremony held at the Pentagon \n     last year.\n       Originally from Letcher County, Ky., Webb credits Berea for \n     getting him on track for what he considers a fascinating \n     career. ``At Berea they taught me to work. They gave me the \n     discipline I needed to do well,'' Webb said.\n       Oh, and just how did Webb get his ``coffee table,'' anyway? \n     ``When they changed the design of the satellite and no longer \n     needed these, a crate arrived at my office,'' Webb \n     remembered.\n       ``When I saw what was in it, I called my supervisor and \n     asked why it had been sent to me. He said, `We have been \n     given an order from the highest possible authority that the \n     bucket is yours to keep. Your efforts have been appreciated. \n     Now, don`t ask any more questions.' And he hung up.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2835-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2835-S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING HARRY HOE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I rise today to \nnote the passing of one of southeastern Kentucky's most notable \ncitizens, Mr. Harry Morgan Hoe. Mr. Hoe was a decorated World War II \nveteran who fought in the Battle of the Bulge under the command of GEN \nGeorge Patton. He recalled once what General Patton said to his men \nthen:\n  ``Half of you guys are not going home, you know that, don't you? \nYou're over here to take that hill, and if you don't take it, I want to \nsee the truckload of dog tags that show me that you proved yourself.''\n  Well, Harry Hoe did return home, after fighting in five major \nEuropean campaigns, and he certainly did prove himself. He received the \nSilver Star for gallantry in action, the Bronze Star, the Oak Leaf \nCluster for heroic action and the French Liberation Appreciation Medal.\n  But Mr. Hoe's heroic service in World War II is just the beginning of \nhis incredible life story. He would go on to meet the love of his life, \nhis wife Mary, in college and return to his hometown of Middlesboro to \nwork in the family foundry business. He would be elected to the State \nlegislature, invest countless hours in volunteer work and community \nservice, and become a role model for me and many others for his \nleadership, his humility and his dedication to the people of the \nBluegrass State.\n  With his wife Mary, who passed away some time ago, Harry had three \nchildren and several grandchildren. I wish to offer my greatest \ncondolences to the Hoe family and all of Harry's many friends who are \nmourning his loss.\n  Mr. President, a wonderful article that appeared today in the \nMiddlesboro Daily News tells the story of Mr. Harry Hoe's life and \ncareer. It is a fitting tribute to a fine man and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n\n       There being no objection, the article was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Middlesboro Daily News, \n                             May 10, 2011]\n\n                    Middlesboro Loses `Crown Jewel'\n\n                    (By Lorie Settles/Staff Writer)\n\n       Middlesboro.--Many in Middlesboro are mourning the passing \n     of one of the city's most influential people--Harry Morgan \n     Hoe.\n       ``The city has lost one of its crowned jewels,'' lamented \n     longtime friend and businessman, Dewey Morgan. ``He and Mary \n     Bob (his\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\n     wife) were always generous and welcoming to everyone. They \n     were people people.''\n       Hoe spent his life serving his community and his nation. A \n     World War II veteran, Hoe fought in five major European \n     campaigns including the Battle of the Bulge, and served under \n     the infamous General George Patton.\n       Hoe spoke of his experience under Patton in a Daily News \n     interview in 2010.\n       ``He said: Half of you guys are not going home, you know \n     that don't you? You're over here to take that hill and if you \n     don't take it, I want to see the truckload of dog tags that \n     show me that you proved yourself.' So we fought. We were his \n     soldiers--that was all we knew to do,'' he remembered.\n       Dewey Morgan also remarked on Hoe's service to the nation.\n       ``The thing a lot of people might not know about Harry is \n     that he was a hero in the Battle of the Bulge. He was a \n     member of the American force that pushed Hitler back into \n     Germany. And for the rest of his life, he suffered with his \n     feet that had been frozen during the battle,'' Morgan \n     reported.\n       Hoe was decorated with the Silver Star for gallantry in \n     action, the Bronze Star, the Oak Leaf Cluster for heroic \n     action and the French Liberation Appreciation Medal--all \n     before reaching the age of 19.\n       Hoe's achievements only increased from there. In 1953, \n     Harry Morgan Hoe was honored as one of the three Outstanding \n     Young Men of Kentucky. Hoe worked as the Director of the \n     Kentucky Utilities company for 19 years, and was honored by \n     the company with a $100,000 donation that was awarded to \n     Clear Creek Baptist Bible College. He served as a board \n     member of the college for 20 years and as Chairman for two \n     terms.\n       In 1953, Hoe became the founder of the first racially \n     integrated Little League Baseball organization south of the \n     Ohio River. He served as the Middlesboro League's president \n     for seven years.\n       Hoe worked as General Chairman for the dedication of the \n     Cumberland Gap National Park in 1959. He was the Director of \n     Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival Board for more than 50 \n     years and served twice as President.\n       Harry also acted as Chairman of the Board of Directors of \n     Kentuckians for Better Transportation and Associated \n     Industries in Kentucky. He spent two three-year terms as \n     Director of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce.\n       In 1964, Harry Hoe decided to try his hand at politics. He \n     was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, where \n     he served for six years. The passage of the drunk driving \n     bill that he authored in 1968 was the highlight of his \n     political career.\n       Harry was the Minority Whip and the Assistant Minority \n     Floor Leader. He spent twelve years serving on the Kentucky \n     Republican State Central Committee and was inducted into the \n     Republican 5th Congressional District Hall of Fame by \n     Congressman Hal Rogers.\n       As an eyewitness to paramount moments in the history of the \n     U.S., the state of Kentucky, and the city of Middlesboro, Hoe \n     served as a reference guide to many who knew him.\n       ``He was a walking history book,'' said friend Lawrence \n     Tuck. ``He was a very special friend to my wife Barbara and \n     myself. He helped so many people and we will miss him so \n     much.''\n       Tuck said that Hoe had attended last Wednesday's Kiwanis \n     meeting, a club he was a member of since 1949. He also \n     attended Sunday services at First Baptist Church where he had \n     served as a Deacon, Sunday School teacher, and choir member.\n       Hoe was additionally a lifetime member of the Salvation \n     Army Advisory Board and was awarded the Salvation Army \n     William Booth Award, the highest honor given by the charity, \n     after serving as Chairman.\n       Many also know Hoe for his work with the family business, \n     the J.R. Hoe and Sons foundry.\n       Hoe was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Mary, whom \n     he met while the two were students at the University of \n     Tennessee. He referred to her as his ``secret weapon'' in the \n     Daily News interview. The couple had three children together \n     and several grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2836-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2836-S2837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING LOGIC SUPPLY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I wish to share a business success \nstory from my home State of Vermont.\n  For years Vermont has been branded as the State of milk, apples, and \nmaple syrup. But along the ridgelines of the Green Mountains and in the \nvalleys along the many rivers that find their way to Lake Champlain, a \nnew high-tech and green-tech sector is quickly emerging as an economic \ndriver for both Vermont and the entire country. The Burlington Free \nPress recently highlighted one such company--Logic Supply in South \nBurlington, VT.\n  I have heard many great things about Logic Supply's work and their \ncommitment to Vermont. Company owners Lisa and Roland Groeneveld have \nkept Logic Supply extremely active in our State's high-tech business \nnetworking community both as members of the Vermont Software Developers \nAlliance and as regular participants in the Vermont 3.0 Creative Tech \nJam. In 2010, KeyBank and Vermont Business Magazine recognized Logic \nSupply as one of Vermont's fastest growing companies.\n  As Logic Supply has grown, they have helped brand Vermont as a place \nwhere businesses can succeed, and where people looking to work in the \neconomy of tomorrow can find a job today. I commend them for their hard \nwork and success.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the May 9, 2011, Burlington Free Press \narticle entitled ``Logic Dictates, Couple Prove Tech Has Place On Vt. \nBuz Scene'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 9, 2011]\n\n      Logic Dictates, Couple Prove Tech Has Place on Vt. Biz Scene\n\n                          (By Dan D'Ambrosio)\n\n       In 2002, Lisa and Roland Groeneveld left behind their \n     corporate telecommunications jobs in the Netherlands, where \n     they had met, and moved to Vermont without work. Roland is \n     Dutch. Lisa is a native of Barre and wanted to live close to \n     family after her father died.\n       The company she worked for, WorldCom, was imploding \n     spectacularly, filing the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history \n     at the time. The company he worked for, an Anglo-Dutch \n     consultancy called CMG with about 14,000 employees, was about \n     to be swallowed up by an even bigger company, Logica, based \n     in Reading, England, now with almost 40,000 employees.\n       So, they went their own way. In less than a decade, the \n     Groenevelds have built a high-tech business in South \n     Burlington, Logic Supply, Inc., that has made a profit from \n     day one.\n       After launching with $40,000 the couple had saved, the \n     company is on track to reach $16 million in sales in 2011--up \n     nearly 40 percent from 2010 sales of $11.5 million. It is \n     debt free, recently moved into a $2.3 million building with \n     room for expansion and, in theory, will reach $350 million in \n     sales by 2020 if it meets the BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) \n     set by its management and employees. That acronym, by the \n     way, is proudly displayed on a bulletin board in the break \n     room.\n\n\n                  How's that for landing on your feet?\n\n       After moving to Vermont, Lisa and Roland's first order of \n     business was to build a house on property Lisa's parents \n     owned where they had a small vacation cabin. Roland bought a \n     book on how to build your own house, hired a carpenter, and \n     got to work, with Lisa's help.\n       ``It literally was nine months of pounding nails, which was \n     a lot of fun, very different than IT,'' Roland said. ``Once \n     you start doing it, it's pretty straightforward.''\n       While their house was being built, Lisa landed a job in \n     Boston at a business some of her former colleagues from \n     WorldCom had started, called Fiberlink. After the house was \n     finished in 2003, the couple decided to move to Boston for \n     Lisa's job.\n       ``We found an apartment there,'' Roland said. ``What am I \n     to do next? Together we sat down and wrote some business \n     plans.''\n       Years earlier, Roland had started a company in the \n     Netherlands, and sold it a year and a half later to an \n     Internet company during the dot.com boom. So he knew the \n     feeling of being an entrepreneur.\n       ``Running your own business is nice, it gives you a lot of \n     freedom and independence,'' Roland said. ``I wanted to get \n     back to that sort of feeling and idea.''\n       The couple complemented each other when it came to \n     launching a high-tech business. Roland had a degree in \n     electrical engineering and computer science. Lisa had an \n     extensive business background, having worked for what was the \n     highest flyer in telecom before it crashed to earth.\n       But before they got to the plan that would lead to Logic \n     Supply, the couple took a couple of detours.\n       ``One was importing high-end coffee makers from Europe,'' \n     Roland said. ``You're drinking a cup of coffee and you think, \n     Boy wouldn't it be nice to get a good cup of coffee!'''\n       Of course, there were already companies out there importing \n     nice coffee pots from Europe. But there weren't so many doing \n     what Logic Supply would end up doing, an idea that came from \n     the development of smaller and smaller, and more and more \n     rugged computers.\n       ``We make very high-end computer systems for industrial \n     embedded applications,'' Roland said, summarizing the company \n     he and Lisa launched in their Boston apartment eight and a \n     half years ago. ``We never really sell to end users. \n     Typically we sell to a company that has their own product, \n     their own sales force and their own marketing. We're \n     basically the engineering department for the company.''\n       Logic Supply makes the computers, for example, for Project \n     54, a system for police cruisers and ambulances developed at \n     the University of New Hampshire that integrates the functions \n     of the vehicle into a single interface that can be operated \n     by voice or a touch screen, simplifying life for a police \n     officer or EMT in an emergency situation.\n       ``It's a computer that runs the police car,'' Roland said. \n     ``When they're driving, cops can\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\n     interact with the computer by voice: `Sirens on, lights on.' \n     They can request initial information on a license plate, \n     operate video cameras. The computer is not taking over the \n     functions, but controlling the functions.''\n       Logic Supply also makes custom computers for industrial \n     automation--in slaughterhouses, where they can be sprayed \n     with blood; or tire manufacturing, where they're subject to a \n     lot of moisture and particles flying around, along with shock \n     and vibration.\n       ``Our computers are designed to withstand all that,'' \n     Roland said. ``A typical PC will fail. They can't handle that \n     sort of environment.''\n       Logic Supply is in the medical market as well.\n       ``One of our customers converts analog X-ray machines to \n     make them digital,'' Roland said. ``Our computers will \n     capture the images from those older machines and convert them \n     and make those images available online for doctors.''\n\n\n                             Internet savvy\n\n       Remarkably, the company has experienced its explosive \n     growth almost exclusively through its website, making search \n     engine optimization a top priority.\n       ``Our primary customers are engineers, and engineers don't \n     like to talk to sales people, they like to do their own \n     research,'' Roland said. ``I can say this stuff because I'm \n     an engineer myself.''\n       The website gives engineers all the information they need \n     to place their orders. The Logic Supply sales team does \n     follow up with human contact, just to make sure their \n     customers are satisfied and have everything they need, Roland \n     says, but if they want to be left alone to place their orders \n     in peace and not talk to anybody, Logic Supply obliges.\n       The Groenevelds' plan for the next 10 years is to grow at a \n     sustained rate of 30 percent to 40 percent a year, which \n     presumably would get them to the BHAG posted on the lunch \n     room bulletin board. If anything slows them down, Roland \n     says, it's likely to be the difficulty of finding qualified \n     employees in Vermont.\n       ``Vermont is not well known as a tech state, or even a \n     great state for employment,'' Roland said. ``People think \n     there's not a future for them here and they leave. We need to \n     stop that as a community. We need to make sure people are \n     aware there are opportunities here and that there are great \n     businesses here.''\n       Mark Heyman is Logic Supply's director of human resources, \n     and recently joined the board of directors of Vermont \n     Software Developers' Alliance. He said the alliance is \n     planning to broaden into a representative group for the \n     entire tech industry in the state, highlighting companies in \n     the state like his own, and many others.\n       ``There's a reason not only to stay in Vermont, but for \n     other people to come here,'' Heyman said. ``We see ourselves \n     along with other companies as leading a resurgence. Get the \n     word out, let's attract people. Like geeking out on a \n     computer? I've got a sandbox for you. As people come walking \n     through here applying for a job, they often say they never \n     even realized something like this existed in Vermont.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2837-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2837-S2838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. MATTHEW FRIEDMAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate Dr. Matthew Friedman, a finalist for the 2011 Samuel J. \nHeyman Service to America Medals. Dr. Friedman is the executive \ndirector of the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, \nPTSD, headquartered in White River Junction, VT. He was a finalist for \nthe Career Achievement Medal given annually to a federal employee for \nsignificant accomplishments over a lifetime of achievement in public \nservice.\n  Dr. Friedman is a pioneer in the field of traumatic stress disorders. \nFor nearly 40 years now he has been working to identify the causes of \nand treatments for PTSD and advocating for those afflicted with the \ndisorder. It is the cause of his career.\n  While PTSD is now recognized as a serious affliction associated with \nthe stresses and violence of war, this was not always the case. In the \nearly days of his work, Dr. Friedman had to convince skeptics both \ninside and outside of the Veterans Administration that many returning \ntroops were suffering from PTSD. His efforts eventually persuaded \nveterans to accept the disease within their own communities. He was \namong the first Veterans Administration clinicians to recognize the \ndepth and breadth of the disorder among returning Vietnam veterans. In \n1973, he established one of the earliest groups to provide mental \nhealth assistance to former soldiers.\n  In 1989, after years of distinguished work in the field, Dr. Friedman \nwas named as the first executive director of the then-new National \nCenter for PTSD based in Vermont, in White River Junction. Since then, \nthe center has grown into a group of seven centers located at VA \nmedical centers and in connection with university medical research \nprograms around the country. These seven centers have conducted \nunprecedented research, leading to critical advancements in the \nunderstanding, treatment, and prevention of traumatic disorders.\n  The Service to America Medals are some of the most prestigious awards \ngiven to celebrate America's civil servants. The medals will be \npresented on September 15 in Washington, DC.\n  Dr. Friedman has spent years studying, treating and advocated for our \nbrave veterans who have been psychologically affected by war or other \ntragedies. Whether or not he is ultimately selected for it, Dr. \nFriedman is certainly deserving of the Samuel J. Heyman Career \nAchievement Medal, I commend him on his selection as a finalist, and I \nthank him for a lifetime of public service to America's veterans.\n  Dr. Friedman was mentioned in an article entitled Finalists for \ngovernment's ``Oscars,'' recently published in the Washington Post. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 2, 2011]\n\n                 Finalists for Government's ``Oscars''\n\n\n      Service medals will be awarded to nine outstanding employees\n\n                             (By Lisa Rein)\n\n       One is leading the effort to reduce tobacco-related disease \n     by regulating what goes into cigarettes. Another helped \n     disrupt drug traffickers from laundering billions of dollars \n     through Mexican banks. Another developed a strategy to make \n     sure every American has access to high-speed Internet \n     service.\n       These are among 34 federal workers nominated for the 2011 \n     Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal awards. The service \n     medals--or ``Sammies,'' as they are known--are the Academy \n     Awards of the federal world and honor distinguished public \n     servants in a variety of fields, including transportation \n     safety and data systems. With civil servants a key focal \n     point in the debate over the size of government, the \n     nonprofit Partnership for Public Service hopes its annual \n     Service to America medals will act as a reminder of federal \n     workers' commitment to their jobs.\n       Nine employees will receive awards this fall for their work \n     on a variety of issues, both in the headlines and under the \n     radar. One among them will be honored as federal employee of \n     the year.\n       The 34 finalists, selected from more than 400 nominations \n     by their bosses and colleagues, will be honored Thursday at a \n     breakfast on Capitol Hill as part of Public Service \n     Recognition Week, May 1-7, intended to recognize the efforts \n     of federal, state and local government workers.\n       The nominees hail from Menlo Park, Calif., to White River \n     Junction, Vt., with 23 working in the Washington area. Some \n     are approaching the end of a long career in government, while \n     others are in their 20s.\n       The Washington Post chose a random sample of finalists to \n     ask about their work:\n       When the Food and Drug Administration gained new authority \n     over tobacco products in 2009, it turned to doctor and public \n     health expert Lawrence Deyton to launch the Center for \n     Tobacco Products. Deyton's 30-year career in government has \n     focused on fighting hepatitis, AIDS among veterans and other \n     public health threats.\n       With a $450 million budget, Deyton, 58, led a successful \n     effort to prohibit tobacco manufacturers from displaying the \n     labels ``light,'' ``low'' and ``mild.'' In June, the center \n     will issue regulations requiting graphic new health warnings \n     on cigarette packages and billboards. Next up: Establishing \n     which ingredients in cigarettes could be removed or changed \n     to make them safer.\n       ``We have a fundamental authority now that no other country \n     has,'' Deyton said.\n       The Defense Department's inspector general has long had a \n     system for protecting service members who report wrongdoing. \n     But until Dan Meyer and his team were hired in 2004, civilian \n     whisleblowers who suffered from retaliation had no advocate.\n       Meyer, 46, created a program that protects employees who \n     report national security and procurement fraud. These \n     whistleblowers often lose their security clearances as \n     punishment. Meyer once blew the whistle himself when he was a \n     Navy line officer who disclosed flaws in the investigation of \n     a 1989 explosion that killed 47 American sailors.\n       ``We needed to approach this as protection of our \n     sources,'' he said.\n       When the Environmental Protection Agency came out late last \n     year with a new plan to restore the Chesapeake Bay, 31-year-\n     old Katherine Antos cajoled sometime-warring state \n     governments, advocacy groups and industry to cooperate to \n     increase their accountability. ``If we are going to be \n     successful, we needed the right buy-in,'' said Antos,\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\n     leader of the bay program's Water Quality Team. The biggest \n     problem was conveying what might seem simple: ``What needs to \n     be done, who is going to do it and how,'' she said.\n       Three years ago, the National Institutes of Health \n     attempted to pick up where the country's prestigious medical \n     centers had left off, cracking the code of diseases that \n     cannot be diagnosed.\n       William Gahl, a pediatrician specializing in clinical and \n     biochemical genetics, took on the challenge as the first \n     director of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program. Interest was so \n     strong that Gahl's $280,000 budget quickly grew to $3.5 \n     million. Of 5,000 applicants, 400 have been accepted, though \n     a medical diagnosis has been found for just 60.\n       ``We admit failure in the majority of our cases,'' Gahl \n     said. ``But these are people who have been everywhere else.''\n       Analysts at the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes \n     Enforcement Network have long suspected that Mexican drug \n     traffickers were smuggling cash from their narcotics sales \n     back into Mexico for deposit in local banks. Senior \n     intelligence research analyst Ann Martin, 29, analyzed tens \n     of thousands of bank transactions and discovered last year \n     that billions of dollars in illegal drug profits were \n     entering the Mexican banking system from the United States. \n     Her work led the Mexican government to issue new regulations \n     capping the amount of American dollars that can flow to \n     Mexican banks.\n       Post-traumatic stress disorder is a well-known mental \n     health issue facing service members, but when Matthew \n     Friedman began his career working with veterans 40 years ago, \n     the term did not exist.\n       Today, the psychiatrist and pharmacologist is executive \n     director of the Veterans Affairs Department's National Center \n     for PTSD, based in White River Junction, Vt. Since the center \n     was created in 1989, Friedman has expanded it to seven VA \n     medical centers across the country. He overcame many skeptics \n     along the way, who believed the affliction was not a serious \n     disorder. At 71, Friedman now wants to understand how to \n     prevent the disorder and why some soldiers suffer from it \n     while others don't.\n       ``What is the difference between resilient and vulnerable \n     people?'' he asked.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2838-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STAMP OUT HUNGER FOOD DRIVE\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I honor the National Association of \nLetter Carriers' Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. Every year, on the second \nSaturday in May, letter carriers across the country collect \nnonperishable food as part of the Nation's largest one-day food drive, \ndistributing the donations to local food banks. In these difficult \neconomic times--as families continue to make ends meet and food banks \ndeal with tightening budgets--these efforts are especially important.\n  The Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive is just one example of how letter \ncarriers work to make a difference in the lives of those they serve. \nSince the food drive was launched 19 years ago, they have collected a \nbillion pounds of food, including 77.3 million pounds last year alone. \nThey do all of this in service of the communities in which the live and \nwork. And the work they do remains essential. Even in today's \nelectronic society, millions of us depend on letter carriers to deliver \neverything from birthday cards to life-saving prescription medications.\n  In recognition of all letter carriers, their hard work and their \ncommitment to their communities, I ask that all of us join with them in \nsupport of their one-day food drive and make a donation of \nnonperishable food items this Saturday, May 14, 2011, the National \nAssociation of Letter Carriers' Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2838-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              NEW HAMPSHIRE TIMBERLAND OWNERS ASSOCIATION\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I recognize and congratulate \nthe New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association on achieving a \ncommendable feat--100 years of successful forest management, \nconservation, and awareness efforts.\n  The New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association will hold its \ncentennial annual meeting this year in Whitefield, NH, at the Mountain \nView Grand Resort from Friday, May 20 through Sunday, May 22, where the \nassociation will gather at Weeks State Park--the former summer home of \nSenator John Wingate Weeks, the author of the 1911 Weeks Act, a \nlandmark piece of conservation legislation which paved the way for the \nformation of the White Mountain National Forest.\n  The New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association was established as a \nnonprofit organization in 1911, with William R. Brown serving as \npresident. By 1912, the association had 32 members. Today, the \nassociation celebrates 100 years of hard work and its more than 1,400 \nmembers representing land ownership of over 1 million acres.\n  The association's initial objectives were the protection and \nimprovement of timberland and property rights. The members' efforts \nfocused on planning and acting on matters relating to forest \nmanagement, legislation, and taxes. Today, the association is a \nstatewide coalition of landowners, forest industry professionals, \ngovernment officials, and supporters who work together to promote \nforest management and conservation of New Hampshire's working forests \nand to ensure a vibrant forest products industry.\n  Since its inception, the association has continuously grown and \nexpanded its efforts. Working with the State of New Hampshire, the \nFederal Government, and local governments, the association has ensured \nthat New Hampshire's timberlands are managed for the benefit of \ntimberland owners and, ultimately, the best interests of the timber \neconomy of our great State. Together, landowners and forest industry \nprofessionals share the understanding that a well-managed forest is \nessential to New Hampshire's economy and our identity. The New \nHampshire Timberland Owners Association represents some of the most \ntreasured characteristics of the Granite State--teamwork, foresight in \ninnovation, vision, and initiative.\n  As the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association celebrates its \nfirst 100 years, I commend their efforts and congratulate them on a job \nwell done. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the New \nHampshire Timberland Owners Association's centennial \ncelebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2838-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 940.

A bill to establish a research, development, demonstration, \nand commercial application program to promote research of appropriate \ntechnologies for heavy duty plug-in hybrid vehicles, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Heavy Duty \nHybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act, along with \nmy colleagues Senator Feinstein and Senator Kohl. This bill will \naccelerate research of plug-in hybrid technologies for heavy duty \ntrucks.\n  The Federal Government, through the 21st Century Truck Partnership, \nhas for some years provided funding to conduct research and development \nfor the modernization of this industry, in association with private \nindustry partners. Despite the significant potential benefits of hybrid \ntrucks, however, research in this area was eliminated recently to focus \non passenger vehicles. This decision was shortsighted.\n  Truck operators in Maine and around the country are again being hard \nhit by increases in the price of diesel fuel. Given that our nation \nrelies upon the trucking industry to keep our economy running by \nproviding timely delivery of food, industrial products, and raw \nmaterials, we must develop alternatives that make the industry less \nsusceptible to dramatic changes in oil prices. Hybrid power \ntechnologies offer tremendous promise of reducing this critical \nindustry's dependence on oil.\n  Trucks consume large amounts of imported fuels. Successfully \ntransitioning trucks to hybrid power technology will reduce our \nNation's oil consumption and improve our energy security. The Heavy \nDuty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act \ndirects the Department of Energy to expand its research in advanced \nenergy storage technologies to include hybrid trucks as well as \npassenger vehicles. Current hybrid technology works well for cars that \ncan be made with lightweight materials and travel short distances. \nTrucks need to be constructed with heavy materials commensurate with \nthe heavy loads they carry and, if they are going to be plug-in \nhybrids, travel relatively long distances between charges. Thus \nadvances in battery and other technologies are needed to make plug-in \ntrucks commercially viable and will require more advanced technology \nthan is required for passenger cars.\n  Grant recipients will be required to complete two phases. In phase \none, recipients must build one plug-in hybrid truck, collect data, and \nmake performance comparisons with traditional trucks. Recipients who \nshow promise in phase one will be invited to enter into phase two where \nthey must produce 50 plug-in hybrid trucks and report on the \ntechnological and market obstacles to widespread production. The bill \nwill also sponsor two smaller programs to deal with drive-train issues \nand the impact of the wide use of plug-in hybrid technology on the \nelectrical grid. In total, the bill authorizes the expenditure of $16 \nmillion for each of fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014.\n  We need a comprehensive approach to modernize commercial \ntransportation in the 21st century. The Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle \nResearch, Development, and Demonstration Act is one vital piece of that \napproach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Coons, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 941. A bill to strengthen families engagement in the education of \ntheir children; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Family Engagement in \nEducation Act with my colleagues Senator Coons and Senator Whitehouse. \nI thank Representative Platts for introducing the House companion of \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  Our legislation will strengthen family engagement in education at the \nlocal, State, and national levels. It will empower parents by \nincreasing school district resources dedicated to family engagement \nactivities from 1 percent to 2 percent of the district Title I \nallocation. It will also improve quality of family engagement practices \nat the school level by requiring school districts to develop and \nimplement standards-based policies and practices for family-school \npartnerships. It will build State and local capacity for effective \nfamily engagement in education by setting aside 1 percent of the State \nTitle I allocation for local family engagement in education centers to \nprovide innovative programming and services, such as leadership \ntraining and family literacy, to local families and to remove barriers \nto family engagement, and for supporting state-level activities. \nFinally, our bill will restructure the Parent Information Resource \nCenters so that they can provide statewide technical assistance in line \nwith the quality framework developed by the U.S. Department of \nEducation, Harvard Family Research Project, and Southwest Educational \nDevelopment Laboratory. At the national level, our legislation will \nrequire the Secretary of Education to convene practitioners, \nresearchers, and other experts in the field of family engagement in \neducation to develop recommended metrics for measuring the quality and \noutcomes of family engagement in a child's education.\n  Research demonstrates that family engagement in a child's education \nincreases student achievement, improves attendance, and reduces dropout \nrates. A recent study by Anne Seitsinger and Steven Brand at the \nUniversity of Rhode Island's Center for School Improvement and \nEducational Policy found that students whose parents support their \neducation through learning activities at home and discuss the \nimportance of education perform better in school. Yet too often, family \nengagement is not built into our school improvement efforts in a \nsystematic way. The Family Engagement in Education Act will promote \nmeaningful family engagement policies and programs at the national, \nState, and local levels to ensure that all students are on track to be \ncareer and college-ready.\n  The bill builds on my successful efforts in the last reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the 2001 No Child Left \nBehind Act, to incorporate provisions throughout the law to strengthen \nand boost parental involvement. It is also in line with the \nAdministration's blueprint for reauthorization, which calls for \ndoubling the amount that school districts are required to set aside for \nparental involvement and encouraging States to use some of their Title \nI funding to support local family engagement centers in education.\n  Developed with the National Family, School, and Community Engagement \nWorking Group, which includes organizations such as National PTA, \nUnited Way Worldwide, Harvard Family Research Project, and National \nCouncil of La Raza, and endorsed by hundreds of local, State, and \nnational organizations, this legislation represents the broad consensus \nthat we must do a better job of engaging families in all aspects of \ntheir children's education.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Family Engagement in Education \nAct, and to work for its inclusion in the forthcoming debate to \nreauthorize and renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 941\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res 175\n\n       Whereas, since 1993, the territorial integrity of Georgia \n     has been reaffirmed by the international community and 36 \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       Whereas the United States-Georgia Strategic Charter, signed \n     on January 9, 2009, underscores that ``support for each \n     other's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and \n     inviolability of borders constitutes the foundation of our \n     bilateral relations'';\n       Whereas, in October 2010, at the meeting of the United \n     States-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, Secretary of \n     State Hillary Clinton stated, ``The United States will not \n     waiver in its support for Georgia's sovereignty and \n     territorial integrity.'';\n       Whereas the White House released a fact sheet on July 24, \n     2010, calling for ``Russia to end its occupation of the \n     Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia'' and for \n     ``a return of international observers to the two occupied \n     regions of Georgia'';\n       Whereas Vice President Joseph Biden stated in Tbilisi in \n     July 2009 that the United States ``will not recognize \n     Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states'';\n       Whereas, according to the Government of Georgia's ``State \n     Strategy on Occupied Territories,'' the Government of Georgia \n     has committed itself to a policy of peaceful engagement, the \n     protection of economic and human rights, freedom of movement, \n     and the preservation of cultural heritage, language, and \n     identity for the people of Abkhazia and South Ossetia;\n       Whereas the August 2008 conflict between the Governments of \n     Russia and Georgia resulted in civilian and military \n     causalities, the violation of the sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity of Georgia, and large numbers of internally-\n     displaced persons;\n       Whereas large numbers of persons remain displaced as a \n     result of the August 2008 conflict as well as the earlier \n     conflicts of the 1990s;\n       Whereas the August 12, 2008, ceasefire agreement, agreed to \n     by the Governments of Russia and Georgia provides that all \n     troops of the Russian Federation shall be withdrawn to pre-\n     conflict positions;\n       Whereas the August 12, 2008, ceasefire agreement provides \n     that free access shall be granted to organizations providing \n     humanitarian assistance in regions affected by violence in \n     August 2008;\n       Whereas the recognition by the Government of Russia of \n     Abkhazia and South Ossetia on August 26, 2008, was in \n     violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \n     Georgia;\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch concluded in its World Report \n     2011 that ``Russia continued to occupy Georgia's breakaway \n     regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and strengthened its \n     military presence in the region by establishing a military \n     base and placing an advanced surface-to-air missile system in \n     Abkhazia'';\n       Whereas the parties have taken some constructive steps in \n     recent months, including the resumption of direct flights \n     between Russia and Georgia, Russian troop withdrawal from the \n     Georgian village of Perevi, and regular participation in the \n     Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism;\n       Whereas these positive steps neither adequately address the \n     humanitarian situation on the ground nor constitute full \n     compliance with the terms of the August 2008 ceasefire \n     agreement;\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2010, before the European \n     Parliament, Georgian President Saakashvili declared that \n     ``Georgia will never use force to restore its territorial \n     integrity and sovereignty'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Clinton stated in Tbilisi on \n     July 5, 2010, ``We continue to

in \n     Abkhazia and South Ossetia continue to be present without the \n     consent of the Government of Georgia or a mandate from the \n     United Nations or other multilateral organizations;\n       Whereas, at the April 15, 2011, meeting in Berlin between \n     the foreign ministers of Georgia and NATO, Secretary of State \n     Clinton stated, ``U.S. support for Georgia's sovereignty and \n     territorial integrity remains steadfast. . . . We share \n     Georgian concerns regarding recent Russian activities that \n     can negatively affect regional stability.'';\n       Whereas, on April 25-26, 2011, Foreign Minister of Russia \n     Sergei Lavrov made a high-profile visit to Abkhazia and South \n     Ossetia, which was immediately criticized by the Department \n     of State as ``inconsistent with the principle of territorial \n     integrity and Georgia's internationally recognized borders'';\n       Whereas the Senate supports United States efforts to \n     develop a productive relationship with the Russian Federation \n     in areas of mutual interest, including non-proliferation and \n     arms control, cooperation concerning the failure of the \n     Government of Iran to meet its international obligations with \n     regard to its nuclear programs, counter-terrorism, \n     Afghanistan, anti-piracy, and economics and trade; and\n       Whereas the Senate agrees that these efforts must not \n     compromise longstanding United States policy or United States \n     support for its allies and partners worldwide: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that it is the policy of the United States to \n     support the sovereignty, independence, and territorial \n     integrity of Georgia and the inviolability of its borders, \n     and to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as regions of \n     Georgia occupied by the Russian Federation;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of Russia to take steps to \n     fulfill all the terms and conditions of the 2008 ceasefire \n     agreements between Georgia and Russia, including returning \n     military forces to pre-war positions and ensuring access to \n     international humanitarian aid to all those affected by the \n     conflict;\n       (3) urges the Government of Russia and the authorities in \n     control in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to allow \n     for the full and dignified return of internally-displaced \n     persons and international missions to the territories of \n     Abkhazia and South Ossetia;\n       (4) supports peaceful, constructive engagement and \n     confidence-building measures between the Government of \n     Georgia and the authorities in control in South Ossetia and \n     Abkhazia and encourages additional people-to-people contacts; \n     and\n       (5) affirms that finding a peaceful resolution to the \n     conflict is a key priority for the United States in the \n     Caucasus region and that lasting regional stability can only \n     be achieved through peaceful means and long-term diplomatic \n     and political dialogue between all parties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2848-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 176--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nUNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD ISSUE A SEMIPOSTAL STAMP TO SUPPORT \n            MEDICAL RESEARCH RELATING TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 176\n\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States Postal Service should, in accordance with \n     section 416 of title 39, United States Code--\n       (1) issue a semipostal stamp to support medical research \n     relating to Alzheimer's disease; and\n       (2) transfer to the National Institutes of Health for that \n     purpose any amounts becoming available from the sale of such \n     stamp.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise today to submit a resolution urging the United \nStates Postal Service to issue a semipostal stamp to help raise money \nfor Alzheimer's research. A semipostal stamp will fund new research \nwhile also raising public awareness about this devastating disease.\n  Finding new ways to treat Alzheimer's should be a national priority. \nThe disease not only harms patients and their families, it strains our \nhealth care system as well. Every 70 seconds, someone in America \ndevelops Alzheimer's. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have \nAlzheimer's disease, including one in eight people over 65. The direct \nand indirect costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias to Medicare, \nMedicaid and businesses amount to more than $183 billion each year. By \n2050, this disease is likely to affect more than 11 to 16 million \npeople 65 and older--unless we can find a medical breakthrough.\n  As Alzheimer's Disease is so prevalent, almost every American knows \nsomeone with this condition. My father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. \nThis was after many physicians said it was just ``old age'' stress or \ndepression. Like all family members with a loved one with Alzheimer's, \nI felt powerless over my father's situation as he got worse.\n  There are 14.9 million unpaid caregivers taking care of loved ones \nwith Alzheimer's. They are depending on us to help find the cure for \nthis terrible disease. No treatment is available to slow or stop the \ndeterioration of brain cells in Alzheimer's disease. The U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration has approved five drugs that temporarily slow the \nworsening of symptoms for about six to 12 months. They are effective \nfor only about half of the individuals who take them.\n  However, researchers around the world are studying numerous treatment \nstrategies that may have the potential to change the course of the \ndisease. Approximately 75 to 100 experimental therapies aimed at \nslowing or stopping the progression of Alzheimer's are in clinical \ntesting in human volunteers. We need to keep the fight for a cure \nstrong and funded.\n  A semipostal stamp is one way each of us can help in the fight \nagainst Alzheimer's. Proceeds from the stamp's sales would help fund \nAlzheimer's research at the National Institutes of Health. By paying \nmore than the normal postage rate for this stamp, the public can \ncontribute directly to the search for a new treatment or even a cure. I \nalso want to thank Senator Cardin for his cosponsorship of the \nAlzheimer's research semipostal stamp and Representative Markey for \nworking on this important legislation in the House. I ask my colleagues \ntoday to join me in the fight against Alzheimer's and support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/10/senate-section/article/S2848-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2848-S2849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 177--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 15 THROUGH MAY 21, \n                2011, AS ``NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
