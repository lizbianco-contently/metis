Mr. President, as the clock ticks down to August 2, I want \nto remind everyone within the sound of my voice what is at stake. At \nthis very moment, millions of seniors across this great country worry \nthat their next Social Security check might not come to them on \nWednesday. Middle-class families wonder whether their retirement \naccounts will be wiped out by an economic collapse brought about by \ndefault on this Nation's debt. Active military personnel, including \nmany who are risking their lives for our great Nation, worry whether \nthey will receive their paychecks.\n  The Associated Press reported that ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, visited with troops serving in Afghanistan \nyesterday. The soldiers Admiral Mullen talked with were not asking \nabout military strategy or how our troop drawdown in Afghanistan would \naffect them. No, they asked whether they would be paid if Republicans \nforced the U.S. Government to stop paying its bills. In a region that \nhas been rocked by violence and plagued by suicide bombers this month, \nthey wondered how they would take care of their families if their \nchecks stopped coming next month.\n  Let me read a little bit of that United Press story that came out \nyesterday:\n\n       A half a world away from Capitol Hill deadlock, the economy \n     and debt crisis are weighing heavily on U.S. troops in \n     Afghanistan. And the top question on their minds Saturday \n     even as bombing rocked the city around them, was one the top \n     U.S. military officer couldn't answer. Will we get paid?\n\n  Admiral Mullen went on to say: I don't know the answer to that \nquestion.\n  But either way to those soldiers he said: All of you must continue to \nwork every day.\n  This is unacceptable. A country as rich and powerful as ours, men and \nwomen with bombs going off around them should not worry whether this \ncountry will leave them high and dry. This afternoon I ask those who \nhave said they will never compromise on any terms to think about who \ntheir stubbornness will hurt: seniors, soldiers, and others.\n  I have spoken to the Vice President this morning--in fact, a couple \nof times. He is hopeful--of course, we have to be hopeful--that we are \nclose to an agreement with Republican leaders. The framework of this \nagreement is based on new ideas and some old ideas. After speaking to \nRepublican Leader Mitch McConnell this morning, we are cautiously \noptimistic.\n  There are a number of issues yet to be resolved, and we must \nunderstand that. There is no agreement that has been made. We are \noptimistic that one\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\ncan be reached, but we are not there yet. Optimism in the days past has \nbeen stomped on at various times. These major issues still to be \nresolved in these ongoing discussions is something we have to resolve \nin the next few hours if they are going to be resolved. Each of them \nmust be resolved before we have a final agreement. And as we know, one \nproblem can stop the whole agreement from going forward. But we want to \nget something done as quickly as possible. I believe all sides are \naware of this urgency. It is unfortunate that the House of \nRepresentatives wasted all last week on legislation they knew would \nnever pass the Senate and, in fact, barely passed the House. It passed \nthe House with only Republican votes, not a single Democratic vote.\n  Democrats have said all along that we would never agree to a short-\nterm arrangement that would put our economy at risk and force Congress \ninto another debt ceiling showdown in a few weeks. We have to move on. \nThe House measure put off the debt ceiling for 5 months--August, \nSeptember, October, November, and December--5 months. We would be back \nin this same debate in a matter of weeks. We cannot allow that to \nhappen. So any agreement has to have a long-term approach. The long-\nterm approach we have forged here in the Senate is absolutely \nnecessary. We must give the financial markets the confidence this \ncountry will not shirk its obligations now or in the future.\n  I know the compromise being discussed at the White House adopts the \nSenate's long-term approach, which will give the economy the certainty \nit needs, take us past January 2013. That has to be done. That will be \ndone if an agreement is reached. It is also crucial that the agreement \nbeing crafted set us on the path to fiscal restraint. There are still \nelements to be resolved. We are watching them very closely.\n  The settlement must include thoughtful constraints on spending, we \nknow that. The 12-member commission I conceived to recommend additional \ndeficit reduction measures this year will be a key to that effort. I \nsay to my friend the Republican leader, I appreciate his wrapping his \narms around this and being such a cheerleader for this idea. It is a \ngood idea. It is an idea that Congress itself will solve the problem. \nIt would be a joint committee that would move forward. There would be a \ntrigger that if they did not resolve this, then something else would \nhappen. Based on past experiences, I think there would be tremendous \nincentive not to let that certain thing happen when the trigger kicked \nin. So Senator McConnell and I agreed the commission owns the \nresponsibility to set this country on the path to fiscal \naccountability. The joint committee--there are no constraints--can look \nat any program we have in government--any program. It has the ability \nto look at everything. That is what needs to be done. The commission \nwill assure we undertake that responsibility.\n  When I thought of this idea about the commission, I knew it was \nimportant that it achieve real results. It will be essential to choose \nMembers with open minds willing to consider every option, even when the \noptions are tough pills to swallow for both parties. So cooperation is \nthe only way forward. Compromise is the only way forward. This is what \nAndrew Carnegie said about the virtue of compromise:\n\n       I shall argue that strong men . . .--\n\n  And since the Senate has changed so dramatically--and strong women--\nthat is me. I stuck that in.\n\n       I shall argue that strong men . . . know when to compromise \n     and that all principles can be compromised to serve a greater \n     principle.\n\n  Andrew Carnegie. But perhaps President Abraham Lincoln said it best \nwhen he said this: ``Determine that the thing can and shall be done, \nand that we shall find the way.''\n  That is where we are today. We must determine that the thing can and \nshall be done, and then we need to find that way. That is President \nAbraham Lincoln.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/31/senate-section/article/S5148-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany S. \n627, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to concur in the House amendment to S. 627, an act \n     to establish the Commission on Freedom of Information Act \n     Processing Delays, with an amendment.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid motion to concur in the amendment of the House of \n     Representatives to the bill, with Reid amendment No. 589, to \n     cut spending, maintain existing commitments, and for other \n     purposes.\n       Reid amendment No. 590 (to amendment No. 589), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid motion to refer the message of the House on the bill \n     to the Committee on the Budget, with instructions, Reid \n     amendment No. 591, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 592 (to the instructions (amendment No. \n     591) on the motion to refer), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 593 (to amendment No. 592), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 1 p.m. shall be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first compliment the majority \nleader. I think he said it accurately; that is, we need to find a \ncompromise between where we are, so we can move forward with increasing \nthe debt limit, and a credible plan to reduce the deficit. I have heard \nmany of my colleagues talk about that. But I want to point out that \nLeader Reid's proposal that we will be voting cloture on in a few \nmoments is a compromise.\n  It includes two major provisions that the Republicans have been \nasking about that, quite frankly, many Democrats disagree with. First, \nthere will be a dollar for dollar reduction in spending for the \nincrease in the debt ceiling.\n  Let me tell you, there is no relationship between the debt ceiling \nand spending. The debt ceiling represents funds that have already been \ncommitted that we have an obligation to pay. We all understand what \nwould happen if we violated the debt ceiling. It would affect the \ncredit of America, its standing internationally, the dollar's global \nsignificance, it would affect our creditworthiness in America, increase \nthe cost of government borrowing, increase the spending for all \ntaxpayers in this country.\n  It would have effects in my own State of Maryland. We have been told \nthat the Maryland bond rating is very much tied to the Federal bond \nrating, and it could very well cause a downgrade for Maryland \ntaxpayers, increase costs for mortgages, for credit cards. Every family \nwould be affected.\n  So the Reid bill yields to what the Republicans have asked. And \nalthough there is no relationship to the debt ceiling and the spending, \nbecause these are bills that have already been incurred, there is \ndollar for dollar reduction in spending for every dollar increase in \nthe debt.\n  The second major concession the Democrats have already made in the \nReid proposal is that there is no revenue in this. We have been talking \nfor a long time. If we are going to have a credible plan to reduce the \ndeficit, we have to include all of the elements of Federal spending. We \nhave a lot of what are called tax expenditures: moneys that are spent \nin our Tax Code.\n  Some of these dollars are spent on shelters and loopholes that we \nshould close. I have taken the floor several times to talk about \nseveral of these loopholes, the ethanol credit that we should not give \nfor ethanol subsidies, the funds that go to gas and oil companies.\n  There are a lot of loopholes in our Tax Code that we could close. The \nReid proposal has made an accommodation to the Republicans to say: \nOkay, you said that is a deal killer. That is not in the Reid proposal.\n  So the Reid proposal is the largest amount of deficit reduction--$2.4 \ntrillion of deficit reduction or $2.4 trillion of debt ceiling increase \nso we can get through March of next year, March of 2013, the year \nafter. That gives us the stability we need. And we know what we have \ngone through already as far as the debt ceiling debate. It has already \nhurt our country. We don't want to go\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\nthrough this again. That is what I think is critically important by \nmoving forward to get this done.\n  We are going to have a vote in about 45 minutes. That vote is on \ncloture. I want to explain that. Senator Levin talked about it \nyesterday. What the Republicans are doing is they are filibustering the \ndebt limit bill. It is a filibuster. They are requiring us now to have \n60 votes rather than a simple majority. The Speaker of the House passed \nhis proposal in the House with a majority of those voting. That is what \ndemocracy should be about. We are talking about the debt limit increase \nand whether it is a type of issue that should be filibustered by the \nRepublicans. They are doing that--filibustering it--and their vote in a \nlittle while will determine whether we should be able to move forward \nwithout a 60-vote threshold.\n  The majority leader pointed out that on previous occasions we have \ntaken up the debt ceiling and we have not required a 60-vote threshold. \nI had my staff pull the information about the debt ceiling votes we had \nwhen George W. Bush was President. The Senate passed the debt ceiling \nincrease by a 68-29 vote on June 11, 2002--with no requirement for a \n60-vote threshold. We had another vote on May 23, 2003, that passed the \nSenate by a 53-to-44 vote, and there was no filibuster of that by the \nDemocrats. We had a vote on November 17, 2004, with a debt ceiling \nincrease of $800 billion. The vote was 52 to 44 in the Senate. Again, \nthere was no effort made to require a 60-vote threshold, and there was \nno effort made to filibuster that issue. Then again on September 27, \n2007, the debt ceiling was increased by $850 billion by a vote of 53 to \n42. On a fourth occasion--March 16, 2006--there was a 52-48 vote for a \ndebt ceiling increase. Once again, there was no effort made to \nfilibuster that issue.\n  Webster's Dictionary defines ``filibuster'' as ``the use of extreme \ndilatory tactics to delay or prevent action by the majority in a \nlegislative or deliberative assembly.'' That is exactly what the \nRepublicans are doing if they vote against the cloture motion in a few \nmoments. They are using extreme dilatory tactics to deny the majority \nthe opportunity to take up an issue.\n  I know we are close to working out an agreement. I certainly hope we \nwork out an agreement. I have been saying on the floor of the Senate \nfor a long time that Democrats and Republicans need to put the Nation's \ninterests first.\n  We have two goals: to increase the debt ceiling and have a credible \nplan to deal with the deficit. The Reid proposal offers solutions to \nboth of those goals. I hope we have a bipartisan agreement before the \nday is out. We can move forward.\n  I think it is critically important that the Members of the Senate \nexpress whether they believe we should be filibustering a debt limit \nincrease. I believe that is not the right precedent for this body to \nset. We should always allow the debt ceiling to be increased by a \nmajority vote. That is what they did in the House; that is what we \nshould be doing in the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the cloture motion, but let's \ncontinue this discussion because in order to get a bill to the \nPresident's desk, we know we are going to have to reach further \ncompromises. We understand that. We have had, I think, some discussions \namong our colleagues here, and I am hopeful we will be able to reach \nthat type of a compromise.\n  We have a chance, in a few minutes, to move forward so that we can \nexpress ourselves that we should be doing this in the Senate by \nmajority vote. I urge my colleagues to support cloture and support the \nReid proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that during the quorum call, the time be \nequally divided between the Democrats and the Republicans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to join others of my colleagues \nin thanking and commending the majority leader, Senator Reid, for his \ntireless and relentless work in extraordinarily difficult \ncircumstances. He has been a model for me as a new Member of the Senate \nin leading this body, along with many of my other Democratic colleagues \nin the leadership and some of our Republican colleagues as well.\n  Senator Johnny Isakson, of Georgia, who spoke to this Chamber \nyesterday morning, demonstrated his determination, as others on the \nother side of the aisle have done, to work together in reaching an \nagreement. As the majority leader said moments ago, the words of the \nday must be ``cooperation'' and ``compromise.'' Those are the words we \nare hearing from countless Americans, including my fellow citizens of \nConnecticut, day after day: We want you to get the job done, put aside \nthe partisan differences. America is speaking with one voice, and \nWashington must listen.\n  I am new to Washington. I haven't been here for long. I have just \nmarked my first 6 months in the Senate. But I understand more and more \nwhy my fellow Connecticut citizens and other Americans are so \nfrustrated and often appalled by what goes on here. This situation is \noutrageous. We have an impending crisis--self-created--and devastating \npossible wounds--self-inflicted--and Washington has been deadlocked.\n  There is a glimmer of hope, a reason to be cautiously optimistic. The \nsolution is in sight, but still work needs to be done. Washington needs \nto end the gridlock, the straitjacket that has been self-imposed, and \ntake action to protect citizens from financial catastrophe. Our Nation \nis really at a crossroads. We need to rein in spending, cut the debt \nand deficits, make the tough choices necessary to get our fiscal house \nin order, and we need to do it now.\n  The fiscal news in the last few days--the anemic and fragile measures \nof recovery--shows more than ever why we need certainty now, certainty \nthat ending this deadlock will produce. Uncertainty is the enemy--enemy \nfor businesses that are deciding whether to hire, for banks wanting to \nloan money to those businesses, and for larger corporations sitting on \nmountains of cash waiting to invest and create jobs.\n  Jobs and our economy are the main reasons to make these tough choices \nliterally today, to make these tough choices now. We have a historic \nmoment, and we must seize it. We cannot keep kicking these decisions \ndown the road. Families in Connecticut and across the country make \nthese tough choices every day. They rightfully expect nothing less from \nus. Tough choices are necessary to help get our debt and our deficit \nunder control.\n  I have heard as late as this morning, Sunday morning, from hundreds \nof Connecticut residents who are frustrated and appalled at what is \ngoing on here, what they see in Washington, DC.\n  Bernice, from Tolland, CT, cannot believe we don't have an agreement. \nShe is worried she won't receive her Social Security check next month.\n  Jane, from West Hartford, is wondering why we are protecting \nsweetheart deals instead of ensuring Social Security is protected and \nstrengthened.\n  Rod, from New Milford, just wants us to compromise and to get \nsomething done and end this nightmare.\n  I agree with them and hundreds of others from Connecticut and around \nthe country who want to make sure that the troops in Afghanistan are \npaid, that their families are taken care of. I thank the citizens from \nConnecticut for calling or writing to me.\n  I agree that the immediate solution is not only to raise the debt \nceiling but also to cut spending, as the Reid proposal makes clear, \ndollar for dollar to match that increase in that debt ceiling, without \ntax increases--none--without any cuts in Medicare or Medicare--none. \nThose basic principles in the Reid proposal are what should be embodied \nin what the outcome is of this debate.\n  The markets need a real solution, not a short-term fix, to \ndemonstrate that we are dedicated to achieving real results in cutting \nspending.\n  Anne, from Hamden, CT, makes this point. She just called yesterday to \nsay\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\nthat a short-term plan would not provide the certainty the markets are \ndesperately seeking. I agree that no short-term plan can provide that \nkind of certainty. It risks a credit rating downgrade and ensures we \nwill be back here in another 6 months.\n  As much as we may criticize the rating agencies--and I have been one \nto criticize them most vehemently as an attorney general of Connecticut \nand now as a Member of this body--we must deal with that reality at \nthis moment and take action down the road to address the need for \nreform. Credit ratings agencies' downgrades seem abstract and \nintangible, but they are hugely consequential. A downgrade in our \ncredit rating would likely cause, in effect, an automatic tax increase \nin the form of higher interest rates for every American who has a \nmortgage, a car loan, student debt, or a credit card.\n  The American people deserve better. Coming together in a compromise \nis essential now. Majority Leader Reid has proposed a solution to meet \nall of the criteria House Republicans have demanded for weeks. It \ndoesn't raise taxes or revenues, and it includes enough spending to \nmeet the debt ceiling increase dollar for dollar, and it includes \nspending cuts that are the very same as our Republican colleagues, our \nfriends across the aisle, have previously voted for and supported over \nthese past weeks.\n  Most important, Senator Reid's plan makes tough spending cuts, but it \ndoesn't balance the budget on the backs of our seniors and our most \nvulnerable. It protects vital programs and doesn't make cuts to \nbenefits, to Medicare and Social Security. Again, as I have said \nrepeatedly, I will oppose cuts in Medicare or Social Security.\n  Time and again, Democrats have shown we are willing to compromise to \navert catastrophe and default. Unfortunately, at every turn Republicans \nin the House have blocked any chance for progress and continue to put \nus on a very dangerous path.\n  I am hopeful that the deadline will produce a compromise, that the \ntalks will be productive. But today's filibuster of our efforts to \nprevent a default is indeed unprecedented. As my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, pointed out a few moments ago on \nthe floor, since March of 1962, Congress has raised the debt limit 74 \ntimes--18 times under President Reagan. During George Bush's \nadministration, Congress passed five stand-alone debt limit increases \nwithout a filibuster or delay. And until this point, debt limit \nincreases were routine, usually passed by a simple 51-vote majority \nwithout the procedural hurdles my Republican colleagues are using \ntoday.\n  Hopefully, they will come to the table to work with us to find a \ncompromise for the good of the country and for our economic recovery. I \nhope my Republican colleagues will join us in achieving that result for \nthe sake of millions of Connecticut families, who are watching and \nlistening, as are hundreds of millions of other Americans, and for the \nsake of our economy moving in the right direction. It is about jobs, \njobs, jobs, the certainty our economy needs at this point in history, \naffordable interest rates, and moving our economy forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois, the assistant \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis comments and for his focus on jobs. If we ask the American people \nwhat the most important thing we face is, it is jobs, creating good-\npaying jobs right here in the United States so families can succeed and \nso our economy can grow.\n  I noted this morning that the President's economic adviser Gene \nSperling said in the first 3 months after President Obama was sworn \ninto office we lost 2.3 million jobs. That is what he faced walking in \nthe door, and we have been trying to dig out of that hole ever since. I \nwould say that, symbolically, this agreement we are working on is \nmoving us to the point where we are having the final interment of John \nMaynard Keynes. He nominally died in 1946, but it appears now we are \ngoing to put him to his final rest with this agreement.\n  Keynes was a British economist who turned the world upside down when \nhe started arguing that just the force of the markets is not enough to \nresolve problems when we face recession and depression. We need to play \na more active role, a more assertive role in increasing aggregate \ndemands by programs. One of the great disciples of that point of view \nwas Franklin Roosevelt, who, when he came to the Presidency in the \nmidst of the Great Depression, believed we needed to create jobs and \nwork, infrastructure work across America to put more money into our \neconomy. That was a positive force that helped to bring us out of the \ndepression.\n  Some argue it was only a halting effort until World War II started, \nbut the fact is, that was accepted economic theory in America for many \ndecades. But now, take a look at where we are today. We have an obvious \nproblem with unemployment being too high, a lack of consumer demand and \nconfidence, and a reluctance by many Americans to make purchases of \ngoods and services that would create a demand for more work, more jobs, \nand more economic growth.\n  The President came to office and said: Well, the first thing we need \nto do is to move this economy forward, and he passed a stimulus \npackage, which I supported. I believe 40 percent of that stimulus \npackage went into tax cuts for families so they would have more \nspending power, particularly lower- and middle-income families. He also \nput money in infrastructure, trying to make sure we move forward \nbuilding in America for our future, and money to help State and local \ngovernments that were clearly struggling with a cutback in revenue. \nThat was the President's stimulus package. It was helpful, but it \nclearly did not turn the economy around as we had hoped. We are moving \nin the right direction.\n  The next thing the President did, last December, was reach a \nbipartisan agreement--a controversial one--to extend tax cuts in this \ncountry. The obvious belief was if we continue to put spending power in \nthe hands of working families who have a lower propensity to save with \nevery marginal dollar, they will spend it and help the economy get back \non its feet. So that was the second phase of the stimulus.\n  What we are talking about now, in terms of our future--the next 10 \nyears, and what we will do specifically for the next year and a half--\nis to do the opposite. It is to take money out of the economy by \nreducing government spending. That is a way to reduce the deficit--at \nleast it appears to be--but yet it flies in the face of this notion \nthat we can increase aggregate demand, increase demand for goods and \nservices, and create jobs.\n  I was a member of the deficit commission--the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission--and that commission was very careful not to put in place \nthe spending cuts for at least a year, until we were back on our feet \nand the economy was moving forward. Their fear--and the fear I share--\nis that if we make spending cuts at this point, it will not help \neconomic recovery. In fact, many would agree. I think Paul Krugman \nregularly reports that point of view in the New York Times, and I think \nhe is right.\n  So here we are, on the horns of a dilemma. In order to avoid the \ndisaster that would occur August 2 if the United States defaulted on \nits debt for the first time in its history, we are being told we have \nto cut back on government spending. By cutting back on spending, we may \nalso have a negative impact on our economy. I am afraid this dilemma is \nnot going to serve our purposes very well. I am not sure this is clear \nthinking. I think, in many respects, it is ideological thinking.\n  The Republican point of view has always been to reduce the size of \ngovernment at any cost to the economy. They believe in their heart of \nhearts in the pre-Keynesian view of the world: the market will work \nthis all out if we just get out of the way. Well, that may be possible, \nbut it is going to be a very costly experience and a costly experiment \nas people find themselves struggling through this recession without a \nhelping hand.\n  For example, will we extend unemployment benefits as part of this \nconversation about what we will do with the economy for the next year \nand a half? I, for one, would argue we should. My understanding is they \nexpire at the end of this year, and if that is the case,\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\nthe extension of unemployment benefits will cut off direct payments to \npeople we know are the first dollars spent. Families on unemployment \nspend it all because that is what they live on. So that stimulus to the \neconomy may be cut off.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me complete one thought. Then I will be happy to \nyield.\n  Secondly, the President has put in a payroll tax cut. What that means \nis, working families will get about 2 percent more each pay period. The \nbelief of the President--and I share it--is that kind of helping hand \nends up with dollars in the hands of many families spent into the \neconomy. I hope we extend the payroll tax cut as part of this \nagreement. It doesn't serve specifically the need for deficit \nreduction, but it certainly serves the need for us to stimulate the \neconomy and have people buy more.\n  Right now we have a crisis of consumer confidence, and I think it is \nbrought on by the bad news out of Washington--we have to share some of \nthis blame--and it is brought on by the fact that many people \noverborrowed before the recession set in, many times going deeply into \ndebt. For example, in the 1990s, the average indebtedness of a family \nwas 84 percent of their annual income. By the year 2007, it had reached \nabout 125 percent, a 15-percent increase in indebtedness. Now families \nfacing that indebtedness are retrenching, holding back, not making \ncommitments, and it is coming down to 112 percent and slowly back to \nwhere it should be.\n  What we are trying to do is to give people some spending power to \ncreate more consumer and aggregate demand for goods and services for \nbusiness growth in this country.\n  So I hope as we look at this deficit-reduction package, as important \nas it is, we understand we are doing it in an economically dangerous \ntime, when this recession still threatens us, and when many people are \nstill holding back because of their reluctance to spend. If we do not \nprovide a helping hand in this situation, I am afraid the economic \nrecovery may be even slower.\n  The political realities tell us we are faced with this dilemma: \neither default on the debt ceiling or cut back in spending, either one \nof which would be harmful to the economy. I hope we can find a way \nthrough this that is sensible, not just from an economical point of \nview but a political point of view.\n  I yield to my colleague for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a few questions because what my colleague is doing \nright now is stepping back and looking at the bigger economic view of \nwhere we are. Having come out of the 2010 election, where, frankly, the \nonly issue I faced day after day was job creation, I think my friend is \nright to talk about that. But here we are in a crisis that is made up.\n  We have raised the debt ceiling 89 times, and I know my friend has \nlooked at all of this. But isn't it true that never before have we been \nin a circumstance where one political party has held the full faith and \ncredit of the United States hostage to some agenda they want to bring \nto the country? Is that my friend's understanding?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would answer my colleague that there has never been an \ninstance, since 1939, in the 89 times we have extended the debt \nceiling--except for one technical period in 1979 for a few days--when \nwe have used the debt ceiling as a political bargaining chip, and there \nhas never been a time when we were this close to defaulting on the debt \ncausing a true concern across the country and the world that the United \nStates would not keep its promise to pay its bills, which, as the \nSenator knows, could result in a loss of confidence in our economy and \nan increase in interest rates not just for the government but for \nbusinesses and families everywhere at exactly the wrong time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. So what we have now established is that at a time of \neconomic uncertainty, what the Republicans have done, as a party, is \nhold this whole economy hostage. We have established that. It has never \nbeen done before. It is a made-up crisis. They know under Ronald Reagan \nthe debt ceiling was raised 18 times, under George Bush it was 7, 8 or \n9 times, and they never said a word. But now, in the midst of this \neconomic crisis we have had going on, this recession, they add this \nhorrific crisis which they have made up.\n  I have one more question I would like to ask my friend for his \ncomment. I was thinking the other day how things are stalling--the \neconomic growth and our recovery. I have looked back on this and have \nasked: Why has this happened.\n  One of the great reasons, I believe, as someone who did study \neconomics a long time ago, is uncertainty and this whole nightmare we \nare going through, this unnecessary nightmare.\n  Here we are on a Sunday--we know talks are going on--but this is \nunnecessary that we are in this mess. The Republicans want us to be in \nthis mess again in 3, 4, or 5 months. I hope we have finally gotten rid \nof that notion. We are not going to agree to a short-term extension. \nBut here is what I see as the bigger picture.\n  As soon as the Republicans took over, they stopped working on this \neconomy. Not only did they stop working on the FAA conference--the \nFederal Aviation Administration--but they now have shut down the FAA. \nThey refuse to allow an extension, and there are job losses all over my \nState--I assume all over my colleague's State.\n  At this time they have stopped completely any work on patent reform, \nwhich Chairman Leahy says is hundreds of thousands of jobs. They have \nput forward a highway bill and a budget that cuts highways by one-\nthird, which is 600,000 jobs that will be lost. They voted down, with a \nfilibuster, Mary Landrieu's small business bill and my economic \ndevelopment bill--hundreds of thousands of jobs between those two. Now \nwe have this made-up crisis. How long have they been in? Let's see: \nJanuary, February, March, April, May, June, July--7 months, and we are \nin a mess.\n  So I say to my friend, as he puts forward this notion that we have to \nbe concerned, it is not only that we have this made-up crisis, it is \nalso that they have put the brakes on anything the Senate and the House \ncan do to stimulate jobs. Does my friend agree that it is a very \ndiscouraging time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, of course, it is. I think what is most discouraging \nis the average person is asking themselves: Why do we inflict this pain \non ourselves in the midst of a recession? Why do we have the fear of \ndefaulting on America's debt for the first time in our history? Why \nwould we lose our credit rating, the best in the world--AAA--because of \na manufactured political debate in Washington?\n  We will pay for this for a long time to come. For every 1 percent \ninterest rates go up, our national debt goes up $130 billion a year--\n$1.3 trillion over 10 years. So as we talk about all the spending cuts \nwe want, the fact is, we end up in a position where we can't keep up \nwith increases in the interest rate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority time has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I will tell you what. I will be glad to engage in a \nshort colloquy with the Senator from Illinois, if he would like.\n  Does the Senator from Illinois believe we are close to an agreement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Illinois agree that, most likely, \nthat agreement will not have an increase in taxes associated with it, \nat least in the short term?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope not.\n  Mr. McCAIN. You hope so?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope there is revenue included in any agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, everything I have heard is that the agreement does \nnot\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\nhave tax increases in it. Has the Senator heard differently, being in \nthe leadership?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I honestly am not party to this. But I can tell the \nSenator, as the Gang of 6 and fiscal commission, we believe everything \nshould be under consideration to reduce our national debt.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So I assume that would also mean the Senator from \nIllinois would advocate another stimulus package?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to make sure we have some stimulus to the economy \nto create jobs and help those out of work find work with training and \neducation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So one would have to assume that the Senator from \nIllinois believes the last stimulus package was successful, which was, \ncounting interest, over $1 trillion. The Senator from Illinois and \nothers who advocated the stimulus package and the administration said: \nIf we pass this, unemployment will be a maximum of 8 percent. This will \nstimulate our economy and create jobs.\n  Do you know what the Senator from Illinois and others are saying now? \nIt was not enough, that it was not enough, that we didn't spend enough, \nthat we didn't make the deficit larger. Because certainly nothing in \nthe stimulus package was paid for. So I hope the Senator from Illinois \nunderstands--the American people understand--that just spending more \nmoney has failed and failed miserably.\n  When we look at the latest news, on the front page of the Wall Street \nJournal and the Washington Post and the New York Times, that our \neconomy is staggering back into a situation of stagnation, and the \nresponse--I will be glad to let the Senator respond. The answer on the \nother side is: Well, let's have some more spending and let's raise \ntaxes. Let's take some more money out of the taxpayers' pockets in the \nform of spending more money--their money. It is not the \nadministration's money. It is not the money of the Senator from \nIllinois. It is the people's money. Take some more money of theirs--and \nthis is the Nobel Prize--well, I will not--anyway. Take more money and \ntaxes and more out of the taxpayers' pockets, and that will be the \nanswer to our problems.\n  I will be glad to hear the response of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I wish to thank my colleague from Arizona. For \nthose who are witnessing this, this is almost a debate in the Senate. \nIt rarely happens. I thank the Senator for coming to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I say that rather than having the Senator use all our \ntime, I thought I would engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, I enjoy doing this and I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Go ahead, please.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, during the course of the Senator's Presidential \ncampaign, Mark Zandi, his economist, helped him formulate some \npositions. His opinion of President Obama's stimulus is, it stopped a \nprecipitous decline in our economy. Did it achieve all we had hoped \nfor? No.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could interrupt on that particular point, Mr. Zandi \nwas one of many advisers to my campaign. The key adviser was Douglas \nHoltz-Akin, who is, as you know, former head of the CBO--the Senator \nknows him well--who had no brief whatsoever for that proposal.\n  Please go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The second point I would like to ask the Senator from \nArizona, I think one of the real bedrock beliefs among Republicans is \nthat if we cut taxes, particularly on the wealthiest people in America, \nthe economy will prosper. We hear that over and over.\n  Didn't we try that experiment under President George W. Bush? Didn't \nthe debt of the United States double under the President and he left a \nshambles behind him, 2.3 million jobs lost in the first 3 months of \nPresident Obama's administration because of this failed economic policy \nwhich the Senator continues to espouse; that if we cut taxes on the \nrich, America is going to get wealthier. Haven't we tried it? Where are \nthe jobs?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could take a little trip down memory lane with my \nfriend from Illinois, whom I had the great privilege many years ago--I \ndon't know if I should mention the 1982 election. He and I came to the \nHouse of Representatives together, and he might recall that one of his \nown, then a Democratic Congressman from Texas, got together with \nPresident Reagan and guess what we did. We cut taxes. Guess what. We \nhad one of the strongest recoveries in recent history of this country \nbecause we didn't start spending and add spending without paying for \nthem.\n  I would say to the Senator from Illinois, he is correct; the spending \nthat went on in the previous administration was not acceptable and led \nto the deficit. But I would also say, speaking for myself, I voted \nagainst the Medicare Part D because it was not paid for. I voted \nagainst the earmark and porkbarrel spendings which were abundant as \nevery appropriations bill came to the floor and dramatically increased \nspending in the worst way, wasteful and corrupt way, I will say. I am \nproud that at least some of us said: If we don't stop this spending and \nget it under control, then we are going to face a serious problem.\n  But I would also mention, and the Senator has seen the chart, it has \ngotten a lot worse--a lot worse--since the last election. You can't \nkeep up B-I-O-B. You can't keep up Blame It On Bush.\n  Go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to respond to my colleague from Arizona, \nthrough the Chair.\n  Does he recall what happened with the Reagan tax cuts? Because what \nhappened was we tripled the national debt during that period of time, \nand President Reagan came to Congress 18 times to extend the debt \nceiling. He holds the record.\n  So to argue the Reagan tax cuts led to great long-term prosperity is \nseriously in doubt, if we are going to use the deficit as a measure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could say we believed and Reagan believed that \ncutting tax cuts would restore our economy, which was in the tank, \nthanks to the practice of the previous administration before him. \nReagan presided over probably one of the greatest job-creation periods \nin the history of this country. Those are numbers that I would be glad \nto insert into the Record.\n\n  Compare that with what has happened since this administration took \noffice, with the promise that if we passed ObamaCare, if we passed \nTARP, if we passed all these others, the economy would then be restored \nand grow.\n  Again, it is hard for my dear friend from Illinois to refute the fact \nthat it was categorically stated that if we passed the stimulus \npackage, unemployment would be at a maximum of 8 percent.\n  Unemployment today is 9.2 percent, and if we look at any indicator, \nwhether it be housing starts, whether it be the deficit, whether it be \nunemployed, whatever it is, it has gotten worse since the stimulus \npackage was passed rather than better.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to just hear the Senator's comment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to give the Senator a chance to speak again.\n  Does the Senator believe that defaulting on our national debt for the \nfirst time in our history, which has been the threat looming over us \nfrom the House Republicans and others for a long period, is good for \nAmerica's economy?\n  One of his colleagues on the floor from the State of Pennsylvania has \ncome in and said: Listen, defaulting on the debt is not that big a \ndeal. It can be, in his words, ``easily managed.'' Does the Senator \nfrom Arizona agree with that thinking?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator may know, I came to the floor a couple \ndays ago and made the comment that the Senator from Illinois and I are \nin agreement.\n  Point No. 1, we can prioritize--and every economist that I know \nliterally would agree. We can prioritize for a while where we want what \nremaining money that is left. But the message we send to the world--not \njust our markets but to the world--that the United States of America is \ngoing to default on its debts is a totally unacceptable scenario and \nbeneath a great nation. We are in agreement, No. 1.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Amen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. 2 is that to insist that any agreement is based on \nthe\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\npassage through the Senate of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States, as I said before, is not fair to the \nAmerican people because the terrible obstructionists on the Senator's \nside of the aisle, the terrible people, their flawed philosophical \nviews about the future of America is not going to allow us to get 20 \nadditional votes from the Senator's side, assuming you get all 47, \nsince it required 67 votes to pass a balanced budget amendment because \nof the Constitution.\n  I think it was not only a wrong assessment; I think it is not fair to \nthe American people to say we can pass a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution through the Senate at this time. Maybe after the \nSenator is defeated in the next election and we get rid of a lot of--\nmaybe that will happen. But certainly let's not tell the American \npeople that is a possibility because I think it raises their \nexpectations in a way that is not fair to them and, frankly, detracts \nfrom what I think is being done as we speak between the leaders, the \nPresident, Democratic leaders and Republican leaders, which is in a \nvery short timeframe.\n  Go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would just say it pains me to say I agree with the \nSenator from Arizona, but I do.\n  We both feel threatening the debt ceiling is not in the best \ninterests of the United States and both of us feel that holding out the \nthreat that if we don't pass a constitutional amendment, we can't let \nthe economy continue is not a good-faith bargain. I wish Senator Byrd \nwere here to respond to that particular suggestion.\n  As for my prospects in the next election, I thank the Senator from \nArizona for campaigning against me last time. When he did, I almost got \n60 percent of the vote in Illinois. So I welcome the Senator back to \nthe land of Lincoln anytime he would like to come.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would love to come out. As I saw, I did so well in the \nPresidential campaign in the land of Lincoln, I am not surprised I had \nsuch a dramatic impact on the election of the Senator from Illinois as \nwell.\n  Could I just say, I think this kind of discussion is important, No. \n1.\n  No. 2 is, we should have this national debate on other forums besides \njust the Sunday show, and perhaps the floor of the Senate is the best \nplace to do that. I wish to continue to engage with the Senator from \nIllinois, but I hope this agreement will assure the American people \nthat we will meet our obligations, that we will meet our obligations \nnot only physically but fiscally but also meet our obligations to them \nto govern--to govern--because they did send to us here to govern. I \nthink the Senator from Illinois would agree with me.\n  The last approval rating of Congress I saw, both sides of the aisle, \nwas about 16 percent; and I have yet to encounter anyone in that 16-\npercent category in my travels back to my State.\n  By the way, I would like to note the presence of the Budget Committee \nchairman, Senator Conrad, who I think has made enormous good-faith \nefforts to reach an agreement on some of these issues, and I thank him \nfor his work. I wish to assure him his reward will be in heaven, not \nhere on Earth.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would also like to thank the Senator from Arizona for \nthe few minutes we shared on the floor. I hope more Members would do \nthis rather than just taking turns giving speeches. These exchanges, \neven when we disagree, are valuable.\n  But I agree completely with the Senator from Arizona. At the end of \nthe day, we cannot allow our economy to lapse into this default. It \nwould be devastating to a lot of innocent families and businesses \nacross America and will cost us dearly in terms of our national debt. \nSo let us hope we can find this bipartisan agreement that people are \nworking on, even at this moment, and I hope we can do that soon.\n  Incidentally, I wanted to say for the Record former Senator Alan \nSimpson, whom I came to know even better on the Bowles-Simpson \ncommission, said:\n\n       Ronald Reagan raised taxes 11 times in his administration. \n     I was here. I was here. I knew him better than anybody in the \n     room. He was a dear friend and a total realist as to \n     politics.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I remind the Senator from Illinois that, in \nretrospect, the one thing President Reagan said he regretted--and he \nregretted it--was the agreement that was made with the Democratic \nleadership that we would cut spending by $3 and increase taxes by $1 \nfor every cut in spending. That was the ironclad agreement. Guess what \nhappened. We increased taxes. The fact is, we raised taxes and did not \ncut spending, and that was in direct violation of the commitment he got \nfrom the Democratic leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the matter now before the Senate is still \nthe pending matter we have been working on for several days. It is \nextremely important that everyone understands we have a message from \nthe House, and if we are going to work something out, which we are \nhopeful we can do, that\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\nwe have a piece of legislation by which we can do that and not require \na bunch of cloture votes. So that is where we are now. We are seeing if \nsomething can be worked out.\n  I have had, for the information of Senators, a number of \nconversations in the last hour with people downtown, and the \narrangement that is being worked on with the Republican leader and the \nadministration and others is not there yet. We are hopeful and \nconfident it can be done. As soon as it is done, I will let my caucus \nknow.\n  I have had conversations with the Republican leader and other \nSenators. Senators should be aware that further rollcall votes are \npossible today. We will do everything we can to give Members adequate \nnotice before additional rollcall votes are scheduled.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, would the majority leader yield on that \npoint?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If we were to vote, I assume we would have significant \nnotice for our Members because many Members would like to leave the \nCapitol if we are not going to be voting.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend that is an appropriate thing to \ndo. I would not suggest a ball game, though; maybe closer than that.\n  We will give everyone adequate notice. As I indicated, we will do \neverything we can to give Members plenty of notice. As I indicated, we \nwill have, on this side of the aisle, a caucus later today, whenever we \nare able to do that.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, for the last few weeks Congress has been \nlocked in partisan gridlock. Today, I am relieved to say leaders from \nboth parties have come together for the sake of our economy to reach a \nhistoric, bipartisan compromise that ends this dangerous standoff.\n  The compromise we have agreed to is remarkable for a number of \nreasons, not only because of what it does but because of what it \nprevents: a first ever default on the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States.\n  Sometimes it seems our two sides disagree on almost everything, but \nin the end reasonable people were able to agree: the United States \ncould not take the chance of defaulting on our debt, risking a United \nStates financial collapse and a worldwide depression.\n  America and the world have been watching our democracy expectantly. \nMy message to the world tonight is that this Nation and this Congress \nare moving forward, and we are moving forward together.\n  Reaching a long-term accord that would give our economy the certainty \nit needs was not easy. But our work is not done. Leaders from both \nparties and in both Chambers will present this agreement to our \ncaucuses tomorrow. Senate Democrats will meet at 11 a.m.\n  To pass this settlement, we will need the support of Democrats and \nRepublicans in both the House and the Senate. There is no way either \nparty--either Chamber--can do this alone.\n  As President Lyndon Johnson said:\n\n       There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very \n     few that we can solve by ourselves.\n\n  Democrats and Republicans have rarely needed to come together more \nthan today. I know this agreement will not make every Republican happy. \nIt certainly will not make every Democrat happy either. But both \nparties gave more ground than they wanted to, and neither side got as \nmuch as it had hoped. But that is the essence of compromise, of \nconsensus building. And the American people demanded compromise this \nweek, and they got it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this is an important moment for our \ncountry. I appreciate the majority leader's comments and want to say a \nfew words to our colleagues who have been so patient over the past \nseveral days and whose ideas and encouragement have been so helpful in \ngetting us to this point.\n  First of all, let me reiterate that before any agreement is reached, \nRepublicans will meet to discuss the framework that the White House and \ncongressional leaders in both parties think would meet our stated \nefforts to cut spending more than the President's requested debt \nceiling increase, prevent a national default, and protect the economy \nfrom tax increases.\n  To that end, I would like to say to my Republican colleagues that we \nwill be holding a conference meeting in the morning to discuss the \nframework and to give everyone a chance to weigh in. But at this point \nI think I can say with a high degree of confidence that there is now a \nframework to review that will ensure significant cuts in Washington \nspending. And we can assure the American people tonight that the United \nStates of America will not for the first time in our history default on \nits obligations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/31/senate-section/article/S5154-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1448\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pryor, the name of the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1448, a bill \nto exempt off-highway vehicles from the ban on lead in children's \nproducts, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/31/senate-section/article/S5154-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 1, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
