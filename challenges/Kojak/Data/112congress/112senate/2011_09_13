Madam President, this week the Republicans sent a message \nto victims of the devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and tornados. That \nmessage was ``tough luck.''\n  Last night, we tried to move forward on a measure that would grant \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency additional funding to help \ncommunities devastated by natural disasters. This ought to be the least \npolitical issue we have, whether to reach out a helping hand to our \nfriends and neighbors in a time of need.\n  These unfortunate people have lost friends and loved ones. They have \nlost their homes, businesses, and livelihoods. They have been destroyed \nby acts of God. I went over this with my wife last night, and she said: \nWhy would you use a term like that? Well, in the law, that is what \nthese floods, these terrible windstorms, and these fires are--they are \nacts of God. We can't plan for them; they just happen. In the law, that \nis the term of art we use.\n  These people have lost loved ones and friends, and their property is \nunderwater or literally reduced to rubble. It is in our power to help \nthem. It is an obligation we have to help them. Last night, Republicans \noverwhelmingly voted to prevent us from coming to their aid. They \nprevented us from getting disaster aid to American families and \nbusinesses that need it now. These unfortunate people, I repeat, don't \nneed the help next week or next month or 6 months from now, they need \nit now, today. It is unthinkable that Republicans would waste time \ncatering to the radical tea party while innocent victims of devastating \ndisasters bide their time. One of the leaders of the tea party, a \nMember of the House of Representatives, has said very publicly that we \nshould get rid of FEMA. But this is not a nation that stands idly by \nwhile our fellow Americans suffer. We are a nation of action. That is \nwhat we have always been. When it is in our power to aid a fellow \ncitizen, we have always done what it takes. We have done it without \npolitics, without pandering, without a moment's delay--until today.\n\n  This year the United States has dealt with more than its usual share \nof terrible natural disasters. Hurricane Irene\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nis estimated to be one of the most costly disasters ever to hit this \ncountry. It caused flooding and wind damage from Florida to Maine. That \nis a long ways. It is a huge coastline. But its damage was not only to \nthe coastline. Interior States such as Vermont suffered terrible \ndamage, hundreds of bridges in Vermont, and scores of bridges in the \nState of the Presiding Officer, the State of New Hampshire. Crops were \ndrowned all over the Northeast. It is rarely that this has ever \nhappened.\n  Just a few short weeks ago an earthquake such as we have not had in \nthis part of the country for 65 years occurred. The epicenter was in \nVirginia. It was felt by tens of millions of people in every corner of \nthe Eastern United States. It damaged buildings in Richmond and closed \nthe Washington Monument. The National Cathedral had some of its spires \ndamaged. It is closed now. The 9/11 celebration was to take place \nthere. They had to move it to the Kennedy Center. Some of the spires \nwere knocked off the Mormon Temple that we see as we drive down the \nbeltway. There was record flooding on the Mississippi and Missouri that \ncost lives and devastated farmland.\n  To get a picture of the devastation, 3 million acres of farmland is \nunderwater now. This is not rice that grows there, these are crops that \nneed to be away from that much water. It is devastating to farmland in \nthat part of the country.\n  In February a massive blizzard buried the Midwest and Northeast with \nas much as 3 feet of snow, paralyzing the city of Chicago, and 36 \npeople died. Even now, firefighters are battling terrible wildfires \nthat have ravaged for weeks and weeks across central Texas. Those fires \nhave killed people and driven residents from their homes, homes they \nwill never see again. In Texas, 2,000 homes have been burned to the \nground. Since January, Texas has reported--this is not a misstatement--\n20,000 fires. Some of the small fires developed into big fires, burning \nalmost 4 million acres of land. The State Forest Service in Texas \nresponded to 19 new fires on Sunday alone, in 24 hours--almost a new \nfire an hour in Texas.\n  This year President Obama has issued disaster declarations in 48 \nStates, and it is only September. Some States have had multiple \ndisasters. The United States has had $10 billion worth of disasters \nalready this year. It is no wonder there are limited moneys left in \nFEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. FEMA has spent about $400 million in the \nlast 2 weeks alone making whole American families, victims of Irene and \nLee, a tropical storm and a hurricane.\n  In short, FEMA is running out of money. They are almost broke. Funds \nare so low FEMA stopped rebuilding Joplin, MO, where more than 150 \npeople died in that terrible tornado. FEMA has programs where they were \nrebuilding the schools and some of the public services that were so \nnecessary. But they wanted to have enough money to supply the food, \nwater, and emergency housing for victims of Hurricane Irene, so they \npulled out of Joplin, MO.\n  We have seen the pictures. It is hard to comprehend what winds \nblowing almost 300 miles an hour do. They just eliminate everything on \nthe ground. Any structure was eliminated.\n  This is not some Democratic idea that has come about, that we need to \nfund FEMA. Republican Governors are desperate for money. They have seen \nthe destruction firsthand. I will pick just two: the Governor in New \nJersey, Governor Christie, said this:\n\n       Our people are suffering now and they need support now.\n\n  Governor McDonald of Virginia said this:\n\n       My concern is that we help people in need.\n\n  He responded in that way because the Republican majority leader of \nthe House said what we need to do is make sure these emergencies are \npaid for by taking money from programs that are now in existence.\n  We cannot be held hostage on that issue to appease the tea party. \nHundreds of millions of dollars in disaster recovery projects are on \nhold. I mentioned Joplin, MO, as just one example. No matter how often \nwe wish for a crystal ball, the process of guessing how much money we \nwill need for natural disasters is not perfect. We have tried, but this \nhas been a very devastating year. Each year Congress estimates how much \nit will cost this country to recover from inevitable storms and fires \nand floods, and then it reacts to what Mother Nature sends our way.\n  Now is the time to react. It is time to show Americans, as we did in \nthe wake of September 11, that when disaster strikes the Federal \nGovernment will be there to help rebuild.\n  These are very hard personal issues. Here in a Virginia suburb, a 12-\nyear-old boy was out watching it rain. He was swept off his back step, \nand he is dead. Scores of people have been killed just in Lee and \nIrene. It is time for Republicans to prove that this Congress, for the \nfirst time, is willing to put politics aside for the good of the \nAmerican people.\n  FEMA is an issue that is bipartisan in nature. Those storms don't \njust hit Republicans; they don't just hit Democrats; they don't just \nhit Independents; they hit us all. That is why we have to react to help \npeople in America because they have been hurt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5508-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last week President Obama came up to \nCapitol Hill to unveil a stimulus bill he is calling a jobs plan, and \nyesterday the White House explained how they would like to pay for it. \nThe first thing to say about this plan is that it is now obvious why \nthe President left out the specifics last week. Not only does it reveal \nthe political nature of this bill, it also reinforces the growing \nperception that this administration is not all that interested in \neconomic policies that will actually work.\n  But none of this is news. Over the past few days, press reports have \nmade it perfectly clear that this legislation is more of a reelection \nplan than a jobs plan. It is an open secret which Democrats all over \nWashington have been acknowledging to reporters since the moment the \nPresident revealed it. They have said that despite the President's \ncalls to pass this bill immediately, the real plan is to let it hang \nout there for a while so Democrats can use it as an issue on the \ncampaign trail. What is more, the President knew as well as I did when \nhe unveiled this plan that Democrats in the Senate had already \nscheduled a full slate of legislative business for the next few weeks. \nSo unless the White House wants to admit that it has no regard for its \nown party's legislative business in Congress, the President's call for \nimmediate action was clearly little more than a rhetorical flourish.\n  But the specifics we got yesterday only reinforced the impression \nthat this was largely a political exercise. For one, they undermined \nthe President's claim that it is a bipartisan proposal because much of \nwhat he is proposing has already been rejected on a bipartisan basis. \nThe $\\1/2\\ trillion tax hike the White House proposed yesterday will \nnot only face a tough road in Congress among Republicans but from \nDemocrats too.\n  The central tax hike included in this bill, capping deductions for \nindividuals and small businesses, was already dismissed by a \nfilibuster-proof, Democratic-controlled Senate in 2009. Another idea \nfloated by the White House yesterday, a tax on investment income, has \nbeen vehemently opposed by the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, among \nothers. A proposal to raise taxes on the oil and gas industry was \nrejected as a job-destroying tax hike by both Democrats and Republicans \njust a few months ago, and for good reason, since the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service tells us it would not only raise gas \nprices but, in addition to raising gas prices, would move jobs \noverseas. So claiming this bill is bipartisan may sound good if you are \nout there on the campaign trail, but surely the President could come up \nwith some proposals that both sides had not already rejected.\n  Here is how one prominent left-leaning analyst put it yesterday: \n``These aren't new policy ideas,'' he wrote. ``The Obama administration \nhas been looking to cap itemized deductions since the 2009 budget. Nor \nare they bipartisan policy ideas. . . . ''\n  The specifics we got yesterday were disappointing for another reason \nas\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\nwell. Not only have they failed to attract wide bipartisan support in \nthe past, even if they did enjoy bipartisan support they wouldn't \ncreate any jobs. The President knows raising taxes is the last thing \nyou want to do to spur job creation. He said so himself. Yet that is \nbasically all he is proposing: temporary stimulus to be paid for later \nby permanent tax hikes so that when the dust clears and the economy is \nno better off than it was after the first stimulus folks find \nthemselves with an even bigger tax bill than today.\n  The President can call this bill whatever he wants, but in reality \nall he is doing is proposing a hodgepodge of retread ideas aimed at \nconvincing people that a temporary fix is permanent and that it will \ncreate permanent jobs, and then daring Republicans to vote against it.\n  I think most people see through all of this. I think most Americans \nare smarter than that. I think they know our economic challenges are \nmore serious than this and that they require serious long-term \nsolutions. I think the American people realize we can do a lot better.\n  I have talked with a lot of job creators over the past few weeks, \nincluding many in my own State. It is no secret that they need to \ncreate jobs. Every one of them says the same thing. Yet the President \nrefuses to do any of it.\n  If the President is truly interested in growing the economy and \nputting Americans back to work, then he will leave the temporary \nproposals and the half measures and the tax hikes aside. He will \nconsult with both parties and work with us on a plan that indicates he \nhas learned something from the failures of the past 2 years and which \nactually has a chance of attracting bipartisan support.\n  He could start with a permanent reform of our broken tax system, \nreducing out-of-control Federal regulations, and by passing the trade \nbills that have been sitting on his desk since Inauguration Day 2009. \nAll of this is doable, all of it should attract bipartisan support, and \nall of it would actually create jobs. That would be a jobs plan worthy \nof the seriousness of the moment.\n  But make no mistake, what the President proposed so far is not \nserious, and it is not a jobs plan. After what we learned yesterday \nthat should be clear to everyone.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5509-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I listened carefully to the statement \nmade by the Republican leader. I noticed that for the last few days the \nRepublicans have been very quiet and calm and circumspect in their \nreaction to the President's speech to a joint session of Congress last \nThursday night. The President, of course, came to us and said this \neconomy needs a helping hand; we have to step in and do something. We \nhave to act and act now. He came up with a list of proposals Thursday \nnight that I think really do address what America needs: First and \nforemost, to create jobs--that is the No. 1 priority. The President \nsays we will do this by creating tax incentives for small businesses in \nparticular to hire people who have been unemployed and to give raises \nto those who currently work.\n\n  He knows families are struggling across America, working families, \nmiddle-class families. Many of them are living paycheck to paycheck. A \nrecent poll asked working families in America how many could come up \nwith $2,000 in 30 days, either from savings or borrowing, to meet a \nmedical emergency, for example. It turns out barely half of the working \nAmerican families polled can do so. Barely half of them could come up \nwith $2,000. It is a reminder to many of us who have a comfortable life \nthat the vast majority of working families struggle every single month \nto make ends meet. President Obama understands that, and that is why he \nhas proposed a payroll tax cut that will put more money in the hands of \nworking families. In Illinois, it will be an average of about $1,400 a \nyear. I wish it were more, but it is a recognition by the President \nthat to get this economy moving again, people have to have more \nconfidence in their own situation at home and more confidence in the \nfuture. Giving working families this spending power can make that \ndifference.\n  The President also understands and I am sure the Presiding Officer \nunderstands as well that many of the families who are unemployed now \nare desperate. I visited with many of them during the August recess, \ngoing to the Elgin Work Center and to others in McHenry County. I sat \ndown with these people who have been out of work for months--some even \nyears--and asked them: What is your day like? They come to these job \ncenters, they sit down, and they work on their resumes. They pore \nthrough all of the want ads, they pore through all of the information \nabout people seeking new employees, and they send out their resumes as \nquickly as possible. Of course, very few of them get any response at \nall.\n  It is a desperate situation. Some of them have lost their homes. Some \nof them are seeing their kids returning from college, unable to \ncontinue their studies because Dad is out of work. Some of the \nmarriages that have been involved have been strained and some have \nfailed because of this economic hardship. The President understands \nthat, and I hope we do too.\n  Unemployment compensation is absolutely essential as a lifeline to \nthese families, and the President makes that part of his package.\n  When I hear the Republican leader call these suggestions a \nhodgepodge, I don't think he is fair and I don't think he is just. Take \na look at the specifics: incentives for businesses to hire new workers, \npayroll tax cuts for working families for more spending money in hand, \nunemployment compensation for those who are out of work so they can \nsurvive.\n  The President also focuses on critical people. How many of us in the \nlast 48 hours have given a speech somewhere at home or here talking \nabout the great first responders of 9/11? The policemen, the \nfirefighters, the medical professionals who literally risked and some \neven gave their lives in response to that national emergency. We know \nwhat is happening across America. Many of these policemen and \nfirefighters are losing their jobs, along with teachers. The President \nunderstands that, and he puts resources into saving some of those jobs \nso that we can have the protection we need in our communities and the \nteachers we need for the next generation of workers.\n  President Obama believes, and I agree, that we need to invest in \nAmerica. When we build the infrastructure in America that will serve us \nin the 21st century, we create good-paying jobs right here at home. \nThese are not jobs you can ship overseas. President Obama understands \nthat. That is why that is a major part of his proposal. We are talking \nabout highways and bridges and airports and ports and waterways and \nschools. The President understands that investment in America not only \nhelps us today in invigorating the economy but will pay off for \ngenerations to come.\n  There were very few lines the President gave at his speech that drew \nstanding applause from the Republican side. I felt at one point that \nthe temperature of the Republican side of the aisle in the House \nChamber was 40 degrees below that on the Democratic side. It was cold \nover there. There was one line they finally acknowledged, and that was \nwhen the President said: For goodness' sake, we owe it to our veterans \nwho have come home to put them to work. To know that 10 percent of \nthose people who risked their lives for America are now back home and \nin unemployment lines is absolutely unacceptable, and President Obama \nrecognizes that in what he has called for to get this economy moving \nforward.\n  I don't think the Republican leader is fair in calling this a \nhodgepodge. It is\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\na carefully constructed plan to get this economy moving forward. What \nreally troubles the Republican leader--and I know he said as much this \nmorning--is that President Obama pays for it. Over and over, we hear \nfrom the Republican side: Don't add to the deficit. Pay for what you \ndo.\n  The President came out yesterday with his proposal of how to pay for \nit. How does he pay for it? For one, he takes away the subsidy to the \noil companies. There is a Federal subsidy that comes out of the \nTreasury and goes to oil companies across America, raises gasoline \nprices through the roof, making them able to enjoy the biggest business \nprofits in the history of the United States. Isn't it time to cut back \non that subsidy and use those resources for the President's plan to get \nthe economy moving forward?\n  The President limits the tax deductions and credits for those in \nhigher income categories. I find it hard to understand why the \nRepublican position is that we cannot ask those who are well off, the \nmost comfortable people in America, to pay one penny more in taxes. \nTheir position is absolute: not one penny more in taxes for the \nwealthiest in America. I think it is fair to limit the tax cuts to the \nwealthiest so that we can provide tax cuts for working families. That \nis sensible. It is not only morally right, it is economically right, \nand it troubles me when I hear the Republican leader reject that out of \nhand.\n  It appears that the warmth of the August Sun is cooling now in \nSeptember, and those who went home and heard how unhappy America is \nwith congressional roadblocks and obstruction have forgotten that \nlesson. They have forgotten what they heard. They are coming back now \nand saying that once again we are going to have a face-off and a \nconfrontation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5510-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5510-S5511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. There is one other area I wish to speak to. I know my \ncolleague from New York is going to be on the floor shortly. The area I \nwish to speak to is disaster relief.\n  I strongly support the disaster relief funding bill. As Americans \nundertake the physically and emotionally difficult task of rebuilding, \ncleaning up, and recovering from hurricanes and flooding and even \nearthquakes, we must see that the Disaster Relief Fund is there so they \ncan get back to their own lives as quickly as possible.\n  The year 2011 has been a record year when it comes to natural \ndisasters. The cost of recovery from Hurricane Irene alone could reach \n$1.5 billion. We have seen it this year in Illinois. It has been tough \nfrom Chicago to Cairo in the southern portion of our State. We have had \nblizzards and floods and tornadoes and troubles all around. Our State, \nlike most other States, has seen the damage and has felt it personally. \nPeople are trying to put their homes back together again.\n  Here is a photo--I saw this in person when I visited the State \nearlier this spring--around Cairo in the southern part of the State. It \nwas an awful situation. We had flooding along the Ohio River that \ntroubled and bothered the folks who live in southern Illinois as well \nas Kentucky and adjoining States, Missouri. Some of our towns, such as \nCairo, were literally threatened with being inundated. They had to blow \nlevees, which basically means to open up a place for the river water to \nflow. That flooded farmland in Missouri and Illinois, and we have to be \nsensitive to the fact that there were real losses there that need to be \npaid for. That record flooding really slammed the southern part of our \nState. The devastation was felt in the entire region.\n  The damage was not just there. I hear from people throughout the \nsouthern part of the State who are still struggling today because of \nthis flooding. Anthony Miles in Urbandale, IL, is an example. Flooding \nfrom the Ohio River rose so high that he could not even find his \nlawnmower in the front yard. All he could see was the river water. In \nMetropolis, IL, my friend Mayor Billy McDaniel said that people are \nstill trying to get the floodwater damage repaired in that town months \nlater. Harrah's casino in Metropolis, which is a major employer and \nsource of revenue in that area, was completely inundated with water, \nand hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs need to be done.\n  Some argue when it comes to these disasters that we cannot afford to \nhelp people in America. It appears to me that the guiding principle and \nmotto of the tea party in America is this: Just remember we are all in \nthis alone. That is what we hear over and over from them. Whenever we \nhave a problem facing us in America where we come together as a family \nto solve it, the tea party stands on the sidelines and says: Don't do \nit. Let them fail.\n  This morning, Senator Reid quoted a leading tea party advocate in the \nHouse who said: The Federal Emergency Management Agency should be put \nout of business.\n  I wonder where he lives. I wonder if his home has been spared. I \nwonder if he has seen people who through no fault of their own have \nlost everything because of a disaster. When that happens in America, we \nstep in and help one another. We don't get tied up in some political \ndebate. We don't find ourselves completely stopped from stepping \nforward and doing what is right, and we can't let it happen this time \neither.\n  Those who say we have to cut other government programs and education, \nmedical research, for example, to pay for the devastation, whether from \nHurricane Irene or flooding or earthquakes or tornadoes, I just don't \nthink they understand there are critical areas of government spending \nthat have been cut back already, and to cut them even further would \njeopardize the future of this country and the well-being of many \nfamilies.\n  I wanted to show a chart here which demonstrates the amount requested \nby the administration over the years by different Presidents for the \nDisaster Relief Fund. In each and every one of these cases, regardless \nof whether it was a Democratic or Republican administration, how much \nof these funds do you think were offset with funds from other accounts \nin the Federal budget? None. Zero. In 2000, when more than $3.5 billion \nwas appropriated for disaster recovery, how much was offset? None. In \n2005 and 2006, when communities all over the South were recovering from \nHurricane Katrina and more than $2 billion was appropriated each of \nthese 2 years for recovery, how much of that was offset? None. Under \nRepublican Presidents, such as President Bush, as well as Democratic \nPresidents, such as Presidents Clinton and Obama, we have not required \noffsets in the rest of the budget when we have literally faced a \ndisaster. We have stepped up, provided the money, and moved forward.\n  The number and cost of disasters have grown dramatically over the \npast few years. I do not want to engage the Senate in the debate about \nclimate change because I know people get red in the face and want to \ncome to the floor and tell us their political views of the science of \nthis question. But I will tell you this: The property and casualty \ninsurance industry of America testified before my committee recently \nand said they see what is coming--more disasters and more costs than we \never imagined. One of the experts said to be prepared to say every \nsummer of your life from this point forward: This is the hottest summer \nI can ever remember. That is what the future is going to hold.\n\n  As these temperature swings get worse and worse, they precipitate \nthese terrible storms. I am not an expert on much, but I am perhaps a \nlittle bit of an expert after almost 30 years of flying 48 roundtrips a \nyear between Illinois and Washington, flying on commercial airplanes. I \nthink I know a little bit about that, maybe even a little more than \nmost. This is one of the roughest periods I can remember. For the last \nseveral months, the storms and turbulence have been greater than I can \never recall. I hope it is an anomaly. I hope it never happens again. We \nare told by the experts it is likely to continue. It means more storms, \nmore damage, more disasters, and we do not have the funding here in \nWashington waiting to pay for it.\n  We have to step forward as the need arises and meet our obligations \nto the families and businesses that have been negatively affected. We \nknow that this damage which I showed in the southern part of my State \nreaches all over the State. This is an area of Galena, IL, the home of \nGeneral Grant, the President, Ulysses S. Grant, and this area in the \nnorthwest part of my State also\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\nhas been flooded, causing extreme damage to the people in the area. It \nis just another example of what we have been through.\n  If we freeze the money for disaster relief, as some have suggested, \nit would mean the repairs being made to recover from floods and storms \nfrom April and May will not be reimbursed. From Metropolis, IL, and \nsouthern Illinois, they are facing damage there that needs to be \nrepaired--the city of Carmi as well.\n  On Friday, President Obama requested $5 billion in new disaster \nfunding, $500 million in supplemental money for fiscal year 2011. The \nPresident recognizes 2011 has been an exceptional year for natural \ndisasters and that the recovery from Hurricane Irene alone could tax \nFEMA beyond what it is capable of providing.\n\n  This money is desperately needed for the families and businesses \ntrying to clean up and put themselves back on track. I strongly support \nthe supplemental appropriations for the disaster relief fund. Let's \nhelp our fellow Americans get back on their feet.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5511-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Patrick Hamburger\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to honor a fallen hero, \nNebraska Army National Guard Staff Sergeant Patrick Hamburger, a native \nof Lincoln who later settled in Grand Island, Nebraska.\n  Staff Sergeant Hamburger served his country as a flight engineer \nwhile mobilized with the Nebraska Army National Guard's Company B, 2nd \nBattalion 135th General Support Aviation, based in Grand Island. Staff \nSergeant Hamburger and 29 fellow soldiers paid the ultimate price in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom on August 6, 2011. He was the \ncrew chief on the Chinook helicopter downed by enemy fire in \nAfghanistan. It is through extraordinary sacrifices such as his that we \nare able to enjoy the freedoms we have today.\n  Staff Sergeant Hamburger's unfaltering devotion to duty and pride in \nhis country went beyond the time he spent in uniform. Patrick lived to \nhelp others. From his childhood in Lincoln, to mentoring fellow \nsoldiers, those who knew him recall that he was always looking out for \nothers. Patrick's brother Chris remembers his kind spirit by stating:\n\n       He didn't worry about himself half as much as he worried \n     about everyone else. You could have been a complete stranger \n     and if he could have helped you, he would have done it.\n\n  Thirteen years ago, that mentality and sense of patriotism led a \nyoung high school senior to take an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States and the State of Nebraska against all \nenemies, foreign and domestic. That oath brought opportunities for \nStaff Sergeant Hamburger to share his mechanical talent with his fellow \nsoldiers.\n  Those closest to him will tell us his pride and joy were his family, \nhis friends, and the ``V-Day Express,'' the Chinook helicopter he \nmaintained. He loved being a soldier, and he took great pride in his \nservice.\n  The decorations and badges earned during his 13 years of \ndistinguished service speak to his dedication and to his skill: the \nBronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Army Reserve Component Achievement \nMedal (4th Award), the National Defense Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Armed Forces \nReserve Medal (with 10 year device), Armed Forces Reserve Medal (with \nMobilization Device), the Noncommissioned Officer Professional \nDevelopment Ribbon, the Army Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Combat \nAction Badge, the Senior Aviation Badge, the Nebraska National Guard \nHomeland Defense Ribbon (with M device), the Nebraska National Guard \nEmergency Service Medal, the Nebraska National Guard Service Medal (10 \nyear device), and the California National Guard Commendation Medal.\n  These medals, as well as Sergeant Hamburger's willingness to serve \nothers in need, speak clearly to his commitment to upholding the values \nand ideals that all Nebraskans hold dear. We are proud of his character \nand the ways in which he represented Nebraska. I am confident that in \nthe coming months, Nebraskans will surround and uplift his family and \nfriends as they mourn the loss of a truly remarkable son, brother, and \nfriend.\n  Today, as we bow our heads with the Hamburger family, I ask that God \nprotect our servicemembers, both here and overseas.\n  We are truly grateful for the service and sacrifice made by those in \nuniform and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                    Destruction from Hurricane Irene\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken to so many of my colleagues--\nI know I have with my good friend, a distinguished Member of this body, \nthe Senator from Montana, and others--about what has happened in \nVermont. We are a little State. We are 660,000 people. We are a State \nthat has sent volunteers all over the country where people have been \nhit by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and flooding, but now \nVermont has been hit.\n  I was born in Vermont. My family came to Vermont in the 1800s. The \nonly thing that could even begin to match what we have seen were the \nhorrible floods of 1927. I was not alive then, but I remember the \nstories my parents told me. Certainly in my lifetime we have never seen \nanything like this. Vermont continues to grapple with the aftermath of \nTropical Storm Irene. It does not make a difference if you are a \nRepublican or a Democrat, all Vermonters are joined together to rebuild \nafter this disaster.\n  I wish to call the Senate's attention today to the severe and \nextensive damage done to our State's transportation infrastructure and \nto how the washed out roads and bridges are affecting the lives of all \nVermonters.\n  Here are a few of the scenes of the destruction. This was a main \nhighway. You can see one lane here. Look what happened. The road does \nnot begin to pick up again until we get over here. That was a highway \nthat had been used for decades. It is Route 100, south of Plymouth.\n  Plymouth, VT, is where Calvin Coolidge was born. He was spending time \nthere with his father when he got news that he had suddenly become \nPresident and was sworn in by his father, who was the justice of the \npeace. The deputy sheriff thought they may need security so he stood \nthere with a pitchfork in one hand and a lantern in the other.\n  But this photo shows you what has happened. They tried to build a \ntemporary bridge up there. As you know, being from a northern State, \nMr. President, we are going to have snow in Vermont in a matter of \nweeks and, of course, companies stop making asphalt in early November.\n  This is a photo I took of U.S. Route 4. I took it from a helicopter \nwhen Governor Shumlin and I toured the State\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nimmediately after Irene. It is a major east-west route across Vermont. \nAgain, look at this. We can't see one of the lanes of the road. It \nwould have gone just like this, but it is gone, and look how deep it \nis. That is because this river moved from where it had never been \nbefore and tore it out.\n\n  Governor Shumlin, the Governor of our State, General Michael Dubie, \nthe head of our National Guard, and I toured the damage around Vermont \nby helicopter immediately after the storm. We actually needed the \nhelicopter because many of the places we went were unreachable on the \nground.\n  This third one is the New England Central Rail Line in central \nVermont that hosts Amtrak's Vermonter train. One can actually get on \nthe Vermonter here in Washington and take it to New York and go up \nthrough New England to Vermont, which I have done a number of times. \nEconomic Recovery Act funds had just repaired this line to nearly mint \ncondition. Look at it now. We couldn't take a train across it. It has \nsunk out from underneath the track. That is a pretty horrific \nsituation.\n  This shot was taken along Vermont Route 30 in Jamaica, VT, or what is \nleft of it. This is while rains from the remnants of Hurricane Lee fell \non Vermont. We just got hit and hit and hit up there. We can see work \ncrews trying desperately to stay ahead of the rising water and some of \nthem, frankly, risking their lives to do that.\n  I might say, in that regard, we have had people come in to help out. \nI told the two Senators from Maine yesterday, we had highway \nconstruction people from Maine--crews, some on vacation--who came down \nand helped. In response, when we thanked them, they said: You helped \nus; we will help you. The Presiding Officer knows rural America. He \nknows we pitch in to try to help each other.\n  Unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Roads, bridges, \nand rail lines all over the State have been wiped out. I apologize to \nmy colleagues for being emotional, but this is my State. This is my \nhome. It is the home of my ancestors. We have seen flooding close more \nthan 300 town and State roads and damage more than 30 bridges, \nstranding people in more than one dozen towns for days. Damage to the \nState's Federal aid roads and bridges will exceed $\\1/2\\ billion in our \nlittle State. It is going to take years and years to recover.\n  It has been extremely difficult to move emergency supplies and \nbuilding materials around. Some of the washed-out roads have gaping \ngullies in the middle that are 30 feet or more deep. One can't drive a \ntruck over that. Some of the reopened roads and bridges are not yet \nrecommended for heavy traffic.\n  The consequences have been harsh. Residents are forced to make a 30-\nmile-plus detour to the nearest grocery store or doctor on mountain \nroads, many of them dirt roads. Businesses are struggling to reopen, \nrehire their people, and then to find new customers. Schools have been \nforced to remain closed until repairs are made, and children are \nwondering--adding to the trauma of what they have seen--when they are \ngoing back to the normalcy of going to school. Tourists are worrying \nabout traveling to Vermont this fall to see the foliage or this winter \nto do some skiing. These are major industries in our State.\n  The end of construction season in Vermont is fast approaching. As I \nmentioned earlier, by November, it will be too cold to lay asphalt. By \nDecember, snow and ice will cover the mountains, leaving many towns \ndangerously isolated. My home was safe, but I live on a dead-end dirt \nroad. It is 2 miles to the nearest paved road. I know how easily these \ndirt roads can be disrupted.\n  I applaud the Vermont Agency of Transportation and the Vermont \nNational Guard--along with the work crews and Guardsmen from States all \naround the country--because they are moving quickly to make emergency \nroad repairs and install temporary bridges. Governor Shumlin, General \nDubie, and I had to helicopter into one town because it was the only \nway to get there. At least now it has a temporary road. But these are \nlifelines to the hardest hit communities. We need to make more \npermanent repairs as soon as possible or future rains and the fall's \nfreeze-thaw cycle will further deterioration of our roads and make them \nall but impassable in the winter and cut off major parts of my State.\n  Given the breadth and depth of Irene's destruction, on top of the \ndisasters already declared in all 50 States, we have to ensure that \nFEMA and the Department of Transportation have all the resources they \nneed to help our citizens in their desperate time of need.\n  The other night the President addressed the Congress and the Nation \nfrom the floor of the House of Representatives. On his way in, he \nleaned over and said to me: I am thinking of your people in Vermont. \nThat means a lot. I applaud him for issuing the emergency declaration \nvery quickly and then making adjustments when we needed them.\n  We have to replenish the FEMA disaster relief fund and the Federal \nhighway emergency road fund, both of which are at dangerously low \nlevels right now, not just for Vermont but for every other State that \nhas been hit with the same kind of problems. Without supplemental \nfunding to these and the other emergency accounts, Vermont and all the \nother 49 States with ongoing Federal disasters are not going to have \nthe resources to rebuild.\n  Americans should be worried about Americans. The kind of money we are \ntalking about we throw away in Iraq and Afghanistan in 1 week's time \nand we do it on a credit card and we say we don't have to pay for it. \nNow we have some say: If we are going to help Americans, we better find \nout some way we can pay for it. What can we take away from other \nAmericans to help these Americans? Can we take away from education, \nmedical research, housing?\n  Let's start thinking about America. We have seen the billions, \neventually trillions, we have spent trying to rebuild Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and we know how much that is appreciated. These are \nAmericans who do appreciate and need the help.\n  Let us come home. Let us take care of the needs in America. There is \nso much on the line, so starkly for so many, it would be horrible and \nunseemly to play politics with disaster relief. We have never done this \nbefore.\n  I was heartened, as I came into one, badly damaged town and I got an \ne-mail from a very conservative Republican Senator who said: Pat, you \nhelped us when our State was hit. What can we do to help your State? \nThat is the kind of bipartisanship, Republicans and Democrats, have \ndisplayed in the past to come together.\n  Thousands of American families and businesses have been devastated by \nan unprecedented series of floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and \nwildfires--look at the pictures out of Texas--and other disasters over \nthese years. The people are hurting out there. They are not thinking \nabout Democrats versus Republicans or red States versus blue States. \nThey are saying: We are Americans. We help everybody else; we can at \nleast help ourselves. People are desperate for a helping hand from \ntheir fellow Americans. We are one Nation. We have traditionally come \nto the aid of our fellow Americans in times of need.\n  In my 37 years in the Senate, we have always dealt with disaster \nbills together. We haven't cared whether it was a Republican State or a \nDemocratic State or Democratic or Republican President. We have worked \nacross the aisle, in the spirit of bipartisanship, in the best \ninterests of America and in the best tradition of our country. As a \nnation, can we afford to toss that tradition and cooperation overboard? \nIt is unconscionable that a small number decided to inject politics and \npolitical point-scoring into a situation that already is so difficult \nand so laden with grim realities for so many of our fellow citizens. Go \nand talk to a farmer who has seen his herd decimated and tell him that. \nGo and see a small business owner who is a major employer in a small \ntown who is saying: I don't know how I can keep hiring these people. Go \nand tell a child who has asked their parents when the road will be done \nso we can go to school or visit grandma. Tell them. Tell them.\n  Leader Reid is right to bring an emergency disaster relief package to \nthe floor that will give aid to all 50 States suffering from the \neffects of unprecedented natural disasters. I state the obvious when I \nsay we need Republican cooperation to get this urgent job\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\ndone. I encourage my colleagues to end this shameful filibuster of the \ndisaster relief bill. Let us proceed to a full debate on how to help \nour fellow Americans--our fellow Americans--as quickly as we can.\n  I have taken a lot of time of the Senate. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5513-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the urgent \nneed for FEMA disaster funds, which is under this Burma joint \nresolution. I was very concerned when I heard some of my colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives demanding that spending cuts be in \nexchange for supplemental disaster relief funds. Last night, we could \nnot even pass a procedural vote to proceed to a bill that would provide \nthis needed relief. This raises the question, What kind of country are \nwe? Are we a country that takes care of the victims of disasters \nwithout hesitation or reluctance or are we a country that engages in \nmisguided debates in the midst of a disaster when our citizens need us \nthe most?\n  My State of Minnesota has seen its fair share of natural disasters \nover the last few years. In the past year and a half, President Obama \nhas declared seven Federal disasters in my State. I have seen the \ndevastation Mother Nature can cause. I have seen communities that \ndesperately need Federal assistance to recover. Northwest Minnesota has \nseen the phenomenon of 100-year floods turn into nearly annual events. \nEvery spring, towns in the Red River Valley of the north hope that this \nyear will not see another record-setting flood.\n  This spring, I visited Georgetown, MN, and watched as they built \nemergency earthen levees to protect their town. The town had run out of \nthe clay needed to build their levee, and the only choice left for them \nwas to dig up their baseball field--their park, the diamond and the \nrest of the park. I watched as they dug up the heart of their community \nto protect their homes and businesses.\n  That same day, I visited Oslo, MN. Flooding in the Red River turns \nOslo into an island town. Residents are cut off from the rest of \nMinnesota for weeks as the Red River floods all of the surrounding \nroads. That night, as I left, I was one of the last cars to make it out \nof town before all the roads were closed, and its residents prayed that \nthe temporary levees would hold.\n  The residents of Georgetown and Oslo were doing what they could do to \nprotect themselves, but not all disasters can be anticipated. On June \n17 of last year, storms brought 39 tornadoes, 26 funnel clouds, and 69 \nreports of hail in Minnesota. Three Minnesotans died.\n  The town of Wadena was hit the hardest; 234 homes were damaged. The \nroof was torn off the high school, and the county fairgrounds and \ncommunity center were destroyed.\n  After a disaster, Minnesotans have enough to worry about. It would be \nterribly unfair to pile politics on top of their worries. Natural \ndisasters just happen. They are acts of God, and they happen without \nwarning. Minnesotans need to know, when their State and local \ngovernments are overwhelmed, that their Federal Government will be \nthere to help them recover. Every State needs to know that; we are one \ncountry. And they need to know we will not play politics with their \nlives and their livelihood.\n  Many of the same people who are demanding that we offset the costs of \nnatural disasters have voted year after year to fund our wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq without paying for them. Some have done this for \nnearly 10 years now. They have passed on well over $1 trillion in debt \nto our children to finance wars that have not been a surprise and that \nwe could have and should have been budgeting for from the beginning.\n  For the last 10 years, we have paid for wars by borrowing from \ncountries such as China willing to finance our debt and by giant \nemergency spending bills, as they are called. That is unusual in \nAmerican history, where wars usually prompt reevaluations of our fiscal \npolicy.\n  This spring, I introduced my Pay for War resolution to address this \nfiscal irresponsibility. My resolution would simply require that war \nspending be offset in the future. To be sure, there can be real \nemergencies that require the immediate exercise of military force with \nits attendant costs. That is why my resolution allows the offset \nrequirement to be waived in such emergencies. But when you know year-in \nand year-out that you are going to be at war, you should budget for \nthat and not just pass the costs on to your children.\n  Iraq and Afghanistan have cost us well over $1 trillion, and we will \nbe paying for years to care for the veterans who came back with the \nwounds of war. That did not singlehandedly create our deficit problem, \nbut it sure made it a lot worse. Yet many of the same people who now \ndemand that we must offset disaster spending for Americans who have \nlost their homes or are suffering otherwise have been fine with \nspending staggering sums of money on our wars--without offsetting them. \nDoesn't that seem just a little hypocritical? I wonder, what kind of \nmindset does it take to conclude that it is OK to pass on to your \nchildren the costs of war. Yet, when Americans have lost their homes or \nhad their communities destroyed, it is not OK to respond to that \nemergency in an appropriate way? It just does not make sense to me.\n  When Congress plans its spending, it can and should be accounted for \nthrough a budget. But when emergencies arise--and natural disasters are \nthe quintessential emergency--we should not hesitate to act for the \ngood of the American people. I believe the United States of America is \na country that protects its citizens when they are at their most \nvulnerable. I hope this Congress will confirm that conviction by voting \nfor emergency aid to the communities across this Nation that have been \ndevastated by natural disasters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as you no doubt know, the State of \nVermont has been hit very hard by Hurricane Irene. The storm caused \nwidespread flooding, resulting in a number of deaths, the loss of many \nhomes and businesses, and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to \nour property and our infrastructure. I have visited many of the most \nhard hit towns, and I was shocked and moved by the extent of the \ndamage. Many of these towns still today have very limited access \nbecause the roads and bridges that link them to the outside world have \nbeen destroyed. Irene will go down in history as one of the very worst \nnatural disasters ever to hit the State of Vermont.\n  Let me take this opportunity again to thank everybody who has lent a \nhand to help their friends and neighbors stricken by this disaster. I \nespecially wish to commend and thank our emergency responders--they did \na fantastic job--the Vermont National Guard and our local officials for \nall they are doing to assist communities and individuals in getting \nback on their feet.\n  We still do not know the cost of this disaster, but let me share with \nyou just a few preliminary figures, and really this is quite \nremarkable, remembering that Vermont is a State of about 630,000 \npeople, with approximately 200,000 households.\n  Today, already more than 4,200 Vermonters--and by and large, those \nare households--have registered with FEMA. With 200,000 households, we \nhave over 4,000 that have already registered with FEMA.\n  To date, there have been more than 700 homes confirmed as severely \ndamaged or totally destroyed. Again, we have about 200,000 households \nand 700 homes have been confirmed as severely damaged or completely \ndestroyed.\n  More than 72,000 homes across the State were left without \nelectricity.\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nThat is about one-third of the total. Thousands lost phone service. And \nin some areas, these services have still not been restored.\n  The storm knocked out 135 segments of the State highway system as \nwell as 33 State bridges. Thirteen communities were completely isolated \nfor days. Thirty-five roads and bridges are still shut down, while many \nothers are only open for emergency services.\n  Hundreds of farms and businesses have been destroyed, undermining the \nfabric of our rural economy.\n  Our Amtrak and freight rail services were completely suspended, as \ntracks literally washed into rivers. One of our two Amtrak lines is \nstill down today.\n  The State's largest office complex--we have a very large office \ncomplex in Waterbury, VT, near our State capital, in which 1,600 State \nemployees go to work every day. It is the nerve center of the entire \nState. That complex was flooded. Those 1,600 workers have not been able \nto return to their offices, disrupting the ability of the State to \ndeliver critical State functions.\n  At least 90 public schools were either directly damaged or \ninaccessible because roads washed out and could not be opened on time. \nFive public schools remain closed until further notice.\n  This is but a short list of the devastation experienced by the State \nof Vermont as a result of Hurricane Irene. I know that, as in times \npast, we will pick up the pieces and restore our homes and businesses. \nThat is what Vermonters will do. Vermont communities stick together in \nhard times, and it has been absolutely amazing to see the volunteer \nefforts taking place from one end of the State to the other. What comes \nto mind now: police officers from the northern part of the State \nrelieving their brothers and sisters in the southern part of the State \nwho are under stress. We are seeing that in almost every area--\nstrangers coming to help people whose homes and businesses were \nflooded. But the simple fact is, Vermont can not do it alone, nor can \nany other State hard hit by disasters. The scale of what Hurricane \nIrene did is overwhelming for a State of our size. The Federal \nGovernment has an important role to play in disaster relief and \nrecovery. Historically it has, and today it has.\n  When our fellow citizens in Louisiana--and I see the Senator from \nLouisiana here--suffered the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, people \nin Vermont, in a very deep sense, were there for them. When the \ncitizens of Joplin, MO, were hit by the deadly tornadoes, people on the \nwest coast were there for them. When terrorists attacked on 9/11, \neverybody in America was there for New York City. That is what being a \nnation is about.\n  The name of our country is the United--U-n-i-t-e-d--States of \nAmerica, and if that name means anything, it means that when disaster \nstrikes one part of the country, we rally as a nation to support our \nbrothers and sisters.\n  I would like to thank, in that context, Majority Leader Reid and \nSenator Landrieu for their commitment to drafting a disaster relief \nsupplemental appropriations bill to provide $6.9 billion in disaster \nrelief funding.\n  At a time when funding is tight and every appropriation is subjected \nto even more intense scrutiny, the majority leader and Senator Landrieu \nare doing exactly the right thing in addressing these needs now. \nSenator Reid has my full support.\n  While it is imperative for Congress to adequately fund FEMA's \nDisaster Relief Fund, the Federal response, in my view, should be more \ncomprehensive, as it has been for past disasters of this scale.\n  In particular, it is imperative to address the severe damage to roads \nand bridges by providing funding for the Federal Highway \nAdministration's Emergency Relief Program. In Vermont alone, \npreliminary estimates to the federal-aid highway system are well in \nexcess of $500 million and likely will be much more. That is an \nincredible amount of money for a small State such as Vermont. For a \nState that receives a total Federal apportionment of $210 million \nannually, the scale of damage relative to our State's ability to pay \nfor it cannot be overstated.\n  Similarly, it is important to provide sufficient emergency funding \nfor programs such as community development block grants, the Economic \nDevelopment Administration, the Emergency Conservation and Emergency \nWatershed Protection Programs at the Department of Agriculture, and the \nDisaster Loan Program at the Small Business Administration.\n  Additionally, given the significant impact of the floods on the stock \nof affordable housing, it is very important to include an appropriation \nfor the HOME program, as well as an additional disaster allocation of \nlow-income housing tax credits. In Vermont, more than 350 mobile homes \nwere destroyed or severely damaged, and many trailer parks will never \nreopen. In other words, we are going to have to make up for a lot of \nlost affordable and lower income housing.\n  Let me conclude by saying this country has its problems. We all know \nthat. But if we forsake the essence of what we are as a nation--and \nthat is standing together when disaster strikes--if we forgo that and \nno longer live up to that, I worry very much about the future of \nAmerica as a great nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to support the remarks of the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Franken, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nSanders, who have described beautifully several different aspects of \nthis debate. Senator Franken said: How is it that so many on the other \nside rush to support funding for wars and rebuilding in Afghanistan and \nIraq and never ask for one dime to be offset, and yet at a time when \nAmericans need help, they are not, let's say, leaning forward?\n  I think there are a lot of Americans, not only from around the \ncountry but from their own States, who might be very puzzled by this \nsudden commitment to find offsets when it comes to rebuilding \nneighborhoods in Minnesota or Vermont or neighborhoods in Virginia or \nin Massachusetts or in other States, such as New York, which have been \nso hard hit. I think they will have some explaining to do, which is why \nI hope today, when we retake this vote, many of my friends on the other \nside will consider the leadership shown last night by Senators Blunt, \nBrown, Coats, Collins, Heller, and Snowe. These six Senators voted yes \nto move forward to try to find a way to find the political will to \nprovide funding for disaster victims now, not wait but send them a \npowerful and strong and clear and unambiguous signal that the Senate \nand the Congress hear their cry. We know of their anxiousness and \ndistress and we will respond and we will fight about how to pay for \nthis later--but not now.\n  They need to hear from us now that help is on the way. What they need \nto hear is that the fund will be replenished. What they need to hear--\nthe mayors, county commissioners, and Governors, Republicans and \nDemocrats, from Governor Christie in New Jersey to Governor McDonnell \nin Virginia, who have given their support for funding disasters now--\nwhat they need to do is not worry about us because they have enough to \nworry about. They have roads to rebuild and neighborhoods to rebuild \nand rivers to get in their banks.\n  I heard today from Senator Schumer that in one of the canals--I think \nthe Erie Canal--the lock is no longer connected to the canal. That is \nhow powerful the water was. There is a lock and a canal, but they are \nnot together. That is a problem not just for New York but for the \nentire northeastern transportation infrastructure, which affects us \nall.\n  As a Senator from Louisiana, I, of course, feel particularly strong \nabout this because many of these Senators, Republicans and Democrats, \ncame to our aid 6 years ago when Katrina hit--the worst natural and \nmanmade disaster because, as you know, it wasn't just the hurricane \nthat did us in down there on the gulf coast, it was the collapse of a \nFederal levee system that should have held and didn't and breached or \nbroke or evaporated in 52 places and left a major metropolitan, \ninternationally famed city underwater and literally fighting for its \nvery survival--a metropolitan area of over 1.5 million people.\n  This country rallied, after a lot of push from me and others and the \nprivate sector stood up and the nonprofit community was terrific. We \nstill have literally thousands of volunteers still\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\ncoming. It is so heartwarming. They are coming to Louisiana and to \nMississippi to help us rebuild. I just drove the gulf coast 3 weeks \nago--my husband and I. We said, let's go see the coast of Waveland and \nthe coast of Mississippi and how it is coming along. I visit our \nneighborhoods regularly in south Louisiana to see how they are coming \nalong. Still, 6 years later, they are struggling. I don't think there \nis 1 house up for every 10 destroyed in Waveland today.\n  That is how hard this work is. It doesn't happen automatically. \nMississippi is working hard and Louisiana is working hard. I can only \nimagine how other States feel, such as Joplin, MO, which was hit by a \ntornado with winds that might have exceeded 250 miles an hour. That is \nunheard of.\n  This is not time for my friends on the other side to sit on their \nhands or take out their green eyeshade and pencil and figure out how we \nare going to pay for it this week. We have all year to discuss that. We \nneed to send them emergency funding now and learn how to pay for it \nlater.\n  This is what our map looks like. Green is too pleasant a color for \nthis map. This indicates the destruction--or the number of disasters \nthat have been declared by the President. For the first time, I \nbelieve, in our Nation's history, a disaster has been declared in every \nState but two--Michigan and West Virginia. Michigan technically could \nbe declared a disaster because it has been under an economic disaster \nfor several years but not a natural weather event. They most certainly \nare having very tough economic times in Michigan. West Virginia always \nhas tough times as one of our poorest States. The whole country is in \nneed.\n  Why would the other side sit when America is lit up with disasters? \nWe have to ask them to reconsider and move forward with the $7 billion \nhelp now. Not only is it the right thing to do and the moral thing to \ndo and what Americans do for each other and what we should do, but it \nis all about--besides the moral aspect, which is obviously the most \nimportant--there being a real immediate economic benefit to this. If \nthere was ever a jobs bill, this is it. I can promise you, having lived \nthrough this disaster recovery, it is like a shot in the arm for these \ncommunities. Literally, every single dollar that leaves our hands and \ngoes to theirs will be spent immediately on food, clothes, and building \nmaterials. This is the most direct stimulative job creation we could \ndo, and we need to do it now, this week, and send a strong signal to \nthe House of Representatives: Don't fool around with disasters, and \nlet's get this job done.\n  Let me just show you that when people say you haven't provided \nfunding for disasters, we have provided funding in our base bill for \ndisasters. I see the Senator from California, and I will be just 2 \nminutes more. I want people to know we have budgeted for disasters. I \nchair the Homeland Security appropriations bill. It is about a $42 \nbillion bill. As we know from marking the 9/11 anniversary this past \nSunday, that department was created after 9/11 to respond to new \nthreats. We pulled disparate agencies together--tried to pull them \ntogether. That is still a work in progress. We have $42 billion. So we \nbudgeted for FEMA in that budget, in 2003, $800 million. It was \nobviously not enough. So then we went up because disasters were \nincreasing to 128. In 2005, Katrina hit and completely shattered the \nmodel. The expenses of Katrina, Rita, and Wilma exceeded the entire \nbudget of Homeland Security. It was $43 billion just for Katrina, Rita, \nand Wilma. The whole budget is only $42 billion.\n  When people say pay for it out of our budget, we cannot do that. In \nsome cases, it exceeds the entire budget of the country. It is not \nright to pay for past disasters with money we use to prepare for future \ndisasters. We have beefed up base funding, but we don't have the level \nof base funding that potentially may be necessary. Now is not the \ntime--we can see--now is not the time to keep the east coast waiting \nand Missouri waiting and the floods along the Mississippi River waiting \nand some people in California waiting. Texas, might I say, has had \n20,000 fires. This is not the time to keep the people of Texas waiting \nwhile we figure this out. Eventually, we are going to have to figure it \nout, but we don't have to do it this week.\n  I see the Senator from California. I will yield to her, and then I \nwill be happy to add a few more comments to the record.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was not \nagreed to on the motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 66 be agreed to; that \nthe motion to reconsider be agreed to; that the time until 4:15 p.m. be \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; and that at \n4:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture \non the motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 66.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are a lot of things going on on \nCapitol Hill this afternoon. We will make sure people have ample time \nto vote, as long as somebody doesn't carry it to extremes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader, before he \nleaves, I didn't hear all he said. Is this the fact that we are going \nto vote again on proceeding to a bill that will allow us to take up \nthis emergency FEMA funding?\n  Mr. REID. My friend is absolutely right. We need to do this. During \nthe caucus that was completed, the Senators from New York indicated, \nfor example, that the Mohawk River because of the storms changed \ncourse. The Erie Canal lock doesn't work. They are going to have to \nspend lots of resources to get the Erie Canal back, which handles \ncommerce in that part of the State. That is just one thing.\n  So the answer to my friend from California is, yes, we need to get \npeople help now. People are desperate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, taking back my time, I am very pleased we \nare having another chance at this because--just for the information of \nthe public--we fell short of the votes required to take up this \nemergency bill. I just looked up the meaning of ``emergency'' in the \ndictionary. It says:\n\n       A serious situation or occurrence that happens unexpectedly \n     and demands immediate attention.\n\n  That was Webster's dictionary--no, it was dictionary.com. They have \nthe best definition, and I want to repeat it. An emergency is a serious \nsituation or occurrence that happens unexpectedly and demands immediate \naction.\n  That isn't a Democratic definition or a Republican definition or an \nIndependent Party definition. That is what an emergency is. To anyone \nwho says don't worry; if an emergency happens we can take care of it \njust from our existing funds, that is not true.\n  Senator Landrieu is our leader in the Appropriations Committee, and \nwhat she told us in a meeting we just had a few minutes ago is that \nthere is support in her committee to fund FEMA--the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. They are the ones, as everyone knows, who gets out \nthere.\n  I will never forget the wonderful James Lee Witt who headed FEMA \nduring the days of Bill Clinton. He was out there with Senator \nFeinstein and myself when we had earthquakes, floods, fires, and \neverything. There wasn't even a question. He knew we would rebuild. He \nknew he could make those commitments.\n  I will just say this: Senator Landrieu held up a map that shows 48 \nStates having been hit by horrible emergencies, some that we never \nanticipated, such as a terrible earthquake right here in this area, \nfloods that had not been experienced since the 1920s in Vermont, and \nCalifornia has had some horrible problems, and we have had some \nterrible emergencies. The President worked with the Governor, and we \nhave these disaster declarations. But now, because the funds we set \naside just weren't enough--and that isn't anybody's fault, it is an \nemergency, a serious situation that happens unexpectedly--we have to \nmove.\n  I have heard one of the Republican leaders in the House say we have \nto cut spending to pay for this emergency. He has recommended a place \nto cut that will cut jobs. It will cut jobs and it will stop us from \nbeing able to reinvigorate our manufacturing sector. That is \nridiculous, unnecessary, and unwarranted. We all know we are going to \ndo\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\ndeficit reduction. We all know there is a smart way to do it. We did it \nwhen Bill Clinton was President. We stopped spending on things we \ndidn't need, we invested in the things we knew would create jobs, and \nwe asked the billionaires to pay their fair share--thank you very much.\n  So let's not get this mixed up with deficit reduction. We are on a \npath to cut the deficit. We will cut the deficit. We know how to cut \nthe deficit. We did it under Bill Clinton. We balanced the budget, we \ncreated surpluses, and we had the debt on the downswing. But don't \nconfuse that with making sure our communities are OK.\n  The Senators from Vermont spoke today at our luncheon, and one of \nthem had tears coming down his face talking about a woman who was very \nill in one of their communities who had to go to chemotherapy. It used \nto be a 5-minute drive in her car. Now she has to drive an hour and a \nhalf in order to get her treatment. So please don't talk about making \nsomeone like that suffer even more. Talk about what we can do as a \nnation when we pull together as Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents.\n  I spoke at a memorial in my hometown on September 11, and when I put \ntogether my remarks, I kept harping on the unity we had then.\n  Well, we need to be true to ourselves and to our constituencies and \nto our beliefs, but there are moments in time when we come together as \nAmericans. I don't know the party affiliation of that woman in Vermont, \nand I could care less. We need to help people who get stuck in these \nfires, in these disasters--in earthquakes, floods, and droughts. I do \nnot believe the American people think when we have that kind of act of \nGod--and that is the legal term as well as a true term--they are on \ntheir own.\n  Last night, our leader tried to move to a bill that would allow us to \ntake up assistance to these people in desperate need and keep our \npromises to those who were the victims of disaster in my home State and \nother States. I believe I am correct that Senator Landrieu told us we \nhave 48 States since January 1. So I don't know, but I think my caucus \nis going to stand on its feet until this is done. We are not going to \nback off.\n  This is one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice \nfor all. I want to give justice to the people who are struggling, who \nare suffering, and who pay their taxes. I want to help the small \nbusinesses that are underwater. There is no liberty if someone is \ntrapped in a house somewhere that is cut off because the road went out. \nThe Senators from Vermont talked about the roads that are impassable--\nimpassable.\n  So last night we had a bad vote. We didn't have enough votes. We need \n60 votes. I hope anyone listening to the sound of my voice will call \ntheir Senator and double-check how he or she voted because Hurricane \nIrene could cost more than $10 billion. It would make it 1 of the 10 \nmost costly disasters in U.S. history. We have seen record flooding on \nthe Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and we have seen lives lost and \nfarmland devastated.\n  Senators spoke in our caucus about what happened to their farmers. \nThey do not have crop insurance for all these crops. These particular \ncrops were not covered. One of our colleagues said: It is bad enough we \nhave to import oil from other countries; do we want to start importing \nour food from China and be reliant on other countries for our food \nsupply?\n  Right now, as I stand here, we have brave heroes--our firefighters--\nbattling wildfires in California and Texas. Here is a picture, because \na picture is worth a lot of words--here is a picture of a fire raging \nout of control. The firefighters are as close as they can get to the \nflames. This one shows the Comanche Fire in Kern County. It has burned \nmore than 29,000 acres and is threatening 2,300 homes in Stallion \nSprings, CA.\n  The firefighters have gotten this fire 60 percent under control \nbecause they have had help from FEMA. They have been able to get help \nfrom the Federal Government. But the fire season in California has just \nbegun. A lot of people don't realize that in our State September and \nOctober are the driest and the hottest months. So every wildfire \nthreatens our communities just as this one. Right now FEMA barely has \nenough funds to get through the next couple of months. FEMA is running \nlow on resources, and funds are so low they can't provide assistance \nfor communities that are rebuilding from past disasters let alone \nrespond to what is happening right now on the ground as we speak.\n  I heard the Lieutenant Governor of Texas complaining--complaining--\nabout the situation in Texas, that they need more Federal help. Well, \nfine. He ought to call up his Senators and tell them to vote with us \ntoday to get that Federal help.\n  We have more than $380 million in disaster recovery projects on \nhold--several in California. We had a tsunami March 11, 2011. We need \nthe $5.3 million that has been promised to help communities in Del \nNorte, Monterey, and Santa Cruz, CA. This tsunami did damage.\n  Let me show a picture from the 2010 mud slide. In January and \nFebruary of 2010 in California we were hit by severe winter storms, \nwith flooding and mud slides. You can see a very important road has \nbeen blocked, again, shutting off people. We have a lot of mountains, \nso we have to cut through those mountains. Calaveras, Imperial, Los \nAngeles County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Siskiyou Counties were \nhit, and FEMA promised them funding. They met the criteria, they had \nthe level of damage, and they are waiting. Right now they can't proceed \nwithout the $3.5 million they need to recover.\n  So that is what this impasse is about. This isn't about make-believe. \nThis is about real people who are cut off, shut off, businesses shut \ndown, people laid off, and suffering. So let's not have a political \nspat around here. This isn't a partisan issue. When your neighbor's \nhouse is on fire, you don't haggle over the price of a garden hose. You \nget the hose out, connect it, and put the fire out.\n  The good news is we have people from both parties who are starting to \nrealize we have to do this. We have to send a message to the House. An \nemergency is an emergency. We have to put aside politics for the good \nof our country.\n  So I will close where I started, with the dictionary definition of \n``emergency'': a serious situation or occurrence that happens \nunexpectedly and demands immediate action.\n  We all agree we have serious situations in our great land. We all \nagree we didn't expect all of this. Although, if I might say with a \ndifferent hat on--my hat as the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee--we better understand that climate change is coming. We \nbetter understand what we are seeing now is going to be a new normal. \nIt pains me to say we have done nothing in terms of addressing some of \nthe causes. But guess what. Regardless of our views, as my kids would \nsay, we are where we are, and it is what it is, and this is what it \nlooks like in too many parts of our great Nation.\n  So an emergency is a serious situation or occurrence that happens \nunexpectedly and demands immediate action, and I echo the call by our \nDemocratic leader for immediate action at 4:15. I hope the phones will \nlight up and everyone will call their Senators. It is time to vote yes \non our vote at 4:15 and get on with this so people will know we stand \nwith them in this greatest of nations; that we don't walk away from our \npeople when they are suffering like this.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \nher poignant, eloquent, and appropriate words. I thank the chair of our \nHomeland Security Subcommittee which handles FEMA disasters for the \ngreat work she has done.\n  Mr. President, I spent several days, both this week and last week, \nvisiting the places in upstate New York that were so badly damaged. \nUpstate New York is a large community. Without New York City and the \nsuburbs we would still be about the eighth or ninth largest State, and \nthe eastern half of upstate New York has been unexpectedly devastated \nnot once but twice--first by Irene and then by Lee.\n  It comes on top of an awful season. Because we have had so much rain \nand the ground has been so wet when these\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\ntorrential rains occur--one a hurricane, one a tropical storm--no \ngroundwater could be absorbed and it made things worse. Let me tell you \na few of the things I have seen, just to share with my colleagues.\n  We went to a small village in Schoharie County. Schoharie County is a \nbeautiful agricultural, dairy county, and it is dotted by small towns \nlike much of upstate New York. We have the third largest rural \npopulation in the country. Only Pennsylvania and North Carolina have \nlarger rural populations than New York. We went down a beautiful \nstreet, a nice typical street. It could be a street you might see on an \nOzzie and Harriet-type TV series. Every single house, street after \nstreet, had all its belongings piled in front. The water from Schoharie \nCreek had so overflowed its banks that the entire town was flooded, not \nby a foot of water but by 3, 4, 5, 6 feet of water. Out front you see \nthe lives of the people whose lives have been so turned inside out by \nthe torrent of water. They have lost thousands of dollars worth, each \nfamily, at a time they can ill afford it, but it is beyond that. It is \nthe picture of grandma and grandpa at their wedding, the only one left. \nThat is gone. It is the chair dad loved and sat in every night when he \ncame home from work. It is their lives wiped out in a few sheer \nmoments.\n  In this town in Schoharie County and in most of New York State, \nalmost all, the evacuation plans were amazing. We lost very few lives. \nIn some counties, with huge amounts of devastation, no lives were lost \nin most. That is because of the great emergency work of our relief \nworkers. As bad as Schoharie County was, because years ago FEMA had \ninstalled their warning system and warning sirens, people were able to \nget out of their homes and avoid being drowned. A dam that again we had \nprovided some dollars for, Federal dollars, didn't break. Had it, it \nwould have been even worse. But FEMA money to prevent disaster has \nhelped strengthen the Gilboa Dam. So the creek went over it and around \nit but not through it, and that saved lives.\n  I visited a place in Ulster County. These are vignettes. The town of \nShandaken is beautiful, in the foothills of the Catskills. There is a \nmajor road that connects one part of Shandaken to the other, a county \nroad. As you are driving along, it is newly paved macadam. All of a \nsudden you see the yellow strips to prevent you from going further and \nthere is a 30-foot gash in the road, totally gone--30 feet. But what is \nastounding is it is 20 feet deep. At Esopus Creek, the waterway there \nchanged its course, went through not just the macadam, not just the \nunderlay that holds the road, not just the dirt fill of a foot or two, \nbut through the bedrock, through 10 feet of bedrock. It will take years \nto bring this road back, and it is a cost the town of Shandaken can't \nafford. Our little towns, our little villages, our cities, even our \ncounties of some significant population, can't absorb the millions and \nmillions of dollars of damage. The total estimate by our Governor is we \nhave suffered more than $1 billion of damage from Irene alone, and of \ncourse Lee moved slightly further west than Irene.\n  I visited a lock in the Mohawk Valley and the city of Amsterdam. It \nhad been very damaged. On a dam that a bridge went over, the metal of \nthe bridge, the steel girders were twisted out of shape. But locks 9 \nand 10 a little further downriver are no longer functioning because the \ntorrent of rain created such swells that the Mohawk changed its course. \nSo the locks are here and the river is here.\n  The Erie Canal, one of our great pieces of history, is damaged so \nthat it can't function. It won't function for quite a long time, even \nwith Federal assistance--I don't know without Federal assistance what \nwould happen--for months and even years.\n  Then I went to Binghamton. Maybe that was the saddest of all. \nBinghamton is a city that has struggled. It had IBM in its early days. \nIBM was founded there. Nothing is left of IBM there, and the city is \nstruggling. It is at the confluence of two river valleys, the \nSusquehanna and the Shenango, and it had been terribly flooded in 2006. \nSenator Clinton and I visited. It was awful--hundreds of homes, the \nsewage plant, the hospital, Lourdes Hospital. Incidentally, Lourdes \nHospital wasn't damaged because, again, FEMA, with remediation money \nafter 2006 helped supply some of the money for a wall that prevented \nthe Shenango River from damaging the hospital. So it, thank God, is \nfunctioning.\n  But then we went to the shelter, with 500, 600 people who had been \nthere for days and have nowhere to go because they lived in rental \napartments in downtown Binghamton, which was totally flooded. Every \nhotel and motel room in Binghamton is taken. There are very few rental \napartments. They have nowhere to go--nowhere to go. Maybe FEMA will \ncome in and bring trailers, as they did for your great State of \nLouisiana, Madam President. But without FEMA, I don't know what these \npeople will do.\n  They have food. The Red Cross is doing a great job. But they have \nnothing else. Their homes are gone, their belongings are gone, their \nclothes are gone. One gentleman came over to me and said, I would just \nlike to try to get to my bank--which is closed and flooded--so I can \ntake a few dollars out so I can buy some slippers. It is awful.\n  What does this mean policywise? It means America cannot ignore these \npeople. The people of New York, when Louisiana had trouble, didn't say: \nOur tax dollars shouldn't go to Louisiana. The people of New York did \nnot say, when there were terrible tornados in Joplin: Our tax dollars \nshould not go to Joplin. And I hope that the people in the rest of the \ncountry, represented by so many here on both sides of the aisle, will \nnot say we are not going to step to the plate. America has always stood \nfor disaster relief--always--because we are one Nation. We all have \nknown that when God-given disasters, way beyond the powers of mankind, \ncome, no single community can take care of it themselves, and that is \nwhy the Federal Government has traditionally stepped in and regarded it \nas an emergency and we have stepped in. We haven't had strings attached \nor conditions, or: Put it in this bill and we will give you a little \nmoney now and we will see what you need later.\n  FEMA, by the way, has done a great job. I want to tip my hat to the \npeople of FEMA who did such a wonderful job. But they are basically out \nof money. Right now in Missouri, none of the relief work continues \ndespite the devastation in Joplin, because they only have money to deal \nwith the immediate emergency of Lee and of Irene that hit New York \nState. The FEMA workers are doing great, and the people, the volunteers \nI saw everywhere, everyone is pulling together. Why can't this Senate \nand this Congress pull together the way the people of our communities \npull together when a disaster hits?\n  We had one gentleman whose house was gone but he hadn't even been \nable to tend to it because he was a skilled worker and he was tending \nto the homes of others for 5 days. I saw him and his sisters, and they \neven had some humor about it. They were wearing shirts, ``Goodnight, \nIrene.''\n  We have to pull together. We pay on an emergency basis, without \nlooking for setoffs, for the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. We \nbuild bridges there, we build roads there, we give aid there. Now we \nare saying, When it comes to our American citizens, we are not going to \ndo that any longer? What is going on?\n  This afternoon we will vote simply on a resolution. To those of you \nnot schooled in the arcane ways of the Senate, it is called a motion to \nproceed. It simply allows us to put legislation on the floor so we can \naid these victims. And it can be amended. If some of our colleagues \nthink this is wrong or that is wrong, they can debate it. But today's \nvote will say whether we should even begin to move to cover this, and \nwe are getting it blocked. On last night's vote, six of our colleagues \nfrom the other side of the aisle joined us, but not enough.\n  And so here it is. This is not me speaking, this is the AP, almost \nuniversally regarded as a nonbiased news source: Republicans block \nSenate disaster aid bill.\n  What is going on? They don't block bridges and money for the war in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, to help rehabilitate those communities, and they \nare blocking this, for help in Missouri and Louisiana and New York and \nVermont and the Missouri River Valley up through the Dakotas, the State \nof Missouri?\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\nWhat is going on here? This has never been a partisan issue.\n  Republican Governors whose States have been hard hit have called for \nhelp. Chris Christie, hardly a wallflower, hardly someone who doesn't \nrelish a partisan battle when he thinks it is right, but to his credit, \nwhen he thinks it is wrong:\n\n       Our people are suffering now and they need support now. And \n     they, Congress, can all go down there and get back to work \n     and figure out the budget cuts later.\n\n  That is Governor Christie.\n  Governor Bob McDonnell, a well-known conservative:\n\n       My concern is that we help people in need. I don't think \n     it's the time to get into the deficit debate.\n\n  Are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle listening? Let us \nbegin to debate this bill. Let us move forward, and let us fund FEMA \nfully. Let's not put something in the CR and say, Well, in a month from \nnow we will debate it. We all know CRs get tied up. FEMA has run out of \nmoney now--now. So this vote will be a vote that determines whether we \nkeep the American tradition of helping one another in a time of \ndisaster here in America; and a vote no says, no, I don't want to do \nit. A vote no says I am not going to proceed to even debate the bill. A \nvote no is against the greatness of America, in my opinion, because we \nalways have stood for helping people, being one Nation, under God, \nindivisible. When a part of the country desperately needs help, we all \npull together to help them, knowing that if, God forbid, it happens to \nus down the road, the Nation will be there for us.\n  I was just at the 9/11 memorial service, the tenth anniversary. It \nwas a time when we all pulled together. George Bush did not ask, when \nwe were in the Oval Office and said New York desperately needed $20 \nbillion, Is it a blue State? How are we going to pay for it? He stepped \nto the plate. He was a patriot and he said: This is what America must \ndo.\n  That was a manmade disaster, an awful disaster. Far more lives were \nlost than now. But it is not a different issue. This is a disaster, and \npeople are hurting and people need help. The attitude of President \nGeorge Bush hopefully will be the attitude of our colleagues across the \naisle, that they won't block the bill, that they won't find seven \nexcuses, or say, We will give you a little of the money a month from \nnow in a continuing resolution, when the money is desperately needed \nnow.\n  In conclusion, this vote is a crucial vote that says: Are we the same \nAmerican people we have always been, who look out for one another, who \nhelp one another in a time of need, regardless of party and regardless \nof bickering and everything else? This vote will determine it. I urge a \nstrong bipartisan vote for the resolution that we will vote on in an \nhour.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from New York for those very \ndescriptive and moving comments about his State, and particularly the \npart of his State that we don't hear a lot about. That is why we depend \non the Senators to speak the truth about what is going on and what they \nare seeing. I know the Senator from New Jersey is here to speak, but \npictures are worth a thousand words and I wanted to put this chart up. \nI hope the cameras can grasp the horror of all four of these pictures. \nWhat is I think most telling about them is they are all from a \ndifferent State in a different part of the country.\n  This picture is of Joplin, MO. I haven't myself personally been to \nJoplin, but before the year is out I will go, and I think other \nSenators should go see what has happened in one of the great tornado \ndisasters in the history of our country.\n  This picture, which almost brings tears to my eyes because it looks \nexactly as Lake Pontchartrain looked in the city of New Orleans, I \nbelieve is from Irene, from North Carolina. It is heartbreaking. I am \nsure this is a family who was on the coast, and everything they had is \ndestroyed. It really is quite moving.\n  This is a picture on the Mississippi River, I am not sure in what \ncounty. But when our Senators come to the floor to talk about rural \nareas and the devastation, at least in Missouri, you can walk down the \nstreet and find a neighbor whose home was equally destroyed and at \nleast get a hug. Out here in these rural areas, you are by yourself. It \ncould be miles between your house and your neighbor's home. You cannot \neven find the church where you worshipped together on Sunday.\n  Here is Texas. We prayed for the rain last week to go west to Texas. \nIt hit Louisiana again. They are the ones who need it, but they cannot \nget it. There were 20,000 fires in Texas. There were thousands of homes \nburned up.\n  Before everybody starts to think, what is the great help--yes, FEMA \nis a great help. But let me put this in perspective. You get $2,000 a \nfamily--$2,000--to help buy a toothbrush, maybe a few pieces of \nclothing, some initial toiletries, et cetera, and you get $30,000 for \nsome immediate needs. It is not as if we are trying to send people $1 \nmillion a house. How can people stand in the way of $2,000 for \nimmediate needs and $30,000? If you had a house that was worth $150,000 \nand you ran a little printing business and you lost both, the most you \ncould get out of this bill is $30,000. Do they think we are being too \ngenerous? It is minimum support. I want to make that clear--minimum \nsupport.\n  Some people are lucky enough to have insurance. If the insurance \ncompany steps up and does not try to pull out the fine print, as they \ndid in Katrina, and come up with 100,000 excuses why they can't fund \nthe homes, maybe they will get homes. This isn't us just trying to dump \nmillions of dollars on people who do not deserve it.\n  That is what I wanted to say. I will have more to say, but I think \nthese pictures speak 1,000 words. Again, FEMA is out of money. I don't \nwant anybody coming here to vote to say: I didn't vote because FEMA has \nmoney. They are out of money. They are stopping projects all over the \ncountry because all they can basically do is have enough money to pay \nthose immediate needs on the east coast. Joplin, MO, has been told: No, \nyou have to wait. Louisiana, on the gulf coast, has been told: No, you \nhave to wait. We are happy to wait a few weeks. We understand the \ndilemma. But this cannot go on week after week, month after month. We \nhave to pass a bill for an entire year and not have to come back to it.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey on the floor, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the passion of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and her personal experience from Louisiana on the \nconsequences of disaster. She speaks from firsthand knowledge and \nspeaks for all of us in this respect.\n  I rise today because we as a nation have always come together to help \neach other in times of crisis without question, without politics. In my \n20 years between the House and the Senate, I never questioned, in the \nmidst of a disaster somewhere in the country--which, fortunately, for \nthe most part has not been New Jersey--casting my vote to support those \nfellow Americans who found themselves in urgent need because of natural \ndisasters having nothing to do with any control they had whatsoever.\n  This is not the time to politicize disaster aid. It is not who we are \nor what we expect this Nation to be. Our goal when disaster strikes is \nto unleash the full force of the Federal Government to help families in \ntrouble and communities in ruin, not to score some political points by \nslowing relief and calling it responsible fiscal policy. In the wake of \na storm, when the floodwaters rise, when the winds blow, when the storm \nsurge rushes in, we should not be rallying our political base; we \nshould be rallying the full force of emergency responders to help.\n  In the last few weeks, the east coast has suffered an earthquake, a \nhurricane, and some of the worst flooding my State has seen in years--a \n100-year flood. I received a letter from a constituent in Moors \nLanding, in Monmouth County, who wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Menendez,\n       I live in Moors Landing, a development of homes in Howell \n     Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. Our community is in \n     great need of assistance. One section of our community was \n     devastated by flooding from an overflow of the Manasquan \n     inlet on August 20 and 21. Homes and property were destroyed, \n     and the families and lives of those homeowners were terribly \n     disrupted.\n       Then, after the first calamity, Hurricane Irene brought \n     further destruction to this\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\n     same section of our community. But in addition to that \n     repeated damage, Irene brought damage to a second section of \n     our community.\n       Hurricane Irene, in addition to the added homes and \n     property damage, forced many of our residents to be evacuated \n     in order to avoid drowning in the rushing flood waters. This \n     second catastrophe added to the misery and hardship suffered \n     from our affected homeowners who lost their furniture, their \n     carpets and flooring and everything in the first floor of \n     their homes, their furnaces and air conditioning units, and \n     all of them have to tear down their water damaged walls to \n     avoid mold and dry out their homes.\n       All of this devastation and loss comes at a time when our \n     people already are finding it difficult to make ends meet. \n     These people have no money to take on the added costs of \n     repair; and now there is no one who would even buy their \n     homes. So they are stuck with a true nightmare scenario--no \n     money to fix things and no way to sell the homes. We need \n     your help. I understand Federal funding from FEMA is \n     available, and we urgently need your assistance in securing \n     these funds for our neighbors so that these people can move \n     on with their lives.\n\n  That constituent, a fellow American, deserves to know that her \ngovernment will be there to help, that relief is on the way, not held \nup in Congress to satisfy some ideology or political agenda.\n  When disaster strikes, Americans come together. We do not hesitate. \nWe do not ask why. We do not wait. We rush to our neighbors and do all \nwe can to help them rebuild. After the damage and flooding Irene \ncaused, we came together as we always do--as a community, each of us \nworking together to help others.\n  I had the opportunity to tour the flooded areas of New Jersey with \nthe Army Corps of Engineers. Then we went to Patterson. This is a \npicture of Patterson, NJ, and these responders are on a boat, with the \nPresident and Governor Christie of my State, to assess that damage.\n  After 5 days of flooding, there were still those who were homeless, \ntrying to put the pieces of their lives back together. As we flew over \nthe area with the President that day, we could see mud lines on homes \nindicating how high the floodwaters had reached. Then, tragically, we \nsaw home after home where everything, up and down some streets--all the \npersonal belongings of residents had been put out as trash, cherished \npieces of their lives lost, ruined.\n  Paterson was particularly hard hit. Ironically, the river that once \nfueled the economy of Paterson washed out bridges, dams along the river \nwere badly damaged, and power was knocked out for days. With the latest \nrains, flooding again took place even after Hurricane Irene. So the \nwater may have receded, but the consequences have not.\n  We have been very pleased with the Federal response so far, a \nresponse that should have nothing to do with politics, nothing to do \nwith political budget debates in Washington, and everything to do with \nthe real needs of families in Paterson, in Lincoln Park, in Wayne, and \nin so many other places in New Jersey and across this country. Some of \nthese people have to start over, start their lives over.\n  FEMA, along with other Federal, State, and local officials, needs the \nresources necessary not only to move in as quickly as possible to deal \nwith the crisis but the resources necessary to deal with the \naftermath--politics notwithstanding--because when one community is in \ntrouble, we are all in trouble, and we pull together.\n  Frankly, I cannot believe there are those in this Chamber and in the \nother body who see this as a political opportunity, those who would \nfocus on the politics of relief even in the face of families who have \nwatched their lives wash away, their property in ruins, and their \ncommunities devastated.\n  New Jersey suffered severe damages and left families, already \nstruggling, with another challenge. It is up to all of us to help them. \nIrene was a powerful storm, but what we have learned is that there is \nnothing more powerful than what unites us as a community. It is in \ntimes such as these, when families and small businesses are trying to \nrecover, that we appreciate the role of professional, well-equipped, \nwell-trained local, State, and Federal boots on the ground.\n  In my view, one of the most legitimate and nondebatable roles of \ngovernment--clearly, I have heard many of my colleagues refer to this \nin a different context--is the security of our people. If you are \nhomeless as a result of a disaster, you have a security problem. In my \nview, one of the most legitimate and nondebatable roles of government \nis to provide a helping hand to a citizen when there is nowhere else to \nturn. Yes, we have to do all we can to keep our economy moving, create \njobs, and reduce the deficit. We have to make cuts where we can. But in \nthe face of disasters, we cannot say no to families who have lost \neverything. We cannot say no when floodwaters are rising, homes are \nlost, possessions are piled in the streets, and families are picking \nthrough the mud to put whatever pieces of their lives they can find \ntogether once again. We are not a nation that ties helping them recover \nto the politics of the moment. We are not a nation that leaves our \nneighbors alone in the time of tragedy. We do not stand down in times \nof crisis, we step up.\n  We in New Jersey are grateful to the President for coming to Paterson \nand to Wayne and for the rapid and effective response of FEMA and State \nand local officials, after Irene, to families who have lost so much. \nBut any attempt to slow relief to these families is, in my view and in \nthe view of Governor Christie of my State--any attempt to politicize \nthis disaster to advance an ideology at the expense of all we stand for \nas a nation is not acceptable.\n  The President said we will do what is necessary to respond. Senator \nLautenberg and I took the same view, and Governor Christie took the \nsame view. We don't want to get into the politics of budget debates or \nwhether this should be offset later on. That is a question for later \non. The question right now for people who find themselves without a \nhome so we can knock on that door is, Is the Federal Government--the \none I pay my taxes to, the one I swear an oath of allegiance to every \nday--is it going to respond to me now?\n  I did not question the need to respond to tornadoes in Joplin, floods \nin the Dakotas, or the terrible consequences of the hurricane in \nLouisiana or any other place in this country, and I do not expect that \nmy colleagues now will say no to their fellow Americans who need help \nnow in New Jersey and in other States along the east coast. It is \nsimply not the American way to not support the funds necessary and deal \nwith the challenges these families have now.\n  Let's keep our eye on the ball. There are families in real need, \nreally struggling in ways we cannot imagine. We have a real ability to \nput politics aside and do what is right. We will have that opportunity \nvery shortly. Let's do what is right. Let's get this money to the \nFederal agencies that can help turn around these people's lives. That \nis the American way. That is the vote we will have later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for adding his \nstrong and powerful voice to this. I wished to clarify a few points \nthat I think are important for people to understand.\n  First, for those who might be engaging in or listening to this \ndebate, we are going to have a vote in about an hour or so, and if we \ndo not get 60 votes, we will likely not be able to replenish the FEMA \ncoffers that are virtually empty. The Federal fiscal year, to remind \neveryone, does not start January 1. It starts October 1. We run on a \nfiscal year, not a calendar year. We are coming to the end of our year \nin September, this month. FEMA has run out of money in the last 11 \ndays. I wish to submit for the Record--this is just an 11-day count, \n$387 million worth of projects that have been halted because FEMA is \nstretching the few dollars it has have left to cover the emergency \nneeds, literally, of meals and shelter for the people on the east \ncoast.\n  In other parts of the country where there are jobs underway, \nrebuilding highways, rebuilding libraries, rebuilding schools, \nrebuilding sewer systems, water systems, et cetera, those projects have \nbeen sent a pink slip, basically, from Washington saying cease and \ndesist. You know what the worst thing about that is, it is not \nnecessary if we would immediately act and refill this coffer so these \nprojects can get started immediately. What is very bad about this pink \nslip is that this $387\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nmillion worth of projects, many of these projects have already been \ndone by small businesses, private sector contractors. This is not money \nowed to the government. This is money, in large measure, owed to \nprivate small business people or medium-sized business people or, in \nsome cases, large businesses that are in the process of fixing the \nlibrary. In the last 11 days, because of some ideology here, some sort \nof political party agenda, they have received a pink slip that says: \nStop work.\n  If these companies that have already purchased the lumber or \npurchased the concrete or purchased the pipe to build the project do \nnot get paid soon, they will go bankrupt. Believe me, I have companies \nin my State that have gone bankrupt because the Federal Government is a \nnotoriously late payer even under good conditions. This is not what I \nwould describe as a good condition. This is a terrible condition. So \nthe other side needs to think about the politics of this. This is not \njust a moral question, it is a business question.\n  There are many dimensions to this question. We have basically sent a \ncease-and-desist order to $387 million worth of contractors and \nbusinesses that might not be in New Jersey or affected in Vermont but \nare working on a project. They have a work order from the Federal \nGovernment, only to find out, sorry, Congress cannot decide how to pay, \nso good luck trying to make your payroll on Friday. This is wrong.\n  The second argument I would like to make to the other side when they \nare considering this important and significant vote is, when the other \nside says to me: Well, we need to budget for it, I would like to budget \nfor it, but I do not have a crystal ball. I think I am a pretty good \nSenator, but one thing I do not do very well is predict the future. I \nsometimes have instincts about it, but I am not a fortune teller, and \none would have to be a fortune teller to see what is happening.\n  This is not Mary Landrieu's opinion. These are the facts. In 2003, we \nneeded less than $1 billion to fund all disasters. It was a relatively \nmild year. Had we put $2 billion in the budget, we would have had $1 \nbillion extra. The next year it jumped to $5 billion. The next year it \nwent up to $45 billion. It broke all records. The next year it went \ndown to $12 billion. The next year it fell to $8 billion. How are we on \nthe Appropriations Committee--Danny Inouye is a fabulous chairman from \nHawaii and Thad Cochran is a terrific Senator from Mississippi, but \nneither Thad Cochran nor Daniel Inouye can predict a year and a half \nout what the disasters are going to be and budget accordingly.\n  Even if you can't motivate yourself--some people here--to vote for \npeople because they need help, just look at the argument on the \nfinances. We do not know in advance. We could set aside some money, \nmaybe more than the $1.8 billion we have. I do not disagree there, but \nwe still would have missed it every year except for 2 years. Even if we \nhad put $5 billion in the base budget, we would have still missed it. \nWe cannot predict it. Should we set aside $25 billion every year?\n  The point is, when disasters happen, just fund what we have committed \nto, which is a base benefit package to people. As I said, no one is \ngoing to get rich off $2,000 and $30,000 to help people get themselves \nstarted. Hopefully, their insurance comes in, nonprofits step up to \nhelp. They can maybe dig into a little bit of their savings.\n  This is as much a jobs bill, it is as much a business bill as it is a \nbill that is the right moral thing to do for people. It is not because \nDemocrats do not know how to budget. I am so tired of being lectured on \nthe other side about Democrats don't know how to budget. I would like \nto remind everyone the last time this budget was balanced, we had a \nDemocratic President. Democrats can balance budgets. I was a State \ntreasurer for 8 years, and I did a lot to help my State get back on a \nstrong financial footing. I am proud of my record and so is every \nDemocrat here. It is impossible to predict in advance.\n  What we could do is what we always do, send help. Help these \ncompanies and help these people get jobs, put people to work in \nAmerica. Do the right thing. Over the course of the next 6 months, as \nour big committee is working and trying to figure out lots of big \nproblems we have--and this is one of them--we can have time to sit down \nand figure out, based on this reality, what we should do. If anyone has \na suggestion, please come to the floor now.\n  My committee has been talking about this for 6 months, and I wish to \nsay thanks to my cochair, Senator Coats, who serves with me on the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Committee. We have been thinking about \nthis for 6 months. He voted yes yesterday because he knows there are \nnot many good options out there. Can we find a way? Yes. Can we find it \nthis week? No. We might not even be able to find it in the next 30 \ndays, but I am confident that over the course of the next month and \nyear we will find a way to pay for it.\n  Right now people in New Jersey and Vermont and Louisiana and Missouri \nand Minnesota and North Dakota do not want to listen to this. They want \nto tell their kids: Yes, we are going to rebuild. They want to tell \ntheir employees: Yes, we are going to put our business back.

Every day this list is going to get bigger and bigger. \nAll this is is a pink slip to someone unrelated to the current \nemergency. They are working on emergencies from 3 years ago and now \nthey are being put out of work because of this bullheadedness that is \ncoming from someplace. I hope we can break through on that today.\n  Again, these pictures are difficult to see, but I think it is worth \nseeing them again. This is what people look like who are listening to \nthis debate--this family sitting on those steps. Someone, either they \nor their neighbor, is going to say: Did you hear Senator Landrieu on \nthe floor? Did you hear the Senate debate? Why would the Senate of the \nUnited States be arguing whether we can get aid? Aren't we building in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and we are not going to build in North Carolina? I \nthink they are sitting on the Outer Banks of North Carolina thinking: \nWhat is going on in the Congress? People are going to be angry, believe \nme.\n  I do not know what we are going to tell them. What are we going to \ntell them if we vote no on this? Are we going to tell them we do not \nhave the money? Are we going to tell them we cannot figure out how to \nbudget it?\n  We will figure it out later. We have to, eventually. Every bill we \nenter into\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\nhas to be paid for, eventually. You know that, Mr. President. We do not \nhave to decide that this week.\n  Let's tell them yes. Let's do the right thing and let's get help to \nJoplin, MO. Let's get help to our rural communities that sometimes get \nvery forgotten. Let's get help to our folks in North Carolina and to \nour people in Texas who have been suffering terribly over this, and \nlet's do it now.\n  Let me share another quote that I think is particularly significant. \nThe Senator from New York talked about Gov. Bob McDonald, a \nconservative Republican from Virginia. He said fund it now. Another \nRepublican Governor, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said:\n\n       Let's fund it now. It is not a Republican or Democratic \n     issue.\n\n  I wish to read what Gov. Tom Ridge, the former Governor of \nPennsylvania and the first Secretary of Homeland Security, a staunch \nRepublican, said:\n\n       Never in the history of the country have we worried about \n     budget around emergency appropriations for natural disasters, \n     and, frankly, in my view, we shouldn't be worried about it \n     now. We are all in this as a country. And when Mother Nature \n     devastates a community, we may need emergency appropriations \n     and we ought to just deal with it and then deal with the \n     fiscal issues later on.\n\n  He is a very influential leader in our country and was the first \nSecretary of Homeland Security. He ran the FEMA budget. He understands \nwhat is at stake.\n  Please, let's not make this a partisan issue. Let's get a strong \nbipartisan vote; the Senate can be very proud of that; and then we can \nnegotiate the issues with the House. I will work with the House \nleadership to say there are several ways we can pay for this. We can \ndebate it over the course of the next several months and maybe come up \nwith a new way. I know one thing we cannot do is take it out of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Our budget would be devastated, and it \nwouldn't be fair to all the perimeters and the security and our ports \nand our firefighters to use their money to pay for past or present \ndisasters. We could potentially find the money somewhere under some new \nmechanism, but let's not make the people of the east coast, the people \nof Joplin, MO, and the people of Louisiana, in the floods that we have \njust gone through ourselves, scapegoats. We will figure out there is \ntime for debate later, but the time for action is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened carefully to our colleague \nfrom Louisiana and note a particular distinction that her State brings; \nthat is, the number of natural disaster problems that State has had and \nhow diligently Senator Landrieu has fought to make sure that when we \nhave a problem, we ask the government with a clear conscience to do its \nshare in helping us cure the problem we get.\n  On Sunday just passed, we marked the 10th anniversary of the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. On that terrible day, 10 years ago, we \nwere reminded that when tragedy strikes one part of our country, \nAmericans pull together to respond. When our enemies and Mother Nature \nsends us their worst, Americans are at our best.\n  In the wake of recent storms across the country, including Hurricane \nIrene in my State of New Jersey, we see this same American spirit of \ncooperation coming through. Unfortunately, we learned that the spirit \nof neighbor helping neighbor stops with our Republican colleagues. We \nsaw a shameful display where all but a handful of Republican Senators \nvoted to block consideration of an emergency disaster relief bill. They \nchose not to let our government do its share in curing a problem that \nenveloped much of the country. They have chosen to use disaster relief \nvictims as pawns in their political gamesmanship.\n  Make no mistake. The disaster relief bill is a critical lifeline to \nthe families who are struggling to pick up the pieces of their \nshattered lives after Hurricane Irene.\n  Early estimates suggest this violent storm could be 1 of the 10 \ncostliest storms in U.S. history, with damages that exceed $10 billion. \nThis is some of the worst flooding in a century, and it is a serious \nemergency.\n  Hurricane Irene produced devastating floods in New Jersey and other \nStates along the east coast. A major tropical storm followed days later \ncausing even more damage. In New Jersey alone at least 11 people were \nkilled, and countless families were displaced after their homes were \ndestroyed.\n  President Obama has declared the entire State of New Jersey--all 21 \ncounties--a Federal disaster area. Earlier this month, the President \ncame to New Jersey to see firsthand the destruction that Hurricane \nIrene has caused. I joined him on his tour of Paterson, NJ, my \nhometown, and one of the cities hit hardest by flooding. We witnessed \nunforgettable images. The streets and sidewalks were covered in mud, \nand inside homes--I saw it personally--mud covered the second floor of \nsome. That is how deep the water was. Fourteen-foot crests followed \nwhat at times were very tepid streams. Walls were stained by high water \nmarks. This picture shows some of the damage in the city of Paterson. \nPerhaps it is difficult to see, but what we are looking at is water--\nwater everywhere--and it is entirely enveloping homes and businesses \nand the community.\n  Paterson is not alone. This is a scene in Boonton, NJ, where we see \nthe road was washed away and people can't move from one part of the \ntown to the other.\n  In Cranford, NJ, we see another disaster scene. Here we have what \nlooks like debris piled up. This debris was furniture. It included \nbeds, cribs, and refrigerators. It included all kinds of things--people \nputting their wares out on the front lawn, furniture never able to be \nused again, the houses themselves often not being able to be entered \nagain.\n  This picture shows the damage in Bound Brook, NJ, and the high level \nof the water as it compares to the buildings constructed there. With \nHurricane Irene, we witnessed nature's power to destroy. Now it is time \nto see the Federal Government's capacity to repair, rebuild, and \nrestore.\n  Even before this hurricane struck, FEMA's primary source of funding \nfor cleanup and recovery--the Disaster Relief Fund--was barely on life \nsupport. The tornadoes and flooding that wreaked havoc across our \nMidwest and South earlier this year, along with wildfires and other \ndisasters, depleted the funds. That is why, in my role as vice chairman \nof the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I helped to craft \na bill to replenish the Disaster Relief Fund.\n  The Appropriations Committee approved this bill last week, and \nmajority leader Harry Reid understood the urgency of the situation and \nbrought emergency disaster relief legislation to the floor right away \nfor us to consider--putting money into the relief fund so we can deal \nwith the tragedies that have hit so many people in so many places.\n  What happened in the Senate yesterday? Republicans filibustered our \nattempts. I think everybody across America has learned about what the \nword ``filibuster'' means. It means stopping things, blocking things. \nThey blocked our attempts to even allow an emergency disaster relief \nbill to be considered. What kind of foul play is that? They talk about \nsaving money, and they talk about cuts. It is outrageous.\n  Some of them have claimed the bill would cost too much. But we all \nknow the widespread damage that occurred demands a strong Federal \nresponse. We have to provide FEMA with the resources it needs to help \nNew Jersey's people, businesses, and communities recover and rebuild \nfrom this disaster.\n  This bill also helps disaster victims in all 50 States--not just the \nStates affected by Hurricane Irene. Every State has experienced \ndisaster in recent years, and FEMA is working in every State to help \nthese communities rebuild and recover. So if we fail to pass this bill, \nevery State is going to suffer because if we can't help one State, we \ncan't help any States, and that is an unacceptable condition.\n  The fact is, the victims of Hurricane Irene and other recent \ndisasters have enough to worry about. They shouldn't have to also \nwonder if their government is going to stand behind them.\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\n  I wish to be clear. The Federal Government plays a critical role in \ndisaster relief efforts, and we have a responsibility to provide \nfunding to help communities rebuild and to make sure the job gets done \nwell.\n  For decades the Federal Government has had a track record of \nextending a helping hand to victims of natural disasters. This includes \nmore than $11 billion in emergency funding to help Texas, Alabama, \nLouisiana, and other States recover from hurricanes or flooding in \n2008. Last year we approved more than $5 billion in emergency funding \nto help States such as Tennessee and Kentucky recover from floods. The \npeople in these States desperately needed our help, and Congress \nresponded. We have to do the same now.\n  It is hard to understand why people on the Republican side in the \nHouse and in the Senate don't step up to their responsibilities. What \nare those responsibilities? Those responsibilities are to protect and \nsecure the safety of our people. Without that, the country isn't quite \nwhat it should be by all measures. We have to do what we have to do, \nnow.\n  As we fight our way out of a recession, this is no time to play \npolitics and penalize people who are struggling. Moments such as this \ndemand shared sacrifice. We face serious challenges in our country, but \nwe cannot put a price on a human life and say, well, if it costs a lot \nover there, we are not going to do that to save people. Nothing is more \nimportant than keeping our families, our economy, and our communities \nsafe.\n  So I call on my colleagues to put aside the Republican cloak, put \naside the savings we think we can make from avoiding our \nresponsibilities because no money is going to be saved. The costs are \ngoing to be there, and the misery is going to be extended.\n  So I urge us all to join to approve this bill. Few of us, if any, are \nexempt from the possibility of disaster in our States. So let's put the \npolitics aside and make sure our first priority is helping people--\nhelping individuals, helping families, helping the communities--and \nkeeping functions going to permit our society to work.\n  With that, I close out my comments with wonderment as to what we have \nseen with the hard shell, heartless attitude about providing FEMA with \nthe money to repair the results of disaster. It is almost \nincomprehensible. We heard a cry from one of the leaders on the \nRepublican side in the House to say: Well, we first have to find the \nmoney to pay for it.\n  Like the Devil, we do. We don't do that when we see forests being \nravaged by fire. We don't do it when we are attacked by outside \nenemies. We don't do it those times, and we ought not to do it now.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, \nand the others who have come to the Senate floor this afternoon to talk \nabout the importance of getting help for people who have been hit by \ndisasters.\n  A little more than 2 weeks ago, Tropical Storm Irene came barreling \nthrough New Hampshire just as she came barreling through Vermont and \nNew York and New Jersey and North Carolina and so many other States \nalong the east coast. The storm dumped as much as 8 inches of rain in \nparts of New Hampshire, and the damage to property and infrastructure, \nespecially in the northern part of our State, was significant. The \nsurging waters and high winds destroyed roads and bridges, damaged \nthousands of homes, left nearly 200,000 without power, devastated \nbusinesses, and ruined crops.\n  While the devastation was terrible, I wish to begin by commending \nthose dedicated first responders and emergency personnel who kept our \nresidents safe and well-informed throughout the storm. I am also \ngrateful for the tireless work of road crews, utility workers, and \nvolunteers from across New Hampshire who began helping families and \ncommunities rebuild just as soon as the storm passed. Their hard work \nand community spirit are deeply appreciated.\n  For many of the towns hit by Irene, this is the third major flooding \nevent of the year. It is the 7th in the last 2 years. These have been \ndevastating floods.\n  I have a picture of the town of Plymouth, a beautiful community in \nnorthern New Hampshire where Plymouth State University is. What we can \nbarely see in this section of the picture is the new ice hockey arena \nfor Plymouth State that was just completed about a year ago. It is a \nbeautiful, state-of-the-art arena that, unfortunately, was flooded by \nthese floodwaters. Of course, we can see other damage to the town.\n  Many of the homeowners in the community of Conway, on the other side \nof the State, are people who suffered some of the worst damage and are \nelderly and disabled. They are people who are living on fixed incomes, \nwho are least able to recover from this kind of disaster.\n  Others affected by the disaster are families who are already \nstruggling to cope with difficult economic circumstances. New Hampshire \nemergency response officials toured Conway today, and they talked to \nour office and told us about the plight of one young family of three. \nSadly, the father was laid off from his job just 3 days before the \nstorm hit, and his wife, who stays at home and takes care of their 3-\nyear-old, doesn't have a job outside the home. So with his layoff, they \nhave lost their entire income, and now their home is so damaged they \nare worried about being homeless. They have no money to rebuild. \nWithout FEMA assistance, this family could indeed wind up homeless.\n  Hundreds in the West Lebanon area in the western part of the State \nacross the river from Vermont may be out of work for months. Peg \nHoward, who owns a boutique gift store in the area, told the Upper \nValley News, which is the newspaper that serves Lebanon, that she fears \ndamage from Irene will put her out of business. As a small business \nowner, she has no parent corporation to help her recover, so assistance \nfrom FEMA and other Federal programs may be her only option as she \ntries to rebuild her business.\n\n  Peg and the hundreds of others in New Hampshire and the thousands \nacross the country who have been devastated are taxpayers, and this is \ntheir government. They help pay for it. Their tax dollars help fund our \ngovernment, including FEMA. They have the right to expect that FEMA \nwill be there when they need help.\n  It is not only sad but it is an outrage that some Members of Congress \nwould deny those people who have been so hard hit by Irene and so many \nother disasters this year--that Members of Congress would deny them \nhelp in their time of need, and for no good reason. The reason is pure \npartisan politics. It is plain and simple.\n  Even in the best of circumstances, the costs of Irene would be a \nsignificant burden for New Hampshire to shoulder alone. Thankfully, \nPresident Obama quickly granted Governor Lynch's request for a major \ndisaster declaration. A number of Federal agencies, including FEMA, are \nnow on the ground providing essential assistance as we begin to restore \nour State's homes, businesses, roads, and utilities.\n  But New Hampshire is hardly alone in the need for assistance after \nHurricane Irene. Other parts of the country are still rebuilding from \ndisasters earlier this year, such as the devastating tornado in Joplin, \nMO. Soon FEMA's disaster relief fund, as we have already heard this \nafternoon, which was already running low prior to the storm, will no \nlonger have the resources needed to continue meeting recovery needs.\n  In the last 2 weeks, FEMA has spent $300 million providing relief to \nStates hit by Hurricane Irene. Less than $500 million remains, which \nmay not be enough to see us through the end of the month. New \nHampshire, and the other States still recovering from disasters would \nbe on their own if that happens. We cannot let that happen. We must act \nquickly to provide FEMA with the resources it needs to help our \ncitizens and our towns recover.\n  In northern New England, we have a limited window to rebuild before \nthe onset of winter brings our construction season to a stop. What is \nmore, in New Hampshire, fall is a critical season for\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nour tourism industry, as thousands of visitors come to take in the \nbeautiful fall foliage. We need to immediately rebuild the bridges \nIrene destroyed, such as this one in Hart's Location, pictured here. As \nyou can see from this picture, in another couple of weeks, this \nbeautiful mountain, as shown in the background, with all of the green \nfoliage will be turning all sorts of colors because of the fall \nfoliage. If we cannot fix this road and bridges in a number of other \nplaces in New Hampshire, we will not be able to have a tourist season \nthat can bring people to the State that can help those people whose \njobs depend on that tourism industry. Any delay in FEMA assistance over \nthe next few weeks could have a serious effect on recovery efforts and \nthe hundreds of businesses and their employees who depend on the \ntourism industry.\n  Mr. President, I know you agree with me and with the other Senators \nwho have come to the floor this afternoon who believe that natural \ndisasters should be beyond politics and beyond partisanship. The people \nhurting all across this country are not Democrats or Republicans or \nIndependents. They are citizens. They are taxpayers. Getting them the \nhelp they need demands bipartisan cooperation. In the past, we have \nalways been able to come together and get people the help they need. \nThis time should be no different.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to work together to address \nthis emergency and provide FEMA the resources it needs to carry out its \nmission. This has an immediate, real impact on so many Americans and we \ncannot delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I had to slip away from the floor for \na few minutes, and I understand that no one from the other side has \ncome down to speak this afternoon. I cannot say I blame them because it \nis a very tough position to take.\n  We are getting ready to take a very important vote in 5 minutes on \nwhether we are going to provide disaster relief for the country, and \nparticularly for the east coast, which has been so terribly hit with \nHurricane Irene and then, of course, Tropical Storm Lee that came up \nthrough the gulf coast--and you know we have had our share of \ndifficulty--but then it dumped additional rain in an area that was \nalready saturated. We have wildfires raging in Texas. We have the \ndestruction still in Joplin, MO, and other places throughout the \nMidwest.\n  The question for Americans in all of these States--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents, and some who are totally unaffiliated \nwith the political process--is: Is Congress going to help? Our answer \ntoday needs to be yes. We need to fill the FEMA coffers that are empty. \nOur fiscal year ends this month. FEMA was given a certain amount of \nmoney in the earlier part of this year. The end of the year is coming \nup, and they are virtually out of money.\n  I submitted for the Record only 30 minutes ago that in the last 11 \ndays $387 million for ongoing construction projects for past disasters \nhave been put on hold so FEMA can stretch those dollars to make sure \npeople can eat in the shelters and at least have one set of clothes to \nwear in other parts of the country. This is unheard of in our Nation. \nWe have never, ever gotten so low in our disaster account.\n  There is plenty of money in the account to rebuild Iraq. There is \nplenty of money in the account to rebuild Afghanistan. There is money \nin accounts for refugee camps all over the world. But the account for \nAmericans who are homeless, desperate, and without their businesses, \ntheir churches and, in some cases, their neighborhoods is empty, and \nMembers are going to come to the floor today and vote no? I strongly \nsuggest a ``yes'' vote.\n  I said the reason we cannot budget exactly for these disasters is \nbecause we, A, do not know when they are going to happen, and we do not \neven know the amount of the damage. As I have shown in my arguments \nthis afternoon, the amount wildly fluctuates. One year it was zero, \nover the last 10 years. One year it was zero. The next year it was $5 \nbillion. One year it was $8 billion. The next year it was $43 billion.\n  So I am saying, no one here--we are all very good, very powerful \npeople, but we are not fortune tellers, and we do not have crystal \nballs on our desk, so there is no way we can know.\n  When people say to me: Well, you don't know exactly, but could you \nbudget something, the answer is, yes, we could figure that out, but we \ndo not have to figure that out today. We do not even have to figure \nthat out this month. We have this supercommittee set up to fix every \nproblem in the world, it seems. We will just give them another one to \nwork on because we have been working on this in the Appropriations \nCommittee for some time. The White House is engaged. The Republican \nleadership, hopefully, will get engaged. The Democratic leadership is \nengaged. We will figure it out. But now is not the time to have the \nvictims of these disasters and the survivors of these disasters worry \nabout this.\n  We need to refill FEMA's coffers, refill the Corps of Engineers that \nare stretched beyond imagination at this time. You can imagine with the \nMississippi River. The highest flooding in 50 years occurred this year. \nNow they have other flash floods all over the country--a bridge here, \nseveral bridges there, dams and dikes bursting. One of the Governors, I \nunderstand, just shut down a major bridge because they found a \nstructural fault. So the Corps of Engineers has more than they can say \ngrace over. Now is not the time to cut their budget. Now is the time to \ngive them additional funding and do some reform of the Corps of \nEngineers that my people are crying for in Louisiana.\n  I think a picture is worth a thousand words. I know we are getting \nready to vote, and the leader will come and, I guess, call for the \nvote. But a picture is worth a thousand words.\n  These are people who are desperate. I have shown this picture this \nafternoon. This is Joplin, MO. This is somewhere along the Mississippi \nRiver and the great flood. How lonely is this? At least in Joplin you \ncould find a neighbor to talk to or a group of people who worshipped at \na church, and you could pray together. This family is isolated, as \nothers are in many rural communities. They need a yes from us this \nafternoon.\n  Here is Texas, and this breaks my heart. I think this is North \nCarolina. How sad are these pictures? They are real. Behind them are \nthousands of families and businesses.\n  In addition, if this argument of compassion doesn't move people, \nmaybe the argument of flat business will move people. We are ready for \nthe vote; I think the time has come. I urge my colleagues to please \nvote yes on this motion to proceed. If we get 60 votes, we can proceed \nto the disaster bill and figure out how to pay for it sometime in the \nnext month ahead.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk \nwill report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 154, H.J.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand that Senator Conrad is on the schedule to \nspeak in just a few minutes, but with his permission I just wanted to \nsay thank you to the Members who voted favorably to move forward with \nthe discussion about how to fund disaster relief and to provide this \nemergency funding.\n  The leader has laid down a very responsible $6.9 billion emergency \nbill for victims and survivors of the many disasters with which our \ncountry is struggling. These numbers were not pulled from the air. \nThese numbers came through the appropriate appropriations committees. I \nthink it is a solid amount to deal with the emergencies right before us \nfor the next months and perhaps through the coming year. These numbers \nwill be fine-tuned as we move forward. But it was a very powerful \n``yes'' vote for thousands, tens of thousands of people who are waiting \nfor us to say yes to move forward, filling the accounts that are now \nvirtually empty, and giving a positive signal to Governors, both \nRepublicans and Democrats; mayors, Republicans and Democrats; county \ncommissioners, Republicans and Democrats, that help is on the way and \nthat the Federal Government is not, and will not, turn its back on them \nat this time of need. So I thank the Members.\n  We had a strong vote, 61 votes. We needed 60; we got 61. But it was a \nstrong vote, and I am glad we were joined by several Members from the \nother side, and I thank those who said yes to move this disaster relief \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I come to thank my colleagues as well \nfor this strong vote to move forward on disaster relief. In almost \nevery corner of America we have had unprecedented natural disasters \nthis year, and my State has not been exempt.\n  I represent North Dakota, and we have had flooding unprecedented \nsince records have been kept on the Souris River that goes through \nMinot, ND, the Missouri River that goes between Bismarck and Mandan, \nND, the place where I come from. We have seen absolute devastation, \nwater levels that changed virtually overnight. I can remember the \nforecast being raised 10 feet from Minot, ND, in a period of 48 hours, \na higher water level than we have seen in over 100 years of recorded \nhistory. The same is true in the Missouri Valley Basin, with runoff the \nhighest it has ever been. This has led to incredible flooding.\n  This is a picture from Minot, ND, where 11,000 people had to \nevacuate, 4,000 homes flooded. These are middle-class neighborhoods, \nand virtually no one had flood insurance. There were only 340 or 350 \nflood insurance contracts in this entire community of over 40,000 \npeople because they had a Corps-certified levee protecting them that \nwas supposed to be good for a 100-year flood. They had new dams that \nhad been constructed in Canada and dams that had been enhanced in North \nDakota. We hadn't had a major flood in 40 years.\n  FEMA is absolutely essential to helping these people get back on \ntheir feet. That funding is necessary, but it is not sufficient. \nAnybody who thinks we are going to get well on just FEMA funding does \nnot understand the FEMA program. FEMA was designed to work in \nconjunction with insurance--homeowners insurance, flood insurance. But \nif there is a flood, homeowners insurance doesn't cover it. I can tell \nyou, in a community that didn't have flood insurance--or almost no one \ndid--if all they have is FEMA, it is important, it is essential, but it \nis not enough.\n  Nobody knows that better than the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu.\n  I don't think in my entire time here I have ever seen anybody fight \nmore doggedly, more persistently, or more effectively for their home \nState and their home community than Mary Landrieu did when they were \nhit with Katrina. Mary Landrieu is a hero because she would not take no \nfor an answer.\n  I saw it time after time after time in the caucus, on the floor of \nthe Senate, in committees. Do you know what. She delivered something \nthat those people desperately needed. Good for her, and good for the \npeople to have sent somebody here who would fight for them in their \ntime of need.\n  Madam President, I am here representing a State at its time of need \nbecause we had thousands of people desperately affected--not as many as \nin the State of Louisiana; it is a much bigger population there. But in \nmy State, when 11,000 people are evacuated in one town, that is a big \ndeal. Eleven thousand people were forced out of their homes. They \nweren't just forced out overnight, they weren't just forced out over a \nweekend, they weren't just forced out over a couple of weeks, they have \nbeen out of their homes for months, and they are not getting back in \ntheir homes until sometime next year. Now, that is reality. Talk about \na tough reality.\n  With FEMA they qualify for $30,000--and thank God for it because \nwithout it they would have nothing. That is it. That is it. These are \npeople who have lost homes that were worth $150,000, $160,000, and they \nhad a mortgage on them. What do they do? They are going to get $30,000. \nDo they rehab the home? Do they rebuild the home? What do they do? \nThirty thousand dollars when a home has been underwater for 6 weeks, \nfor 8 weeks, thousands of homes that had 10 feet of water in them for \nweeks and weeks and weeks?\n  When the water recedes, as it has done now, they are left with a pile \nof muck. I have been there. I have seen it, I have smelled it, and it \nis not a happy circumstance. These people deserve some additional help.\n  Do you know what we did in Louisiana? We passed emergency \nsupplemental appropriations for CDBG. I predict if that is not done now \nin this disaster, these communities will have a difficult time ever \nrecovering because with homeowners insurance, they are not going to \ncollect on that in a flood. Very few people had flood insurance because \nthey thought they were protected by the dams. They are left with \n$30,000 to recover. It doesn't add up.\n  We have to have additional CDBG funding because that is what was used\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nin the floods of North Dakota in the 1990s that helped us recover. That \nwas what was used in Louisiana to help them recover. That is what is \ngoing to be needed here in cases where flooding occurred.\n  Here is the headline from the Minot Daily News: ``Projection: \nDevastation.'' When they were told the water level was rising as \nrapidly as it was, there was no time to defend the town.\n  They had levees that were supposed to be good for a 100-year flood, \nbut Canada lost control of one of its major dams. Their provincial \nleadership told our Governor: The floodgates are wide open. We have \nlost control of the dam, and that wall of water is coming your way. \nThat meant, in a short period of time the projections for the height of \nthe water in Minot, ND, went up 10 feet in 48 hours. There is no way to \nraise miles and miles of levees 10 feet in 48 hours. That is humanly \nimpossible.\n  What was the result? Everywhere you look, flooding. The Minot Daily \nNews headline: ``It's a sad day''. Boy, it was a sad day. ``The crest \ncould be 10 feet higher than June 1.''\n  In just a matter of days that wall of water was headed toward this \ncommunity, and they had no time to raise their defenses. Here is the \npredictable result: That is Minot, ND, downtown. Water is everywhere--\nin every residential community in the valley, the business community. \nYou can see, this water is not like the typical flood where the water \ncomes and goes. Here, the water came and stayed and stayed for days and \ndays and weeks and weeks and months. It wasn't until just recently that \nthe floodwater receded.\n  This is a picture, again, from that community. In many cases all you \ncan see are the rooftops.\n  Again, I want to say to those who might be listening because they \nneed to understand, they need to understand: The FEMA assistance that \nwe believe is now going to be on its way--in our case, some of it has \nalready been received and we deeply appreciate it--it is not going to \nbe enough. When someone has lost a $160,000 house, $30,000 is not going \nto touch the problem.\n  That is the reality, and the only way they are going to make \nmeaningful inroads on that problem for people who didn't have flood \ninsurance, through no fault of their own because they thought they were \nprotected by new dams, by a levee--but, unfortunately, they faced \nsomething that has never been seen in history. It has never been seen \nin history. These are middle-class families, and they are devastated--\nthere are over 4,000 homes destroyed in a community of 40,000 people.\n  If we don't get some additional help through additional funding for \nCDBG, those people's lives will be devastated. That is the reality. We \ndid better for the people in Katrina. We did better for the people who \nwere victims of the floods back in the 1990s because we passed \nemergency supplementals for CDBG to help people who were devastated, \nwho needed a helping hand. We need to do it again.\n  I am pleased to say we have circulated a letter--and we have \nbipartisan signatures on it--to the leadership asking for CDBG funding \non an emergency basis for the communities not just in my State but all \nacross the country: the people in Joplin who were devastated by a \ntornado with wind speeds, I am told now, some of them up to 300 miles \nan hour; the people who have just been devastated by Irene; others who \nwere affected by Lee; and others whom we can fairly anticipate will be \nhit as we go through the hurricane season.\n  We have seen natural disasters I think declared in all the States but \ntwo.\n  Yes, we need to replenish FEMA. We need to do it on an urgent basis. \nBut we also need to add to CDBG funding so that people are not left \ndevastated, with no chance to rebuild their lives.\n  I end with this headline: ``Swamped.'' That is what happened in \nMinot, ND. That is what happened in other cities in my State as well--\nBismarck, Mandan, my hometown area, and many other communities. Of \ncourse, we have the ongoing situation in Devils Lake, ND, where the \nlake has gone up 30 feet in the last 17 years. That is now three times \nthe size of the District of Columbia and is within 3 feet of going \nover. That will be a major calamity for all of eastern North Dakota if \nit is not prevented.\n  I implore my colleagues: Yes, let's replenish FEMA funds on an \nemergency basis. That is essential. But let's not stop there. Let's \nalso provide meaningful funding for CDBG because without it, families \nwill have a very difficult time ever recovering from these devastating \nblows.\n\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Employment Impact Act\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, last week the President addressed a \njoint session of Congress. He said he wanted to eliminate regulations--\nregulations, he said, that put ``unnecessary burden on businesses at a \ntime when they can least afford it.'' We have heard this same message \nfrom the White House time and time again. The rhetoric coming out of \nthis White House simply has not matched the reality. In fact, \nWashington continues to roll out redtape each day, and the redtape \nmakes it harder and more expensive for the private sector to create \njobs in this country.\n  The President also said that his administration has identified over \n500 reforms to our regulatory system that would save ``billions of \ndollars over the next few years.'' I appreciate that the White House \nhas identified wasteful regulations, but it will not really help our \neconomy unless the White House repeals them. Since January, this White \nHouse has only repealed one single regulation, and it has to do, \nactually, with spilt milk. The President's new plan does nothing to fix \nthe regulatory burdens faced by our job creators. It actually adds to \nthe burdens of the job creators of this country.\n  The President has tried to justify this increasing avalanche of \nredtape. He said he doesn't want to ``choose between jobs and safety.'' \nIn today's regulatory climate, that choice is a false choice. \nWashington's wasteful regulations are not keeping Americans safe from \ndangerous jobs. The American people cannot find jobs because no one is \nsafe from the regulations coming out of Washington. For every step our \neconomy tries to take forward, Washington's regulations continue to \nstand in the way.\n  Federal agencies' funding has increased 16 percent over the past 3 \nyears while our economy has only grown 5 percent over these same 3 \nyears. Washington's regulatory burden is literally growing three times \nfaster than our own economy. This massive increase in Washington's \npower has only made the economy worse.\n  Americans know that regulating our economy makes it harder and more \nexpensive for the private sector to create jobs. The combined cost of \nthe new regulations being imposed by this administration just last \nmonth was over $9 billion. Much of this cost has been borne by \nAmerica's energy producers and has cost American workers thousands of \nred, white, and blue jobs.\n  Those who try to justify these policies claim they will help us \ncreate green jobs at some unknown time in the future. Our economy, our \njob market, is not a seesaw. Pushing one part down doesn't make the \nother side pop up.\n  This administration's out-of-control regulation is persistently \ndragging down large portions of our economy. The President has promised \nto stop this kind of overreach. Remember, he issued an Executive order \nat the start of this year that was supposed to slow down Washington's \nregulation. So what has this administration done about it? In the 7 \nmonths since the President issued his Executive order, hundreds of new \nrules have been either enacted or proposed. For every day that goes by, \nour job creators face at least one new Washington rule to follow.\n  When the President announced his Executive order, he said he wanted \nto promote predictability and reduce uncertainty. These are laudable \ngoals,\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\nbut a new rule every day does nothing to promote predictability and is \nthe very definition of uncertainty.\n  The President talked about uncertainty just recently. The main source \nof uncertainty in the economy right now is Washington's regulations. \nYet there was not a single sentence about regulations in the \nPresident's address just this week.\n  To make things worse, the people most victimized by this uncertainty \nare the very people the President claims he wants to help. The \nPresident said last year that when it comes to job creation, he wants \nto, as he said, ``start where most new jobs do--with small \nbusinesses.'' The sentiment is right, but, again, what has he done \nabout it? According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, businesses with \nfewer than 20 employees incur regulatory costs that are 42 percent \nhigher than larger businesses with up to 500 employees, and that is not \ncounting the avalanche of new regulations that will come down the road. \nThis year, over 50,000 pages of regulations have been added to the \nFederal Register already, and the chamber of commerce has said that the \nPresident's new health care law alone will produce ``30,000 pages of \nnew health care regulations, many aimed at small employers.''\n  The President has said he will keep trying every new idea that works \nand listen to every good proposal, no matter which party comes up with \nit. I have a pretty simple idea. If the President wants to know which \nproposals will work to create jobs, maybe he should require his \nregulatory agencies to tell him how their own actions will affect the \njob market.\n  Congressman Lee Terry of Nebraska and I have a bill that will do just \nthat. It is called the Employment Impact Act, S. 1219. This bill will \nforce Washington to look before it leaps when it comes to regulation \nthat could hurt America's jobs. Under our bill, every regulatory agency \nwould be required to prepare what is called a jobs impact statement, \nand this jobs impact statement would need to be prepared with every new \nrule that is proposed. The statement would include a detailed \nassessment of the jobs that would be lost or gained or sent overseas by \nany given rule coming out of Washington. It would consider whether new \nrules would have a bad impact on our job market in general. This jobs \nimpact statement would also include an analysis of any alternative \nplans that might be better for the economy. Most importantly, it would \nrequire regulatory agencies to look at how new rules might interact \nwith other proposals coming down the road.\n  The problem with our regulations is not only that they are too \nsweeping, it is also that there are too many of them, so it makes no \nsense to look at an individual rule in a vacuum and enacting hundreds \nof them without knowing their cumulative effect. The effect of all of \nthese together could spell death by a thousand cuts for hard-working \nAmericans who are trying to work and support their families.\n  Also in keeping with the principles of transparency, this bill would \nrequire every jobs impact statement prepared by a Federal agency to be \nmade available to the public. The American people deserve to know what \ntheir government is actually doing, and Federal agencies in Washington \nneed to learn to think before they act.\n  Requiring statements from these agencies on what their regulations \nwill do is nothing new. For 40 years, the Federal Government has always \nrequired its bureaucrats to ask the question of whether their actions \nwill impact America's environment. They have to file environmental \nimpact statements. What I am asking for here is a jobs impact \nstatement.\n  Past generations of legislators rightly recognized the importance of \nAmerica's land, air, and water, but it is important that we recognize \nthe importance of America's working families as well. America's \ngreatest natural resource is the American people. We are talking about \npeople who want to work, are willing to work, are looking for work, and \nyet cannot find a job. The Employment Impact Act will force Washington \nbureaucrats to realize Americans are much more interested in growing \nour Nation's economy than they are in growing our government.\n  I am going to continue to fight to see that the Employment Impact Act \nis passed and signed into law to help get Americans working again.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to echo the comments made by my \ncolleague from Wyoming regarding regulations. That is something I hear \nfrom small businesses all across South Dakota, traveling my State \nduring the month of August. I toured businesses, and I visited with \nfarmers and ranchers and small businesspeople. That was a recurring \ntheme, one thing people continued to bring up unsolicited. When you \nasked them questions about what can be done to help create jobs, to get \nthem investing and putting their capital to work, that was the \noverwhelming response. It came back literally every single time, that \nbusinesses are concerned about the overreaching regulations coming out \nof Washington, DC, and the economic uncertainty that it creates. Part \nof it just has to do with the predictability that businesses need to \nmake long-term investment decisions. If they do not know what is going \nto happen next in Washington, DC, it makes it awfully hard for them to \nplan. So as a consequence of that, we see billions of dollars, \ntrillions of dollars, sitting on the sidelines right now that could be \ninvested and could be put to work, could be getting people back to work \nin this country.\n\n  Last week we all listened with great interest as the President came \nout to a joint session of Congress and made a speech about a jobs plan. \nHe talked about passing this jobs plan. He has been traveling around \nthe country making that same argument. What was interesting to me about \nthat proposal--and, of course, the speech itself was sufficiently \nvague. It was very difficult to know exactly what was in that proposal, \nwhere more of those details now are coming to light. It sounded eerily \nsimilar to the very same proposal we voted on a couple of years ago in \nthe Senate. It ultimately became law. It was called the stimulus bill. \nIt had a pricetag of nearly $1 trillion.\n  The assertions made at the time were along the lines that if we \npassed this it would keep unemployment below 8 percent. We know \nemployment is over 9 percent, and since that stimulus bill was passed \nwe have lost 1.7 million jobs in our economy. There are 1.7 million \nfewer Americans employed today than there were when the stimulus bill \npassed a couple of years ago. So the question, then, is, Why would we \nwant to go down that same path?\n  In many respects this proposal is like that one because it consists \nof more spending and more taxing and more borrowing--all the things we \nbelieve are detrimental to the economy in the long run. They do nothing \nto address the concern that was raised to me by the small businesses \nacross South Dakota and the issue to which the Senator from Wyoming was \njust speaking; that is, the issue of overregulation that we keep \nhearing from our businesses across this country, the job creators in \nour economy.\n  It strikes me, if the President is serious about actually doing \nsomething that would create jobs in this country, it ought to involve \nputting policies in place that will be conducive toward long-term \neconomic growth to provide the economic certainty these small \nbusinesses are asking for.\n  Right now there is uncertainty with regard to taxes. Tax rates are at \nleast locked in now until the end of 2012, but beyond that it is \nanybody's guess. There is a concern, of course, that any proposal \ncoming out of Washington right now that deals with deficit reduction \nmight include higher taxes. That certainly is something the President \nput on the table yet again yesterday as a proposed way to pay for his \nnew stimulus bill.\n  There is this repeated and consistent assault upon small businesses \nin the form of more regulations. The President backed off of the ozone \nregulations, which is something that everybody reacted very favorably \ntoward in the business community and people I\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\ntalked to. But there are so many other regulations that are out there: \nthe CO2 emission regulation, appropriated dust regulation, \nthe change in the classification for coal ash. There are all kinds of \nregulations--particularly out of the EPA, but not exclusively the EPA--\ncoming out of agencies of this government that are creating greater \nuncertainty and making it more difficult and more costly for small \nbusinesses to create jobs. So why not focus on that issue? Why not \nfocus on getting the free-trade agreements?\n  There were three free-trade agreements essentially negotiated in the \nprevious administration. They are languishing because they have not \nbeen submitted to Congress for ratification. The President talks about \nfree trade and creating jobs through exports. We had three free-trade \nagreements in 2006 and 2007. Colombia was 2006. Panama and Korea were \nJune of 2007. The President said: I want Congress to approve these \nfree-trade agreements.\n  We cannot do that until he submits them to the Congress. We would \nlove to approve those free-trade agreements. It would mean thousands of \njobs in this economy. We know that. It is low-hanging fruit. It is \nsomething we could do today that is something positive to actually \ncreate jobs in this country.\n  Just as an example, in my State of South Dakota in 2008, the top \nthree crops were corn, wheat, and soybeans. In those three commodities \nwe had 81 percent of the market in the country of Colombia. In 2010 \nthat had dropped off to 19 percent. It is a major collapse in our \nmarket share in that country simply because we have not ratified this \nfree-trade agreement, and in the interim we have had other countries \nthat have moved in and filled the vacuum.\n  Most recently the Canadians, on August 15, I think, had their own \nbilateral trade agreement with Colombia. We may go down to zero market \nshare if we do not act quickly to get the free-trade agreements \napproved. It is not a function of us wanting to do it; it is a function \nof the President submitting those agreements to Congress for \nratification. We cannot vote on and ratify those trade agreements, put \nthem into effect, and get them implemented absent the President of the \nUnited States sending them to Capitol Hill. That is something on which \nRepublicans would love to work with the President.\n  We would also love to work with the President on a moratorium on \nregulations. I think it would make perfect sense, given what we know \nabout what small businesses are telling us in terms of creating jobs \nand hiring people and investing capital, that regulation is a huge \nimpediment to that. So why not--at least for the foreseeable future, \nuntil such time as we start getting this unemployment rate down and get \npeople back to work--put a moratorium on all these crazy regulations \ncoming out of Washington, DC?\n  There are literally millions of jobs that are impacted by these \nvarious regulations according to estimates that have been put forward \nby organizations such as the chamber of commerce and others. There are \nmillions of jobs in this country impacted by the issue of regulation. I \nwould think it would make perfect sense for this President to say to \nus, as part of his jobs package, his jobs plan: We want to work with \nyou to put a moratorium on regulations for a 2-year period, until the \nend of his term in office--whatever that period is--but at least some \namount of time so businesses know with some certainty that if they \ninvest their dollars, they are not going to be slapped with some new \nregulation coming out of Washington, DC.\n  There was a story just this morning about 500 jobs lost in the State \nof Texas over a new EPA regulation. We have seen examples of that in my \nState of South Dakota. We have had coal-fired powerplants that have \nbeen nixed simply because of this uncertainty that has been created by \nregulations coming from Washington, DC. That is something that \nRepublicans on Capitol Hill--if the President wants to be proactive in \nterms of job creation and actually having a forward-looking proposal \nand plan for job creation, he would certainly get cooperation from lots \nof folks on our side of the aisle when it comes to the issue of \nregulations.\n  Another thing we would be more than happy to work with the President \non is broad-based and comprehensive tax reform. We all talk about it, \nand nobody seems to be willing, at least from the President's \nperspective, to put forward a proposal that would actually broaden the \ntax base in this country, lower the rates on businesses and \nindividuals. I think it would lead to an enormous amount of economic \ngrowth. Most people and businesses I talk to suggest that right now in \nAmerica the complexity in the Tax Code, the rates in our Tax Code, make \nus anticompetitive.\n  We lose jobs every single day to other countries around the world \nthat have lower tax rates. Businesses are taking their capital and \ninvesting it overseas, creating jobs overseas, and are opposed to \nputting it in our country because our rates are not competitive. Our \ncorporate tax rate at 35 percent is the second highest in the world. We \nare second only to Japan, and they were going to lower theirs prior to \nthe tsunami.\n  The fact is, we have tax rates in America today that are making it \nvery difficult for our businesses to compete and to keep those jobs and \nkeep that investment in this country.\n  What can we do about that? Well, if we had broad-based tax reductions \non individuals and small businesses in this country, lowered taxes on \ninvestment, I think we would see an explosion of economic growth and \nget these businesses--provided that there is enough certainty \nassociated with that. In other words, we don't do it for a short period \nof time, we do it for a long period of time. If we do that, we will see \nbusinesses pick up on that signal from Washington, DC, and begin to \ninvest again and get a rate structure that is competitive with other \ncountries around the world.\n  Tax reform regulations, regulatory reform, a moratorium on \nregulations, trade, those are all issues that we are more than willing \nto work with this President on if he is willing to work with us because \nthose are policies proven over time that actually will create jobs. \nAgain, they are the things we consistently hear.\n  I dare to say that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nhearing the same thing I am hearing. I hear it from colleagues on my \nside who are repeatedly visited by small businesses in their travels in \ntheir individual States, and when they go to make contact with their \nsmall businesses they hear this over and over. These are the issues the \nAmerican business communities are saying we need to address to get \npeople back to work in this country.\n  I am certainly hopeful the President will change directions away from \nwhat he is proposing to do now, which is a very similar path to what \nwas done 2 years ago, which we all know has been unsuccessful. If we \nlook at it based upon the metrics--and, again, I am talking about job \ncreation. If we look at it based upon the employment rate, the \nunemployment rate has gone up. The number of jobs lost has gone up. The \namount of our debt has gone up by $4 trillion. We have borrowed more, \nwe are spending more, and we are getting nothing in return--in fact, \nthe very opposite of what we hope to get; that is, job creation. That \napproach has not worked.\n\n  Let's not double down on that and go back and try the same failed \npolicies again. Let's change direction. Let's go in a different \ndirection for this country, and I would hope the President would do \nthat.\n  The other thing that I think is particularly troubling about his \nproposal--not to mention some of the things that he put out in his \nspeech last week that give me a good amount of heartburn in terms of \nthe direction he is headed--is how he proposes to pay for that. It was \nindicated yesterday that 90 percent of the cost of this stimulus bill \nwould be paid for by allowing or preventing people from taking \ndeductions--the two top income tax rates in this country and the people \nwho are in those income tax brackets, to be able to claim deductions on \ntheir tax returns.\n  Well, that impacts millions of Americans and millions of job \ncreators, millions of small businesses, not to mention a lot of \ncharities. Many of the people who contribute to charities today don't \ndo it simply because of the tax consequence, but the amount they \ncontribute to a charity is affected by the Tax Code, and reducing the \namount they can deduct is going to make it more difficult for many of \nour charitable organizations that rely upon the\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\ngenerosity of people. In many cases these are high-income people in \nthis country.\n  That being said, raising taxes, in my view, is not the way to pay for \na new stimulus, a stimulus 2.0, an approach that has been tried and \nfailed. It is something we should not be moving toward, but moving away \nfrom, and moving in a different direction.\n  Again, we have no greater priority in America today than getting this \neconomy growing, creating jobs, getting people back to work. That helps \nbring in more revenue in the Federal Government and helps deal with our \nissue of the deficit and the debt. There are two ways we can deal with \nthat: We can reduce spending, and we can grow the economy. We have to \ndo both.\n  Certainly, those are not unrelated. When we reduce spending, that is \nessential to growing the economy. We also have to put policies in place \nthat will grow the economy and create jobs. Raising taxes is not the \nway to do that, and so the President's proposal to pay for his new \nstimulus bill which raises taxes on people is a wrongheaded approach \nthat has not worked in the past. It will not work in the future. We \nneed to try a different direction.\n  Republicans are willing, ready, and able to work with this President \non passing trade agreements that have been languishing around here, \nliterally, for 4 to 5 years; on reducing the overreaching regulations, \nwhich are creating economic uncertainty for our small businesses across \nthis country; and on tax reform that would lower rates and broaden the \ntax base and bring in an incredible explosion of economic growth and \njobs.\n  Those are the types of things we ought to be looking at--long-term \npolicies that will affect in a positive way the environment, the \natmosphere for our job creators, not doing another Washington-directed \nspending program that has already demonstrated that it doesn't work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the world has witnessed considerable \nupheaval across the Middle East this year as citizens from all walks of \nlife have turned out by the millions to say enough to repressive \nregimes, stagnant political systems, and a lack of economic \nopportunities.\n  In fact, we should probably look back to the summer of 2009 when \nthousands upon thousands of ordinary Iranians bravely took to the \nstreets to peacefully protest the country's likely stolen election.\n  These Iranian citizens were met with brutal violence, death, \ndetention, and unspeakable torture.\n  While Iran's ruling dictatorship was able to temporarily repress the \npublic aspirations of its own people, the seeds for wider public \ndiscontent were taking root through much of the region.\n  First, in Tunisia we saw peaceful protests lead to the ousting of \ncorrupt, long-time strongman President Ben Ali.\n  Next, Egyptian President Mubarak resigned following sustained \npeaceful protests in Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt.\n  And certainly Muammar Qaddafi's reign of erratic and despotic rule is \nnearing an end.\n  Other popular calls for political and economic reform from Bahrain to \nYemen remain in flux.\n  And as we saw this weekend with the violent and very troubling \nprotests breaching the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, ousting a repressive \nregime is only one step on a long road toward building effective long-\nterm democratic and economic institutions.\n  The United States stands ready to support these peaceful transitions, \nbut most of the hard work must continue to come from within--from the \npeople who made such historic change possible in the first place.\n  Amid so much upheaval and potential hope, it is critically important \nthat we also keep our attention on what is happening in another very \nimportant country in the Middle East--Syria.\n  Since March, millions of protesters have peacefully taken to the \nstreets of towns and villages across Syria demanding an end to the \nbrutal dictatorship of the Assad family.\n  The Syrian people have suffered 40 years of economic hardship, \npolitical repression, and corruption under the Assad family--first \nunder former President Hafez al-Assad and now under his son, Bashar al-\nAssad.\n  Let me give an example of life under the Assad regimes.\n  Almost 30 years ago, then-President Hafez al-Assad ruthlessly leveled \na Portion of the town of Hama to put down a rebellion by his own \npeople.\n  Between 10,000 and 20,000 fellow Syrians were literally buried to \ndeath in the ruble.\n  This is how political dissent was dealt with in Syria.\n  And what has been his son's strategy for addressing public demands \nfor change while reform is sweeping the rest of the region?\n  Tragically, the same as his father--mass murder.\n  Since the popular uprising began, an estimated 2,000 people have \nalready been slaughtered by Assad's security services.\n  Government snipers on rooftops have fired on those who dare to go \noutside in areas where protesters are active. Men have been rounded up \nand detained in nighttime house-to-house raids. Tanks and anti-aircraft \nguns have been used against civilians and civilian buildings.\n  A recent example--sadly one that is not at all unique--obviously \nshows that the current Assad regime has no sense of history.\n  Last month government troops backed by tanks, armored vehicles, and \nsnipers entered the heart of Hama--the same town of Hama that had been \nflattened by Assad's father three decades earlier--to quash \nantigovernment protesters.\n  Our dedicated U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford had gone to Hama not long \nbefore the siege to serve as witness to the unfolding events.\n  I wish to show this photo, which shows a giant Syrian flag held by \nthe crowd during a protest against President Assad in the city of Hama \non July 29.\n  The town--already under siege for days--saw its telephone, water, and \nelectricity cut off at 5 a.m. as a prelude to the deployment.\n  Residents tried to stop the advancing armored columns with \nbarricades--many of them built of furniture, iron railing, rocks, and \ncinderblocks--but stood little chance.\n  Dozens were killed and hundreds wounded.\n  Such public resilience and government brutality have continued \nunabated in Syria for months.\n  President Assad's tyrannical actions have been condemned around the \nworld. The Arab League, not always known for its democratic advocacy, \nhas urged Syria to ``end the spilling of blood and follow the way of \nreason before it is too late.''\n  Syria's neighbor and significant trading partner Turkey has spoken \nout. Turkish President Gul said he has ``lost confidence'' in the \nSyrian government. Prime Minister Erdogan has said, ``Turkey can no \nlonger defend Syria.''\n  British Prime Minister Cameron, French President Sarkozy and German \nChancellor Merkel jointly issued a statement urging Assad to ``face the \nreality of the complete rejection of his regime by the Syrian people \nand to step aside in the best interests of Syria and the unity of its \npeople.''\n  The United Nations human rights office in Geneva has issued a \nsweeping report concluding that the Syrian government might have \ncommitted crimes against humanity through summary executions, torture, \nand by harming children.\n  President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton have sharply \ncriticized the Syrian government's crackdown from the start, and most \nrecently the Administration announced additional sanctions against the \nregime, including those squeezing Assad's cash lifeline from petroleum \nexports. The European Union also cut its purchase of Syrian petroleum.\n  Senators Gillibrand and Lieberman have introduced legislation--\nlegislation I am pleased to support--that further tightens sanctions \nagainst Syria's\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\npetroleum exports by penalizing those who buy Syrian oil or invest in \nits energy sector--an approach Congress has supported in the past \nagainst Iran.\n  I urge others to support this legislation and for the Congress to \npass it expeditiously.\n  And when the crackdown in Syria began, I joined Senators Lieberman, \nMcCain, Cardin, Kyl and at least 20 others on a Senate resolution \ncondemning the violence. I understand that Senator Paul has had a hold \non that resolution for a number of months. I call on Senator Paul to \nwork with us on his concerns in a timely manner so we can move forward \nputting the Senate on record about these tragic events in Syria.\n  There is more still the international community can do.\n  Russia, China, India, Brazil and South Africa are still blocking a \nUnited Nations Security Council resolution that could impose more \nsweeping international sanctions on Syria. That some of these countries \nhave emerged from decades under their own repressive regimes, only to \nsit silently as Assad slaughters his own people is extremely troubling.\n  Russia and China should also pledge not to purchase any surplus \nSyrian oil which is used by Assad to pay off his enablers and security \nhenchmen.\n  Human rights monitors, humanitarian workers, and journalists must be \nallowed in the country.\n  And the International Criminal Court should look into indicting \nPresident Assad on war crimes.\n  This administration has shown great skill and diplomacy in navigating \nthe turbulent calls for change in the Middle East.\n  These are demands from everyday people for a better life, for a \nchance to freely choose one's government, and to see hope and dignity \nfor one's children.\n  The people of Syria should know that the rest of the world is \nwatching and supporting their aspirations for freedom.\n  Saturday night in a suburb of Chicago I had a meeting with about 30 \nSyrian Americans, and we spoke at great length about the situation in \nthe country of their birth. Many of them still have relatives, family, \nand friends, in Syria, and they are following on YouTube and through \nthe international media the events of the day. They showed me on one of \nthe computers nearby some of the YouTube footage which showed the \nSyrian security forces literally shooting a man dead, point blank. You \ncould see him lying in the street, and you could see the blood flowing \nfrom his body.\n  To suggest that these peaceful protesters are anything else is to \nmisstate the obvious. These people, by and large, in the streets of \nSyria are asking for the same thing that was asked for across the \nMiddle East. They are asking for a chance for reform, for change, for \nself rule.\n  I promised my friends and people I represent in Illinois who have \nsuch strong feelings about Syria that I would do my best when I \nreturned to Washington this week. This floor statement is just the \nbeginning.\n  A few moments ago, I got off the telephone, having had a phone \nconversation with Ambassador Ford, who is in Damascus. He has done an \nexceptional job for our country. He has risked his life to let those \nwho are protesting peacefully know that the United States is in their \ncorner. We talked about the situation on the ground. He is a man of \ngreat talent and experience in the Middle East, and he analyzed all the \ndifferent forces at work.\n  We know that Iran is, in fact, the major supporter and promoter of \nAssad and his repressive regime. We know, as well, that these five \ncountries in the United Nations--Russia, India, China, Brazil, and \nSouth Africa--are stopping the United Nations action when it comes to \nSyria. I find it hard to imagine how some of these countries, in light \nof their own history, could ignore the obvious: the killing of innocent \npeople in the streets of Syria. It cannot be tolerated, should not be \ncondoned, and should not be protected by their veto in the United \nNations.\n  I am going to work with President Obama and this administration and \nmy friends in Congress on both sides of the aisle to let the people of \nSyria know that what is happening there has not been ignored by the \nU.S. Congress. I hope Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky will at least lift \nhis hold on bipartisan legislation which we have pending here which \nwill express that sentiment in the strongest of terms.\n  The people of Syria deserve that message, to know that the people of \nthe United States, through their elected representatives in the Senate, \nunderstand their plight, stand behind them, and will work to bring \njustice to their country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my congratulations and \nbest wishes to the people of South Boston, MA, as they honor their \ncommunity's long tradition of service to country on the 30th \nanniversary of the South Boston Vietnam Veterans Memorial.\n  Thirty years ago, on September 13, 1981, the people of South Boston, \nled by their own citizens who had served in the Vietnam war, became one \nof the first communities in the United States to build and dedicate a \npermanent memorial in honor of those who had given their lives in \nVietnam. I was privileged to be a speaker at the original dedication of \nthe memorial, and I am honored to be returning to South Boston this \nyear in order to once again pay tribute to those who served.\n  It is difficult for many of the generation that followed us to \nunderstand how bitterly our country had been divided by that war and \nhow long it took to overcome if not resolve the divisions, often along \nclass lines, that were left in its wake. I do not seek to reopen those \nwounds today, but it should not be forgotten that 25 young men from \nthis solidly working-class community gave their lives in Vietnam, while \nHarvard College, located nearby on the far banks of the River Charles, \nlost a total of 12 out of the 11 classes from 1962 to 1972.\n  In building this memorial, the people of South Boston took it upon \nthemselves to honor their own, and in so doing they reignited the \nspirit of service to country, not only here in Boston but elsewhere \nacross our country. It was built through the dedication of friends and \nneighbors, acting together to honor and remember the service and \nsacrifice of those they knew and loved.\n  Many veterans from this community took strong roles in bringing the \nmemorial to fruition, but I would like to extend a special recognition \nto Tommy Lyons, a Marine Corps veteran of Vietnam, who not only \nprovided spirited and determined leadership on this Memorial but also \nwent on to found the Semper Fidelis Society in Boston, which every \nNovember brings together more than 1,000 marines of all ages and wars \nfor the most well-attended veterans' lunch in America.\n  Mr. President, 25 names are engraved on the South Boston memorial--\nall of them ``Southie Boys,'' 15 of them marines, 9 soldiers, 1 airman. \nOne of them was a lieutenant; the other 24 were enlisted men. All of \nthem represent the best of citizen service, the willingness to put \none's life on the line on behalf of our country.\n  In closing, I ask that the names of those inscribed on the memorial \nbe printed below:\n\n     Joseph J.

Mr. President, I rise today on this most moving and \nmemorable of occasions after we as a nation joined together to mark the \nsolemn 10th anniversary of the attacks on September 11, 2001. \nThroughout my home State of Maine and across this great land, Americans \nare uniting as one nation indivisible as we pause to remember with the \nheaviest of hearts the tragedy that befell our nation 10 years ago--a \nmorning that changed America--and Americans--forever.\n  We are all a different people in America--no matter our faith or \nancestry--as a result of the horrific events on\n9/11 that are ingrained upon the landscape of our consciousness for all \ntime. We all know where we were and what we were doing at the precise \ntime they happened. As many of us remember the assassination of \nPresident Kennedy, and some Pearl Harbor, our children will remember \nthis day.\n  As we recall, that morning began with such remarkable blue skies, but \nended with a Nation in mourning and stunned disbelief. In Washington, \nDC, I watched the images along with the rest of the world. Later, as \nthe Sun set over the National Mall--still capped by smoke billowing \nfrom the wound in the side of the Pentagon--I will never forget \ngathering with my colleagues in the House and Senate on the Capitol \nsteps to sing ``God Bless America.'' We sang to send a message to the \ncountry and to the world that we would never be deterred--that freedom \nwould never be crushed by the blunt and remorseless instruments of \nterror.\n  The notes of ``God Bless America'' still reverberate, the resilience \nwe recaptured as a country remains pressed upon our national psyche, \nand the memory of the inspirational sacrifices of so many heroic \nAmericans who perished that morning will forever have a home in our \nhearts and our prayers.\n  On this September 11 as in all that have preceded it, we mourn the \nloss of those eight individuals from Maine who were taken from us all \ntoo soon--Anna Allison, Carol Flyzik, Robert Jalbert, Jacqueline \nNorton, Robert Norton, James Roux, Robert Schlegel, and Stephen Ward.\n  We remember the heroic acts of valor that will always distinguish the \nmen and women of 115 different nations who went to work that day, or \nboarded a plane, or rushed to the aid of strangers whose lives they \nbelieved were as vital as their own--and never returned home. If 9/11 \nwas a snapshot of horror, it also became a portrait of consummate \nhumanity. If it laid bare the unimaginable cruelties of which humankind \nis capable, it also etched forever within our minds the heights to \nwhich the human spirit can rise--even and especially in the face of \nmortality.\n  Each had a soul, and having visited Ground Zero in the aftermath, I \ncan tell you their presence still triumphed over the twisted \ndestruction--and it always will. We recall that during one of the \ndarkest days in our Nation's extraordinary and storied history, we also \nwitnessed our Nation's mettle and solidarity, the inexhaustible courage \nand undaunted bravery that provided us with boundless inspiration and \nhope that sustained us then and inspires us today.\n  And nowhere was that more evident than with the first responders who, \nin the face of unspeakable adversity and peril, heroically ran toward \nthe very dangers others were desperately trying to escape, placing \ntheir lives in harm's way in the most courageous and valiant of \nendeavors to save others without regard for their own safety.\n  As Americans, we are awed by the noble examples of courage and \nselflessness that emerged. When the alarm went off in fire stations \nacross New York, firefighters were changing shifts. If they were on the \nway home, they turned around. If they were finishing up at the \nfirehouse, getting ready to leave, they stayed. Some were retired--\nveterans already at home--and they reported in. Many were to find \nthemselves climbing higher and higher in those great silver towers \ntoward a fate that must have become clearer with every step.\n  Their valiant service and sacrifice are also a vivid reminder of the \nremarkable men and women exceptional enough to don our country's \nuniform to serve and defend our nation. Whether on our shores or soil \nhere at home or around the globe, their steadfast sense of duty and \nlove of country are an inspiration to us all, their commitment \nfortifies our will, and their professionalism steadies our hands in an \nuncertain world.\n  As I gathered with Mainers across our State, I could not help but \nfeel that inescapable, palpable sense of patriotism that binds us all \ntogether as Americans. It is also, I believe, a continuation of the \nheightened love of country all of us experienced when our Nation's \nbravest and finest--in this case our Navy SEALs--achieved what Americas \ndetractors said was unachievable. They triumphantly rid the world of \npublic enemy number one, and brought justice to the evil incarnate that \nwas Osama bin Laden.\n  In speaking of bin Laden, I have often sounded the refrain that you \ncan run but you cannot hide. Well, thanks to the combined might of our \nmilitary, intelligence, and counter-terrorism professionals, the \nmessage sent to the terrorists of the world with the death of Osama bin \nLaden is that America will prevail no matter how long it takes, \nwhatever it takes, no matter where you are.\n  Though justice was finally rendered, the unending pain of loved ones \nlost does not ease with the passing of years, and yet out of these \natrocities emerged heroes who were then and will forever be shining \ntestaments to the very best of who we are as a nation. And so, today, \nwe memorialize those whose lives were stilled on September 11, and at \nthe same time, we cannot help but extol the courage and indomitable \nspirit they exhibited.\n  It was an unmistakable message to the world that we would never be \ndeterred--that our freedoms could never be crushed by the cowardly \ninstruments of terror that are no match against a resilient people \ncertain in the knowledge that good ultimately triumphs over evil.\n  What better symbol could there be of our mettle as a people than the \nhistoric National 9/11 Flag initiative. Americans across our country \nare stitching together the tattered remnants of one of the largest \nflags that flew over the wreckage at Ground Zero. When our beloved \nbanner of freedom arrived at the U.S. Capitol on July 14, I cannot \nbegin to convey the sense of honor and privilege I experienced in \ncontributing to its restoration. And to share in this event with first \nresponders, 9/11 families, and veterans made this moment one I will \ntreasure, always.\n  This expression of love for our homeland speaks to the inescapable \nbelief that our strength as a nation has always emanated not from \nWashington, but from the people themselves--from tireless patriots of \ntheir own volition performing the most extraordinary of deeds.\n  Patriots like the exemplary Freeport Flag Ladies--Elaine Greene, \nCarmen Footer, and JoAnn Miller, who have waved American flags on Main \nStreet every Tuesday morning, rain, snow, or shine, since 9-11 in \ntribute to those who have sacrificed for all of us--our brave \nservicemen and women and our first responders. It was the highest of \nhonors for me to join them early Sunday morning on Main Street in \nFreeport to wave flags on the 10th anniversary.\n  Amid the trials and tribulations that this date in our history \nevokes, we take solace in the sacred truth that none of us grieves \nalone--that there are no strangers among us, only Americans. Indeed, \nout of the rubble rose our resolve, out of despair grew our \ndetermination, and out of the hate that was perpetrated upon us proudly \nstood our humanity.

In its years of service, \nCommunity Shares has demonstrated a tireless commitment to supporting \nColorado's nonprofits and providing individuals with an opportunity to \ndo the same.\n  Community Shares strives to connect Coloradoans of any economic \nbackground with organizations that inspire them. The organizations \nstaff and supporters firmly believe that philanthropy should not be \nrestricted to the most affluent, but rather should be extended to \ninclude any and all who are willing to give. Using this approach, they \nhave brought together average gifts of $5 a week for a total of nearly \n$20 million in support of more than 100 nonprofits.\n  Furthermore, Community Shares has recently begun a program entitled \n``My Colorado Project'' aimed at encouraging our kids and young \nColoradans to develop the habits of philanthropy and social \nresponsibility. This innovative program expands traditional donation to \ninclude elements of social media and creates an engaging virtual \ncommunity that involves our young, emerging philanthropists in \nsupporting their communities and causes they care about with a \ngeographic, age-accessible online tool.\n  The organizations that Community Shares supports are local and \ndedicated to the issues that define Colorado, from protecting our \nabundant natural resources to improving health care and promoting \ncommunity leadership.\n  I join the State of Colorado in thanking the staff of this \norganization for their hard work and dedication, and I look forward to \nits continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5531-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MUSIC IN THE MOUNTAINS\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I recognize the 25th \nanniversary season of Music in the Mountains, a nonprofit classical \nmusic festival held in Durango, CO. This festival began in 1987 when \nMaestro Mischa Seminetsky assembled 11 musicians and offered 5 chamber \nmusic performances. Under the strong and capable leadership of \nexecutive director Susan Lander and current board president Terry \nBacon, the festival has grown to more than 220 musicians, many of whom \nare esteemed first chairs from orchestras across the country and a \nnumber of world renowned soloists. The festival now offers nearly \nthirty orchestral and chamber performances as well as a number of \nnontraditional musical events.\n  In addition the festival includes a conservatory program that \nprovides musical training and mentoring for up to 100 young musicians \nfrom around the world. In 2000 Mischa Seminetsky and then-board \npresident Ann Flatten began the Music in the Mountains Goes to School \nProgram to reach out to local school children for instructional \nsessions and miniconcerts. Since then Music in the Mountains has become \na regular partner with local schools in Durango offering a variety of \nteaching programs and activities during the school year that impact the \nlife of hundreds of young students.\n  This festival would be remarkable in any community; I take particular \npride in its being held in Durango, a town of 14,000 residents in the \nsouthwest corner of Colorado. The festival is a key component of \nsouthwest Colorado's summertime economy providing important economic \nbenefits for the region. Most of the performances are held at the \nDurango Mountain Ski Resort, a stunningly beautiful resort north of \nDurango in the San Juan Mountains and an enchanting place to listen to \nworld class music. I congratulate Music in the Mountains and all the \nvolunteers, musicians and community leaders who have made this festival \na brilliant success over the last 25 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5531-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MAINE MILITARY FUNERAL HONORS PROGRAM\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I recognize the contribution \nof the Maine Military Funeral Honors Program of the Army National \nGuard. The soldiers in this exceptional program perform military honors \nat the funerals for Maine's fallen warriors and veterans. They pay \ntribute to the men and women who have served our Nation, and provide \ncomfort and dignity to the families during their time of loss.\n  On August 27, the Maine Military Funeral Honors Program performed its \nseven thousandth military funeral, a duty they have carried out since \nOctober 2004. Since that time, approximately 30 highly skilled and \ncarefully selected soldiers of the Maine Military Funeral Honors \nProgram have performed funerals for all of Maine's soldiers who have \nbeen killed in action, as well as funerals for veterans of every era, \nincluding one in July 2010 for a Civil War Veteran, William Wallace \nClark, whose remains were recovered in July 2009 from an unmarked grave \nbeside that of his wife. The team performed 424 military funerals in \nits first year, and this year they will perform over 1,300--sadly more \nthan 3 funerals per day as our World War II veterans are leaving us.\n  The soldiers of the Maine Military Funeral Honors Program proudly and \nrespectfully render final honors for our fallen heroes, both past and \npresent, from Fort Kent to Kittery, in the sweltering heat or the \nbitter cold. They never break military bearing and conform to the same \nexacting standards that are expected of all honor guards across the \ncountry, including those at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  The Maine Military Funeral Honors Program provides services to 96 \npercent of the Army veteran population in the State of Maine, a \nremarkable achievement unmatched by any other State. This year, the \nprogram will likely achieve 100 percent. As they continue to meet the \ngrowing number of requests to honor those who have answered the call to \nserve, I continue to be impressed by this exceptional program's \ndedication to honoring Maine's fallen Army veterans. On the occasion of \ntheir seven thousandth military funeral, it is an honor for me to pay \nhomage to those who provide final honors to the best Maine and America \nhave to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5531-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5531-S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BONNEVILLE COUNTY, IDAHO\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins \nme today in recognizing Bonneville County's 100-year anniversary.\n  Established on February 7, 1911, by the Idaho Legislature, Bonneville \nCounty was formed out of Bingham County in eastern Idaho, along the \nWyoming border. Bonneville County was named for CPT Benjamin \nBonneville, an officer in the U.S. Army who was an explorer and fur \ntrapper in the area in the 1830s.\n  Home to more than 100,000 Idahoans in an area of nearly 2,000 square \nmiles, the county has diverse geography and industry. It is Idaho's \nfourth largest county and includes the six incorporated cities of Idaho \nFalls, Ucon, Iona, Ammon, Swan Valley, and Irwin. Outside of these \ncities, the county has many beautiful natural features, including the \nSnake River, Palisades Reservoir, Caribou National Forest, Grays Lake \nNational Wildlife Refuge, and Targhee National Forest. Family farmers \nproduce an abundance of agricultural products, including grain, \nlivestock, fruits and vegetables, floriculture, and poultry, throughout \nthe county. Bonneville County also leads the Nation in energy research \nand development through the Idaho National Laboratory, the Center for \nAdvanced Energy Studies, and the AREVA Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility.\n  Bonneville County residents have much to celebrate with 100 years of \naccomplishments. The work of the Bonneville County Heritage Association \nand volunteers to organize events observing this milestone, including \nthe centennial Gala Celebration in November, is commendable. Many \npeople have worked hard to make this celebration possible.\n  I was blessed to grow up and together with my wife raise our children \nin Bonneville County, where we experienced firsthand the exceptionalism \nof the people and the communities of the county.\n  Senator Risch and I are proud to recognize this landmark anniversary. \nWe congratulate Bonneville County residents for this centennial, and we \nwish its communities many more years of success.\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5532-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          SECURITY STATE BANK\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of Security State Bank. I am honored to have the \nopportunity to celebrate this extraordinary milestone.\n  For over a century, Security State Bank has provided its customers \nwith the highest quality banking services. Since 1911, this locally \nowned institution has grown substantially and continues to promote \neconomic growth throughout northern Wisconsin. Furthermore, Security \nState Bank has demonstrated an incredible commitment to customer \nservice, as well as to the communities and employees it serves. Under \nthe leadership of the bank's chairman and president, Mr. Willard Ogren, \nSecurity State Bank has prospered, further cementing its reputation as \na fine lending institution but, more importantly, as a community leader \ndedicated to promoting financial stability and improvement.\n  I have both personal and professional admiration for independent \nbanks that are focused on strengthening communities in both the best \nand worst economic times. For more than 100 years, Security State Bank \nhas embodied the importance of building strong local connections.\n  It is for this commitment to providing every customer with the \nhighest quality banking services and for their crucial role in \ncommunity improvement that I am proud to recognize this occasion and \n100 years of service that Security State Bank has provided to the \npeople of the State of Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5532-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CENTENNIAL OF MADISON COLLEGE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity \nto congratulate Madison College on their centennial celebration marking \n100 years of providing high quality education to students in my State.\n  Wisconsin was the first State to establish schools for technical and \nvocational education. Madison College, founded in 1912 as the Madison \nContinuation School, was opened to provide vocational education to \nstudents who dropped out of school. School administrators also targeted \nadult workers to help them maintain and flourish in their current jobs \nand also work toward obtaining new ones by providing the classes to \nhelp them do so. Throughout the years, Madison College tailored its \neducational role by responding to the Great Depression with increased \ncraft specialty offerings, such as millinery and woodworking, and later \nin the post-World War II era, with the help of Federal funding, by \nhoning workers' skills necessary for wartime jobs.\n  The focus and plan to ensure that every person gets a high-quality \neducation remain true today at this fine institution. Currently, \nMadison College operates 12 locations in Madison and 4 regional \ncampuses throughout a 12-county district in order to offer a wide \nvariety of educational opportunities to the greatest number of students \npossible. Today, Madison College continues to add new programs, such as \nbiotechnology and renewable energy, to keep up with the trends of the \n21st century and continue to live up to their mission.\n  For a century of service I commend Madison College and recognize the \nfaculty, students, alumni, and communities they call home. In these \ntough economic times, access to high-quality education and workforce \ndevelopment are critically important to our State and country finding \nour way to better financial times. Madison College has stood the test \nof time as well as economic cycles. I am honored to recognize Madison \nCollege on its centennial celebration and for all it has done for the \nState of Wisconsin and its citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5532-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:45 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1059.

A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of California urging Congress to enact federal \n     legislation to modernize the federal Toxic Substances Control \n     Act of 1976 by strengthening chemical management through \n     specified policy reforms; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, children and pregnant women are uniquely \n     vulnerable to the health threats of toxic chemicals, and \n     early life chemical exposures have been linked to chronic \n     disease later in life; and\n       Whereas, a growing body of peer-reviewed scientific \n     evidence links exposure to toxic chemicals to many diseases \n     and health conditions that are rising in incidence, including \n     childhood cancers, prostate cancer, breast cancer, learning \n     and developmental disabilities, infertility, and obesity; and\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\n       Whereas, the President's Cancer Panel report released in \n     May 2010 states ``the true burden of environmentally induced \n     cancers has been grossly underestimated,'' and the panel \n     advised the President of the United States ``to use the power \n     of your office to remove the carcinogens and other toxins \n     from our food, water, and air that needlessly increase health \n     care costs, cripple our nation's productivity, and devastate \n     American lives''; and\n       Whereas, workers in a range of industries are exposed to \n     toxic chemicals which pose threats to their health, \n     increasing worker absenteeism, workers' compensation claims, \n     and health care costs that burden the economy; and\n       Whereas, a recent national poll found that 78 percent of \n     American voters were seriously concerned about the threat to \n     children's health from exposure to toxic chemicals in day-to-\n     day life; and\n       Whereas, states bear an undue burden from toxic chemicals, \n     including health care costs and environmental damages, \n     disadvantaging businesses that lack information on chemicals \n     in their supply chain, and increasing demands for state \n     regulation; and\n       Whereas, the federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 \n     (TSCA; 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2601 et seq.), the primary governing \n     federal statute, was intended to authorize the federal \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect public \n     health and the environment from toxic chemicals; and\n       Whereas, when TSCA was passed, about 62,000 chemicals in \n     commerce were ``grandfathered in'' without any required \n     testing for health and safety hazards or any restrictions on \n     usage; and\n       Whereas, in the 35 years since the enactment of TSCA, the \n     EPA has required chemical companies to test only about 200 of \n     those chemicals for health hazards and has issued partial \n     restrictions on only five chemicals; and\n       Whereas, TSCA has been widely recognized as ineffective and \n     obsolete due to legal and procedural hurdles that prevent the \n     EPA from taking quick and effective regulatory action to \n     protect the public against well-known chemical threats; and\n       Whereas, a strong uniform federal standard would be \n     beneficial to both consumers and businesses; and\n       Whereas, in January 2009, the United States General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) added the EPA's regulatory program \n     for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals to its list of \n     ``high risk'' government programs that are not working as \n     intended, finding that the EPA has been unable to complete \n     assessments of chemicals of the highest concern. The EPA \n     requires additional authority to obtain health and safety \n     information from the chemical industry and to shift more of \n     the burden to chemical companies to demonstrate the safety of \n     their products. TSCA does not provide sufficient chemical \n     safety data for public use by consumers, businesses, and \n     workers and fails to create incentives to develop safer \n     alternatives; and\n       Whereas, the National Conference of State Legislatures \n     unanimously adopted a resolution in July 2009 that \n     articulated principles for the reform of TSCA and called on \n     Congress to act to update the law; and\n       Whereas, in August 2010, the Environmental Council of the \n     States (ECOS), the national association of state \n     environmental agency directors, unanimously adopted a \n     resolution entitled ``Reforming the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act,'' which endorsed specific policy reforms; and\n       Whereas, ten states have come together to launch the \n     Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse (IC2) to coordinate state \n     chemical information management programs, and a coalition of \n     13 states issued guiding principles for TSCA reform; and\n       Whereas, seventy-one state laws on chemical safety have \n     been enacted and signed into law in 18 states with broad \n     bipartisan support over the last eight years; and\n       Whereas, California's policy leadership on chemical \n     management, although outstanding, cannot substitute for \n     congressional leadership to reform TSCA, a reform which all \n     parties agree is urgently needed; and\n       Whereas, TSCA is the only major federal environmental \n     statute that has never been updated or reauthorized; and\n       Whereas, legislation to substantially reform TSCA was \n     introduced during the 109th Congress in 2005, the 110th \n     Congress in 2008, and again in the 111th Congress in 2010; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the California State Legislature \n     urges the President and the 112th Congress of the United \n     States to enact federal legislation to modernize the federal \n     Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 by strengthening \n     chemical management through policy reforms that would do all \n     of the following:\n       (a) Require producers and importers to perform \n     comprehensive toxicity testing on their products and to fully \n     disclose the results of their testing.\n       (b) Require producers and importers to disclose the \n     identities of chemicals in their products.\n       (c) Require immediate action to reduce or eliminate the \n     worst chemicals, including persistent, bioaccumulative, and \n     toxic chemicals, which are known as PBTs, and other priority \n     toxic chemicals, to which there is already widespread \n     exposure.\n       (d) Preserve the authority of state and tribal governments \n     to operate chemical management programs that are more \n     protective than the programs established by the federal \n     government.\n       (e) Establish health safety standards for chemicals that \n     rely on the best available science to protect the most \n     vulnerable, including children and the developing fetus.\n       (f) Support those chemical manufacturers that are striving \n     to establish that all existing and new chemicals are not \n     harmful to human health, and to provide essential health and \n     safety information on chemicals to inform the market, \n     consumers, and the public.\n       (g) Reward innovation by fast-tracking the approval of new, \n     demonstrably safer chemicals, and invest in green chemistry \n     research and workforce development to boost American business \n     and spur jobs making safer alternatives.\n       (h) Promote environmental justice by developing action \n     plans to reduce disproportionate exposure to toxic chemicals \n     in ``hot spots'' communities;\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the President pro Tempore of the United \n     States Senate, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     author for appropriate distribution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5535-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota, from the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 1547.

A bill to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United \nStates, and for other purposes; from the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs; placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout the Export-Import Bank. Earlier today, I filed the Export-Import \nBank Reauthorization Act of 2011. This legislation was approved \nunanimously by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nlast Thursday.\n  This legislation will ensure that the Bank remains able to continue \nto provide support for U.S. exporters and workers. The bill extends the \nauthorization of the Bank for 4 years, and will increase the Bank's \nlending authority to $140 billion by 2015. It also strengthens \ntransparency and accountability at the Bank, seeks to modernize the \nBank's IT, encourages the Bank to increase projects designed to create \nrenewable energies, and provides for greater oversight of the Bank's \nfinancing and any risks it might have to taxpayers.\n  The Bank's current authorization expires on September 30, 2011, and I \nhope that this legislation will pass as soon as possible to ensure that \nthe Bank continues to operate.\n  The Export-Import Bank is the official export credit agency of the \nUnited States and it assists in financing the export of U.S. goods and \nservices to international markets. Following the financial crisis, the \nBank experienced a dramatic increase in its activities as many \ncompanies struggled to find financing in the private market. In Fiscal \nYear 2010, the Bank saw a 70 percent increase in authorizations from \n2008. In fact, last year the Bank committed almost $25 billion in \nsupport of U.S. exports--a record.\n  The Bank has been self-funding since 2008, regularly returning \nmillions of dollars each year to the Treasury. This is a testament to \nthe Bank's leadership under Chairman Fred Hochberg, as well as the good \nwork of the dedicated staff and Board of the Bank.\n  All of the Bank's transactions are backed by the full faith and \ncredit of the United States. Therefore, I am pleased that this \nlegislation will help ensure that the Bank is working as efficiently \nand effectively as possible to protect the taxpayers.\n  Equally important is the Bank's goal to use exports to help create \nand maintain jobs here at home. This mission, embodied in the Bank's \nCharter, is at the very core of what Congress intended the Bank to do. \nI believe that while the Bank is doing a good job, it can--and must--do \nmore. I believe this legislation will help the Bank reach that goal.\n  This bill is a bipartisan effort and I thank Senator Shelby for his \nsupport. In addition, I thank Senator Warner, the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Security and International Trade and Finance, Senator \nBennet and Senator Hagan for their extremely important input into this \nlegislation. I urge all my colleagues to support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (by request):\n  S. 1549.

SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the \n     ``Building and Upgrading Infrastructure for Long-Term \n     Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 243. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) infrastructure has always been a vital element of the \n     economic strength of the United States and a key indicator of \n     the\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\n     international leadership of the United States;\n       (2) the Erie Canal, the Hoover Dam, the railroads, and the \n     interstate highway system are all testaments to American \n     ingenuity and have helped propel and maintain the United \n     States as the world's largest economy;\n       (3) according to the World Economic Forum's Global \n     Competitiveness Report, the United States fell to second \n     place in 2009, and dropped to fourth place overall in 2010, \n     however, in the ``Quality of overall infrastructure'' \n     category of the same report, the United States ranked twenty-\n     third in the world;\n       (4) according to the World Bank's 2010 Logistic Performance \n     Index, the capacity of countries to efficiently move goods \n     and connect manufacturers and consumers with international \n     markets is improving around the world, and the United States \n     now ranks seventh in the world in logistics-related \n     infrastructure behind countries from both Europe and Asia;\n       (5) according to a January 2009 report from the University \n     of Massachusetts/Alliance for American Manufacturing entitled \n     ``Employment, Productivity and Growth,'' infrastructure \n     investment is a ``highly effective engine of job creation'';\n       (6) according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, \n     the current condition of the infrastructure in the United \n     States earns a grade point average of D, and an estimated \n     $2,200,000,000,000 investment is needed over the next 5 years \n     to bring American infrastructure up to adequate condition;\n       (7) according to the National Surface Transportation Policy \n     and Revenue Study Commission, $225,000,000,000 is needed \n     annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade \n     the United States surface transportation system to a state of \n     good repair and create a more advanced system;\n       (8) the current infrastructure financing mechanisms of the \n     United States, both on the Federal and State level, will fail \n     to meet current and foreseeable demands and will create large \n     funding gaps;\n       (9) published reports state that there may not be enough \n     demand for municipal bonds to maintain the same level of \n     borrowing at the same rates, resulting in significantly \n     decreased infrastructure investment at the State and local \n     level;\n       (10) current funding mechanisms are not readily scalable \n     and do not--\n       (A) serve large in-State or cross jurisdiction \n     infrastructure projects, projects of regional or national \n     significance, or projects that cross sector silos;\n       (B) sufficiently catalyze private sector investment; or\n       (C) ensure the optimal return on public resources;\n       (11) although grant programs of the United States \n     Government must continue to play a central role in financing \n     the transportation, environment, and energy infrastructure \n     needs of the United States, current and foreseeable demands \n     on existing Federal, State, and local funding for \n     infrastructure expansion clearly exceed the resources to \n     support these programs by margins wide enough to prompt \n     serious concerns about the United States ability to sustain \n     long-term economic development, productivity, and \n     international competitiveness;\n       (12) the capital markets, including pension funds, private \n     equity funds, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other \n     investors, have a growing interest in infrastructure \n     investment and represent hundreds of billions of dollars of \n     potential investment; and\n       (13) the establishment of a United States Government-owned, \n     independent, professionally managed institution that could \n     provide credit support to qualified infrastructure projects \n     of regional and national significance, making transparent \n     merit-based investment decisions based on the commercial \n     viability of infrastructure projects, would catalyze the \n     participation of significant private investment capital.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate \n     investment in, and long-term financing of, economically \n     viable infrastructure projects of regional or national \n     significance in a manner that both complements existing \n     Federal, State, local, and private funding sources for these \n     projects and introduces a merit-based system for financing \n     such projects, in order to mobilize significant private \n     sector investment, create jobs, and ensure United States \n     competitiveness through an institution that limits the need \n     for ongoing Federal funding.\n\n     SEC. 244.

A bill to establish a smart card pilot program under the \nMedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand here today and \nintroduce the Medicare Common Access Card Act of 2011 with my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Ron Wyden. Every year, at least $60 billion in the \nMedicare program is attributed to waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nMedicare program. One of the fundamental steps Congress can take to \naddress this is to upgrade the beneficiary's Medicare card using secure \nsmart card technology, similar to the one already used for Department \nof Defense personnel.\n  Verifying identity through a secure smart card will protect a \nbeneficiary's personal information, prevent fraud among beneficiaries \nand providers, and legitimize Medicare claims. The Department of \nDefense has issued over 20 million secure smart cards as their ``Common \nAccess Card,'' CAC, to authenticate and verify users for access to \nprograms and facilities. To date, DoD reports that not a single Common \nAccess Card has been counterfeited. We cannot stop or prevent fraud in \nthe system until we find a way to know and verify who is authorized to \nprovide and receive benefits.\n  The Medicare Common Access Card Act of 2011 builds on the success of \nthe DoD CAC card to establish a program that simply and securely \nverifies the identity of both Medicare beneficiaries and providers. By \nimplementing well-established Common Access Card technology to protect \nthe Medicare program, we can save U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars \nwhile securing the privacy of America's seniors. I urge my colleagues \nto join us in supporting the Medicare Common Access Card Act--a common \nsense approach to reforming Medicare, protecting seniors and preventing \nmillions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5580-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5580-S5582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 261--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2011 AS \n              ``NATIONAL MEDICINE ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Manchin, and Mr. Portman) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\n                              S. Res. 261\n\n       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been \n     determined to be safe and effective when used properly;\n       Whereas the abuse of such medicines can be extremely \n     dangerous and produce serious side effects;\n       Whereas according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services Administration's 2010 National Survey on Drug Use \n     and Health, the nonmedical use of prescription drugs has \n     risen, with 2.5 percent of the population engaging in \n     nonmedical use of prescription drugs in 2008 and 2.8 percent \n     of the population engaging in such use in 2009;\n       Whereas the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health \n     illustrates that the abuse of prescription medications such \n     as pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives \n     is second only to marijuana, the most commonly abused illegal \n     drug in the United States;\n       Whereas the 2010 Monitoring the Future survey, funded by \n     the National Institutes of Health, indicates that \n     approximately 5 percent of teenagers in the United States \n     report having abused an over-the-counter cough medicine to \n     get high, and prescription and over-the-counter drugs account \n     for 8 of the 14 most frequently abused drugs by students in \n     grade 12;\n       Whereas the 2010 Monitoring the Future survey also \n     indicates that the intentional abuse of cough medicine among \n     students in grades 8, 10, and 12 is at 3.2 percent, 5.1 \n     percent, and 6.6 percent, respectively;\n       Whereas according to research from The Partnership at \n     DrugFree.org, more than one-third of teenagers mistakenly \n     believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not \n     prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using street \n     drugs;\n       Whereas the lack of understanding by teenagers and parents \n     of the potential harm of such powerful medicines makes it \n     more critical than ever to raise public awareness about the \n     dangers of the abuse of such drugs;\n       Whereas when prescription drugs are abused, such drugs are \n     most often obtained through friends and relatives;\n       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives \n     teenagers access to websites that promote the abuse of \n     medicines;\n       Whereas the designation of ``National Medicine Abuse \n     Awareness Month'' promotes the message that over-the-counter \n     and prescription medicines should be taken only as labeled or \n     prescribed, and such medicines can have serious or life-\n     threatening consequences when used to get high or in large \n     doses;\n       Whereas the designation of ``National Medicine Abuse \n     Awareness Month'' will encourage parents to educate \n     themselves about the problem of abuse of over-the-counter and \n     prescription medicines, and talk to their teens about all \n     types of substance abuse;\n       Whereas observance of ``National Medicine Abuse Awareness \n     Month'' should be encouraged at the national, State, and \n     local levels to increase awareness of the abuse of medicines;\n       Whereas educational tools, training programs, and \n     strategies have been developed by the national organization \n     that represents 5,000 anti-drug coalitions nationwide and the \n     association representing makers of over-the-counter \n     medicines, in order to help local coalitions demonstrate the \n     best ways to engage and educate parents and grandparents, \n     teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors, other \n     healthcare professionals, and retailers about the potential \n     harms of cough medicine abuse;\n       Whereas a partnership of nonprofit associations \n     specializing in raising media awareness about substance abuse \n     and organizations that represent the leading makers of over-\n     the-counter drugs have developed a nationwide prevention \n     campaign that utilizes research-based educational \n     advertisements, public relations and news media, and the \n     Internet to inform parents about the negative teen behavior \n     of intentional abuse of medicines, in order to empower \n     parents to effectively communicate with their children about \n     this dangerous trend and to take necessary steps to safeguard \n     prescription and over-the-counter medicines in their homes;

and\n       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and \n     activities to educate parents and youth about the potential \n     dangers associated with medicine abuse.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution \ndesignating October 2011 as National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month \nwith my colleagues and friends, Senators Charles Grassley, Richard \nBlumenthal, Sheldon Whitehouse, Dick Durbin, Jay Rockefeller, Joe \nManchin and Rob Portman.\n  According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, prescription \ndrug abuse is our Nation's fastest-growing drug problem. The U.S. \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's 2010 \nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the non-medical use \nof prescription drugs rose from 2.5 percent of the population in 2008 \nto 2.8 percent in 2009. The 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health \nillustrates that the abuse of prescription medications such as pain \nrelievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives is second only to \nmarijuana, the number one illegal drug of abuse in the United States.\n  Sadly the number of people who have unintentionally overdosed on \nprescription drugs is rising rapidly. The misconception that taking \nprescription drugs, even if not prescribed by a doctor is safer than \nusing street drugs is becoming more and more widespread, as seen in the \nnumber of visits by individuals to hospital emergency rooms involving \nthe misuse or abuse of pharmaceutical drugs which has doubled over the \npast five years.\n  Throughout National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month, we encourage \ncommunities to promote the message that over-the-counter and \nprescription medicines are to be taken only as labeled or prescribed \nand to encourage safe disposal of unused medications. Educating the \npublic on the dangerous consequences of taking prescription drugs to \nget high or in large doses is critical.\n  We applaud the efforts of the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, \nand local and State law enforcement agencies across the country to \ncollect potentially dangerous, expired, unused or unwanted medications \nduring their nationwide prescription drug ``take back'' campaign. We \ninvite our colleagues to join us in continuing the efforts of the DEA \nand partnering organizations to combat the misuse of psychotherapeutic \nmedications by designating October 2011 as National Medicine Abuse \nAwareness Month. This is an opportunity for Americans to reaffirm our \nnational, State and local level commitment to living healthy, drug-free \nlifestyles.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Feinstein \nin cosponsoring a resolution designating the month of October 2011 as \nNational Medicine Abuse Awareness Month. The abuse of prescription \ndrugs and cold medicine is currently the fastest growing drug abuse \ntrend in the country. According to the most recent National Survey of \nDrug Use and Health (NSDUH), more and more people are turning to using \ncontrolled substances without a doctor's prescription. The same survey \nshows that nearly one-third of all respondents who initiated drug use \nin the past year used prescription drugs. People between the ages of 12 \nand 25 are the most common group to abuse these drugs.\n  More people are dying because of this abuse. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention reports that the unintentional deaths involving \nprescription narcotics increased 117 percent from the years 2001 to \n2005. In my home State of Iowa, the Governor's Office of Drug Control \nPolicy reports that at least 40 people died from an overdose of \nprescription painkillers in 2009. This represents a sharp increase in \nthe last decade when only three people died from painkiller overdoses \nin 2000.\n  Abuse of over-the-counter, OTC, cough and cold medicines is also \nalarming. While these common cold medicines are safe and effective if \nused properly, the abuse of these medicines can also be destructive. \nAccording to a study conducted by the Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica, nearly 1 in 10 young people between the ages of 12 and 17 have \nintentionally abused cough medicine to get high off its main ingredient \ndextromethorphan. This is a problem that cannot be ignored.\n  Millions of Americans use these medicines every year to treat a \nvariety of symptoms due to injury, depression, insomnia, and the \neffects of the common cold. Many legitimate users of these drugs often \ndo not use as much medication as the prescription contains. As a \nresult, these drugs remain in the family medicine cabinet for months or \nyears because people forget about them or do not know how to properly \ndispose of them. However, many of these drugs, when not properly used \nor administered, are just as addictive and deadly as street drugs like \nmethamphetamine or cocaine.\n  According to the NSDUH, more than half of the people who abuse these \ndrugs reported that they obtained OTC\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\nand prescription drugs from a friend or relative or from the family \nmedicine cabinet. As a result, groups and organizations like the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, \nthe Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Consumer Healthcare \nProducts Association, and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America have \nbeen reaching out to communities throughout the Nation to raise \nawareness of this growing drug abuse trend and encourage communities to \ntackle the problem head on. Many community antidrug coalitions, \nincluding those in Iowa, public health officials, and law enforcement \nofficials have been holding townhalls, organizing community ``clean out \nyour medicine cabinet'' events, and holding many other events to raise \nawareness of this growing abuse in an effort to reverse this trend.\n  We can stop the growing trend of medicine abuse in its tracks, but it \nwill require all sectors of the community to join together to make it \nhappen. The National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month resolution promotes \nthe message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines must be \ntaken as directed, and when used recreationally or in large doses they \ncan have serious and deadly consequences.

Res. 256\n\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit \n     community-based health care sites that offer primary care and \n     wellness services based on the nursing model;\n       Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, \n     promotion, and optimization of health, the prevention of \n     illness, the alleviation of suffering, and the diagnosis and \n     treatment of illness;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are led by advanced \n     practice nurses and staffed by an interdisciplinary team of \n     highly qualified health care professionals;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of \n     services including treatment for acute and chronic illnesses, \n     routine physical exams, immunizations for adults and \n     children, disease screenings, health education, prenatal \n     care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics have a proven track \n     record, as the first federally funded nurse-managed health \n     clinic was created more than 35 years ago;\n       Whereas, as of June 2011, more than 250 nurse-managed \n     health clinics provided care across the United States and \n     recorded more than 2,000,000 client encounters annually;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique dual \n     role as both health care safety net access points and health \n     workforce development sites, given that the majority of \n     nurse-managed health clinics are affiliated with schools of \n     nursing and serve as clinical education sites for students \n     entering the health profession;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health \n     care safety net by expanding access to primary care and \n     chronic disease management services for vulnerable and \n     medically underserved populations in diverse rural, urban, \n     and suburban communities;\n       Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health \n     clinics experience high-patient retention and patient \n     satisfaction rates, and nurse-managed health clinic patients \n     experience higher rates of generic medication fills and lower \n     hospitalization rates when compared to similar safety net \n     providers; and\n       Whereas the use of nurse-managed health clinics offering \n     both primary care and wellness services will help meet this \n     increased demand in a cost-effective manner: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of October 2 through October 8, \n     2011, as ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';\n       (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed \n     Health Clinic Week; and\n       (3) encourages the expansion of nurse-managed health \n     clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may continue to \n     serve as health care workforce development sites for the next \n     generation of primary care providers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5584-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5584-S5585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed \nto, the preambles be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table en bloc, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nrelated statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 262\n\n  Designating the week beginning on September 12, 2011, and ending on \nSeptember 16, 2011, as ``National Health Information Technology Week'' \n to recognize the value of health information technology in improving \n                             health quality\n\n       Whereas healthcare information technology and management \n     systems have been recognized as essential tools for improving \n     patient care, ensuring patient safety, stopping duplicative \n     tests and paperwork, and reducing health care costs;\n       Whereas the Center for Information Technology Leadership \n     has estimated that the implementation of national standards \n     for interoperability and the exchange of health information \n     would save the United States approximately $77,000,000,000 in \n     expenses relating to healthcare each year;\n       Whereas Congress has made a commitment to leveraging the \n     benefits of healthcare information technology and management \n     systems, including supporting the adoption of electronic \n     health records that will help to reduce costs and improve \n     quality while ensuring the privacy of patients;\n       Whereas Congress has emphasized improving the quality and \n     safety of delivery of healthcare in the United States; and\n       Whereas since 2006, organizations across the United States \n     have united to support National Health Information Technology \n     Week to improve public awareness of the benefits of improved \n     quality and cost efficiency of the healthcare system that the \n     implementation of health information technology could \n     achieve: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on September 12, 2011, \n     and ending on September 16, 2011, as ``National Health \n     Information Technology Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the value of information technology and \n     management systems in transforming healthcare for the people \n     of the United States; and\n       (3) calls on all interested parties to promote the use of \n     information technology and management systems to transform \n     the healthcare system of the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 263\n\nDesignating the week beginning September 11, 2011, as ``National Direct \n                Support Professionals Recognition Week''\n\n       Whereas direct support professionals, direct care workers, \n     personal assistants, personal attendants, in-home support \n     workers, and paraprofessionals (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``direct support professionals'') are the primary \n     providers of publicly-funded long term supports and services \n     for millions of individuals;\n       Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, \n     trusted relationship with an individual with disabilities;\n       Whereas a direct support professional assists an individual \n     with disabilities with the most intimate needs, on a daily \n     basis;\n       Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range \n     of support, including preparation of meals, helping with \n     medications, bathing, dressing, mobility, transportation to \n     school, work, religious, and recreational activities, and \n     general daily affairs;\n       Whereas a direct support professional provides essential \n     support to help keep an individual with disabilities \n     connected to such individual's family and community;\n       Whereas direct support professionals enable individuals \n     with disabilities to live meaningful, productive lives;\n       Whereas direct support professionals are the key to \n     allowing an individual with disabilities to live successfully \n     in such individual's community, and to avoid more costly \n     institutional care;\n       Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are \n     female, and many are the sole breadwinners of their families;\n       Whereas direct support professionals work and pay taxes, \n     but many such professionals remain impoverished and are \n     eligible for the same Federal and State public assistance \n     programs on which the individuals with disabilities served by \n     such direct support professionals must depend;\n       Whereas Federal and State policies, as well as the Supreme \n     Court, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), assert the \n     right of an individual to live in the home and community of \n     the individual;\n       Whereas, in 2011, the majority of direct support \n     professionals are employed in home and community-based \n     settings and this trend is projected to increase over the \n     decade;\n       Whereas there is a documented critical and growing shortage \n     of direct support professionals in every community throughout \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to \n     leave jobs due to inadequate wages and benefits, creating \n     high turnover and vacancy rates that research demonstrates \n     adversely affects the quality of supports to individuals with \n     disabilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning September 11, 2011, as \n     ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct \n     support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals \n     with disabilities of all ages;\n       (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support \n     professionals in supporting the needs that reach beyond the \n     capacities of millions of families in the United States;\n       (4) commends direct support professionals as integral in \n     supporting the long-term support and services system of the \n     United States; and\n       (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public \n     policies of the United States depends on the dedication of \n     direct support professionals.\n\n                              S. Res. 264\n\n  Designating September 12, 2011, as ``National Day of Encouragement''\n\n       Whereas negative images, stories, and influences in the \n     day-to-day lives of the people of the United States can \n     detrimentally affect\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\n     their emotional well-being, interactions with others, and \n     general demeanor;\n       Whereas a group of teenagers participating in a leadership \n     forum at Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas, identified a \n     lack of encouragement as one of the greatest problems facing \n     young people today;\n       Whereas the youth of the United States need guidance, \n     inspiration, and reassurance to counteract this negativity \n     and to develop the qualities of character essential for \n     future leadership in the United States;\n       Whereas a National Day of Encouragement would serve as a \n     reminder to counterbalance and overcome negative influences, \n     and would also provide much-needed encouragement and support \n     to others;\n       Whereas, following the events of September 11, 2001, \n     thousands of people made sacrifices in order to bring help \n     and healing to the victims and their families, inspiring and \n     encouraging the people of the United States; and\n       Whereas the renewed feelings of unity, hope, selflessness, \n     and encouragement that began on September 12, 2001, are the \n     same feelings that the National Day of Encouragement is meant \n     to recapture and spread: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 12, 2011, as ``National Day of \n     Encouragement'';\n       (2) acknowledges the importance of encouragement and \n     positive influences in the lives of all people; and\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to encourage \n     others, whether through an act of service, a thoughtful \n     letter, or words of kindness and inspiration, and by that \n     encouragement to boost the morale of all people of the United \n     States.\n\n                              S. Res. 265\n\n        Honoring the lifetime achievements of E. Thom Rumberger\n\n       Whereas E. Thom Rumberger served in the United States \n     Marine Corps;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger earned a bachelor's degree, with \n     honors, and a J.D. from the University of Florida;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger was a founding partner of the law \n     firm Rumberger, Kirk & Caldwell, which has represented \n     multinational corporations such as American Airlines, Inc., \n     Sears, Roebuck and Co., and Toyota Motor Corporation;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger was listed in Florida Super Lawyers \n     every year from 2007 to 2010;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger was appointed Circuit Judge in the \n     18th Judicial Circuit of Florida in 1969;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger committed himself to numerous acts \n     of public service, including serving on the Federal Judicial \n     Advisory Commission of Florida and the Board of Supervisors \n     of the Spaceport Florida Authority;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger was one of the most steadfast \n     champions of the Everglades in Florida;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger served as lead counsel for the \n     Everglades Foundation since 1999;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger was instrumental in the passage of 2 \n     amendments to the Florida Constitution and of section 601 of \n     the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-\n     541; 114 Stat. 2680), known as the Comprehensive Everglades \n     Restoration Plan;\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger was instrumental in obtaining \n     several billion dollars in funding for Everglades \n     restoration; and\n       Whereas Thom Rumberger served on the Florida Governor's \n     2001 Select Task Force on Elections and the 2002 Select Task \n     Force on Election Procedures, Standards and Technology, and \n     was Chairman of the Legislature's Study Committee on Public \n     Records in 2002: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the professional success of E. \n     Thom Rumberger; and\n       (2) recognizes and honors the lifelong dedication of Thom \n     Rumberger to the protection of the Florida Everglades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/13/senate-section/article/S5585-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1549, H.R. 2832, AND H.R. 2887\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
