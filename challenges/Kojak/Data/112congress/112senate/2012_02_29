Madam President, back in 2008 then-Senator Obama said that \nunder his policies energy costs would necessarily ``skyrocket'' and \nthat he would ``have preferred a gradual adjustment to higher gasoline \nprices.'' He indicated at the time that under his policies energy \nprices were going to go up. He mentioned that he would like a more \ngradual adjustment, but when he talked about those policies, he said \nenergy costs would necessarily ``skyrocket.''\n  I think we now know which of the campaign promises the President has \nkept because we have seen energy prices skyrocket for most Americans. \nIn fact, gasoline prices have doubled\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\nunder President Obama's watch. If you look at January 2009, the price \nper gallon of gasoline was $1.85. Today it is $3.73, and some analysts \nare predicting $5-a-gallon gasoline by May of this year. Today marks \nthe 24th straight day of gasoline price increases.\n  The problem with all this is that the President rhetorically, when he \ngoes out and talks about energy, says that he wants an all-of-the-above \nstrategy. We always say that imitation is the sincerest form of \nflattery, and obviously that is a phrase many of us as Republicans have \nbeen using for some time. We talk about an all-of-the-above strategy \nthat includes oil and gas and clean coal and nuclear and biofuels and \nsolar and wind--all of those. The problem with what the President says \nis that his actions say he really means ``none of the above.'' He says \n``all of the above,'' but he means ``none of the above'' because the \nPresident has taken unprecedented steps to restrict access to America's \naffordable and reliable sources of oil and natural gas.\n  President Obama's energy policies are increasing the cost of gasoline \nin this country. His administration is pursuing new regulations that \nwill increase the cost of domestic energy production and destroy jobs. \nMore domestic production of energy in this country equals lower prices \nat the pump and more American jobs.\n  The President's statements have been punctuated or reinforced by \nmembers of his administration. I go back to 2008, Dr. Steven Chu, who \nis now President Obama's Energy Secretary, who said at the time:\n\n       Somehow, we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  Think about that: that somehow we have to figure out how to boost the \nprice of gasoline to the levels in Europe. If we look at the levels in \nEurope, I think even at that time we are talking about $9 to $10-per-\ngallon gasoline. So we have members of this very administration \nsuggesting, even back then, that part of the strategy, the energy \nstrategy, was to increase prices. Think about that, having an energy \nstrategy that is actually going to drive up the cost of energy to \npeople in this country.\n  Yesterday, in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, \nnow-Secretary Chu, who said back in 2008, ``Somehow we have to figure \nout how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,'' was \nasked: But is the overall goal to get our price of gasoline down? That \nwas asked by a Member of the House of Representatives, again, as \nSecretary Chu was testifying in front of the House Appropriations \nCommittee. Is the overall goal to get our price of gasoline down?\n  This is what the Secretary said:\n\n       No, the overall goal is to decrease our dependency on oil, \n     to build and strengthen our economy.\n\n  When we are literally doubling the price per gallon of gasoline, how \ndoes that strengthen your economy? Small businesses are faced every \nsingle day with the high costs of energy. It is an important component \nof running a business in this country. Energy is probably one of the \nmost important costs people are going to deal with. It certainly is in \nmy part of the country, where I represent an agricultural economy. \nAmerican families are looking at gasoline prices that literally have \ndoubled since this President took office. Yet here is the Secretary of \nEnergy, the very guy who was to guide energy policy in this country, in \nfront of a House committee as recently as yesterday, when asked about \nthe overall goal, whether the overall goal is to get the price of \ngasoline down, he said no. It squares perfectly with what he said 4 \nyears ago when he indicated that we need to figure out how to somehow \nboost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n  That is an amazing statement. I think it is almost incomprehensible \nto the American people in terms of what it means to their daily lives \nbecause they are the people who ultimately, in their pocketbooks, have \nto deal with the consequences of bad policies--bad policies that raise \nthe price of energy and make it more difficult for them to balance \ntheir budgets and to be able to continue to enjoy the standard of \nliving and quality of life in this country.\n  Yesterday Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar defended the Obama \nadministration's failure of an energy policy when testifying before the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He said:\n\n       We have an energy strategy and a policy that we have been \n     working on from day one, and we believe it continues to show \n     good results.\n\n  Think about that.\n\n       We have an energy strategy and a policy that we have been \n     working on from day one, and we believe it continues to show \n     good results.\n\n  I don't know how you can argue that doubling the price for a gallon \nof gasoline is a good result. And literally taking areas out of \nproduction in this country that could be yielding energy, that would \nhelp reduce the dependence we have on foreign sources of energy, drive \ndown the price at the pump and create American jobs is a good result? I \ndon't know how you can argue that what has happened during this \nadministration's time in office has been anything but disastrous for \nthe American people, for American business, and for the continued \ndependency we have on foreign sources of energy.\n  President Obama rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline which would have \ncreated 20,000 shovel-ready jobs and delivered up to 830,000 barrels of \noil per day from Canada, America's largest trading partner.\n  President Obama has reduced the number of offshore leases by half. \nPresident Obama has blocked exploration and production on 97 percent of \noffshore areas; 97 percent of those areas that could be useful in \nhelping meet America's energy needs have been put off limits by this \nPresident, by his policies that blocked exploration and production in \nthose very areas.\n  Under the Obama administration, new permits to drill in Federal \nonshore and offshore areas have declined by 40 to 50 percent.\n  That is the President's record on energy. How his Secretary of the \nInterior can say their energy strategy shows good results is beyond me. \nIt is completely at odds with the reality and with the facts.\n  The Obama administration is implementing a national backdoor energy \ntax through unprecedented regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under \nthe Clean Air Act, specifically targeting the oil and gas industry with \nnew regulations, such as new source performance standards, Boiler MACT, \nand tier 3 gasoline standards that could drive up the cost of gasoline \nproduction by 25 cents, raise the refining industry's operating costs \nby $5 to $7 billion annually, lead to a 7- to 14-percent reduction in \ngasoline supplies from U.S. refiners, and force as many as seven U.S. \nrefineries to shut down. That is the tier 3 gasoline standard the Obama \nadministration is proposing. Time after time, opportunity after \nopportunity is missed.\n  This President continues to put policies in place that make it more \ndifficult and more expensive to create jobs and raises the cost of \ndoing business by raising the cost of energy and raising the costs that \nevery American consumer has to deal with in the form of higher gasoline \nprices.\n  When he says he supports an ``all-of-the-above'' energy plan, his \npolicies tell a very different story because his policies have \ndiscouraged increased production of oil, and high oil costs are indeed \na key driver of gasoline costs. Republicans support a real all-of-the-\nabove strategy, and that includes production in all sources of energy. \nIt includes support of projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline that \nwill strengthen America's energy security, and we have to have a robust \nenergy plan focused on increasing those areas of domestic production \nthat will send a strong signal to energy markets around the world to \nmake America less vulnerable to skyrocketing gasoline prices.\n  It is interesting the response on Capitol Hill to this spike in \ngasoline prices we have seen over the past several days is along these \nlines. There was a letter from Senator Schumer to Secretary Clinton a \ncouple of days ago in which he talked about the skyrocketing fuel \nprices and directly linked those to the global energy market but \nsuggested that the solution should be urging the State Department to \nwork with the Government of Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production \nto its actual capacity of 12.5 million barrels to help stabilize \nmarkets.\n\n  Instead of developing American resources and actually doing something\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\nthat would lessen the dependence we have on these foreign sources of \nenergy, the solution proposed by some of our colleagues--at least some \nof our Democratic colleagues--is to have Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton go to the Saudis, hat in hand, and beg them to increase daily \nproduction by 2.5 million barrels, ironically at the very time they are \nblocking policies that would help generate that same 2.5 million \nbarrels a day right here in the United States and stabilize world \nmarkets.\n  In fact, if we look at many of these areas that are off limits to \nproduction today--the North Slope of Alaska, the Atlantic Outer \nContinental Shelf, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Outer \nContinental Shelf, the Keystone XL Pipeline--if we add up the amount of \nproduction that will bring to our country, it adds up to 4.5 million \nbarrels a day, 4.5 million barrels per day of additional energy \nproduction that we could be benefiting from and enjoying at a time when \nwe are seeing gas prices literally double.\n  Of course, in accordance with the President's promise when he was \nrunning for office that prices were going to skyrocket, it should not \ncome as any surprise. But these energy policies implemented by this \nadministration have literally created a situation where we are now \nhaving to go and ask the Saudis: Please, would you please give us an \nadditional 2.5 million barrels of oil a day instead of opening the \nareas that could generate up to 4.5 million barrels per day if we would \nsimply develop the resources we have in this country and quit blocking \nthe access to these important energy resources.\n  This is a fairly straightforward issue for the American people, No. \n1, because it hits very squarely in their daily lives. The pocketbook \nissues, the bread-and-butter issues, the issues people discuss around \ntheir tables every day are the issues that I think are most important \nto America right now, particularly with a down economy and high \nunemployment rates. Certainly, what we are seeing in terms of energy \ncosts makes that situation worse for American families. In fact, the \npayroll tax holiday which was extended a couple of weeks ago will \nactually be eaten up, any savings that might be achieved to the \nAmerican family's pocketbook will literally be eaten up simply by \npaying the higher costs of gasoline that are going to be imposed on \nevery American family as a result of these higher prices, again, that \nsimply are the result of us not having enough supply.\n  This is a market situation. Gasoline is a global commodity. When we \nhave more supply, it brings the price down. When we have more domestic \nproduction, it means two things: it means lower prices at the pump for \nAmerican consumers, and it means more jobs for American workers. \nBlocking access to American sources of energy production means higher \nprices at the pump for American consumers and fewer jobs for American \nworkers. It is that straightforward. It is that simple.\n  The American people understand that. That is why the policies this \nadministration is pursuing--and, clearly, from the statements that are \nbeing made by these members of the President's administration, from \nSecretary Chu to Secretary Salazar to the President himself--suggest, \nif you can believe this--unfathomable, I am sure, to many Americans--\nthat it is intentional to actually push those prices higher.\n  That is what Secretary Chu said back in 2008: We need to boost our \nprices to the level they are seeing in places such as Europe.\n  I think the American people believe differently about that. I believe \nthey deserve better. They want policies that lower the cost of energy \nand make America less dependent upon dangerous foreign regimes. I know \nmany of us--Republicans in the Senate--are ready to go to work putting \nthose policies in place if the President and his allies in the Senate \nwill give us that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1101-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from South Dakota and follow up in that regard.\n  Yesterday I came to the Senate floor and explained how the \nPresident's ideological outlook and the policies that have grown out of \nit will only continue to drive up the cost of gasoline at the pump. \nAfter I spoke, the President's Energy Secretary seemed to confirm it \nwhen he told a congressional panel that the Department of Energy isn't \nworking to drive down the price of gas. They are working to wean us off \nof it altogether, and high gas prices add urgency to those efforts.\n  In other words, high gas prices actually help the administration \nachieve what it is trying to achieve. What I suggested yesterday and \nwhat I am suggesting again this morning is that we look at statements \nsuch as this and many others from the President and some of his top \nadvisers in the past, along with the President's actual policies when \nit comes to assessing the current situation at the pump--not the \nspeeches he gives when he starts feeling the political heat for it \nbecause he can't have it both ways.\n  Once again, here are the facts. The President continues to limit off-\nshore areas to energy production and is granting fewer leases on public \nland for oil drilling. At the same time, he has encouraged other \ncountries such as Brazil to move forward with their off-shore drilling \nprojects. The Obama administration continues to impose burdensome \nregulations on the domestic energy sector that will further drive up \nthe cost of gasoline for the consumer. He is proposing raising taxes on \nthe energy sector, a move that the Congressional Research Service has \nsaid would drive up costs.\n  As we all know, he flatly rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline, a \npotentially game-changing domestic energy project that promises not \nonly greater independence from Middle Eastern oil but tens of thousands \nof private sector jobs.\n  All of these policies help drive up the cost of gasoline and increase \nour dependence on foreign sources of oil, but perhaps none is as \nemblematic of the President's simplistic and punitive approach to \nenergy policy as the last one. The President simply cannot claim to \nsupport a comprehensive approach to energy while at the same time \nstanding in the way of the Keystone Pipeline. It doesn't make any \nsense. It is either one or the other.\n  Most Americans understand that. That is why many of us were pleased \nwhen the company that is responsible for building Keystone said it \nplans to move forward with the southern portion of the pipeline, \ndespite the administration's decision to block the northern portion to \nalleviate a bottleneck in Cushing, OK. They are just not going to let \nthis administration punish them or the rest of those who want to build \nthis pipeline.\n  Asked about the impact of delays, the company's President and CEO \nsaid they were partly to blame for the recent spike in gas prices, \nwhich is presumably why the White House came out in support of the \nmove. But the hypocrisy is quite stunning.\n  How could a White House that is single-handedly blocking one-half of \nthe pipeline to appease an extreme segment of its political base now \nclaim to support the southern half of the same pipeline? Well, the \nshort answer is they don't have the authority to block the southern \nhalf, so they think that by claiming to support it, then they can get \ncredit from people for being on both sides of the issue. But if \nKeystone is good for America and good for jobs, the President should \njust come out and support the whole pipeline. With gas prices literally \nskyrocketing and growing turmoil in the Middle East, we can't afford \nanother year of foot-dragging. It is time for the President to move \nquickly to approve the entire Keystone XL Pipeline. This is literally a \nno-brainer.\n\n  An overwhelming majority of Americans support the Keystone XL \nPipeline in its entirety. The President should listen to them. Instead \nof lecturing the American people about his idea of fairness, he should \nspend a little more time thinking about what most Americans think is \nfair. Most Americans don't think it is particularly fair that the \nPresident of the United States is blocking them from tapping into our\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\nnatural resources even as he uses their tax dollars to prop up failing \nsolar companies like Solyndra and to hand out bonuses to the executives \nwho drive them literally into the ground. Most Americans don't think it \nis fair that their President would want to drive up the cost of \ngasoline they need to get around every day and build their families and \ntheir businesses and their lives even as he is directing more and more \nof their money to risky solar schemes in his own administration--risky \nsolar schemes his own administration says sometimes fail.\n  Well, the American people don't ask for much, but they do expect to \nbe able to go out there every day and try to build a future for \nthemselves and their families without their own President throwing sand \nin the gears. And whether it is high gas prices or government \nregulations or higher debt, the American people are tired of bearing \nthe burden so this President can build an economy in which Washington \ncalls all the shots. Yes, Americans want lower gas prices, and, yes, \nthis President's policies are hurting. But let's be clear about \nsomething: This debate is not just about gas prices, it is about a \nPresident who wants to impose a definition of ``fairness'' on the \nAmerican people, yet most of them simply do not accept.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to finish my remarks and that I be granted enough time to do \nso.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the first 3 years of President Obama's \nadministration were a frenzy of activity. He pushed the stimulus, he \nspent over a year pursuing his health care law, and he forced through \nDodd-Frank, imposing historic regulations on the banking industry. Even \nThe Economist magazine has found fault with that. Yet, at a time when \nthe Nation was in economic free fall, the President chose an agenda of \nmore regulation and higher taxes.\n  The President ignored private sector job creation and the primacy of \neconomic growth, and nowhere was this more evident than with respect to \nenergy policy. President Obama has failed entirely to address one of \nthe greatest obstacles to economic growth; that is, high energy prices.\n  Today he claims he is for an all-of-the-above approach to energy. All \nof a sudden, facing $5-a-gallon gasoline, weak job creation, and a \nPresidential election, he claims to have found religion on energy \nproduction. But whether we look at oil, natural gas, or the Keystone \nPipeline, the American people are not buying this conversion story, and \nI certainly agree with our distinguished minority leader and his \ncomments here this morning.\n  This failure by the President to tackle our energy needs is a \nnational crisis for which the American people should hold him \naccountable. Yet his inability to put jobs ahead of his radical and \nunrepresentative environmental base has particular implications for the \ncitizens of my State of Utah as well. Days after announcing in his \nState of the Union an ``all-of-the-above strategy that develops every \navailable source of American energy,'' the administration cut access to \nFederal lands in the West for oil shale development by 75 percent and \nproposed a 50 percent royalty hike on domestic energy production on \npublic lands.\n  Whether it is closing off more Federal lands to American energy \nproduction or saying no to the Keystone Pipeline, this White House has \nshown it is more focused on appeasing its extremist ideological allies \nthan putting forward an energy policy that works for Utahans and \nAmericans everywhere. With gas prices and home heating costs on the \nrise, the American people deserve action, not more campaign speeches--\nand I might add, from the most anti-American energy administration in \nour Nation's history.\n  When it comes to energy policy, the President is a man divided. On \nalmost all economic policy, his answer is, tax the rich more. Taxing \nthe rich more is his go-to option for reducing the deficit, paying for \nObamacare, and paying for new roads and bridges. Higher taxes are a \nmatter of fundamental fairness, the President claims, but when it comes \nto gas prices, the President sides with the 1 percent.\n  The folks who would benefit most from increased energy production are \nblue-collar workers and middle-class families. High energy prices hit \nthe wallets of lower income Americans the hardest. Middle-class \nAmericans are more likely to have longer commutes and bigger cars than \nwealthy urban citizens. The passthrough cost of high fuel prices hits \nthe grocery budgets of all Americans. The jobs that never materialize \ndue to the failure to develop energy resources undermines every blue-\ncollar American.\n  The President claims to be for fairness and an egalitarian economic \npolicy, but his energy policy is incredibly regressive, putting the \nburden of his environmental agenda on the backs of the middle class. \nThe situation got no better with the budget the President recently \nsubmitted or with this long-delayed proposal for business tax reform.\n  Rather than advance an energy agenda that would spur production, \nlower prices, and create jobs, the President continues to advocate for \nincreased taxes on oil and gas production in the United States.\n  On March 3 of last year, the Congressional Research Service concluded \nthat the President's proposals would ``make oil and natural gas more \nexpensive for U.S. consumers and likely increase foreign dependence.'' \nThe same holds true today. These decisions are based in political \nappeals to his elitist base rather than any interest in developing \nsound energy policy. For example, in his budget the President cites the \nfollowing as his reason for repealing tax incentives for oil and gas \nproduction:\n\n       Special tax treatment of working interests in oil and gas \n     properties . . . distorts markets by encouraging more \n     investment in the oil and gas industry than would occur under \n     a neutral system.\n\n  Give me a break. The reason the President opposes current tax policy \nfor oil and gas is because he opposes distorting markets?\n  The Energy Information Administration reports that in fiscal year \n2010, $14.7 billion in energy-specific subsidies went to advance \nrenewable energy compared to $4.2 billion in energy-related subsidies \nthat went to advance fossil fuels. In other words, there are three \ntimes as many government subsidies going to renewable energy as there \nare going to oil, gas, and coal combined. Now, that is what you call \ndistorting the market.\n  Contrary to the President's presentation, these are not tax loopholes \nthat need to be closed. The term ``tax loophole'' implies that a tax \nincentive is susceptible to an exploitation of an unintended benefit. \nWhile the Tax Code has some tax loopholes that we must clearly \neliminate, the tax expenditures that benefit oil and gas companies were \nintended to incentivize a particular activity or behavior. For \ninstance, section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code includes an \nincentive for the domestic production of oil and gas. This is no \nloophole. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, understands that without \nthis incentive, we could see an enormous reduction in employment, and \nit is simply inaccurate to state that this incentive adds little to our \neconomic or energy security.\n\n  The American people need to understand that repeal of this policy \nwill only increase our dependence on foreign-produced oil. But this \ndoes not seem to bother the President one bit. On March 20 of last \nyear, the President told a group of political and business leaders in \nBrazil that we ``want to help with technology and support to develop \nthese oil reserves safely, and when you're ready to start selling, we \nwant to be one of your best customers.''\n  As hard as it is to believe, the administration does not even seem to \nshare the desire of the American people for lower energy prices. The \nPresident's Secretary of Energy, Secretary Steven Chu, stated: ``We \nhave to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in \nEurope.'' Gas prices in Europe are $8 to $10 a gallon, and that is \nwhere the administration and environmental activists want gas prices to \nbe for Americans. Even President Obama stated in 2008 that he would \nprefer a gradual adjustment to high gasoline prices, just maybe not a \nquick spike.\n  The President claims he is for an all-of-the-above energy policy so \nlong as it\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\ndoes not include offshore drilling, drilling on our western lands, the \ndevelopment of energy in Alaska, and the Keystone Pipeline. My reading \nof his all-of-the-above approach is some-of-the-above and only those \nthat are poll-tested and approved by environmental activists.\n  This is terrible tax policy, it is terrible energy policy, and it is \nterrible economic policy. Unfortunately, it is all we have from this \nadministration.\n  The reality is that our country relies upon oil and gas because it is \ndependable, abundant, affordable, and domestic. Raising taxes on \nAmerican companies that produce oil and gas will be felt by all \nAmericans not only at the pump but also through a decrease in dividends \nto many middle-class shareholders. This is the wrong prescription for \nour ailing economy.\n  For this administration, the goal remains not lower energy prices but \nthe liberal dream of getting America off of oil. Just the other day, \nthe President's Secretary of Energy acknowledged that the overall goal \nof his Department is not to lower the cost of traditional energy but to \ndecrease dependency on oil.\n  For what it is worth, this commitment to restricting domestic \nproduction is a policy that divides my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. They know the President is putting the preferred lifestyle \npolicies of wealthy urbanites ahead of the needs of blue-collar and \nunion workers and middle-class Americans. They know the decision by the \nPresident to kill the Keystone Pipeline put environmental interest \ngroups ahead of the needs of workers, commuters, and families.\n  President Obama has traded in the hardhat-and-lunch-bucket heritage \nof the Democratic Party for a hipster fedora and a double-skim latte. \nHe has put liberal environmental dreams ahead of the economic reality \nthat working-class Americans have been struggling with for years. The \nNation's unemployment rate has been above 8 percent for 36 straight \nmonths. The average duration of unemployment was 40.1 weeks in January \n2012. Yet the President and his allies in the Senate have helped to \nkill projects that would undeniably lead to the creation of hundreds of \nthousands of high-paying American jobs.\n  Gas prices have now risen for 20 straight days. Gas prices are now up \n30 cents over the last month and 18 cents in the past 2 weeks. We are \ncruising toward $5-a-gallon gas, and the President resists any long-\nterm solutions to these rising energy prices.\n  The American people deserve better than this. They have waited 3 long \nyears for a serious energy agenda from this President, and if he does \nnot address this energy crisis soon, in less than a year the American \npeople will be looking to another President to promote an energy \nprogram that will finally create jobs and lower the cost of energy for \nall Americans. Look, we have energy within our country's boundaries. We \nhave energy that is just begging to be developed, that would help us to \nmake it through these trying times. We need the lowest cost energy we \ncan possibly have, and we are not going to get it under this President. \nWe are not going to get it under this administration. I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle wake up and realize we are \nputting our country right down the drain.\n\n  I saw, sometime over the last couple of weeks, The Economist \nmagazine. The front page of that magazine criticizes us for the \noverregulatory nature of our economy and of our government. We are \nmaking it so it is almost impossible for businesses to expand and \ncreate high-paid jobs.\n  We can solve our own energy needs. We have between 800 billion and \n1.6 trillion barrels of recoverable oil in oil shale in Utah, Colorado, \nand Wyoming alone. We have billions of barrels of oil in ANWR up in \nAlaska and billions of barrels of oil at other sites in Alaska. \nFortunately, we found oil in the Bakken claim in North Dakota, but the \nonly reason we have been able to drill there is because it is private \nland. Fortunately, we found some places down in Texas, but again they \nare on private land. We can't get the permits and the ability to drill \non public land or even develop oil shale on public land. Yes, it would \ncost us more per barrel to develop that oil, but it would also bring \ndown the intense problems we have in trying to find enough oil and gas \nto keep our country moving ahead as the greatest country in the world. \nWe have to simply get this administration to wake up and realize there \nare many ways we can solve our energy problems--many ways.\n  We are also awash in natural gas. A lot of people have been saying we \nneed to develop our natural gas. We need to develop more of our energy \nresources than we are developing now. And we can do it. America can do \nit if we get the government off the backs of those who produce energy. \nI hope and pray that Democrats and Republicans alike will lock arms, \nget together, and solve the problems facing our country, regardless of \nthis President, who doesn't seem to know what to do or how to do it.\n  This is a crucial time for our country. There is no excuse for us to \nbe in the mess we are in. But unfortunately, we are here because of the \npoor energy policies of this administration.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1103-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1103-S1104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         STOCK OPTION LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there has been a great deal of \nconversation recently about the need to close tax loopholes. This is a \nwelcome development for those of us who have gone after these loopholes \nfor years. It is particularly timely as the public is focusing more and \nmore on how tax loopholes distort economic incentives and often benefit \nthe wealthiest among us at the expense of most U.S. taxpayers.\n  Last week, President Obama released a framework for business tax \nreform that took aim at many corporate tax loopholes. I look forward to \nworking with the administration and with our colleagues in the Senate \nto make real reform a reality--reform that brings greater fairness to \nthe Tax Code, eliminates incentives for moving jobs and assets \noverseas, restores revenue lost to unjustified tax loopholes, and helps \nus reduce the deficit without damaging vital programs for education, \ntransportation, health care, and national security.\n  One recent and very public announcement illustrates dramatically our \nTax Code's distortions and the need for reform. At the center of this \nstory is Facebook and its founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Mr. \nZuckerberg and his company have become a remarkable American business \nsuccess story. As part of that success, Facebook is in the process of \nmaking its initial public offering of stock. The public documents that \nFacebook is required to file as part of that offering tell another \ncompelling story about one of our Tax Code's unjustified corporate \nloopholes.\n  According to its filings, when Facebook goes public, Mr. Zuckerberg \nplans to exercise options to purchase 120 million shares of stock for 6 \ncents a share. Obviously, Mr. Zuckerberg's shares are going to be worth \na great deal more than 6 cents each--a total of about $7 million. They \nwill apparently be worth in the neighborhood of $5 billion.\n  Here is where the tax loophole comes in. Under current law, Facebook \ncan, perfectly legally, tell investors and the public and regulators \nthat the stock options he received cost the company a mere 6 cents a \nshare. That is the expense shown on the company's books. But the \ncompany can also, perfectly legally, later on file a tax return \nclaiming that those same options cost the company something close to \nwhat the shares actually sell for later on--perhaps $40 a share. The \ncompany can take a tax deduction for that far larger amount. So the \nbooks show a highly profitable company--profitable, in part, because of \nthe relatively small expense the company shows on its books for the \nstock options it grants to its employees--but when it comes time to pay \ntaxes, to pay Uncle Sam, the loophole in the Tax Code allows the \ncompany to take a tax deduction for a far larger expense than they have \nshown on their books.\n  In addition, Facebook is allowed by law to carry back the so-called \nloss arising from this deduction for 2 years into the past, which means \nit can claim a tax refund for the income tax it has paid over the past \n2 years--a refund that the company estimates at $\\1/2\\ billion. So \ninstead of paying taxes to the Treasury, this profitable company will \nclaim a hefty refund on the taxes already paid.\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\n  But that is not all. The company says it will, as allowed by law, \nalso carry forward the so-called losses arising from this tax deduction \nfor over 20 years into the future, thereby reducing any taxes that it \nowes in the years ahead. Over the years, this loophole could give a tax \nbreak of up to $3 billion. The end result is that a profitable U.S. \ncorporation--a success story--could end up paying no taxes at all for \nyears, even decades.\n\n  I emphasize that Facebook's actions are within the law. As with so \nmuch of our Tax Code, it is not the law-breaking that shocks the \nconscience, it is the stuff that is perfectly legal. For years, my \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations has identified this stock \noption loophole and tried to explain its cost, its unfairness, and why \nit should be closed. Facebook's $3 billion tax break brings the issue \ninto sharp focus.\n  Again, the stock option loophole allows corporations to compensate \ntheir executives with stock options, report a specific stock option \nexpense to their shareholders, and then later take a tax deduction for \ntypically a much higher amount. Stock option grants are the only kind \nof compensation where the Tax Code allows companies to claim a higher \nexpense for tax purposes than it shows on its books. Our subcommittee \nfound that the difference between what U.S. corporations tell the \npublic and what they told the IRS was as much as $61 billion in 1 year.\n  Facebook's use of this loophole is the most pointed illustration yet \nof the cost of this loophole. It is difficult to get our minds around a \n$3 billion tax break for a single corporation. Just how big is it? \nWell, consider this: In 2009, the most recent year for which IRS data \nis available, taxpayers from 11 States in our Union sent less than $3 \nbillion in individual income tax revenue to the Treasury. How does this \nmake any sense? After all, American taxpayers are going to have to make \nup for what Facebook's tax deduction costs the Treasury. That $3 \nbillion is either going to come out of the pockets of American families \nnow or it will add to the deficit they are going to have to pay for \nlater.\n  What could our Nation do with the $3 billion it will lose when \nFacebook exploits the stock option loophole? We could reduce the \nFederal deficit or we could pay for programs that protect our seniors, \nput cops on the beat or teachers in classrooms. The $3 billion Facebook \nwill get in tax deductions would more than triple the budget of the \nSmall Business Administration, which seeks to help American \nentrepreneurs create jobs and grow the economy. Three billion dollars \nwould pay for the Pentagon's budget for housing our military families \nfor nearly 2 full years. It would pay the budget of the National \nInstitute of Science and Technology for 4 full years. It would more \nthan triple what we plan to spend helping homeless veterans next year. \nIt would pay 6 times over for the 24 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles \nthe Air Force plans to buy next year.\n  Some are going to argue that Facebook's tax break is offset by the \nfact that Mr. Zuckerberg himself, as well as the other executives who \nare receiving stock options, will pay taxes as individuals. As various \nnews reports indicate, Mr. Zuckerberg will face a substantial tax bill \non the $5 billion in compensation he is about to receive--perhaps in \nthe neighborhood of a $2 billion tax bill. But it is unlikely that the \nindividual taxes Mr. Zuckerberg pays will offset the tax revenues lost \nto this loophole. What the Treasury receives from Mr. Zuckerberg on the \none hand, it will return, and then some, to his company with the other \nhand. We also should remember that Mr. Zuckerberg's financial future is \nclosely tied to that of his company. The value of the options and his \nretained interest make that clear. To the extent that his corporation \nbenefits--and as I have shown, Facebook will benefit handsomely from \nthe use of this loophole--Mr. Zuckerberg stands to benefit as well. Put \nsimply, some of that big tax bill he faces right now will come back to \nhim through the corporation he will still own a huge part of and will \ncontrol.\n  Our tax system is built on the principle that businesses as well as \nindividuals ought to help pay our Nation's bills. Corporations impose \nplenty of costs on society, from environmental disasters, financial \nbailouts, product recalls, and more. Businesses also want and need \ngovernment services, including efficient transportation systems, patent \nprotections, even Federal loan guarantees. Paying those costs is why we \nhave a corporate income tax to begin with. Both businesses and \nindividuals are required by law to contribute, and should do so, to \nmeet their civic obligations and to pay their fair share. There is no \nreason Facebook and the other corporations that use this tax loophole \nshould continue to receive these windfall tax deductions.\n  Senator Conrad and I earlier this month introduced S. 2075, the Cut \nUnjustified Tax Loopholes Act, or CUT Loopholes Act. This bill, similar \nto the legislation I have introduced in the past few Congresses, would \nclose this loophole. Under our bill, corporations would no longer be \nallowed to claim tax deductions for options that are larger than the \nexpense they report to their shareholders and to people considering \nbuying their stock. It would also subject stock options to the same $1 \nmillion cap on deductions for executive compensation that now applies \nto other forms of compensation. At the same time--and this is important \nto know--our bill would leave unchanged the way the law applies to \nindividuals who receive stock options, and it would leave unchanged \nincentive stock options that are offered by startup companies. We would \nnot affect that.\n  The stock option loophole should have been closed long before Mr. \nZuckerberg's extraordinarily lucrative options became public. But \nsurely the case of Facebook illustrates to the Senate, to the Congress, \nand to the American people that we must close this loophole.\n  I have spoken today about one corporate tax loophole, but there are \nmany more. The momentum has never been stronger for tax reform that \nbrings more fairness to the Tax Code, restores revenue lost to \nunjustified tax loopholes, reduces the deficit, and protects important \npriorities. I look forward to working with our colleagues and with the \nadministration to turn that momentum into real reform.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss the amendment \nto the surface transportation bill offered by my friend and colleague \nfrom Missouri, Senator Blunt.\n  For reasons beyond me, the other side has demanded a vote on birth \ncontrol. It seems they wish to debate whether we should take away \naccess to contraception for millions of women.\n  Cooler heads are not prevailing on the other side of the aisle these \ndays. There are some wiser voices on their side who do seem to regret \nthey are having this debate, but they are the minority.\n  Just this morning, the senior Senator from Alaska is quoted in the \nNew York Times expressing exacerbation. Of her party's push to roll \nback access to contraception, she says:\n\n       I don't know where we are going with this issue.\n\n  I sympathize with the frustration shown by my friend from Alaska. \nThere is no good answer about where the other side is going with this \nissue--except, perhaps, back to the 19th century.\n  This whole debate is an anachronism. Our country progressed beyond \nthe issue of whether to allow birth control a long time ago. Yet here \nwe are in 2012 and some in the Republican Party suddenly want to turn \nback the clock and take away contraception from millions of women.\n  Make no mistake, that is what this debate is about, as backward as it \nis. I keep hearing this measure being referred to as the Blunt \namendment, named after its sponsor, my friend, the Senator from \nMissouri. We should, instead, call it for what it will be: an attempt \nto take away for millions of women birth control.\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\n  If this amendment passes, it would ban contraception coverage for any \nwoman in America whose boss has a personal objection to it. The measure \nwould force women to surrender control of their own health decisions to \ntheir bosses. That concept is not merely quaint or old-fashioned, it is \ndangerous, and it is wrong.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, some 20 \nmillion American women could be cut off from health services by this \nproposal. The other side does not want the debate framed in those terms \nbecause they know it makes them look silly. So instead, they are \nspinning.\n  In the last week, there have been op-eds penned by the minority \nleader, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, and the junior Senator \nfrom Missouri, all seeking to frame this as about protecting religious \nliberty.\n  The debate may have been about religious liberty for a time, but now \nsome on the other side have overplayed their hand. They may have \nstarted seeking protections for religious-affiliated employers, but now \nthey sense a ripe time to make headway on a far-right social agenda.\n  The debate reminds me of a famous quote that our former colleague \nDale Bumpers used to invoke. It was a quote by H.L. Mencken, who said:\n\n       When someone says it's not about the money, it's usually \n     about the money.\n\n  Well, when the other side tries so hard to claim this is not a debate \nabout contraception, that is how you know this debate is precisely \nabout contraception.\n  The amendment is not about religious liberty. The truth is religious \ninstitutions have always been exempt under the law from certain \ncoverage requirements. Under the President's compromise, an even larger \nset of employers--those with a religious affiliation such as certain \nhospitals and schools--also will not have to pay for contraception \ncoverage. It will, instead, be covered by the insurance company. The \nPresident's compromise has been widely embraced, including by many of \nthe same church-affiliated organizations that expressed concern \noriginally.\n  The administration is working on a solution for self-insured \nemployers. I am confident they will find a way that works for everyone.\n  The amendment being voted on tomorrow is not responsive to any real \nconcerns about religious freedom. Its reach extends far beyond church \norganizations that legitimately seek considerations based on \nconscience. It wants to let any employer in the country decide to cut \noff services for any reason whatsoever.\n  Under the guise of religious liberty, some on the hard right are \ntrying to accomplish a political goal: banning contraception more \nwidely. This is a goal the other side has been pursuing for a while now \nat the State level. At the heart of many of the personhood proposals \nbeing advanced in State legislatures is an attempt to cut off women's \naccess to certain forms of contraception.\n  Some Republicans in the Senate now seem to want to nationalize this \nfringe debate over whether contraception should be allowed. It is not a \npolitical winner. Even the House Republicans seem to have the good \nsense not to bring up the amendment on the floor of their Chamber. But \nhere the other side is pushing ahead with the ban.\n  It is so far-reaching, it has stirred a wide collection of health \norganizations to speak out against it. These are groups such as the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, the March of Dimes, and Easter Seals. These are \ngroups with no agenda other than protecting the health of those they \nserve.\n  In a letter these groups sent earlier this week, they pointed out the \nwide variety of services that an employer could decline to provide, \nsuch as child vaccinations and mammograms.\n  It is true that all these services and more are threatened by this \namendment. But are Republicans against child vaccinations and \nmammograms? I doubt it. So let's admit what this debate is really about \nand what Republicans want to take away from millions of American women. \nIt is contraception. We should call this debate and this amendment for \nwhat it will be for millions of women whose boss may have a personal \nobjection: This is a contraception ban.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 200th \nanniversary of the War of 1812 and the ``Star Spangled Banner,'' and to \nhonor the memory of all Americans who came together in America's \n``Second War of Independence,'' particularly those fallen heroes who \ngave their lives during the conflict.\n  It is important Americans recognize the service and sacrifice of all \nthose who have worn the uniform of this Nation. On behalf of the \nSenate, I thank the millions of brave men and women who have served in \nthe U.S. Armed Forces and risked their lives for our Nation, including \nduring the War of 1812.\n  The War of 1812 confirmed America's independence from Great Britain \nin the eyes of the world. Before the war, the British had been \nroutinely imposing on American sovereignty. They had impressed American \nmerchant seamen into the British Royal Navy, enforced illegal and \nunfair trade rules with the United States, and allegedly offered \nassistance to American Indian tribes that were attacking frontier \nsettlements. In response, the United States declared war on Great \nBritain to protest these violations of free trade, sailors' rights, and \nsanctioning raids on American land.\n  After 2\\1/2\\ years of conflict, the British Navy sailed up the heart \nof the Chesapeake Bay with combined military and naval forces, and in \nAugust 1814 attacked Washington, DC, burning to the ground the U.S. \nCapitol, the White House, and much of the rest of our capital city. \nLess than 3 weeks later, the British set their eyes upon the next \nprize: the strategic port city of Baltimore, MD.\n  American forces, primarily made up of citizens of Baltimore, prepared \nBaltimore City's defenses. Marylanders fought the British army during \nthe Battle of North Point and helped repulse the British Navy from Fort \nMcHenry during the now infamous Battle of Baltimore. I want to point \nout that the American forces during the Battle of North Point were \nvolunteer militia. In the battle, just 250 members of the 5th Brigade \nof the Maryland Militia, heavily outnumbered by the highly trained \nBritish infantry, managed to delay the British forces long enough for \n10,000 reinforcements to arrive, preventing a land attack against \nBaltimore.\n  The British assault also failed at sea. Following 25 hours of intense \nBritish naval bombardment at Fort McHenry, the American defenders \nrefused to yield, and the British were forced to depart. During the \nbombardment, an American lawyer, Francis Scott Key, who was being held \nonboard an American flag-of-truce vessel in Baltimore Harbor, beheld, \nby the dawn's early light, the American flag still flying atop Fort \nMcHenry.\n  Key realized then that the Americans had survived the battle and \nstopped the enemy advance. Moved by the sight of the American flag \nflying over Fort McHenry, he composed the poem called ``The Defense of \nFort McHenry,'' which was later set to music, becoming ``The Star \nSpangled Banner'' that officially became the National Anthem on March \n3, 1931. We will be celebrating this weekend the 82nd anniversary of \nthe ``Star Spangled Banner'' becoming the official national anthem of \nour country. The flag that flew over Fort McHenry during that fateful \nnight is now a national treasure on display at the Smithsonian \nInstitution--an inspiration to all Americans--a very short distance \nfrom where we are today.\n  The War of 1812 confirmed the legitimacy of the Revolution and served \nas a critical test for the U.S. Constitution and our newly established \ndemocratic government. Our young Nation battled against the largest, \nmost powerful military on Earth at the time and emerged with an \nenhanced standing among the countries of the world. A new generation of \nAmericans too young to remember the victory of the Revolutionary War \nwere inspired by Francis Scott Key's poem to take pride in our Nation's \nflag, which embodies\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\nour universal feelings of patriotism and courage.\n  As a Marylander, I am proud of the role my State played in the War of \n1812, and I have been involved in legislative efforts to bring greater \nattention to this bicentennial celebration. My colleague Congressman \nRuppersberger and I were sponsors of the Star Spangled Banner \nCommemorative Coin Act, signed into law by President Obama in August \n2010, directing the U.S. Mint to create coins commemorating this \nimportant anniversary.\n  These gold and silver coin designs are emblematic of the War of 1812, \nparticularly the Battle of Baltimore that formed the basis for the \nlyrics to our National Anthem. The coins are set to go on sale in March \nand will be sold only during this year. The surcharges from these \ncommemorative coins will provide support to the Maryland War of 1812 \nBicentennial Commission to conduct bicentennial activities, assist in \neducational outreach, and preserve sites and structures relating to the \nWar of 1812.\n  I am also planning to introduce with my colleagues Senator Portman, \nSenator Kerry, and Senator Mikulski a resolution to mark this occasion, \nto celebrate the heroism of the American people during the conflict, \nand to recognize the various organizations involved in organizing \ncommemorative events in Maryland and throughout the United States in \nthe coming years, including the U.S. Armed Forces, the National Park \nService, and the Maryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission.\n  As we recognize all these ongoing efforts during this commemorative \nperiod, I encourage all Americans to remember the sacrifice of those \nwho gave their lives to defend our Nation's freedom and democracy, and \nto join in the bicentennial celebration of our victory in the War of \n1812.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer).

Mr. President, it is with great disappointment and \nbafflement that I stand here yet again in the year 2012 to draw a line \nin the sand against another outrageous attempt to roll back women's \naccess to basic health care services.\n  After insisting that we debate the long-settled concept of provided \naccess to birth control, when 99 percent of American women use this \nmedication at some point in their life, many of whom use it not even \nfor contraception, Republicans have chosen to take another extreme step \nto roll back all women's health care rights. So instead of talking \nabout how to grow our economy, we are wasting time on the latest \noverreach and intrusion into women's lives. When will my colleagues \nunderstand this very nondebatable fact, that the decisions of whether a \nwoman takes one medicine or another, or what type of health care she \nshould have access to, should not be the decision of her boss--a \ncommonsense, simple principle, that bosses and employers should not \nmake these very personal decisions. What could be more intrusive than \nthat?\n  Let me be clear. This debate, as the Presiding Officer said in his \nremarks, has nothing to do with religious freedom. You do not have to \ntake it from me. Take it from the Supreme Court. Take it from Justice \nAntonin Scalia, one of the most conservative Justices of our Supreme \nCourt.\n  In the majority decision in 1990, Employment Division v. Smith, \nJustice Scalia wrote, ``We have never held that an individual's \nreligious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid \nlaw prohibiting that the State is free to regulate.'' And that is \nexactly what we are seeing here. Employers cannot pick or choose what \nlaws they are going to follow. Employers cannot pick or choose if they \nwant to follow this labor law or that labor law. They have to follow \nthe law.\n  This extreme amendment Republicans are bringing up for a vote \ntomorrow makes it clear that this is a political and ideological \noverreach, not a religious issue. The fact that they want to exempt all \nbusinesses from providing any preventive care for a woman is outrageous \nand a clear, callous disregard for the health and well-being of \nAmerica's women.\n  The Blunt amendment would allow any insurer or employer to refuse \ncoverage for any health care service otherwise required under the \nAffordable Care Act, jeopardizing vital and necessary health care \nservices for millions of Americans, services such as prenatal care that \nhelp our babies survive; fertility treatments; testing for HIV; mental \nhealth services; screening for cervical cancer; screening for type 2 \ndiabetes; vaccinations.\n  Coverage for any or all of these services and countless others could \nbe denied to any person under this radically broad amendment. This \namendment is not just dangerous for women, it is also dangerous to our \nchildren, and children's health groups are opposing this amendment \nbecause vaccines could be denied on the basis of personal belief. \nDenying childhood preventive care could negatively influence their \nhealth as adults, adding billions of dollars in additional health care \ncosts throughout the lives of these children as they grow.\n  We will not stand for these attempts to undermine the ability of a \nwoman to make her own decision about what is best for her and what is \nbest to protect her children. If our Republican colleagues want to \ncontinue to take this issue head on, we will stand here as often as \nnecessary to draw a line in the sand and to make it known that in the \nSenate we oppose these attacks on women's rights and women's health. \nAnd even if House Republicans are not going to allow women's voices to \nbe heard in their hearings, women's voices will surely be heard all \nacross our country.\n  It is time to agree that women deserve access to preventive health \ncare services regardless of where they work and who their boss is. It \nis time to agree to get back to work on legislation that can create \njobs and get our economy moving. That is what the American people want \nus to be debating. That is what our mission should be here in Congress, \nand that is where our sole focus should be, not on undermining \nprotection and well being for America's women.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1106-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1813, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1813) to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and \n     highway safety construction programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 1730, of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid (for Blunt) amendment No. 1520 (to amendment No. \n     1730), to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act to protect rights of conscience with regard to \n     requirements for coverage of specific items and services.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. As the senior Senator from New York relinquishes the \nchair to his colleague from New York, I want to thank both of them for \ntheir amazing leadership in every issue we turn to today.\n  Senator Schumer's work to help us bring this transportation bill to \nthe floor is exemplary. And Senator Schumer knows, as Senator \nGillibrand\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\nknows and every one of us knows, we cannot have a strong economy if we \ncannot move goods, if we cannot move people, if commerce comes to a \nhalt. So we have to pass a transportation bill to make sure our \nhighways are adequate, our bridges are safe, our commerce can move, and \nour transit systems can carry people from one place to another.\n  I want to say to my colleague who is now sitting in the chair, \nSenator Gillibrand, that I listened to her remarks. I am very touched \nby them. She talked about women's voices, and she is dedicated to \nensuring they are heard. Let me assure my friend that her voice has \nbeen heard on this and so many other important issues. And it is an \neffective voice. She was the one who came to me when the Republicans \nstarted to say they did not think it was necessary for women to have \naccess to birth control with no copay through their insurance, and \nsaid: Barbara, do you understand that a full 15 percent of women are \nprescribed birth control pills because they want to avoid ovarian \ncancer, they want to make sure that a cyst on an ovary does not get out \nof control, they want to avoid debilitating monthly pain, and even it \nis used for terrible skin conditions?\n\n  So when we hear our colleagues talk about birth control as if it is \nsome unnecessary prescription--although you never hear them say it when \nit comes to Viagra, I would note--let me point out it is necessary. We \nwill be on our feet day after day, month after month, hour after hour, \nand minute after minute, because we are not going to let them take away \nmedicine from women. Oh, no. They are not. They will not. And the women \nof this country will not have it. They are engaged in this debate. They \nunderstand it. My friend from New York has been an incredible voice.\n  So here we are. We are on the highway bill. You may wonder, why is it \nthat the Senator from New York came and talked about the issue of birth \ncontrol and women's health when we are on a highway bill? Well, here is \nthe news: My Republican colleagues are so intent on taking away women's \nrights, rights to health care, that they insisted on having a vote to \ntake away these rights before they would allow the highway bill to move \nforward. Can you imagine?\n  I think it appropriate that at this point I pay tribute to my \ncolleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, who has been an amazing colleague, \nwho has been a voice of reason, a voice of progress, over the many \nyears she has served. I have served with her in the House and the \nSenate, I do not know, decades. I will miss Olympia Snowe. But let's \nlisten to what she said. She said: This place has become so polarized, \nso partisan we cannot move forward.\n  I would submit to you that the situation we find ourselves in at this \nmoment is exhibit A on why someone such as Olympia Snowe is saying this \nhas been a privilege and a wonderful thing, but I think I am going to \nmove on. Because here we have a highway bill that is completely \nbipartisan. And again, my colleague in the chair from New York, Senator \nGillibrand, is a very important member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. We passed a bill out of our committee with a vote of \n18 to 0. We had 100 percent support in a polarized time because \neverybody understands we have to make sure we have a No. 1 \ntransportation system, a class A transportation system in this great \ncountry of ours, a vision that was first brought to us by Dwight \nEisenhower in the 1950s when he said, we have to be able to have a \nnetwork of national highways.\n  So here is a bill that comes out of the EPW Committee 100 percent \nbipartisan. The section that dealt with banking comes out of the \nBanking Committee 100 percent bipartisan. It comes out of the Finance \nCommittee very bipartisan, not 100 percent but very. And in Commerce it \nhad a problem, which we have rectified, and it is now bipartisan.\n  So four committees have done their work on the transportation highway \nbill, and all of them have been bipartisan. So we come to the floor--I \nthink this is now the third week or the second week on the bill--the \nsecond week on the bill--and we have gone nowhere, because in order for \nus to move forward, the Republicans are insisting on a vote to take \naway women's health care. So Senator Reid said to them: Fine. We will \nvote on it Thursday morning. But let it be known throughout this land \nwhat is going on.\n  Sometimes people tune in and they say: Oh, it is so complicated, I \ncannot follow it. It is not complicated. Here is where we are: We have \na bipartisan bill, 2.8 million jobs are at stake. We have to do it. The \ntransportation bill is going to expire, the authorization, so we will \nnot have any program in place March 31. We have to do this work, and we \ncannot move forward unless we have a vote on a polarizing amendment--a \npolarizing amendment.\n  How did it come about, this polarizing amendment? It came about \nbecause we passed the health care law that made some incredible \nbreakthroughs. Two of the biggest breakthroughs, I think, in that bill \nis that we for the first time said to insurance companies and \nemployers: When you provide insurance for your people, it must include \na list of essential health care benefits and preventive health care \nbenefits.\n  Let me read you the list of essential health care benefits that \npeople of America are going to have unless the Blunt amendment passes \nand takes this away. This is the list of essential benefits the Blunt \namendment would take away: Emergency services, hospitalization, \nmaternity and newborn care, mental health treatment, preventive and \nwellness services, pediatric services, prescription drugs, ambulatory \npatient services, rehabilitative services and devices, and laboratory \nservices.\n  These are categories of services that health insurance plans must \ncover under health care reform. But if the Blunt amendment passes--and \nwe know it started because of birth control, but it has reached beyond \nthat to every single essential health benefit that any employer in this \nNation, if Blunt passes, could say: I do not want to do any of these. I \ndo not want to do some of these, because I have a moral objection.\n  So if you worked for an employer who believes that prayer is what we \nneed to cure illness--and by the way, that is their right. I would \nfight for their right to believe that. They would be able, however, to \ntell you that that is your alternative, and they do not have to provide \nany of those essential health benefits in their insurance plan.\n  The other thing the Blunt amendment does is it says that no more \npreventive health benefits will be required. Under the law, these are \nthe preventive health benefits that are required to be offered to you. \nYou do not have to take them if you are an employee who has an \nobjection to any of these things. You do not have to do it, but they \nhave to be offered to you: Breast cancer screenings, cervical cancer \nscreenings, hepatitis A and B vaccines, measles and mumps vaccine, \ncolorectal cancer screening, diabetes screening, cholesterol screening, \nblood pressure screening, obesity screening, tobacco cessation, autism \nscreening, hearing screening for newborns, sickle cell screening, \nfluoride supplements, tuberculosis testing for children, depression \nscreening, osteoporosis screening, flu vaccines for children and the \nelderly, contraception.\n  Contraception is a preventive health benefit because we know it \nprevents unintended pregnancies and prevents abortion and prevents \nillness. Fifteen percent of people take it to prevent illness. Also, \nwell-woman visits, HPV testing, STD screening, HIV screening, breast \nfeeding support, domestic violence screening, and gestational diabetes \nscreening--all of these have to be provided. But if you don't want to \ntake contraception, you can say, no; I am not interested in that. If \nyou don't want to have your child to have a vaccine--personally, I \nthink that is terrible--but you don't have to. But that is what is \nrequired.\n  Under the Blunt amendment, let's be clear. Any employer who simply \nsays they have a moral objection can say: Sorry, see this list. We are \nnot going to do 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 things here. For example, obesity \nscreening, we believe that is your problem, and we have a moral \nobjection to that. Colorectal cancer screening, I have an objection to \nthat because, again, my religion says it doesn't do any good.\n  This is why Blunt is so dangerous. It is about denying women the \nabsolute right to have contraception offered to them--it does that, but \nit does a lot\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\nmore than that. Again, we are on a highway transportation bill. It is \n2.8 million jobs. It came out of four committees, and it is bipartisan. \nIt will keep this country moving. It will keep this economy going.\n  Madam President, I want you to imagine one Super Bowl stadium filled \nwith people. Think about what that looks like in your mind's eye. Every \nseat in that stadium is filled. Now imagine 15 of those stadiums \nfilled. That is how many unemployed construction workers there are in \nthis great country today.\n  Yes, we are making progress. Yes, President Obama took us out of the \nworst recession since the Great Depression that he inherited. Yes, he \nturned it around. But he and we say, we have to do more. We cannot just \nsay, because we are creating jobs now, it is enough. The President \nknows it; we know it. We were bleeding 800,000 jobs when he took over, \nand now we have stemmed it and we are creating a couple hundred jobs a \nmonth--100,000, 200,000--thank goodness. We have created, in the last 6 \nmonths or so, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Here is the point: Why on Earth would we take a U-turn as we are on \nthe road to economic recovery, as we are on the road to a bill that is \nabsolutely necessary, and take up the issue of women's health? I am \ntelling you, I believe it is radical. I believe it is taking us \nbackward. I believe it is hurtful to women. I call on every woman, \nregardless of political party, to make your voice heard against the \nBlunt amendment. You are being attacked.\n  What the President did in dealing with the issue of contraception \nshowed the wisdom of Solomon. He basically said: If you are a religious \ninstitution and you have an objection to offering contraception, you \ndon't have to do it. So 335,000 churches are exempt. I feel sorry for \nthe employees who may not agree with the church, but they work for the \nchurch and therefore that is the rule.\n  Religiously affiliated hospitals and universities raised a question--\nyou know, they serve a broad array of people. They hire a broad array \nof people, not just people of one faith but of many faiths and of many \npoints of view. They raised the question, saying: We don't feel \ncomfortable. The President came up with a compromise that has been \nembraced by Catholic Charities, Catholics United, and the Catholic \nHealth Association. The only group that doesn't support him are the \nbishops.\n  If I could respectfully say to them, they don't deliver the health \ncare services; Catholic Charities does, and the Catholic Health \nAssociation does. They represent thousands of providers. So they have \nembraced the President's compromise. But not my Republican friends. \nThey didn't. They want to cause trouble and take away the ability for \nwomen to have access to contraception, without a copay--while they \nsupport supplying Viagra to men. It is stunning.\n  I think this is rippling across the land. I don't know if we have the \nphoto--I don't think we have it on the floor--of the last panel that \nwas held in the House, and my friend from New York talked about it. We \ndo have it.\n  This is a picture. A picture is worth 1,000 words. This is a panel on \nwomen's health focused on contraception. Where are the women? Where are \nthe women? One, two, three, four, five men; they are talking about \nwomen's health care. Not one of them ever had a baby. Not one of them \never had a monthly cramp. They are talking about women's health care \nlike they know all about it.\n  The chairman, Chairman Issa, didn't see immediately that there was a \nproblem. There was a woman sitting there, and she asked to be heard. \nShe said, ``I have a story to tell this panel.'' Oh, no, he didn't want \nto hear from her. He said she wasn't qualified. Do you know what her \nstory was? It was about how a friend of hers who was denied the \ncontraceptive pill and instead developed a terrible tumor on her ovary. \nHe didn't think that was worthy of discussion.\n  This issue is rippling through the land. It says everything to me. We \nwomen in the Senate are not going to allow this to go unnoticed. That \nis a symbol of what is happening to women in this country. In the very \nStates that are passing legislation that some have dubbed ``State \nrape,'' because it would require a woman to be subjected to an invasive \nvaginal probe without her consent, now they are backing off. That was \nthe bill that almost passed in the Virginia Legislature. Now they have \nsaid: OK, it is a sonogram. There is another way to do it. It took \nwomen crying out and saying: Wait a minute. Are you kidding? And they \nare backing off.\n  Well, they better back up overall because this is the 21st century. \nWomen should be trusted and respected and honored and believed. When \nyou tell a woman she needs to be lectured by some stranger on her own \npersonal decisions, right away you are questioning her worth. So the \nissue goes so far beyond the ability to obtain birth control pills. The \nissue goes so far beyond that. It really does. You can stand up here \nand say it is not about women's health, it is really about religious \nfreedom, but as Patty Murray, my colleague from Washington, has said: \nWhen they say it is not about contraception, it is about contraception.\n  Others have said: When they say it is not really about the money, it \nis really about the money. When they say it is not really about \npolitics, it is about politics.\n  This is about contraception, making it difficult for women who don't \nhave the means to have some sense of control over their reproductive \nlives and to be able to access a pill that could help them live a \nhealthier life and live longer and free of pain.\n  So they will come and say: Oh, Senator Boxer, this isn't about \ncontraception; it is about religious freedom. The President has taken \ncare of the religious objection. I described how he did it, and I will \nsay it again. He said if you are a religious institution, you don't \nhave to provide contraception. If you are a religiously affiliated \ninstitution, there will be a way for a third party to deal with it. The \nCatholic health organizations support it, Catholic Charities. He has \ncome up with a compromise. There is no reason to have this polarizing \ndebate. Everybody should have religious freedom, including the \nemployees, including the boss, including everybody. So no one under the \nPresident's plan is forced to do something they don't want to do. We \njust want to make sure when the Institute of Medicine tells us that \navailability to contraception saves lives and protects health, women \nget a chance to get it if they want. If they don't want it, they don't \nhave to get it. Of course not.\n\n  Again, I will end where I started, talking about my colleague Olympia \nSnowe, who is retiring, not running again, because she said we are so \npolarized. This is exhibit 1. We are on a transportation bill that is \nbipartisan, but the other side can't let it rest, cannot move forward \non it, and cannot move to make sure our businesses and our workers have \na brighter future. Oh, no, they have to delay it.\n  By the way, it is not only with this birth control amendment and \nwomen's health amendment but with other amendments that have nothing to \ndo with the subject. It is what makes the American people wonder what \nwe are doing here.\n  I want to show some charts that deal with transportation issues right \nnow. I will continue talking about Olympia Snowe for a minute. I went \nthrough some of the issues that I worked on with her. I want to talk \nabout them. She and I wrote the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act. \nWe were very strong because we knew our constituents were getting stuck \non aircraft hour after hour, stuck on the tarmac, with no food, kids \nscreaming, nightmare scenarios, 9, 10 hours on the runway. We thought \npassengers deserved a bill of rights.\n  We worked with outside groups, some wonderful people. Lo and behold, \nit passed as part of the FAA bill that finally got enacted. We didn't \nget 100 percent of what we wanted, but we got 90 percent. I was proud \nto work with her.\n  In 2009, following a tragic Buffalo commuter plane crash, which I \nknow the occupant of the chair remembers, Senator Olympia Snowe wrote a \nbill to implement the recommendations of the National Transportation \nSafety Board to make sure these pilots get enough rest and that they \nare well-trained. We were very pleased that moved forward. We worked \ntogether--Olympia and I--on the Purple Heart for POWs to make\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\nsure the Purple Heart included prisoners of war who died in captivity \nand they could get that to bless their memory.\n  We worked together against the global gag rule.\n  We worked together and wrote a letter to the President--President \nObama--asking him to appoint a woman to replace Justice David Souter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter I \nwill be quoting from.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2009.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The announced retirement of United \n     States Supreme Court Justice David Souter--an outstanding \n     jurist--has left you with the crucial task of nominating \n     someone for a lifetime appointment to our nation's highest \n     bench.\n       The most important thing is to nominate an exceptionally \n     well-qualified, intelligent person to replace Justice \n     Souter--and we are convinced that person should be a woman.\n       Women make up more than half of our population, but right \n     now hold only one seat out of nine on the United States \n     Supreme Court. This is out of balance. In order for the Court \n     to be relevant, it needs to be diverse and better reflect \n     America.\n       Mr. President, we look forward with great anticipation to \n     your choice for the Supreme Court vacancy.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara Boxer,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Olympia J. Snowe,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am so proud of this letter we wrote together. In the \nletter, we said:\n\n       The most important thing is to nominate an exceptionally \n     well-qualified, intelligent person to replace Justice Souter. \n     . . . Women make up more than half of our population, but \n     right now hold only one seat out of nine. . . . This is out \n     of balance. In order for the Court to be relevant, it needs \n     to be diverse and better reflect America.\n\n  Then, of course, the President nominated Sonia Sotomayor and we were \nvery excited about that.\n  So it was wonderful to work with her on that, and we worked together \non respecting human rights in Tibet and led 27 Senators in a letter to \nChinese leader Hu Jintao asking that Tibetans be respected. Regarding \nwomen in Afghanistan, we worked together to ask Afghan leaders to \nrevise a law that would legalize marital rape and impose other Taliban \nrestrictions on Shiite women in Afghanistan.\n  This is just a partial list of issues I have worked on with Olympia \nSnowe, and I will do a longer tribute for the record at a later time.\n  But, again, as I heard this news, I was first filled with worry about \nher health, and I hoped she was OK. But she has clarified she \nabsolutely is. So I wish her nothing but the best. I know she will \nalways work on issues because she is so good at looking at a problem \nand solving it and not thinking first whether it is Democratic or it is \nRepublican or where it falls on the political scales. So I have \nappreciated working with her on so many of these important issues that \nhave come before us.\n  I think the Senate should take a minute to think about this in \nrelation to this bill. The whole world is watching us. When I say that, \nI don't mean the whole world literally, but I think the country is \nwatching us. Why do I say that? Because 1,000 groups have endorsed our \nmoving ahead with this bill--a coalition of 1,075 organizations from \nall 50 States. Here is what they said about this Transportation bill:\n\n       There are few Federal efforts that rival the potential of \n     critical transportation infrastructure investments for \n     sustaining and creating jobs and economic activity.\n\n  This is what they wrote. So they know this is the way to sustain and \nrevive economic activity. This is what is at stake: Right now, 1.8 \nmillion jobs are created because we have a transportation bill. That \nbill ends March 31. So 1.8 million jobs are at stake if we don't act. \nBecause of the way we wrote our bill, we leveraged funding, and this \ngained great bipartisan support. We have greatly increased the TIFIA \nProgram, which is the transportation infrastructure financing program, \nwhich leverages funds by 30 times. Because of this, we believe we will \nsee another 1 million jobs created. So we are talking 2.8 million jobs \nthat are at stake. Yet we have an amendment on women's health. I just \nkeep coming back to how insane that is.\n  I also wish to note again the many unemployed construction workers. \nRemember, I said 15 stadiums could be filled with unemployed \nconstruction workers. This is the number: 1.48 million construction \nindustry workers unemployed. The unemployment rate is 17.7 percent \namong construction industry workers; whereas, the national unemployment \nrate is 8.3 percent. We know the housing sector is still having major \nproblems getting out of the funk it is in. It is tough. So we have to \ndo this bill.\n  I have a picture, just in case your mind's eye wasn't able to conjure \nit up. Here is a picture of a stadium filled with about 100,000 people. \nSo 15 of these stadiums would basically reflect all the unemployed \nconstruction workers.\n  Which are the groups that are supporting us and are they bipartisan? \nOh, my goodness. I don't think I could share with everyone a more \nbipartisan list of organizations than the AAA, the American Association \nof State Highway and Transit Officials, the American Bus Association, \nthe American Concrete Pavement Association, the American Council of \nEngineering Companies, the American Highway Users Alliance, the \nAmerican Moving & Storage Association, the American Public \nTransportation Association, the American Road and Transportation \nBuilders Association, the American Society of Civil Engineers--and it \ngoes on and on--the trucking association, the Metropolitan \nTransportation Organizations, Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, \nGovernors Highway Safety Association, International Union of Operating \nEngineers, Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, National \nAsphalt Pavement Association, National Association of Development \nOrganizations, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Stone, Sand & Gravel \nAssociation, National Construction Alliance.\n  Oh, it goes on. That is just a partial list of those 1,000-plus \norganizations.\n  When we started our bill the Presiding Officer will remember we made \nhistory because we had Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL CIO, sitting \nnext to Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Donohue \nand Trumka, the odd couple. They are fighting and arguing on \neverything. Yet they came together in front of our committee because \nthey know we will all benefit. All of America benefits when we do a \nbill such as this.\n  I think I have shared a lot, but there is one more point. If we allow \nthis bill to go away, and we are stuck with an extension because the \ntransportation fund is not collecting enough gas tax revenues--and \nthere is a good-news reason for that, which is we are getting better \nfuel economy and we are using public transit a lot more, so the gas tax \nis not coming in at the rate it normally does--we will be down 35 \npercent in the fund. So right away--right away--631,000 jobs are gone. \nBut what is so great about our bill is that four committees, including \nthe Finance Committee, filled the gap in a way that was bipartisan.\n  Our story is a great story to tell. If I had to tell my grandkids a \nstory, I would say: Once upon a time in America, we didn't have a \nnational road system. But a Republican President named Dwight \nEisenhower had a vision. He was a general. He knew it was important to \nmove things in a reliable way, and he had a vision of a national \ntransportation system, and everybody in the country said: What a great \nidea. So we started to have a bill every few years to authorize a \nhighway fund. Then somebody came up with the notion of it being funded \nby the users, so that the gas tax would go--part of it--to this fund \nand we would have enough in that fund to build our highways and our \nbridges, and then, later on, our transit systems. People said: We have \na lot of wear and tear on the roads. What if a lot of people took \npublic transit and got out of their cars? It would be better for the \nair quality. It would be better for everybody and for the state of the \nroads, and so they were married up, highways and transit and bridges.\n\n  Now we have to live up to that legacy and not bog this bill down with \nbirth control amendments and women's health amendments and amendments\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\nabout Egypt or anything else. There is time for that. We don't mind \nthose battles but not on this bill. Infrastructure is the name of the \ngame. We all know it--Republicans and Democrats.\n  So I say, let's stop playing games with this bill, please. Let's \ndispose of this birth control amendment, this women's health amendment. \nIt doesn't belong on here. But if that is what it takes to get us off \ndead center, fine, let's go. To coin Olympia Snowe's phrase, it will be \npolarizing. It will not be pretty, but we will dispose of that and then \nwe will move on and dispose of this bill.\n  I hope we will not have to face 5, 10, 20, 30 unrelated amendments. I \nhope we can get it down to a small number and move on. Let's pass this \nbill, lift the workers and lift our businesses. Every dollar, almost--\nmost of the dollars--goes straight to the private sector through our \nStates, through our local entities.\n  Then let's hold our head up high when we go home. So when I go to the \nsupermarket I don't have people coming to me and saying: What is going \non over there? Birth control on a highway bill. What, are you kidding? \nI don't want to have those conversations every time I go to the \nsupermarket. What are these guys thinking, they say. I say: I don't \nknow. I can't speak for them. I think it is an agenda that appeals to \nthe far right of this Nation. It is not a mainstream way to go.\n  In closing now, for those who say Republicans and Democrats never \nwork together, that is not true. Senator Inhofe and I are as far away \nfrom each other politically as two human beings can get, but we teamed \nup and put aside our ideologies, put aside our pet peeves, put aside \nthings that, perhaps in our hearts, we truly wanted to do on this bill, \nand we met in the middle. He was over here and I was over here and we \nended up right in the middle. We said: We can do this, and we proved we \ncould do it. It was a challenge that was put to us by the leadership of \nboth our parties and we met that test and other committees met that \ntest.\n  So here we are. Are we now to say to committee chairs and ranking \nmembers, Republicans and Democrats alike, forget about it? It is not \nworth it. Work your heart out.\n  I pay tribute to my staff, my Democratic staff, and to Senator \nInhofe's Republican staff. They worked night after night after night to \ncome together on this bill. Then we were given an assignment 2 weeks \nago to resolve the germane amendments and they have come together and \nthey have resolved I don't know how many but dozens of amendments. So \nis the message, work your little hearts out, have your staff give up \ntheir nights with their families and come up with a bipartisan bill and \nall of a sudden have it subjected to some polarizing amendments that \nhave nothing to do with the subject?\n  Please, let's not see this bill go down. Because if this bill goes \ndown, let me tell you, I, for one, will go to as many cities as I can \nand counties in this country and tell the truth about what happened. \nThere is no reason for us not to get this done, especially when we have \nthe Chamber of Commerce working with the AFL CIO, we have Republican-\nleaning business organizations working with Democratic-leaning worker \norganizations all throughout this country--over 1,000 of them. I talk \nto them every week to say thank you to them for keeping the pressure on \nall of us to keep moving forward. When we have that kind of \nbipartisanship in our committees, when we have that type of bipartisan \nbill on the floor, when we have that type of bipartisan support in the \ncountry, it is time to move forward and get the job done for the \nAmerican people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum calm be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today as I do week \nafter week to talk about the health care law and offer a doctor's \nsecond opinion about this health care law. I do that as someone who has \npracticed medicine in Wyoming, taking care of families across the \nCowboy State for about a quarter of a century, and I do it today \nbecause we are now approaching the second anniversary of the \nPresident's health care law, and, as predicted by many on my side of \nthe aisle, the negative results continue to roll in and billions of \ntaxpayer dollars continue to roll out.\n  Each week we learn more about how this law is going to break another \none of the President's promises. He made a lot of promises, one of \nwhich is he said it would not add a dime to the deficit. It is now \nclear that the White House and Democrats in Congress completely \nunderestimated--possibly intentionally but certainly vocally \nunderestimated--how much the President's new entitlement program is \ngoing to cost the American people.\n  I come week after week because Nancy Pelosi said, ``First you have to \npass it before you get to find out what is in it.'' This past week a \nstory came out that talks about the high-risk pools, designed and \nestablished to cover people who were not able to buy health insurance \nin the individual market prior to the health care law. The goal was \nadmirable. The plan, though, they came out with was horrible.\n  First, the new Obama high-risk plans created more bureaucracy, more \ngovernment, and undermined what States like mine, Wyoming, were already \nsuccessfully doing.\n  Next, the White House and the Democrats who crammed this bill through \nCongress and down the throats of the American people set aside $5 \nbillion for this program. The money was supposed to last, they said, \nuntil 2014--no problems. The bad news is that the Medicare's Chief \nActuary, the official who actually tracks the spending that goes on as \na result of this law, estimates now that the funding could run out much \nearlier than expected.\n  Last week the Washington Post explained how this could happen. It \nreported that ``medical costs for enrollees in the health-care law's \nhigh-risk insurance pools are expected to more than double initial \npredictions''--more than double the initial predictions by the \nDemocrats who voted for this health care law. So the cost for enrollees \nare expected to be more than double what the White House and the \nDemocrats predicted when they drafted the law, as the American people \nremember, behind closed doors.\n  The President promised this would be open--C SPAN--people would be \nable to see the discussions and the debates. Everything was done behind \nclosed doors. Yet our debt as a nation continues to skyrocket. It is \ncompletely unsustainable, and it is irresponsible. You know, it could \nhave been prevented if the White House and Congress had just let the \nAmerican people participate in the process.\n  So here we are, 2 years later, a second anniversary coming up of a \nhealth care law, a law that the American people are now learning what \nis in it because, as Nancy Pelosi said, ``First you have to pass it \nbefore you get to find out what is in it.''\n  The American people also know that this administration and this \nPresident and this Congress used about every budget trick and \naccounting gimmick in the book to turn it into law. They ignored the \nreal costs, they ignored the red flags, and they ignored reality. Two \nyears later, the American people understand that we cannot afford the \nhigh cost of the President's health care law and health care mandates. \nThe longer it stays in place, the more expensive it will get.\n  That is one of the reasons Americans from both sides of the aisle are \nspeaking out against this health care law. When I say both sides of the \naisle, I want to talk about a recent USA TODAY/Gallup Poll. This was \nMonday's--Monday, February 27--USA TODAY, front-page story, right at \nthe top: ``Health Care Law Hurts Obama.''\n  My concern is that the health care law is hurting the American \npeople. That is what the impact of this law is. It is hurting the \nAmerican people.\n  What the poll shows is that a clear majority of registered voters \ncall the bill's passage ``a bad thing.'' They support its repeal if a \nRepublican wins the White House in November.\n  Eleven percent of voters in battleground States have said the law has \nactually helped their families, but 15 percent say it has hurt them. \nLooking\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\nahead, they predict by a number of 42 percent to 20 percent, so two to \none, that the law will make things worse rather than better for their \nfamilies and for their lives.\n  Americans overwhelmingly believe the individual mandate, which is a \nkey part of the Obama health care law, is unconstitutional, the mandate \nthat every American must buy insurance. Americans believe it is \nunconstitutional by a margin of 72 percent to only 20 percent. An \noverwhelming number of Americans believe that what this Senate and the \nHouse, under Democratic control, and the President in the White House, \nBarack Obama, have forced on the American people--they believe, and I \nagree with them--is unconstitutional. Even a majority of Democrats and \na majority of those who think the health care law is a good thing \nbelieve that provision--that people across the country be forced to buy \nhealth insurance or to buy any product--is unconstitutional.\n  Instead of heaping more debt on the backs of the American people, we \nneed to repeal the law. We need to replace it with health care reform \nthat allows Americans to have a bigger say, a patient-centered health \ncare approach.\n  It is interesting. When you look at this USA TODAY article, there is \na picture of a family, a father and mother and three children. Robert \nHargrove of Sanford, NC, said: You have to have insurance or pay a \npenalty? ``That is not the way the country was set up.''\n  That tells the story I heard around the State of Wyoming last week as \nI traveled, as other Members traveled around their home communities, \ntheir home States. They remember the President's promises. He promised, \nNo. 1, that the cost of insurance for families would go down. The \nPresident promised it would go down by $2,500 per family per year. That \nis not what the American people have seen in the last 2 years since it \nhas been passed. They remember the President promising that if you like \nthe care you have and the insurance you have, you can keep it. That is \nnot what American families are finding. Broken promise after broken \npromise.\n\n  Now, with the Chief Actuary coming out this past week in the \nWashington Post, reporting that the high-risk pool is doubling the \ncosts that were predicted--once again, the President promised that it \nwould not add a dime to the deficit--another broken Obama promise.\n  Here we are. I go to townhall meetings, visit with people, and ask \nfor a show of hands: How many of you believe that under the President's \nnew health care law, your costs are going to go up? Every hand goes up. \nObviously, they do not believe what the President has told them.\n  How many of you believe that as a result of the new health care law, \nactually the quality of your care and the availability of your care \nwill go down? Again, every hand goes up.\n  It is not what the President promised the people of this country.\n  That is why, when the USA TODAY headline on Monday says ``Health Care \nLaw Hurts Obama,'' my concern is that it is hurting the American \npeople. People asked for health care reform in this country. What they \nasked for was the care they need, from the doctor they want, at a cost \nthey can afford. This health care law has provided none of those \nthings. This health care law is bad for patients, it is bad for \nproviders--the nurses and the doctors who take care of those patients--\nand it is terrible for the American taxpayers. That is why I come to \nthe floor week after week with a doctor's second opinion, saying it is \ntime to replace this health care law with reforms that will put health \ncare under the control of patients--not insurance companies, not \ngovernment, but under the control of patients.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Crowdfunding\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Good morning to you, Mr. President, and \neverybody in the gallery. I wanted to thank Majority Leader Reid for \nhighlighting next week's Banking Committee hearing on small business \ngrowth. It is something all of us have a very dear and great concern \nwith. One of the issues that will be discussed is a concept called \ncrowdfunding. People may be saying: What is crowdfunding? Well, if you \never wished that you had the opportunity to invest in a Facebook or a \nGoogle or new idea before they hit it big, wouldn't that be nice? We \nwould all be multibillionaires. My Democratizing Access to Capital \nbill, S. 1791, would expand entrepreneurs' access to capital by \ndemocratizing access to startup investing so they can have the funds to \ngrow and create jobs.\n  The House passed a crowdfunding bill 407 to 17. So you know they must \nbe on to something when they can pass something in such a bipartisan \nmanner. The President referenced it in his State of the Union. He \nsupports crowdfunding, and public support for crowdfunding is, in fact, \nexploding.\n  On Monday I hosted a roundtable in Boston at City Hall on small \nbusiness access to capital, and I listened to small business owners and \nentrepreneurs and investors to get their thoughts and concerns about \nbusiness growth, about investing, about the access to capital, and it \nwas a very successful event. They all had one thing to say and that \nwas: If we can't get behind the bipartisan, commonsense idea of \ncrowdfunding, then what can we actually agree upon and how can we \nexpect small businesses to grow?\n  With such strong support, I believe we should put, once again, \npartisan politics aside and focus on what we can do to help small \nbusinesses as we have done with the 1099 fix, the 3-percent \nwithholding, the Hire a Hero Act, the most recent insider trading STOCK \nAct. All of my bills, all the things I have worked on, we did in a \nbipartisan manner. When the leader let them come to the floor and \nallowed us to work them through, they passed 96 to 3 and 100 to 0. It \nshows that the Senate can work together regardless of our political \ndifferences, our geographical locations, our belief on where we are \nbecause we are Americans first. These are things the business \ncommunities are looking at to move our country forward.\n  Next Monday I am hosting a roundtable with an entity called Wefunder, \na group of innovators who started a petition for my bill to discuss \ncrowdfunding. Their petition currently has 2,500 supporters who would \ninvest over $6 million today if businesses had the opportunity to \nparticipate in crowdfunding, but right now it is illegal.\n  My bill is a commonsense bill, and I want to note that Senator \nMerkley has also introduced a different crowdfunding bill. It is a good \nstart, but we can do a little bit more. I have reached out to his \nstaff, and I have asked my staff to continue to do that. So I think we \ncan work together as Senator Gillibrand and I have, and Senator Cochran \nand Senator Collins worked on the recent insider trading bill. We can \ndo the same with Senator Merkley if he is willing and if the leader \nallows us to put those political party differences aside and actually \nwork on something for the benefit of our country.\n  Today I am going to talk about some important principles that I \nbelieve are critical to making crowdfunding legislation a success. For \ncrowdfunding to actually work, we need a national framework, which my \nbill creates. If we require entrepreneurs to comply with every separate \nState securities law mandate, filing the appropriate paperwork alone \nwould cost over $15,000. That is the reason we don't have this type of \nsituation. In my bill we don't have small business owners being able to \ngive up to $1,000 per person, up to $1 million to invest in that next \nnew idea with minimal SEC filings and minimal secretary of state \nfilings. It is something that makes sense. We should not be burdening \nour startup businesses, which is where the largest growth is in this \ncountry right now, with costly quarterly reporting requirements. We \nmight as well go through the whole process of the full SEC filings. It \nis not appropriate, especially until they are fully off the ground.\n  The point of crowdfunding is to allow entrepreneurs to flourish, not \nto bog\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\nthem down in an avalanche of paperwork and bureaucracy and redtape. \nThat is why we are in this mess somewhat, because of the \noverregulation, the continued regulatory and tax uncertainty when it \ncomes to planning and growing businesses.\n  In addition, I believe our existing fraud laws are solid; we just \nneed to enforce them. Exposing startup founders to new personal \nliability is not going to work. It will create a real wet blanket on \neverything we are trying to do here from thousands of investors who are \ninvesting only a maximum of $500 to $1,000 and to have them also put in \na personal guarantee for a $500 investment. How does that make any \nsense whatsoever, a quarterly filing, a personal liability guarantee \nfor a $500 investment? This makes no sense at all. This will cause \ninvestors to use crowdfunding only when there is no other option \navailable and will leave them to switch out crowdfunding investors for \nventure capital firms at the first opportunity, therefore, I believe, \nstifling that crowdfunding opportunity.\n  There was a recent article I read in which Canada's Government is \ndeeply concerned about us actually doing this because they are fearful \nthat Canadian money will be flowing into the United States. Wouldn't it \nbe nice for once to have money flowing into the United States on \nsomething that will actually create small business growth in our great \ncountry? So recognizing that investors need protection, my bill does \nrequire entrepreneurs to offer their securities through regulated \ncrowdfunding intermediaries.\n  In addition, my bill requires intermediaries to facilitate \ncommunication between investors and the offerors. I believe Senator \nMerkley and I have the same concerns in this regard which I believe can \nbe addressed without creating a private right of action. It is not \nnecessary especially for the amount of money we are talking about and \nthe new business growth opportunities we can actually stimulate.\n  Crowdfunding depends on small investments by many, which is why we \nmust exempt crowdfunding securities from the 500 shareholder cap so we \ndon't create additional redtape for startups. It makes total sense. \nEveryone talks about overregulation of small business and how that is \nhurting their growth. I see it, you see it where you live, Mr. \nPresident, and in legalizing--let me repeat--in legalizing crowdfunding \nI believe we can still provide for the appropriate level of regulation \nbut also give small businesses the access to capital they so \ndesperately need.\n  This is a home run all over the place, and once again I am very \npleased the majority leader has taken an additional step to call for \nthe hearing on crowdfunding. When he talked about this issue, he \nreferenced Senator Merkley's bill. I also have a bill. So why don't we \ndo it as we did it with the insider trading bill, the Hire a Hero, the \n3-percent withholding, the 1099, the Arlington Cemetery bill? All of \nthose things, when we were allowed to work in a truly bipartisan \nmanner, we were able to get done. With all due respect, there is no \nRepublican bill that is going to pass right now, and I know that shocks \nsome people. There is no Democratic bill that is going to pass either. \nIt needs to be a bipartisan, bicameral bill that the President is going \nto sign. That is what I offer, is that olive branch, that one good deed \nthat begets another good deed and moves us forward to addressing our \nvery real problems in a truly bipartisan manner as Americans first and \nnot as Republicans or Democrats.\n  I would ask the majority leader to also include my bill when he is \nmoving forward because otherwise I am fearful nothing will move \nforward. So I am looking forward to not only working with Senator \nMerkley but working with the majority leader and his team. When I was \nworking on the insider trading bill, which was my bill and Senator \nGillibrand's bill that we combined, we found that common ground. We \nworked together, we managed the floor, we had an open amendment \nprocess. Everybody walked out of here saying: That was nice. When was \nthe last time we did that? Remember? That was unbelievable. Everyone \nhad a role. Even Senator Kirk, who is recovering, had a role to play \nand it was good to see him. We can even do it in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I yield the floor at this \ntime. I see that we have a speaker all ready to go as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1520\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time from 2 \nto 4 p.m. be equally divided, with Senator Blunt or his designee in \ncontrol of the first hour and the majority side controlling the second \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words today about the \namendment that is being called the Blunt amendment, the purpose of \nwhich I will read from the amendment, to amend the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, to provide rights of conscience with regard to \nrequirements for coverage of specific items and services.\n  I oppose this amendment, and I wish to be very clear today as to why \nI oppose this amendment. This is not a bill that attempts to address \nthe necessary divide between church and state.\n  Let me say that a little more specifically. This is not an amendment \nthat addresses the necessary divide between the establishment of \nreligion or the free exercise thereof as outlined in the first \namendment of our Constitution, which is a concept I care deeply about.\n  This amendment, by definition, attempts to widen the restrictions on \nour laws from the necessary divide between church and state into the \nunknown and often indefinable provinces of an individual's personal \ndefinition of conscience. The amendment is clear on this point. It is a \npreamble in which it lists its findings, talks repeatedly about the \nrights of conscience, not the separation of church and state. It \ninvokes Thomas Jefferson's view of the rights of conscience against the \nenterprise of civil authority. It addresses the purported flaws of the \ncurrent health care law in terms of governmental infringement on the \nrights of conscience of insurers, purchasers of insurance, planned \nsponsors, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. It then mandates that \nthe right to provide, purchase, or enroll in health care coverage must \nbe consistent with the religious beliefs or the moral convictions of \nthese stakeholders.\n  Again, let me be clear: This language goes well beyond the \nconstitutional requirement of separation of church and state into the \narea of legislative discretion. Quite frankly, it would be the same \nthing as Congress saying that not only should religious establishments \nbe exempted from taxation under the doctrine of separation of church \nand state, but also that anyone who has a moral objection that they can \ndefine to paying taxes should not be required to pay them either. There \nis a place for this type of conduct in our legal framework. It has a \nlong history. It is called civil disobedience. The act of civil \ndisobedience is protected by our Constitution, but the ramifications \nare not. Unless there are clear constitutional protections, legal \naccountability remains.\n\n  The effect of this amendment on its face would be that any \nstakeholder could decide to deny health care benefits to any individual \non the very loose definition that to provide such care somehow would \nviolate a personal definition of one's moral convictions. In other \nwords, any provider could potentially deny a wide range of benefits to \nanybody.\n  This is a vaguely drafted and potentially harmful amendment. It is \nnot about protecting religious institutions or protecting the clear \nobjective and understandable parameters of religious belief. It should \nnot be approved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Farm Labor\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I also \nthank the floor managers of the highway bill for allowing me a couple \nminutes and to let them know how appreciative I am of their efforts to \nmove forward on an important piece of legislation--the highway \nlegislation. Nothing creates jobs and makes our economy stronger in the \nlong run than responsibly investing in our infrastructure. So I thank \nSenator Boxer and Senator\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\nInhofe for their good work and, hopefully, that good work will come to \nfruition very soon.\n  Last September, the Department of Labor published new child labor \nregulations. They would have the effect of restricting how young folks \nare able to work on farms. I am deeply concerned about these new rules \nwhich will keep teenagers from working on farms and ranches.\n  As the Senate's only working farmer, I know how important it is for \nyoung people to have the opportunity to work on farms and ranches. I am \nnot alone in that belief. There are many folks here who understand the \nvalue of family farm agriculture. Growing up on the same farm that my \ngrandparents homesteaded nearly a century ago--well, it was a century \nago this year--my brothers and I were expected to bail the hay, pick \nrocks, feed the livestock, do field work, and the list goes on and on. \nThat work ethic that was instilled in us as youngsters is a big part of \nmy success today. It was that work ethic that built this Nation and \nthat work ethic which I think is critical to the future of America. The \nskills young people learn from working on a family farm translate into \na healthy work ethic that will serve them their entire lives, whether \nthey choose to be in agriculture or in some other business.\n  Family farm agriculture is one of the foundations of this country, \nand irresponsibly regulating the ability of young people to fully \nexperience and grow from it will be detrimental to this country's \nfuture. I know firsthand that agriculture is uniquely a family industry \nin the United States, in Montana, and throughout rural America. Young \npeople are expected to help out on the family farm or ranch. That is \npart of the economics of family agriculture. For smaller farms and \nranches to survive, it has to be everybody pitching in. By \nparticipating in production agriculture, young people learn the value \nof a day's work. They also learn that grain doesn't come from a box or \nvegetables don't come from a bag or meat doesn't come from a package. \nThey truly get educated about where our food comes from while they \nbuild that work ethic.\n  These new rules get in the way of that education. That is because \nthese rules were not written with a solid understanding of how family \nproduction agriculture works today. We are losing family farms every \nday in my hometown of Big Sandy, for example. In that community, I went \nto school with about 40 kids or so in my high school class. Today there \nare about 60 kids in the entire high school. That is because family \nfarms are getting bigger, and there are fewer folks living in rural \nAmerica. We ought to encourage beginning farmers and ranchers, \npreparing them to be our next generation of food producers in this \ncountry.\n  The proposed rules would expand restrictions on what duties teenagers \ncan perform on farms, limiting them. Under these new rules, all animal \noperations would be off limits until a person reaches 16 years of age. \nThat is a sad day, a missed opportunity, and a loss of an opportunity \nfor our young folks to learn.\n  I am calling on the Department of Labor to withdraw this proposal as \nit applies to family farm agriculture and allow this country's youth to \nlearn a solid work ethic. The common sense that goes with that work \nethic is so critically important to our Nation's future.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Vitter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2138 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would ask, what is the pending business \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Blunt amendment No. 1520.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to object to the Blunt amendment. I \nbelieve this amendment is extreme and it would undermine the delicate \nbalance between religious freedom and a woman's health. It would be a \nmistake. It goes too far. It would allow any employer to prevent a \nwoman's access to mammograms, prenatal care, even vaccinations or any \nother form of preventive care. In Montana, my State, 62,000 women could \nlose access to preventive care. I am here to say that is wrong, and I \nam going to go to bat for them. I think a woman should decide for \nherself and her family what preventive care makes the most sense for \nher.\n  As Americans, we believe in individual liberties and equal access to \nhealth care. Current policy upholds those values. It preserves the \nintegrity of a woman's freedom and the right to access all health care \nservices. It protects the religious liberties that so many Americans, \nincluding myself, value. And that is why both faith-based and health \ncommunities support this policy--not the Blunt amendment but the \ncurrent policy. The Blunt amendment would overturn this. It would allow \nany corporation or health plan to deny women and their families access \nto preventive health care for almost any reason. It is written so \nbroadly that an employer or an insurance company could deny access to \npreventive care for virtually any reason. That is not right.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Blunt amendment. I urge them \nto protect the health of all Americans. That includes our mothers, \nwives, sisters, and daughters in Montana and across the country.\n  In Montana, we are very proud to have sent the first woman to \nCongress--Ms. Jeannette Rankin--in 1916. We have a very strong \ntradition in our State of respecting women--women who are not only the \nhearts of our families but are also those providing the fabric of our \ncommunities. When we support women's health, we are supporting healthy \ncommunities that could be strong for our kids and our grandkids.\n  Let's uphold our values of liberty. Let women choose for themselves \nindividually. It is their responsibility what preventive care they \nthink makes the most sense for them. And let's treat all Americans \nfairly. Let's defend against discriminatory health insurance practices, \nand let's do so while protecting everyone's fundamental rights.\n  Mr. President, on another matter, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In ``Common Sense,'' the American patriot Thomas Paine \nwrote in 1776 as follows:\n\n       The landholder, the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, \n     the tradesman, and every occupation, prospers by the aid \n     which each receives from the other, and from the whole. \n     Common interest regulates their concerns, and forms their \n     law. Common interest produces common security.\n\n  In the 240 years since Paine's pamphlet helped define who we are as \nAmericans, our transportation system has become the cornerstone of our \ncommon interest. There are few things under the Sun that are not \nimpacted by our highways, our roads and bridges, and our transit \nsystems, yet we can too easily take our network for granted.\n  A recent Rockefeller Foundation survey found that two-thirds of all \nrespondents believe America should invest more in infrastructure. It is \na common interest. That same survey found that two-thirds of all \nAmericans believe they should not have to pay any more for this \nincrease in infrastructure investment. That means we have to rise to \nthe challenge in Congress to come up with a highway bill that invests \nin infrastructure without asking folks to pay more than their fair \nshare.\n  According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Transportation Performance \nIndex, we could lose nearly $340 billion in potential economic growth \nover the next 5 years if we do not pass a highway bill and provide the \ncertainty our economy needs. Let me make that statement again. We could \nlose $340 billion in potential economic growth over the next 5 years if \nwe do not pass a highway bill and provide the certainty our economy \nneeds.\n  Our transportation system depends on substantial investments from the\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nFederal Government. This investment consistently yields a big return \nfor American jobs. In my home State of Montana, the last highway bill \ncreated or sustained more than 18,000 good-paying jobs, and nationwide \nit put approximately 35,000 people to work for every $1 billion \ninvested. So for every $1 billion invested, it created 35,000 jobs. \nThese are not just statistics, these numbers represent families able to \nput food on the table. They are good jobs. These numbers represent \nsmall businesses able to attract new customers.\n  I know these types of investments work because I spent a day working \nalongside a road construction crew on Amsterdam Road in Bozeman. They \nshowed me the ropes of running a road grader, a paver, and an \nexcavator. I might say, the grader was really up to date. All I had to \ndo was get in the grader, move forward, and it was guided by a GPS \nsystem that raised the blade, turned the blade, tilted the blade at \nexactly the right location, and it was a perfect line I made down that \nroad, whereas if I had had to do it by myself, it would have been a \nmess. The GPS made it work. During the workday, I talked to about a \ndozen workers who said their families depended on the project for their \nlivelihood. It was very impressive. Their work also had a major impact \non the community because Amsterdam Road is one of the most traveled \nroads in the area.\n  Investing in our transportation infrastructure is investing in our \nfamilies and our economy. It is an investment. It yields great returns. \nIt pays dividends. This bill seeks to maintain that investment through \n2013; that is, the underlying bill that is before us--not the Blunt \namendment but the underlying bill. I would prefer a longer period of \ntime in the underlying bill to provide greater certainty. We are \nalready 2 years past due. We have had lots of extensions. We must work \ntogether now to get something done at least until the end of next year, \nand a 2-year bill provides the compromise we need to get there.\n  I have worked on this bill for about 4 years from the leadership \nperspective of two different Senate committees: the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, which provided the authorization for roads, \nhighways, bridges, and various forms of nonmotorized transportation, \nand the Finance Committee, which provided the money so we can have the \nproceeds and the resources to pay for these highways.\n\n  From the perspective of investment, I can tell you firsthand that \nthis bill specifically focuses on those programs that are truly in our \nshared national interest. It consolidates nearly 90 road programs down \nto approximately 30. Consolidating 90--lots of individual, separate \nprograms that kind of divide our country, didn't bring us together--to \n30--30 programs that rely on the highway trust fund.\n  This bill also focuses on dramatically improving our national \ncapacity for data-gathering and data-sharing--desperately needed. We \nsought to enable States to address safety and mobility difficulties by \nseeing what solutions have worked in other States. More data will help \nthem better answer those questions. For example, why in some States--my \nState of Montana--is the highway fatality rate 2\\1/2\\ times the \nnational average? There are a lot of ideas, but what are the real \nreasons? We need data to find out.\n  This bill creates for the first time a dedicated freight program to \naddress interstate commerce.\n  The bill extends a program called TIFIA. That is a lending program \nthat leverages private sector investment, good investment, building \nroads and bridges. History tells us that every $1 we put in can \nleverage $30 in private sector investment.\n  This bill has no earmarks--no earmarks. Senators Boxer, Inhofe, \nVitter, and I worked hard to achieve agreements, and I thank my \ncolleagues who serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee for \nunanimously approving this bill and its reforms--unanimously.\n  I especially would like to applaud Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member \nInhofe for their leadership. They worked very hard, and they worked \ntogether. Sometimes people think Washington can't work together. Let me \ntell you, I have watched these two people work very closely together. \nThey were a team to get a highway bill here before the Senate.\n  Next, from the perspective of the Finance Committee, the bill \nprovides the highway trust fund with sufficient funding to last at \nleast until the end of fiscal year 2013. The highway trust fund simply \ndoes not bring in enough revenue from traditional funding sources, such \nas the fuel tax, to meet our national needs. As a result, Democrats and \nRepublicans on the committee had to look elsewhere to ensure for the \nshort term that we could maintain current levels of Federal investment. \nIn the long term, we should use the opportunity to decide what we want \nfor a transportation network in the 21st century. So we are going to \npass this short-term bill, and while we are passing this short-term \nbill, we have to give a lot of thought to what we want to do for the \nlong term. We should use that opportunity to decide what makes the most \nsense for the 21st century. Where we could apply unused fuel tax money \nthat currently goes to the leaking underground storage tank trust fund \nsurplus, the Finance Committee did so with support from Democrats and \nRepublicans. And where we transferred money from the general fund to \nthe highway trust fund, we sought to backfill the general fund by \nclosing tax gaps or focusing on tax scofflaws.\n  It is important that we make sure the highway bill stays focused on \nsupporting the economy. In Montana, our highways are our lifeblood. We \nare a highway State. We log a lot of hours at the wheel. It is a part \nof who we are. We are the fourth largest State in the Nation for land \nmass, but we have fewer residents than Rhode Island, the smallest State \nin size.\n  My friend the former Senator Mike Mansfield said in 1967:\n\n       Montanans are formed by the vastness of a state whose \n     mountains rise to 12,000 feet in granite massives, piled one \n     upon another as though by some giant hand. To drive across \n     the state is to journey, in distances, from Washington, DC, \n     north to Toronto, or south to Florida. In area, we can \n     accommodate Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and \n     New York, and still have room for the District of Columbia. \n     Yet, in all this vastness, we are . . . less than a million \n     people.\n\n  A few weeks ago, we just tipped the needle on 1 million residents. I \nmight say, I am not sure we are happy about that. Some of us want to be \nunder 1 million in population and some kind of like 1 million. It is a \nbig debate in our State: Should we be 1 million or less than 1 million? \nNonetheless, we lack the population to make the necessary investments \nin Federal aid roads and interstates by ourselves, and we shouldn't \nhave to do so. Montana alone could not support the Interstate Highway \nSystem--we couldn't do it--or the other national highways in our State. \nWe don't have the people. With more than 10 million visitors annually \nand with the majority of our truck traffic originating and ending out \nof State, we rely on the Federal program with good reason: It is in our \ncommon interest--in the interest of Montana, in the interest of all \nthose folks who transport freight across our State, and in the interest \nof people who want to visit Glacier Park or Yellowstone Park. It is in \nour common interest.\n  I am here to say that the more we keep our eye on the ball, with a \ntransportation bill that keeps our common interests in mind, the more \nsuccessful we will be.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Midwest Storms\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, overnight and early this morning parts of \nmy home State of Illinois and our adjoining State of Missouri were \npummeled by severe storms and tornadoes. While the total extent of the \ndamage is not yet known, it is clear that southeastern Illinois was hit \nhard by at least one tornado and heavy storms. The\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\ntowns of Harrisburg in Saline County and Ridgway in Gallatin County \nhave suffered terrible damage. Several people in Harrisburg have died \nas a result of these tornadoes. The earliest reports suggest 10 deaths. \nThe exact number will not be known for some time. More than 100 other \npeople in this area are reported to have suffered serious injury.\n  This is an indication of some of the damage and devastation in \nHarrisburg. Between 250 and 300 homes in nearby Gallatin County have \nalso been damaged. An estimated 25 Harrisburg-area businesses are \ndamaged or destroyed, including a Walmart and a strip mall that were \nhit by the tornado.\n  This next photograph is an indication of some of the terrible \ndevastation that took place. Three bodies have been recovered from the \nfield behind the Walmart, and survivors are still being pulled from the \nwreckage of the building. Most roads in Harrisburg have been closed. \nPeople are going door to door to check. The reports are positive in \nterms of the accountability.\n  The Harrisburg Hospital has received damage itself. Yet the personnel \nhave done a heroic job in setting up triage stations throughout the \nhospital after this devastation. Hospital officials are asking that all \nnonemergency cases that are unrelated to the severe weather go to other \nhospitals. The hospitals are only taking in those who are injured and \nasking family members to wait outside because of the limited facilities \navailable. Patients in the hospital's B wing, which suffered heavy \ndamage, are being evacuated to Evansville, Indiana's Deaconess \nHospital, which has called in all available staff.\n  The First Baptist Church in Harrisburg is being used as a shelter, \nand I am sure everyone in that community--a wonderful community in \nsouthern Illinois--is pitching in to give a helping hand. Harrisburg \nschools, obviously, are canceled for the week. Ridgway is nearby, and \nno one is being allowed to visit the town at this point. Between 50 and \n60 homes in Gallatin County have been destroyed.\n\n  I have an early photograph of some of the scenes there that show the \ndamage to this historic church. Historic St. Joseph Church, and at \nleast one business, the Gallatin County Tin Shoppe, have been leveled \nby this tornado.\n  This last photograph is of the same church before the storm, which is \nan indication of what happened. This is an historic church which many \nof us are well aware of. It has served the Catholics in this community \nfor many years.\n  Between 9,000 and 13,000 people are without electricity because of \nthe storm damage. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency is hard at \nwork clearing debris and roads. Governor Pat Quinn has activated a \nstate emergency operations center to help with the damage, and he and \nJonathan Monken of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency are on \ntheir way to the scene this afternoon.\n  My heart goes out to all of the people in Harrisburg who have lost \nloved ones. We are keeping in close contact with the people on the \nground, working together with my colleague Senator Mark Kirk's office \nhere in Washington. They share our concern for the devastation, damage, \nsuffering, and death associated with this, and both Senator Kirk and I \nhave extended to the State of Illinois our willingness to help in any \nway possible.\n  My thoughts are with the residents of these hard-hit towns, with the \nfirst responders, and the Red Cross volunteers who are always on the \nscene and who are working to assess the damage and help those who have \nbeen injured. Jonathan Monken had a conference call with many members \nof the Illinois congressional delegation a short time ago. He assures \nus that all requests for State and FEMA assistance are being met at \nthis moment. We will continue to make the promise that that will be \ntrue in the future as well.\n  My staff and I are in contact with local officials, including \nHarrisburg Mayor Eric Gregg; the mayor of Ridgway, Becky Mitchell; \nState Senator Gary Forby; and State Representative Brandon Phelps. I, \nalong with Senator Mark Kirk, am committed to help do everything \npossible to help communities respond to and help with this disaster.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, my colleague, the Senator from Illinois, \nand I live in a part of the country where these terrible weather \nevents--tornadoes and other things--are not unusual for us. But as \nSenator Durbin has pointed out, we did have them last night in a number \nof places in southern Missouri, including Branson, the tourism strip, \nat one theater and one tourism location after another, as well as in \nBranson, Lebanon, Dallas County, and other places in southern Missouri. \nWe had way too much experience with this last year.\n  As my friend has pointed out, the Federal Emergency Management people \nare quickly there. We had a year of experience with this, particularly \nafter the Joplin tornado. They were terrific. We want to remember too \nthe first responders are always our neighbors, and neighbors are coming \nforward to help families whose houses were lost and possessions were \nscattered, and even in this particular case where there are occasions \nwhere people are injured and lives have been lost as well.\n  Senator McCaskill and I join with Senator Kirk and Senator Durbin in \ntheir efforts in this regard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1520\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nmy Republican colleagues for 60 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to talk about an amendment that has \nhad lots of attention. It is an amendment that I offered on the floor a \ncouple of weeks ago. We weren't able--the leader didn't want to get to \nit at the time, but the majority leader brought it up for me yesterday, \nand I am glad he did. I am glad we are able to talk about it.\n  This is an amendment that would allow religious belief or moral \nconviction to be an important factor in whether people comply with new \nhealth care mandates. We have long had this exemption for hiring \nmandates. In fact, when I served in the House of Representatives, I had \nbeen the president of a Southern Baptist university and I understood \nthe importance of these institutions, I thought, in maintaining their \nfaith distinctions as part of why they provide education and health \ncare and daycare and other things. So I have long been an advocate of \nthe principle that the Supreme Court upheld a few weeks ago 9 to 0 that \nthere is a difference in these faith-based institutions. Now that we \nhave health care mandates being complied with by these institutions, \nall this amendment does is extend the same privilege to them and others \nwho have a religious belief or a moral conviction so that they would be \nable to defend their moral conviction.\n  We don't do anything about the mandate itself. It is important to \nunderstand that the administration--this one or any other--if the \nAffordable Health Care Act is still in force, can issue all the \nmandates that the act would allow. In fact, if a person doesn't comply \nwith those mandates, they would have the penalties that the act would \nallow. But the difference is if the government wouldn't recognize a \nperson's religious belief or moral conviction, as I think they would \nlikely do. For example, the archdiocese in Washington, DC, is saying \nthis is something we have long held as a tenet of our faith that we \ndon't believe should happen, we shouldn't be a part of, and we don't \nwant it to be a part of the insurance policies of our schools, our \nhospitals. My guess is if we pass this amendment, without any question, \nthe Justice Department would say, Well, you are certainly going to be \nable to defend that because that has been your belief for centuries, \nthe belief of your faith.\n  This amendment doesn't mention any procedure of any kind. In fact, \nthis morning we had a reporter call the office who said we can't find \nthe word ``contraception'' in this amendment anywhere. How is this a \nvote on contraception? Of course we were able to say, as we have said \nfor 4 days, the word ``contraception'' is not in there because this is \nnot about a specific procedure, it is about a faith principle that the \nfirst amendment guarantees.\n  This exact language of religious belief or moral conviction was first \nused in 1973 in the Public Health Services Act. It was brought to the \nSenate floor by Senator Church from Idaho, who I\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\nbelieve was considered one of the liberals of the Senate at the time, \nprotecting health care providers from having to be involved in \nprocedures they didn't agree with. It is part of the Legal \nServices Corporation limitation in 1974, the foreign aid funding \nlimitation in 1986, the refusal to participate in executions or \nprosecutions of capital crimes in 1994, the vaccination bill wherein a \nperson comes to this country as a nonresident and they don't want to \nhave vaccinations that are otherwise required, they don't have to have \nthem if they have a religious belief or moral conviction against them.\n\n  The list goes on and on: The Medicare and Medicaid Counseling Act, \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan of 1998, the contraception \ncoverage for federal employees in 1999, the DC contraception mandate in \n2000, the United States Leadership Against AIDS Act in 2003.\n  Then this exact same language even more specifically has been in \nbills that weren't passed. In 1994, Senator Moynihan from New York \nbrought a bill to the floor that Mrs. Clinton--later Senator Clinton, \nnow Secretary Clinton--was very involved in, this 1994 health \ndiscussion. That bill said: Nothing in this title shall be construed to \nprevent any employer from contributing to the purchase of a standard \nbenefits package which excludes coverage for abortion or other services \nif the employer objects to such services on the basis of religious \nbelief or moral conviction.\n  This is Senator Moynihan less than 20 years ago in what was \nconsidered a liberal piece of legislation, putting what the country had \nthought since the beginning of government-paid health care was a \nnatural part of every health care bill. In fact, the bill we are \ntalking about that this amendment would impact is the first time the \nFederal Government has passed a health care bill that didn't include \nthis language--the first time it didn't include this language. If one \nis not offended by the current mandate that some religions are, I think \nit is important to think of what one would be offended by. What in \none's faith would be an offensive thing to be told one had to be a part \nof, and then imagine the government saying, no, a person has to be a \npart of that? Even if a person doesn't do it themselves, they have to \npay for it, or they have to be sure that a person's employees, their \nassociates, are a part of this thing that is offensive to that person \nbecause of religious belief or moral conviction.\n  Before I yield to my good friend Senator Johanns, who understands \nthis issue so well, let me also say that, as I said, we didn't \neliminate a mandate, so we can still have a mandate. The Federal \nGovernment can still come in and say: You are not offering these \nservices so you have to pay a penalty, and then you have to go to court \nand prove that you have a long-held belief that this is wrong. The \nCourt, in 1965, when this particular phrase became the boilerplate \nlanguage for the law, said, You can't become a conscientious objector \nthe day you get your draft notice, in essence; you have to have these \ntwo principles. You have to have a religious belief, a strong moral \nconviction, and you have to be able to go to court and prove that.\n  All of the fiction writers out there, in fundraising letters and \notherwise, saying things such as women who have contraceptive services \ntoday wouldn't have them, of course that is not true. Of course that is \nnot true. The women who have those services today either have them \nbecause they have found a way to pay for them themselves or they have \nan employer who is providing that as part of health care. That employer \nis not going to be able to turn around and say, I am not for that \nanymore because I object for some religious reason that I didn't have \nall the time I was providing it.\n  This is an important issue. It is a first amendment issue. It is an \nissue that group after group after group thinks violates the Religious \nFreedom Act--RFRA. There are six lawsuits already. I suspect they have \na good chance of prevailing because it does exactly what the religious \nfreedom law says you can't do and it needlessly forces people to \nparticipate in activities that are against their moral principles, \ntheir religious principles.\n  The circumstance in the country is we have 220 years of history on \nthis. We have almost 50 years of history of government-paid health care \nfor one group or another that always included an exemption such as this \nexemption. To not do this assumes that the government can make people \ndo things that Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and others \nspecifically said were among the rights we should defend the most \nvigorously; that we should hold the most dear; that we should not let a \ngovernment interfere in these basic rights of conscience, a phrase of \nThomas Jefferson when he wrote the New London Methodist in 1809. These \nrights of conscience are an area that we should not let the government \nget between the American people and their religious beliefs. Our laws \nsince then, whether it is for hiring or in the case of any health care \ndiscussion, have always anticipated the protection of this first \namendment right--not a specific thing but, again, if you are not \noffended by the things that some people are concerned about today, it \nis important to think about what you would be offended by, what your \nreligious belief leads you to believe would be wrong and how you would \nfeel if the government says now you have to be a part of that activity.\n  I wish to turn to my good friend from Nebraska who has been a real \nadvocate in understanding the importance of the first amendment and the \nrole it plays in our society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, let me start this afternoon by thanking \nmy colleague from Missouri for taking on this issue and putting this \nlegislation together. Let me also thank my colleague for telling the \nreal story of this legislation. It is critically important we \nunderstand the history that brings us here this afternoon and, \nultimately, to a vote on this legislation I am proud to cosponsor.\n  My colleague just so ably pointed out that what has changed is, the \nObama administration, working with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, took this important language out of this health care \nlegislation. For decades--for decades--this important protection was in \nlegislation, and it was supported by Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents, liberals, conservatives. That was the history of our \ncountry until all of a sudden this change came about where that \nconscience protection was taken out of the health care legislation that \nwas passed a couple years ago.\n  But let's look back even further in our history. The first freedom in \nour Bill of Rights is the liberty to exercise any religion we might \nchoose, or for that matter not participate in any religion whatsoever. \nThat is what this United States of America is based upon, this concept \nthat we have the freedom to choose what faith we will belong to, what \nteachings we will follow, and, as I said, we have the choice to not \nparticipate at all, if we choose, in this country.\n  Yet the President and my colleagues from across the aisle want to \nforce--want to force--religious institutions, for the first time in the \nhistory of our country, to violate their strong moral convictions. And \nthey go even further. They want to somehow shroud this and veil it as a \nwoman's health issue.\n  Let me set the record straight. This debate is not about that, as \nsome would have us believe. It certainly is not about contraceptives. \nWhat this debate is about is fundamental to our freedom as citizens of \nthis great country. It is religious liberty we are talking about.\n  It is an American issue that dates back to our very Founders who \nlooked at the war they had just fought and said to themselves: We are \nnever going to allow our country to force us to attend a certain church \nor to participate in a certain faith--not at all. And it was written in \none of our most sacred documents, the Bill of Rights. Yet the President \nof the United States is trampling on this religious freedom and \nattempting to convince Americans that it is something else.\n  His power grab is forcing religious institutions to go against their \ndeeply held beliefs. If they stay true to their beliefs, the \nCongressional Research Service reports these religious insurers and \nemployers may face Federal fines of $100 per day per plan.\n  So let me give an example of how that will work in my State. For a \nself-insured institution such as Creighton University in Nebraska, a \nJesuit institution--I happen to have graduated\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\nfrom there--they have about 6,000 health care plans. So the cost to \nCreighton University in Omaha, NE, to exercise their religious liberty \nwill be an annual pricetag of $24 million. That is the price of \nexercising their religious liberty in the President's world. \nUnbelievable.\n  Well, I went on the Internet. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an open letter to the President that is being signed by \nwomen all over this country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Open Letter to President Obama, Secretary Sebelius and Members of \n                                Congress\n\n\n                   Don't Claim to Speak for All Women\n\n       We are women who support the competing voice offered by \n     Catholic institutions on matters of sex, marriage and family \n     life. Most of us are Catholic, but some are not. We are \n     Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Many, at some point \n     in our careers, have worked for a Catholic institution. We \n     are proud to have been part of the religious mission of that \n     school, or hospital, or social service organization. We are \n     proud to have been associated not only with the work Catholic \n     institutions perform in the community--particularly for the \n     most vulnerable--but also with the shared sense of purpose \n     found among colleagues who chose their job because, in a \n     religious institution, a job is always also a vocation.\n       Those currently invoking ``women's health'' in an attempt \n     to shout down anyone who disagrees with forcing religious \n     institutions or individuals to violate deeply held beliefs \n     are more than a little mistaken, and more than a little \n     dishonest Even setting aside their simplistic equation of \n     ``costless'' birth control with ``equality,'' note that they \n     have never responded to the large body of scholarly research \n     indicating that many forms of contraception have serious side \n     effects, or that some forms act at some times to destroy \n     embryos, or that government contraceptive programs inevitably \n     change the sex, dating and marriage markets in ways that lead \n     to more empty sex, more non-marital births and more \n     abortions. It is women who suffer disproportionately when \n     these things happen.\n       No one speaks for all women on these issues. Those who \n     purport to do so are simply attempting to deflect attention \n     from the serious religious liberty issues currently at stake. \n     Each of us, Catholic or not, is proud to stand with the \n     Catholic Church and its rich, life-affirming teachings on \n     sex, marriage and family life. We call on President Obama and \n     our Representatives in Congress to allow religious \n     institutions and individuals to continue to witness to their \n     faiths in all their fullness.\n\n                                          Helen M. Alvare, JD,\n\n                                       Associate Professor of Law,\n                                     George Mason University (VA).\n\n                                              Kim Daniels, JD,\n\n                                                   Former Counsel,\n                                      Thomas More Law Center (MD).\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Women have signed this, and one of the things they say \nis, they are proud to work for institutions that contribute to their \ncommunity.\n  Let me quote from that letter. They value ``the shared sense of \npurpose found among colleagues who choose their job because, in a \nreligious institution, a job is . . . also a vocation.''\n  These women are Americans who believe this mandate by the Federal \nGovernment, interfering with religious liberty, is wrong.\n  I will wrap up my piece of this colloquy by again thanking the \nSenator from Missouri for his leadership in this area. The President \nhas said he offered an accommodation. The accommodation is, woe, lo and \nbehold, this is going to be free.\n  Now, I would like to know what legal authority he relies upon that \nthe President could ever order anyone to offer a service or an item for \nfree. He has no such authority. This is not the Soviet Union; this is \nthe United States of America. We do not believe that for a moment. Of \ncourse we are going to be paying for this through our insurance \npremiums.\n  Well, my hope is we will read our Constitution and we will stand as a \nunited front upholding religious freedom, which is being violated by \nthis mandate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank my friend for those good additions \nto what we are talking about.\n  I might say, also, even if there is some accounting issue that makes \nthis appear that maybe someone you are hiring is paying for it instead \nof you, if this is something you are opposed to for religious grounds, \nit is not about the cost; it is about the fact that this is something \nyou do not believe you should be part of.\n  In my particular faith, the contraception part of this is not \ntroublesome for me. But it does not mean I should be less troubled that \nit bothers others or that I should care less about their religious \nfreedom than I do mine or that I should not care about the government \nusing the heavy hand of these fines to force people to do something.\n  The other point I would like to make, before I go to my friend from \nIdaho, is, if the government chooses to fine people, people actually \nhave to go to court and prove they have a deep religious belief. I do \nnot think that would be very hard for Creighton University. The entire \nhistory of the university is founded on the principles of faith that \nwould say: This is something we do not want to be part of. If that is \nthe case, maybe that Justice Department would not take them to court or \nwould not make them go to court rather than pay the fine. But they \ncould. We are not saying that anybody can do anything they want to do. \nWe are just creating a way that we can assert your first amendment \nrights if we choose to do that.\n  As the Governor of Idaho, Senator Risch was responsible for lots of \npeople who worked for the State of Idaho. He knows about this both from \na faith perspective and an employer's perspective, and I am glad he \ncame down to the floor.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much.\n  Fellow Senators, I am going to speak briefly on this issue, and I \nthank those who have actually put this on the table for us to talk \nabout.\n  Every single American should watch the debate on this issue. This \ndebate strikes to the heart of the freedoms we as Americans enjoy. Why \ndo we have these freedoms? We have them because in 1776 the people \ndecided they were sick and tired of the King telling them they had to \ndo this and they had to do that and had totally wiped out a number of \nfreedoms they had--not the least of which was speech and religion.\n  We will remember, these people operated under a King who was so \npowerful--the Monarchy was so powerful, it established a religion and \nsaid: You must belong to this religion if you are a citizen of this \ncountry.\n  When we fought to be free of that, when we fought to be a free \npeople, the Founding Fathers put together a document that specified \nvery clearly the freedoms we would have.\n  We have come many years since then, but we will lose these freedoms \nif we do not guard them when even a little chip comes out of it. That \nis what they are doing here. Think about this for a minute. We have \ngotten to the point where this government has gotten so big and so \npowerful that it has said: Look, we do not care about what you believe \nin your religion because what we are doing is a good thing and, \ntherefore, you must do what we are telling you because the ends justify \nthe means--the means is to chip away at the religious freedoms we as \nAmericans enjoy.\n  It is wrong. It is the way we lose our freedoms. If we turn our back \nand let a government do this to us, this is how we lose our freedoms.\n  This government is big. It is getting bigger by the day. It is \ngetting more powerful by the day. When they sat around the table in \n1776, they had just fought with a government that had been terribly \noppressive. They argued amongst themselves: Well, what are we going to \ndo? We are going to create a government.\n  They knew from a historical perspective, and they knew from their \nrecent experience, that any government they create needed to be \ndistrusted, needed to be watched, needed to have shackles on it because \nif they did not, that government would abuse them--just as every \ngovernment had throughout history.\n  So that is why they drew the document we live under today, the \nConstitution we have. They not only gave us one government, they gave \nus three governments. They gave us a legislative branch, an executive \nbranch, and a judicial branch--each with the duty to watch the other \nand beat the other over the head if, indeed, they got out of line. They \nwere so afraid of a government that they did everything they possibly \ncould to see that government did not abuse them.\n  Well, we learn frequently that their fears were well founded. Today \nwe see, once again, their fears were well founded. What we have is a \ngovernment that is saying: We do not care what your religious beliefs \nare; you must do what\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\nwe are telling you to do because we think it is the right thing to do \nregardless of your religious beliefs.\n  It is wrong. It has to be fought. It must be reversed.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing this issue to the attention of \neveryone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  There are a number of waivers on this. The administration has given \nover 1,700 waivers to 4 million people. If you have a plan that is \nbetter than the government plan, if you have a plan that might be taxed \nunder the law because it has been negotiated as part of collective \nbargaining, if you are a fast food institution that has insurance but, \napparently, with high deductibles--those were all reasons to create a \nwaiver. You would think that a faith-based belief would also be a \nreason that a waiver could have been granted.\n  This amendment just assures that we can have the same kind of \nopportunity to exercise our religious beliefs going forward as every \nAmerican has in health care, in labor, in hiring, and other areas up \nuntil right now.\n  I would like to turn to my friend, the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to express my gratitude to the \nSenator from Missouri for his leadership on this issue.\n  This used to be a topic that was a bipartisan issue dating back to \nthe passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\n  But just so people can refresh their memories, there have been a \nnumber of allusions made to the language of the Constitution. But let \nme just read the first amendment to the Constitution, part of our Bill \nof Rights, the fundamental law of the land that cannot be abridged or \nchanged by a mere act of Congress, which is what we are concerned \nabout; that the President's health care bill, the Affordable Care Act, \nso-called, purports to change the Constitution, which it cannot do. \nWhen there is a conflict between the Constitution and a law passed by \nCongress, that law falls as unconstitutional.\n  But the first amendment to the Constitution says:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\n\n  That is what we are talking about is the free exercise of religion. I \nagree with Senator Risch that one of the biggest problems with this \nlegislation, the President's health care bill, the so-called affordable \ncare act, which we have came to learn is not so affordable, is that it \nforces each individual in this country to buy a government-approved \nproduct according to the dictates of Congress. That is one of the \nissues the Supreme Court will be ruling on, whether that is even within \nthe scope of congressional power under the commerce clause.\n  But Senator Risch makes a very good point; that is, the basic problem \nwith this legislation generally is it is too big, it is too expensive, \nand it is too intrusive on the individual choices and freedoms of \nAmerican citizens.\n  As I said, it used to be that religious freedom was a bipartisan \nissue. That is why I am so concerned this has turned into a purely \npartisan issue. It is very obvious to me that some of our colleagues on \nthe floor believe they can make political hay by scaring people, by \nmisleading people; that this is somehow about denying women access to \ncontraception when that is not the issue.\n  This is about protecting our sacred constitutional freedoms. When I \nsaid religious freedom used to be a bipartisan issue, I was referring \nto the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. I think it is \ninteresting to see who the sponsors were and people who were some of \nthe principal proponents of the bill. That demonstrates it was \nbipartisan.\n  The lead sponsor in the House was Senator Chuck Schumer, now a Member \nof the Senate. Cosponsors included then-Representative Maria Cantwell, \nnow in the Senate; then-Representative Ben Cardin, who is presiding \ntoday; and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n  In the Senate it had 60 cosponsors. Ted Kennedy was the lead sponsor. \nWe have heard Senator Brown from Massachusetts saying the position he \nis taking on this issue of religious freedom is exactly the same \nposition Senator Kennedy took during his lifetime. But 60 other Members \nof the Senate cosponsored this, including Senator Boxer, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Kerry, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Leahy, Senator \nLevin, Senator Murray, and Senator Reid, the majority leader of the \nSenate today.\n  It was signed into law by then-President Clinton, demonstrating that \nreligious freedom was not a partisan issue, it was a bipartisan concern \nof Congress and the reason why this bipartisan legislation passed to \nprotect religious freedom.\n  So similar to members of the Catholic Church who are concerned about \nbeing forced to provide coverage for surgical sterilization or drugs \nthat induce abortions or other forms of contraception, members of the \nMuslim faith, if they are a woman, need not be concerned about \nrestrictions on their ability or desire to wear a head scarf in public \nor in government buildings or dietary rules practiced by observant Jews \nor that Christians would not be somehow interfered with when it came to \nwearing religious symbols such as crosses or rosaries. This is not \nabout those rules or those items of clothing or religious symbols, this \nis about religious freedom, over which Congress shall pass no law, \nunder the words of our Constitution.\n  I am somewhat disappointed we now find ourselves--that the lines seem \nto have been drawn so sharply in a partisan way on an issue that used \nto enjoy such broad bipartisan support. It is my hope our colleagues \nwill reconsider because it is not good for the country, it is not good \nfor our Constitution, it is not good for the preservation of our \nliberties, for the very fundamental law of our land, the Bill of \nRights, to become a partisan issue.\n  But if there is a fight, if there is a disagreement, I believe it is \nour responsibility to speak in defense of religious freedom and to \nremind our colleagues that Congress shall pass no law restricting \nreligious freedom. That is what we are talking about.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri for being the leader on this \nimportant amendment. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to voice \nthe reasons for my support, and I hope our colleagues who are opposed \nto the amendment or have already publicly stated their opposition will \nreconsider.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I do too. I hope we find out now that while we do not have \nas much bipartisan support as we would like to have, we will have some. \nSenator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, along with Senator Ayotte from New \nHampshire and Senator Rubio from Florida and I introduced this bill in \nAugust of last year. This is not just something we came up with \nrecently.\n  Members who were in the Senate when the health care act, the \naffordable health care act passed, said they believed if it had passed \nin a more normal way, this would have been in the final bill, that \nwould have been an understanding, as it was in the Patients' Bill of \nRights draft and legislation that was introduced in 1994 or the health \ncare bill in 1999. This same language was an accepted and bipartisan \npart of who we are as a country enforcing the first amendment.\n  In fact, in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it says: \n``Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of \nreligion even if the burden results from a rule of general \napplicability.'' Even a rule that would generally apply, the government \nshould not burden a person's exercise of religion unless it \ndemonstrates a burden that it is in the furtherance of a compelling \ngovernment interest.\n  I cannot imagine--nobody has had to do this ever before. Why would \nsuddenly defining insurance policies beyond the faith beliefs of \nindividuals and groups that were long held, why is that a sudden \ncompelling government interest or it is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering that government interest? Surely not.\n  Again, I am going to repeat for what may be the third or fourth time: \nWe do not do anything in this amendment that would end the mandate. \nThat is for another debate at another time. The government can still \nhave a mandate. The government can still say: Here is what we are \ntelling you a\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\nhealth care plan has to look like. But this allows people who have a \nfaith-based first amendment right to object to that to have a way to do \nit.\n  One of the original cosponsors of the bill; that is, the amendment we \nare debating today, has joined us and that is Senator Ayotte from New \nHampshire. She is an advocate of the first amendment, as a former \nattorney general. I am glad she is here.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the opportunity to be \nhere to rise in support of the pending amendment that is based upon, as \nSenator Blunt mentioned, a piece of legislation that was introduced on \na bipartisan basis earlier in the year called the Respect for Rights of \nConscience Act, which I was proud to cosponsor.\n  During the past few weeks, we have heard certainly impassioned \narguments from both sides of the aisle about this issue. Certainly, it \nhas been a robust and important exchange of views, which I have \nappreciated. However, I think it is regrettable that similar to so much \nelse that happens around here, this issue has been used as an election-\nyear tactic to score political points, and in some cases there have \nbeen the facts of what this amendment and our bill hope to accomplish \nhave been supplanted by mischaracterizations and distortions.\n  That is unfortunate because what we are here to talk about is \nincredibly important. This is a fundamental matter of religious freedom \nand the proper role of our Federal Government. It is about who we are \nas Americans and renewing our commitment to the principles upon which \nthis Nation was founded.\n  This debate comes down to the legacy left behind by our Founding \nFathers and over 200 years of American history. We have a choice \nbetween being responsible stewards of their legacy, as reflected in the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution, or allowing the Federal Government \nto interfere in religious life in an unprecedented way. The first \namendment to the Constitution starts with: ``Congress shall make no law \nrespecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.''\n  Just last month, we saw our Supreme Court unanimously uphold, under \nthe establishment and free exercise clauses of our Constitution, a \nruling in the Hosanna-Tabor case that the Federal Government may not \ninfringe on the rights of religious institutions in their hiring \npractices. To do so, they ruled on a unanimous basis, would interfere \nwith the internal governance of the church.\n  Protecting religious freedom and conscience rights has in the past \nbeen, as was mentioned here, a bipartisan issue. No less than Ted \nKennedy himself, a liberal icon of the Senate, wrote in 2009 to the \nPope: ``I believe in a conscience protection for Catholics in the \nhealth care field and will continue to advocate for it.''\n  Senator Kennedy had previously pushed for the inclusion of conscience \nprotections in legislation he proposed in 1997 as well as in his \nAffordable Health Care for all Americans Act proposed in 1995. These \nare the same protections our amendment seeks to restore.\n  In 1994, provisions aimed at protecting conscience rights were \nincluded in the recommendations made by the Task Force on National \nHealth Care Reform, led by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. In 1993, \nwhen President Bill Clinton signed the bipartisan Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act into law, he said: ``The government should be held to a \nvery high level of proof before it interferes with someone's free \nexercise of religion.''\n  Protecting religious freedoms was once an issue that bound Americans \ntogether. It certainly is a very important issue as we take the oath of \noffice here to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I believe \nthis effort which is so fundamental to our national character must \nbring us together once more on a bipartisan basis.\n  I would like to make one very important point about this amendment. \nUnfortunately, many have tried to characterize this amendment as \ndenying women access to contraception. That is a red herring, and it is \nfalse. We are talking about government mandates that are interfering \nwith conscience protections that have long been engrained in our law.\n  To be clear, women had access to these services before the President \npassed the Affordable Care Act, and after this amendment would be \npassed, they would still have access to these important services. \nContrary to what some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have \nasserted, this measure simply allows health care providers and \ncompanies to have the same conscience rights they had before the \nPresident's health care bill took effect.\n  We are not breaking any new ground. In fact, we are respecting what \nis contained within our first amendment to the Constitution and what \nhas long been a bipartisan effort to respect the conscience rights of \nall Americans, whatever their religious views are.\n  This vote goes to the heart of who we are. If we allow the government \nto dictate the coverage and plans paid for by religious institutions, \nthat is the first step down a slippery slope. When religious liberty \nhas been threatened in the past, Members of both sides of the aisle of \nCongress have taken action to preserve our country's cherished \nfreedoms. We must do so again now or risk compromising a foundational \nAmerican principle.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will give this \namendment careful consideration and appreciate that it is an amendment \nthat will respect the conscience rights of all religions and will \ncertainly not deny women access to services they need and deserve.\n  I appreciate the Senator having me here today. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this important amendment.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator for her leadership and from the \nbeginning of this discussion back in August when Senator Ayotte, \nSenator Rubio, Senator Nelson from Nebraska and I introduced this bill, \nwe have been joined in this amendment by three dozen or more other \nsponsors, one of whom actually I mentioned a piece of legislation he \nwas involved in the first time he was in the Senate. It protected the \nreligious rights of people who were temporarily in the country, with \nexactly this same language, who might have some religious belief or \nmoral conviction that meant they didn't want to get the vaccines we \nwould require a visitor to have. In 1996 Senator Coats put this in a \nlaw that virtually every Member of the Senate serving today, in both \nparties, voted for, as they have time after time when this issue was \nbrought up. This language was understood to be an important defense of \nthe first amendment in a health care piece of legislation.\n\n  I am glad Senator Coats has joined us today. Whenever I researched \nthis, I saw that he had used this very language 15 years ago in a piece \nof legislation. I know the Senator is an important advocate of \nreligious freedom.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. I thank \nhim also for his willingness to engage with this amendment, to put it \nin play here for us to debate and discuss. It is a very fundamental \nprinciple of our Constitution that is at stake, and it deserves debate, \nand it deserves this body putting their yea or nay on the line relative \nto how we are going to go forward. I commend him for his leadership, \nand I am pleased to join him, as well as many others, in this colloquy.\n  This is an issue that is as old as this Nation. We are all blessed to \nlive in this Nation and are blessed by the wisdom of our Founding \nFathers, guaranteeing our rights. The very first right they guaranteed \nin the Constitution was the right to religious freedom. Many of the \nearliest settlers came here because of that right and their desire to \ncome to a country where their religious beliefs, tenets, and principles \nwould be respected and honored, where they would not be dictated to by \na government like they lived under before they came here, but it would \nbe protected and preserved as a basic fundamental right. It was a \ntransformational idea at the time. Yet, now for well more than 220 \nyears or so, it has been maintained throughout the history of this \ncountry. It stands as a bulwark against government interference with \npersonal beliefs and government trying to dictate how we exercise the \nreligious freedoms we are all so privileged to have.\n  It has been said--and I want to repeat it--that the debate today is \nnot about access to contraception. This is not about whether it is \nappropriate to use contraception. It is not about a woman's right to \ncontraception. As a pro-life Christian and a Protestant, I am\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\nnot against contraception, but I also believe it is a decision \nindividuals must make in accordance with their own faith and beliefs, \nnot a decision to be made by the Federal Government.\n  What this is about is whether Congress is going to sit by and idly \nallow this administration to trample our freedom of religion--that core \nAmerican principle--or whether we will stand and protect what our \nFounding Fathers put their lives on the line for and what millions of \nAmericans today will defend. We cannot pick and choose when to adhere \nto the Constitution and when to cast it aside in order to achieve \npolitical prerogatives. We must consistently stand for our timeless \nconstitutional principles. The debate that is taking place is a stand \nto protect an inalienable right, the right of conscience established in \nour Nation's founding days and sustained for over 200 years.\n  I regret that this issue has been reframed for political purposes \ninto a woman's right to choose, to deny women the opportunity to \nexercise their right to make a choice. That is not what this is about \nat all. Yet some have said it has been so successfully reframed that, \npolitically, those who defend this as a matter of religious conscience \nand freedom are on the losing side of the political argument. Well, we \nmay be or we may not be. I think it is up to this body to decide that \nwith a thorough debate and vote that puts our yeas and nays on the \nline.\n  Nevertheless, whether it is a winner or a loser politically, it is \nirrelevant to the argument. It should be irrelevant to the debate \nbecause this clearly is a fundamental principle of religious freedom \nthat needs to be protected regardless of the political consequences. So \nthose of us standing up to debate this are setting aside any kind of \npolitical risks, any advice that basically says: You don't want to \ntouch this because it has been reframed in a way that the American \npeople don't understand it. We are here to say that we stand to protect \nthe liberties that are granted to us by our Constitution and, \nregardless of political consequences, we will continue to do that.\n  Mr. President, I again thank Senator Blunt and all those who are \nwilling to address this issue and trust that our colleagues will see \nthis as a fundamental breach of a constitutional provision provided to \nus by the people who sacrificed their lives to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I want to go next to my neighbor in the Congress, and \nnow my neighbor in the Senate, and my neighbor in real life from \nnorthwest Arkansas. I am from southwest Missouri. I am glad Senator \nBoozman came down to discuss this issue.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri, and I \nappreciate his hard work and his leadership in bringing this amendment \nforward.\n  President Obama's accommodation of religious liberty in his revised \nhealth care mandate covering contraceptives, sterilizations, and \nmedicines causing abortion raises more questions than it answers. \nPerhaps the most troublesome part is that even with this revision, the \nPresident's mandate refuses to acknowledge that the Constitution \nguarantees conscience protections. He instead tries to run around them. \nYou don't ``accommodate'' religious liberties, you respect them. That \nis why they are enshrined in the Constitution.\n  Those constitutional protections should prevent the President from \ntrampling the conscience rights of Americans and religious institutions \nthat hold a strong belief that contraceptives, sterilizations, and \ndrugs causing abortion are wrong. Clearly, however, these \nconstitutional protections are not enough. President Obama's \n``accommodation'' shows that he considers conscience rights to be an \ninconvenience in his effort to remake America in his vision. That is \nwhy we need the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act. The Respect for \nRights of Conscience Act--introduced by my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Roy Blunt--seeks to restore conscience protections that existed \nbefore President Obama's health care law. These are the same \nprotections--and I think this is important--that have existed for more \nthan 220 years, since the first amendment was ratified.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Missouri has been offered to the \nsurface transportation act, and we expect to vote on it as early as \ntomorrow. The amendment's goal is commendable, and I look forward to \nsupporting it. It is simply asking the President to respect the \nreligious liberties of Americans.\n  Many longstanding Federal health care conscience laws protect \nconscientious objections to certain types of medical services. The \nPresident could have just as easily followed that course when he issued \na mandate requiring almost all private health insurance policies--\nincluding those issued by religious institutions, such as hospitals, \nschools, and nonprofits--to cover sterilizations and contraceptives, \nincluding emergency contraceptives at no cost to policyholders, but he \ndid not.\n  Now Congress must step up and protect the religious liberties of all \nAmericans. We can do this by passing Senator Blunt's amendment. I \ncertainly encourage all of my colleagues to take a close look at this--\nthis is so important--and restore the conscience protections we have \nalways stood for as a nation. I commend the Senator from Missouri and \nlook forward to supporting his amendment.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude in the next few minutes by first \nsaying that a growing list of groups support this amendment: Home \nSchool Legal Defense Association, Family Research Council, Southern \nBaptist Convention, Americans United for Life, American Center for Law \nand Justice, Susan B. Anthony List, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, \nU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Focus on the Family, Christian \nMedical Association, National Right to Life, National Association of \nEvangelicals, Orthodox Union of Jewish Congregations, Concerned Women \nfor America, Eagle Forum, Religious Freedom Coalition, \nCatholicVote.org, American Family Association, Catholic Advocate, \nTraditional Values Coalition, Christus Medicus Foundation, Alliance \nDefense Fund, Christian Coalition, Advanced USA, American Association \nof Christian Schools, American Principles Project, Wallbuilders, Let \nFreedom Ring Liberty Consulting, Liberty Counsel Action, Free Congress \nFoundation, Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, Students \nfor Life of America, Heritage Action, and there are others that are \nsupporting this amendment.\n  We can go back to 1965 and a Supreme Court case where the \ndetermination of how a conscientious objection would be defined was \nclearly established in ways that led to this religious belief and moral \nconviction becoming the standard. It is not just something we came up \nwith for this amendment, it has been the standard since that 1965 case. \nIt said: These are the elements you have to have. You cannot suddenly \ndecide you have a religious conviction. This is a conviction that has \nto be a provable part of who you are.\n  The Public Health Service Act in 1973, where Senator Church brought \nthis language into the public health arena, is really the first major \nlegislation after Medicare and the Medicaid discussion. There was also \nthe Legal Services Corporation limitation, the foreign aid funding \nlimitation, and the refusal to participate in executions or in \nprosecutions of capital crimes limitation. This language was good \nenough for those things, and almost every Member of the current Senate, \nif they were there then, voted for these, and since, including the \naction Senator Coats talked about earlier. The Medicare and Medicaid \nCounseling and Referral Act, the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan, contraceptive coverage for Federal employees in 1999, the DC \ncontraceptive mandate in 2000, and the United States Leadership Against \nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act in 2003 all included this \nlanguage. We had to get to the affordable health care act, which passed \nthe Senate, and then suddenly it wasn't possible to go through the \nfinal process of legislating here. There was no conference committee, \nno House bill. My belief is that almost nobody who voted for that act \noriginally thought that would be the final bill.\n  Frankly, I think that if we had ever had a more normal process, this \nnormal element of protecting the first amendment would have been added, \nas it was every other time. This is about the first amendment. I \nunderstand the\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\nfundraising ability to make it about something else. I understand the \nPR ability to make it about something else. But it is not about \nanything else.\n  A minute ago, we had three Protestants on the floor on the \ncontraception issue who probably have no religious problem at all. \nThere may be other elements I have problems with, but it doesn't matter \nif I have a problem. What matters is that I represent lots of people \nwho do have a problem with it, and the Constitution is specifically \ndesigned to protect those strongly held religious views.\n  As Senator Coats said, it was the first thing in the first amendment. \nIt was exact in its duplication in 1994 in the great health care effort \nmade then, whether it was the protection of religious freedom or the \nPatients' Bill of Rights or the effort First Lady Clinton worked hard \nto do. This wasn't even really a debatable item then because everybody \nunderstood this was a necessary part of protecting the first amendment \nto the Constitution.\n  Again, I would say if these two or three things that are most \nobjectionable to the Catholic community right now--and many of the \npeople who are opposed to this are opposed to this because they wonder \nwhat they could be opposed to that the government would decide they had \nto participate in, they had to be a provider of, they had to pay the \nbill for. I would ask my colleagues to think of something in their \nreligious view that they would not want to be forced by the government \nto be part of, and let's give all Americans that same capacity who have \nthese strongly held religious beliefs.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to support the first amendment. I am \ngrateful for those groups around the country that have rallied around \nthe first amendment. Freedom of religion defines who we are and has \ndefined who we are since the very beginning of constitutional \ngovernment, where the first thing added to the Constitution was the \nBill of Rights. And the first thing in the Bill of Rights is respect \nfor religion. We need to not give that away just to prove that \neverybody has to do what the government says because the government \nknows best rather than our conscience and our personal views.\n  This is not about whether people provide health care or not, it is \nabout whether they are required to provide elements of health care they \nbelieve are fundamentally wrong, and how the government can force \npeople to do things they believe and have a provable religious \nconviction are fundamentally wrong.\n  Mr. President, I think we have used the hour we had, but this debate \nwill go on. There will be a vote tomorrow, but this debate will go on \nuntil this important freedom is soundly protected in health care, in \nhiring, in all of the elements that create that faith distinctive in \nour individuals and institutions that make us uniquely who we are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to listen to my \ncolleague from Missouri as he talked about his amendment. I know he is \nvery sincere in his efforts to protect the first amendment, and if that \nis what this amendment was about, he would have my support. But let me \ntry to go over the amendment and put in context how it is drafted, \nbecause this amendment goes well beyond that.\n  I would agree with my colleague that the genesis of this amendment \nwas because of contraceptive services and the request from religious \ninstitutions not to have to provide coverage for those services. The \namendment we have before us, however, would allow an employer--any \nemployer--or any insurance company to deny essential medical services \ncoverage based upon a religious or moral objection. So the concern with \nthis amendment is that it would allow any employer in this country to \ndeny coverage of essential medical services in the plan that employer \nprovides. And that could cover women's health care issues; it could \ncover contraceptive issues, mammography screenings, prenatal \nscreenings, cervical cancer screenings. An employer could very well \nsay, I am against the moral issue concerning providing that coverage.\n  I don't believe the historical interpretations my colleague went \nthrough apply to those types of circumstances. This amendment would go \nwell beyond one particular service and would cover any medical service. \nIn fact, it says if an employer or insurance plan had any religious or \nmoral objection to a service it can choose to exclude that service from \nthe essential benefit package or the preventive services provisions of \nthe Affordable Care Act. Yes, it would affect women's health care. \nThere is no question about that. It would also affect the health care \nof men and of children.\n  The Affordable Care Act guarantees that all plans offered in the \nindividual small group market must cover a minimum set of essential \nhealth benefits, including maternity and newborn care; pediatric \nservices, including oral and vision care; rehabilitative services and \ndevices; and mental health and substance use disorder services, \nincluding behavioral health treatment.\n  Under the Blunt amendment, any employer could say, look, I don't want \nto cover rehabilitative services, for whatever reason--I have a moral \nobjection to it--and they could exclude that service. Preventive care \nwould be at risk, prenatal care would be at risk, life-saving \nimmunization could be at risk, developmental screening, mental health \nassessments, and hearing and vision tests. Any employer could make it a \njudgment not to cover any one of those services. Any insurance company \ncould, based upon a ``moral objection.'' That is a very broad standard.\n  That is why pediatricians and advocates for children across the \nNation oppose it. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \nCongress of Obstetricians oppose it, the Association of Maternal and \nChild Health Programs, the Children's Dental Health Project, Easter \nSeals, Genetic Alliance, the March of Dimes, and the National \nAssociation of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners oppose it. These are not \npolitical groups, these are health care groups. They know this \namendment could put at risk what we were attempting to achieve in the \nAffordable Care Act, and that is to make sure we have coverage for \nessential health services for all the people in this country.\n  Well, what if an employer could say, I don't want to cover preventive \nservices based on a moral objection? That could happen. This amendment \nwould allow employers to decline to offer life-saving screenings for \nprostate cancer screenings by simply citing a moral objection, even \nthough one in six men in the United States will be diagnosed with \nprostate cancer during their lifetime. Last year, 33,000 Americans died \nfrom prostate cancer.\n  An employer who claims a moral objection to cigarette smoking could, \nunder the Blunt amendment, deny employees coverage for smoking \ncessation programs or treatment for lung cancer. I have a moral \nobjection to smoking; I am not going to cover in my health care plans \ntreatment for lung cancer. More people die from lung cancer than any \nother type of cancer. More than 200,000 people are diagnosed with lung \ncancer each year and more than 150,000 die from it. Last year, 85,000 \nwere men.\n  An employer who claims a moral objection to alcohol consumption \ncould, under the Blunt amendment, deny coverage for substance abuse or \nrehabilitation or for medical treatment for liver disease, if it is \nfound to be the result of alcohol abuse.\n  Nowhere in the Affordable Care Act does it stipulate any American \nmust take advantage of the expanded preventive health services. Here is \nwhere we have an agreement. We have an agreement that we are not trying \nto tell anyone what they have to do. I have been a defender of the \nfirst amendment my entire legislative career. If you have a religious \nobjection to this, then don't use the services. Nowhere in the \nAffordable Care Act does it require a woman to use contraception or a \nman to have cancer screening or a child to receive well-baby visits. \nWhat the Affordable Care Act requires is that every American have \naccess to these services so they can decide for themselves, with the \nadvice of their physician, whether they are appropriate and healthy to \nutilize. If the Blunt amendment were used by employers to deny access \nto care, we are denying the people in this country the right to make \nthat choice themselves.\n\n  I agree it is not just contraceptive services, it is the choice to be \nable to have preventive services--to take care\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\nof your children, to have the screenings for early detection of cancer \nor to have treatment for serious diseases. All that could be put at \nrisk. The Affordable Care Act views health care as a right, not a \nprivilege, and it expands the freedoms available to American workers \nand their families rather than limits them.\n  I understand the intentions may be very pure. And if we want to have \na resolution saying we support the first amendment, you will have all \nof us in agreement on that. But when you say you are using that to \nremove from the Affordable Care Act the essential health coverage for \nservices that I think all of us agree should be available to every \nperson in this country, to make a decision whether he or she wants that \nhealth care, then this amendment could be used to deny them that \nability to get that health care. Whether it is women's health care \nissues, which was the genesis of this amendment originally, in the \ndebate we had a couple of weeks ago, or whether it is the care of our \nchildren or the care of each American, this amendment puts that at risk \nby allowing an individual employer or insurance company to make a \ndecision to eliminate essential health service coverage. I don't \nbelieve we want to do that, and I urge my colleagues to reject the \nBlunt amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the attack on \nwomen's health care that has been taking place over the last few weeks. \nThere has been a heated debate in Washington about access to \ncontraception for all women, regardless of her employer. There is a \nfundamental question here: Do women get control over their health care \nor do a small handful of people--the presidents of companies and the \npresidents of insurance companies--get to choose for a woman whether \nshe has access to birth control?\n  First, I think it is important to note that 98 percent of all women \nhave relied on contraception at some point in their lives. The \nnonpartisan scientists and experts at the Institute of Medicine who \nfirst recommended covering contraception without a copay did so because \nthere are tremendous health benefits that come from use. But now some \nin this Chamber are holding up this transportation bill, a bill that \nwould create more than 1 million jobs across the country and 7,000 jobs \nin Oregon, because, apparently, it is a higher priority to take away \nwomen's health choices, to come between a woman and her doctor.\n  How is this relevant to a transportation bill? The answer: It is not. \nBut regardless, we are going to vote on an amendment to this bill that \nwould allow those CEOs of companies and insurance companies the right \nto refuse coverage not just of contraception but of any health care \nservice they consider in violation of their personal convictions. So \nthe personal convictions of one will be imposed on the dozens or \nhundreds of thousands of employees of that company. That is an \nincredible philosophy.\n  I wish one of my Republican colleagues was on the floor to have a \nlittle conversation about it, because I would simply ask the question: \nPlease explain why you think that the CEO of a company should get to \ncome between a woman and her doctor and choose what health care she has \naccess to.\n  We talk a lot about big government. Well, this is big government. \nThis is big government, giving power to an individual who runs a \ncompany, making choices for dozens or hundreds or thousands of their \nemployees. Not only are we talking about contraception but any health \ncare service.\n  A company CEO could deny access to HIV or AIDS treatment, to \nmammograms, to cancer screenings, to maternity care, to blood \ntransfusions. The list goes on and on.\n  The Blunt amendment would allow an employer who objected to \npremarital sex to deny an unmarried pregnant woman maternity care. Is \nthat right, that an employer should make that choice for all the \nemployees who work for him or her? The Blunt amendment would allow an \nemployer to deny children of employees access to vaccines because the \nCEO has a conviction that the vaccine poses a risk. Is that right, that \nthe leader of a company should make that decision for Americans, coming \nbetween them and their doctors? The Blunt amendment would deny all \nhealth coverage if a CEO believes that physical health problems are \nsimply God's will. That is the imposition of one's religion on those \nwho work for you, making it their religious requirement. That is not \nthe way the Constitution is designed. The Constitution is designed to \nallow us to all follow our own course, not to impose our course on \neveryone else through an employment relationship.\n  The Blunt amendment would allow a CEO to say we are not going to \ncover end-of-life care because, in that conviction of that CEO--whether \nit be a man or a woman, the CEO believes that such end-of-life care is \ninterfering with God's will. The Blunt amendment would allow an \nemployer to deny access of folks who suffer from obesity to health \ncare-related obesity programs because they believe that obesity comes \nfrom a moral failing.\n  I think we can all understand with these examples that this is simply \nwrong--simply wrong--that a CEO should be able to take their personal \nconvictions and impose them on their employees.\n  This amendment is just the latest in a litany of extraordinary and \nextreme efforts by my Republican colleagues to curtail women's access \nto health care services. In the last year alone, Republicans nearly \nshut down the government over Planned Parenthood, tried to eliminate \ntitle X funding for low-income women's health, and tried to take away \npreventive services such as cancer screenings for women because of \nideological objections.\n  What this amendment is all about is that a few powerful CEOs dictate \nhealth coverage for the rest of America. If this, giving the powerful \nfew the ability to dictate coverage for everyone else, isn't an \noverreach by an overly intrusive government, I don't know what is.\n  Some have said that blocking women's coverage of contraception \nthrough their insurance doesn't affect access. They say that \ncontraception doesn't cost that much; that, in the words of one \nRepublican House Member, there is not one person who has not ever been \nable to afford contraception because of the price. Well, tell that to \nour young women between age 18 and age 34 who actually know what \ncontraception costs. More than half of women struggle to afford it at \nsome point. Tell that to a young couple struggling to figure out how \nthey can afford to buy their birth control and put food on the table \nfor their children. Tell that to a college student deciding whether to \nbuy textbooks or fill her prescription. The truth is, contraception is \nhugely expensive without insurance. Based on information compiled by \nthe Center for American Progress, the cost to an average woman using \nbirth control pills continuously between age 18 and menopause would be \nmore than $66,000 over the course of her lifetime if she had to pay out \nof pocket.\n  I think this point bears reinforcement, because I would never have \nimagined that that is the price of birth control. I think the House \nMember I was quoting probably had no idea of what contraception costs, \n$66,000 for a woman between the age of 18 and menopause. Where I come \nfrom, that is a lot of money. A lot of money. That is 5.5 years of \ngroceries for a family of four. That is putting two kids through the \nUniversity of Oregon with 4-year degrees, not including the cost of \nroom and board. That is a downpayment on a nice family home. In fact, \nwhere I come from, that is a third of the price of a nice family home. \nI think a lot of families would wish they had extra cash in their \npockets right now. And I certainly have heard from many women in Oregon \nwho are extremely concerned about the impact this amendment would have \non their pocketbooks and on their health.\n  Therese from Washington County writes to me:\n\n       As one of your constituents, and a practicing Catholic \n     woman on birth control, I am urging you to please back up the \n     President on this most recent decision requiring \n     contraception coverage for all of their employees . . .\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\n       There are many, many reasons women use the pill in addition \n     to preventing pregnancy. I have issues with pre-menopause. \n     There are lots of women I know who have heavy periods, \n     horrible acne, endometriosis, debilitating cramps . . . the \n     list goes on. And to not treat these ailments because the \n     treatment also prevents pregnancy is to allow women to \n     suffer.\n\n  Bridget from Multnomah County writes:\n\n       This amendment does not protect religious freedom. Rather, \n     it empowers insurance companies and businesses to impose \n     their religious views on their employees and the insured. It \n     is an example of government intrusion into the personal lives \n     of millions of women who would prefer to privately make their \n     own choice about family planning, without politicians \n     interfering.\n       It is incredibly, vitally important to me that you do not \n     support this amendment. I happily attended a Catholic college \n     and cannot imagine what I would have done had I found out \n     that my health insurance did not cover birth control. . . . \n     This would be a disastrous decision.\n\n  It is not Congress's job, it is not an employer's job, to impose our \nbeliefs on others. Let's let women and families make their own health \ncare decisions without the heavy hand of government intrusion being \nprovided from my colleagues across the aisle. Let's not put government \nbetween women and their doctors or between men and their doctors or \nbetween families and their doctors.\n  I am committed to fighting for women's health and will do whatever I \ncan to defeat this amendment--this amendment, which is so wrong on \nhealth care and so wrong on imposing religious views of one or personal \nconvictions of one on the many.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Merkley, \nthe Presiding Officer, and the others of my colleagues who will come to \nthe floor this afternoon to speak out against the Blunt amendment.\n  Over the past year, we have come to the floor many times to speak out \nagainst the attacks on women's health. Since this Congress began, we \nhave seen assaults on Planned Parenthood, on Federal funding for family \nplanning and on contraception. But now we are facing the Blunt \namendment which is even more extreme and far reaching than we have seen \nin all those other attempts to politicize women's health.\n  This proposal would affect health care not just for women but for all \nAmericans. It will affect the care of our children, of our husbands, \nand our wives. In short, the Blunt amendment would let your boss make \nyour health care decisions instead of you and your doctor. The \namendment would empower corporations or any other employer to deny \nvirtually any preventive or essential health service to any American \nbased on any religious or moral objection. I would point out that in \nthe bill, religious and moral objections are not defined. So it can be \nwhatever anybody interprets it to mean.\n  Under the amendment, an employer could claim a moral or religious \nbasis in order to deny things such as coverage for HIV/AIDS screenings \nor counseling, prenatal care for single mothers, mammograms, \nvaccinations for children, or even screenings for diabetes if the \nemployer claims a moral objection to a perceived unhealthy lifestyle.\n  While this amendment could affect men, women, and children, make no \nmistake; at the most fundamental level, this debate is about a woman's \naccess to contraception. Supporters of the amendment want to turn back \nthe clock on women's health. They want to deny women access to \npreventive health services.\n  Birth control is something most women use sometime in their lifetime, \nand it is something that the medical community believes is essential to \nthe health of a woman and her family. I would point out the decision \nthat the Blunt amendment claims to be addressing is one that was made \nnot for political reasons but for medical reasons by the Institute of \nMedicine, and it was made because contraception is important to women's \nhealth. It prevents unintended pregnancies. The United States has the \nhighest rate of unintended pregnancy in the developed world. \nApproximately one-half of all pregnancies here in America are \nunintended. Contraception can help women and families address this.\n  Access to birth control is directly linked to declines in maternal \nand infant mortality. In fact, the National Commission to Prevent \nInfant Mortality has estimated that 10 percent of infant deaths could \nbe prevented if all pregnancies were planned.\n  For some 1.5 million women, birth control pills are not used for \ncontraception but for medical reasons. As the Presiding Officer pointed \nout in that poignant letter from your constituents who pointed out all \nof the reasons that women could take contraceptives, it could reduce \nthe risk of some cancers, and it is linked to overall good health \noutcomes.\n  As Governor of New Hampshire, I was proud to sign a law back in 1999 \nthat requires health care plans to cover contraception. At that time, \nwe heard little controversy, little uproar, virtually no concerns about \nreligious exemptions to the law. The bill in New Hampshire back in 1999 \npassed the Republican-led State legislature with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. In fact, in the House, almost as many Republicans \nvoted for the bill as Democrats. I think that was because it was \nunderstood by people on both sides of the aisle of all religious faiths \nthat requiring contraceptive coverage was about women's health and it \nwas about basic health care coverage.\n  For 12 years, that law in New Hampshire has been in place with little \nopposition because it has worked. And it is particularly unfortunate, \nas we are having this debate about women's health, thinking about what \nhappened back in New Hampshire, to see this debate become so \npoliticized. It is not right. It is not what is the best interest of \nwomen's health, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the Blunt amendment.\n  The decision about a woman's health care should be between her, her \ndoctor, her family, and her faith. Let's not turn back the clock on \nwomen's access to health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, do we have a specific order here for \nspeaking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats currently have 30 minutes of \ntime.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am on the floor here today, as I was \nearlier, to talk about the dangers of this Blunt amendment.\n  Senator Blunt says it has nothing to do with providing health care to \nwomen; it has nothing to do with that. It is just about freedom of \nreligion, he says. Well, as many people say, when someone comes up to \nyou and says it is not about the money, it is about the money. And when \nsomeone says it is not about access to women's health, it is about \nreligious freedom, it is about access to women's health care. Why do I \nsay that? Because that is what this debate is all about. And we see it \nall over the country with rightwing Republicans trying to take away \nwomen's health care. Why are they trying to do this? You would have to \nask them. But we are here to say no.\n  The thing about the Blunt amendment is, it would not only say that \nany insurer or any employer for any reason could stop women from \ngetting access to contraception; it could also stop all of our families \nfrom getting access to essential health care services and preventive \nhealth care services.\n  Why do I say that? Let's take a look at the Blunt amendment. Enough \nof this chatter. Let's take a look at it. Here is what it says: A \nhealth care plan shall not be considered to have failed to provide the \nessential health care benefits package described in our law or \npreventive health care services described in our law if they exercise \nwhat they call a moral objection.\n  So say someone has a moral objection to someone who has smoked, and \nthe person wants to give up smoking and they want to get a smoking \ncessation program as part of their insurance. If the insurer says, That \nis your fault, you are not getting it; or someone may have diabetes and \nthe employer or the insurer says, You know what? That was your problem. \nYou ate too much sugar as a kid. Too bad.\n  That is what the Blunt amendment does and that is a fact. Here it is. \nI placed it here because this is the amendment. That is what it says.\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\n  I wish to show a list of preventive services and essential health \ncare services that the Blunt amendment threatens. Remember, the Blunt \namendment says there is a new clause that now says any insurer or any \nemployer can deny any one of these benefits: emergency services, \nhospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health treatment, \npediatric services, rehabilitative services--that is just some.\n  Here is the list of the preventive health care benefits that any \ninsurer or any employer could deny: breast cancer screenings, cervical \ncancer, hepatitis A and B vaccines, yes--contraception, HIV screening, \nautism screening, hearing screening for newborns.\n  This is the list. Why do I show this list? Particularly because I \nknow the Senator served on the HELP Committee and helped put this \ntogether. This is the list of services that was put together by the \nexpert physicians in the Institute of Medicine, this list, preventive \nhealth care, and this list, essential health benefits.\n  I was stunned to come on the floor and hear Senator Ayotte invoke the \nname of our dear colleague and our dearly missed colleague, Ted \nKennedy. She tried to imply that he would support the Blunt amendment.\n  She is not the first Republican to do it. I am calling on my \nRepublican friends to stop right now because there are several reasons \nwhy they are wrong to do that. First of all, Ted Kennedy, in one of his \nlast acts, voted for the health care bill. He voted for the health care \nbill that came out of the HELP Committee. He helped to write the \npreventive section. He helped to write the essential health benefits \nsection. He would never ever--as his son has said--support the Blunt \namendment that would say to every employer in this country if they \ndon't feel like offering any of these, they don't have to.\n  He fought hard for these. He wouldn't give an exception to an \ninsurance company or a nonreligious employer, never.\n  How else do I know that to be the case? I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a list of bills that Senator Kennedy \ncosponsored.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       S. 766, Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive \n     Coverage Act of 1997.\n       S. 1200, Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive \n     Coverage Act of 1999.\n       S. 104, Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive \n     Coverage Act of 2001.\n       S. 1396, Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive \n     Coverage Act of 2003.\n       S. 1214, Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive \n     Coverage Act of 2005.\n       S. 21, Prevention First Act (110th Congress).\n       S. 21, Prevention First Act (111th Congress).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. What are these bills? These are bills that called for \nequity for women to get contraceptive coverage. If they were given \nother coverage, they had the right to get contraceptive coverage. Ted \nKennedy was a leader. He is a cosponsor on all these bills. Do you know \nfor how many years? Thirteen years. For thirteen years, Ted Kennedy \nfought for women to get access to contraceptive coverage in their \ninsurance.\n  I say to my Republican friends, don't come to the floor and invoke \nthe name of our dear colleague. I was so proud that the first thing I \ndid when I came to the Senate, he asked me if I would help him work on \na bill to protect people who were going to clinics, women's clinics, \nwho were being harassed at the clinic door. You know what. I worked it \nfor him. I helped him on the floor, and I was so proud we won that. Now \nthere is a safety zone for women when they go to a clinic for their \nhealth care, their reproductive health care. That was Ted Kennedy.\n  Yes, Ted Kennedy supported a conscience clause--we all do, and \nPresident Obama has taken care of that. He has stated clearly in his \ncompromise that if you are a religious institution, you do not have to \noffer birth control coverage. If you are a religiously affiliated \ninstitution, you don't have to cover it directly but you do indirectly. \nThat was a Solomon-like decision by our President. But that is not \nenough for my Republican colleagues. They have to fight about \neverything.\n  I ask unanimous consent also to have printed in the Record the letter \nPatrick Kennedy wrote to Senator Brown.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                February 26, 2012.\n     Hon. Scott Brown,\n     Suite 100, 337 Summer Street,\n     Boston, Massachusetts.\n       Dear Senator Brown: In your current radio ad and in many \n     news reports, I hear you claim my father would have joined \n     you in supporting an extreme proposal now before the U.S. \n     Senate that threatens health care coverage for women and \n     everyone. Your claims are misleading and untrue.\n       Providing health care to every American was the work of my \n     father's life. The Blunt Amendment you are supporting is an \n     attack on that cause.\n       My father believed that health care providers should be \n     allowed a conscience exemption from performing any service \n     that conflicted with their faith. That's what was in his 1995 \n     law and what he referenced to the Pope. That is completely \n     different than the broad language of the Blunt Amendment that \n     will allow any employer, or even an insurance company, to use \n     vague moral objections as an excuse to refuse to provide \n     health care coverage. My father never would have supported \n     this extreme legislation.\n       You are entitled to your own opinions, of course, but I ask \n     that, moving forward, you do not confuse my father's \n     positions with your own. I appreciate the past respect you \n     have expressed for his legacy, but misstating his positions \n     is no way to honor his life's work.\n       I respectfully request that you immediately stop broadcast \n     of this radio ad and from citing my father any further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Patrick J. Kennedy.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. In that letter, he said: ``You are entitled to your own \nopinions but I ask that, moving forward, you do not confuse my father's \nposition with your own.''\n  He said: ``I appreciate the past respect you have expressed for his \nlegacy, but misstating his positions is no way to honor his life's \nwork.''\n  I ask my colleagues in this debate, come and state their own views, \nbut don't misstate the views of a dear departed colleague who for 13 \nyears supported a woman's right to have access to contraception.\n  I think people watching this today have to be a bit confused because \nwhen they look up at the screen it says we are on a transportation \nbill. Indeed we are. Indeed we have been on it for almost 3 weeks now. \nI say to my colleagues who know the importance of this bill: Please, \nlet us get to it. Let us get to the heart of the matter. We have a huge \nunemployment rate among construction workers. The unemployed \nconstruction workers could fill 15 Super Bowl stadiums. That is how \nmany are unemployed. We need to get to this bill.\n  It is important to our businesses. It is important to our workers. It \nis important to our communities. It is important for our safety. It is \nimportant to fix the bridges and the highways. It is important to carry \nout the vision of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who said it \nwas key that we be able to move people and goods through our great \nNation.\n  When Olympia Snowe, our very respected colleague from Maine, told us \nyesterday she would not seek reelection, she said it was because there \nis so much polarization here. I said this morning, this bill is exhibit \n1. Here we have an underlying bill that came out of four committees in \na bipartisan way. It means we can save 1.8 million jobs, create up to 1 \nmillion new jobs, and guess what. The first amendment is birth control, \nwomen's health, an attack on women's health. We have to come to the \nfloor and stand on our feet and fight back.\n  You know what. I am proud to do it. I am proud of the men and women \nwho have stood on this floor and have come to press conferences and \nbeen on conference calls fighting for women's rights. But this issue \nwas decided a long time ago. We know access to contraception is \ncritical for people. A full 15 percent of women who use it use it to \nfight debilitating monthly pain or to make sure tumors do not grow any \nlarger or for severe skin conditions, and the rest use it to plan their \nfamilies.\n  When families are planned do you know what happens? The babies are \nhealthier. The families are ready. Abortions go down in number. It is a \nwin-win. We all know that and I always thought we could reach across \nthe aisle and work together to make sure there was family planning. But \ntoday just proves the opposite, our colleagues on the other side, the \nRepublicans, are bound and determined to go after women's health.\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\n  I stand opposing the Blunt amendment, thanking my colleagues for \ntheir eloquence, and hoping we can dispose of it, defeat it, and get \nback to our Transportation bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Blunt amendment \nwhich simply goes way too far. The President has struck the right \nbalance in his decision to address religious institutions' concerns \nwhen it comes to providing women's health services, but this amendment \ngives all employers shockingly broad discretion to make moral decisions \nfor their employees, fundamental decisions about some of the most \npersonal issues an individual faces--the health care needs of \nthemselves and their families, a woman's decision about contraception \nand family planning, decisions about whether their child gets a blood \ntransfusion for deadly disease, decisions regarding the use of \nprescription drugs, decisions on who to treat and how to treat them--\nbased entirely on an employer's moral views, not an individual's moral \nbeliefs.\n  The bottom line is health services should not be provided at the \nmoral discretion of an employer but on the medical determination of the \nemployee and their doctor. According to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, 1.7 million New Jerseyans, almost 500,000 children, \nover 600,000 women and over 600,000 men benefit from the expanded \npreventive service coverage from their private insurers that we created \nunder the law: screenings for colon cancer, mammograms for women, well \nchild visits, flu shots, a host of other routine procedures. All these \ncould be taken away under this proposed amendment should their employer \ndetermine it is against their personal beliefs or convictions.\n  Every day, millions of Americans who are worried about a health \ncondition go to see their doctor. Millions of women go for necessary \nscreening and access to legal medical procedures. Their doctor \nevaluates their condition and recommends a course of treatment and that \ncan range from simple preventive measures, such as exercise and diet, \nto a prescription drug regimen, to major surgery. The last thing a \nwoman or her doctor should have to concern themselves with is whether \ntheir employer will deem their medical treatment to be immoral based on \ntheir employer's personal beliefs, regardless of their own beliefs or \nneeds. The last thing they need is to be denied coverage by an employer \nwho would be allowed, under this amendment, to effectively practice a \nform of morality medicine that has nothing to do with accepted medical \nscience or the affected individual's personal beliefs.\n  Under the language of this amendment, that is exactly what would \nhappen. It would allow employers simply to deny coverage based on a \nparticular religious doctrine or moral belief, regardless of the \nscience, medical evidence or the legality of the prescribed treatment. \nPut simply, we expect our health insurers, no matter where we work, no \nmatter what our faith, to cover basic benefits and necessary medical \nprocedures recommended by our doctor and then we as individuals should \nhave the right to decide which of those benefits we use based on our \nown personal beliefs, our medical diagnosis, and our treatment options. \nJust because one person makes one decision or holds one belief doesn't \nmean someone else will do the same. That is what freedom is all about.\n\n  The arbitrary denial of coverage based on anything other than good \nscience and rational medical therapy was the driving force behind the \nneed for health care reforms that ensured that if one paid their \npremiums, they would be covered, freeing families from having to choose \nbetween putting food on the table, paying their mortgage or using their \nsavings to pay for medical treatment because an insurer, based on their \nown rules, refused to cover them.\n  With this amendment, we are turning back the clock and allowing the \narbitrary denial of coverage based on someone else's sense of morality. \nThat is not what America is about. It is not what freedom of religion \nis about.\n  In a system predicated on employer-based health insurance coverage, \nin which workers often forgo other benefits such as wage increases in \nexchange for coverage, it is vitally important to ensure families can \ncount on their coverage to provide the treatments and benefits they \nneed. We can continue doing so, as we have for many years, while \nrespecting people's personal moral beliefs.\n  Supporters of this amendment claim it is about protecting religious \nfreedom. They are wrong. Supporters of this amendment claim that recent \nregulations guaranteeing a woman's access to preventive health care \nservices is a governmental overreach. They are wrong. What supporters \nof this amendment are actually trying to accomplish has nothing to do \nwith either of those issues. It has to do with trying to dismantle \nheath care reform to score cheap political points and throw America's \nmothers, daughters, and sisters under the bus in the process.\n  This amendment is not about religious freedom. The President rightly \naddressed that concern with a recent compromise he announced for \nreligious institutions. No, it is about allowing morality-based \nmedicine to deny coverage for neonatal care for unwed women, to deny \naccess to lifesaving vaccines for children, to refuse to cover \nmedications for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases or even \ndeny coverage for diabetes or hypertension because of an unhealthy \nlifestyle. The scope of this amendment is unlimited.\n  If it were truly about religious freedom or about contraceptives, \nthen why have so many nationally respected organizations that have \nnothing to do with birth control, reproductive issues or religion, such \nas the Easter Seals, the March of Dimes, the Spina Bifida Association, \ncome out in such strong opposition? The answer is simple, because the \namendment isn't about birth control and it isn't about religious \nfreedom. The amendment is about fundamentally undermining our system of \npatient protections, especially for women, and leads us backward to a \ntime when insurance companies and employers could play life-or-death \ngames with insurance coverage. Supporters of this amendment will stop \nat nothing to undermine the progress made thanks to health care reform, \nprogress that says insurance companies can no longer deny coverage \nbecause of a preexisting condition, can no longer impose arbitrary caps \non the coverage you can receive or cancel a policy because of a \ndiagnosis they deem too expensive to cover. In my view, it is shameful \nthat they are using women's health and access to vital preventive \nservices as a scapegoat for a larger anti-health agenda. Any attempt to \nsay otherwise is wrong.\n\n  Let me close by saying to allow any employer the ability to deny any \nservice for any reason is doing a disservice to the people we \nrepresent. We would be turning the Constitution on its head to favor a \nmorality-based medical decision over good science and over the \nrelationship between a patient and their doctor. This is an incredibly \noverreaching amendment with radical consequences, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it and preserve the progress we made on trying to \nlevel the playing field for workers and patients in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey for his remarks, and most particularly for the \nremarks of my friend and colleague from California. She has fought this \nfight along with the dean of our women, Senator Mikulski, year after \nyear and time after time.\n  Before I speak about the Blunt amendment, I wanted to express that \nthe retirement or announced perspective retirement of Senator Olympia \nSnowe is, for me, a heartbreak. I have regarded her as one of the most \nimpressive Senators in our body. She still has many good years ahead of \nher. I have had the pleasure of working with her on a number of bills. \nMost importantly, we did really the only fuel economy improvement that \nhad been done in 20 years in the 10-over-10 bill. What is interesting \nabout it is it was a bipartisan bill and it got passed thanks to \nSenator Ted Stevens who was Vice-Chairman of the Commerce Committee at \nthe time and it was put in his bill. So it was really quite wonderful \nto see that happen.\n  This is my 20th year here, along with my friend and colleague Senator\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\nBoxer, and over the last 10 years what I have seen is more and more \nattacks on women and women's health, stemming largely from the abortion \ndebates, but not only that. We have fought--and Senator Mikulski has \nled the way--for equal pay, we have fought against discrimination, \nattacks on Title X Family Planning grants, attempts to defund Planned \nParenthood, and attempts to limit access to preventive health care such \nas contraception. These attacks to limit a woman's right to make her \nown reproductive health care choices have now escalated to an \nunprecedented level. I am not going to go into the specifics of some of \nthem, but trust me, I never thought I would see people in public office \nput forward some of the bills out there. I believe strongly that all \nwomen should have access to comprehensive reproductive care, and should \nbe able to decide for themselves how to use that care regardless of \nwhere they work or what insurance they have.\n  The other side of the aisle has tried to take away access not only to \ncontraception but also primary and preventive screenings for low-income \nwomen that are provided by the Title X Family Planning program and by \nPlanned Parenthood. Title X programs serve over 5 million Americans \nnationwide, Planned Parenthood almost 3 million. They are not minor, \nthey are major, and for many individuals it is their only source of \ncare. And now here we are defending not just women's rights but the \nrights of all Americans to have access to essential and preventive \nhealth care benefits.\n  I strongly oppose this latest attack in the form of the Blunt \namendment, and I join my colleagues on the floor to speak about the \nharm that this amendment will do.\n  I think it was stated by Senator Menendez that the amendment is \nvague. In its vagueness it becomes a predicate for any provider, \nemployer, or insurer to decline to provide to cover a myriad of health \ncare benefits simply on the basis of religious beliefs or moral \nconviction. There is no statement in the legislation as to what the \nreligious belief or moral conviction has to be, when it begins, or when \nit ends. It is an excuse as to why they do not want to do something.\n  What does this mean? Well, what it means in reality is 20 million \nwomen could be denied any preventive health care benefits, including \ncontraception, mammograms, prenatal screenings, and cervical cancer \nscreenings. In addition, 14 million children--and this is right--could \nbe denied, under this Blunt amendment, access to recommended preventive \nservices including routine immunizations, necessary preventive health \nscreenings for infants, and developmental screenings.\n  In my State alone an estimated 6.2 million individuals--2.3 women, \n1.6 million children, and 2 million men--could be denied access to the \npreventive health services afforded to them by the health reform law, \nwhich incidentally is four typewritten pages, single spaced, a list of \npreventive health services. This debate is not about religious freedom. \nIt is about allowing providers and employers the right to deny access \nto care for autism screening, STD and cancer screenings, and well-baby \nexams for any reason. All they have to say is they have a moral concern \nwith it, that their conscience bothers them.\n  For instance, any employer could refuse to cover screening for type 2 \ndiabetes because of moral objections to a perceived unhealthy \nlifestyle. A health plan could refuse to cover maternity coverage for \nan interracial couple because they have a religious or moral objection \nto such a relationship. The only thing this amendment does is protect \nthe right to deny. It doesn't give anything. It allows denial. It does \nnothing to protect the rights of employees to access fundamental health \ncare.\n  The radical wing of the Republican Party does not speak for most of \nthe women in this country. About 100 organizations nationwide oppose \nthis amendment, including the National Partnership for Women and \nFamilies, National Physicians Alliance, Human Rights Campaign, and the \nAmerican Public Health Association.\n  Earlier we heard from an intensive care nurse who had worked 37 years \nin intensive care in a Boston hospital who said people get the best \ncare essentially when the politicians stay away, and I believe that. I \nhave heard to date--and I am sure Senator Boxer has heard from a \nsimilar number--from 11,500 constituents in my State, Senator Boxer's \nState, who oppose this amendment and have grave concerns about its \nimplications. I don't need to tell the women in this body that we have \nhad to fight for our rights. No one has given women anything without a \nfight. We had to fight for our right to inherit property, our right to \ngo to college, our right to vote, and for the last 10 years, the right \nto control our own reproductive systems. We will continue to fight the \nBlunt amendment and other attempts to roll back the clock.\n  I urge my colleagues to think carefully about the long-reaching \nimplications of this amendment and oppose it. Senator Boxer shared with \nme a letter, and she indicated that she had read one part of it. I wish \nto read another part of it. This is a letter from Patrick Kennedy to \nScott Brown, and I want to read this paragraph because it involves \nsomeone everybody on this floor knows sat right over there at that desk \nfor years and was known as the lion of the Senate. When he stood on his \nfeet, everyone listened. Here is what Patrick Kennedy said:\n\n       My father believed that health care providers should be \n     allowed a conscience exemption from performing any service \n     that conflicted with their faith. That's what was in his 1995 \n     law and what he referenced to the Pope. That is completely \n     different than the broad language of the Blunt amendment that \n     will allow any employer, or even an insurance company, to use \n     vague moral objections as an excuse to refuse to provide \n     health care coverage. My father never would have supported \n     this extreme legislation.\n\n  It is signed Patrick Kennedy, and I believe Senator Boxer put the \nletter in the Record so anyone who wishes to see the whole letter has \naccess to it. But I hope this amendment is defeated on the floor.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from the neighboring State, Maryland, \nthe dean of the women, is on the floor.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend the \ntime on the Democratic side for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. I want to thank my colleagues who \nhave spoken on this amendment, particularly those who oppose the \namendment.\n  I come to the floor today with sadness in my heart. I come because \nover the weekend one of our Maryland National Guards was killed in \nAfghanistan. He was one of two men working in a building in which he \nwas attacked by someone he trusted at the Interior Service, and it \nappears that he was assassinated. I talked to his widow. We are sad. We \nare sad that somebody who went to defend freedom was killed in such a \nterrible way.\n  I am sad because last night I spoke to a dear friend of mine whose \nhusband is very ill from the ravages of brain cancer, and we remembered \nso many good times we had together, but those good times don't seem \npossible in the future. I want so much for her to be with her husband \nand not think about the consequences of costs and so on.\n  Last night we learned that our very dear friend and colleague, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, is going to retire not because she is tired but \nbecause she is sick and tired of the partisanship. Senator Snowe is not \ntired. She is sick and tired of the partisanship. And you know what. So \nam I.\n  We have a highway bill here. We have an unemployment problem. We \ncould solve America's problems and get it rolling again, and if we pass \nthe highway bill--with the appropriate debate on amendments germane to \nthe bill--we could do it. So I am really sad.\n  I am sad that I have to come to the floor to debate an amendment that \nhas no relevance to the highway bill. And I am sad because we are so \ntied up in partisan politics and scoring political points that we don't \nlook at how we can get our troops out of Afghanistan. How can we make \nsure we have a budget that can fund the cure for cancer and at the same \ntime make sure any\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\nfamily hit by that dreaded C word doesn't go bankrupt during care?\n  I am devastated that a dear friend and extraordinary public servant \nis so fed up with how toxic we have become that she chooses not to run \nfor office again. So I want to be serious, and therefore you need to \nknow I am really sad about this, but I also am frustrated about this. \nSo I want to talk about this Blunt amendment because we have heard \nnothing but mythology, smokescreens, and politics masquerading as \nmorality all day long.\n  Let me tell you what the Blunt amendment is not. It is not about \nreligious organizations providing health care and the government saying \nwhat the benefits should be. It is not about affiliated religious \norganizations and the government saying what the service is to be. This \namendment is about nonreligious insurance companies and nonreligious \nemployers. It is about secular insurance companies and it is about \nsecular employers. The Blunt amendment allows that any--any--health \ninsurer or employer can deny coverage for any health service they \nchoose based on something called religious beliefs and moral \nconvictions.\n\n  Now, there is a body of knowledge that defines religious beliefs, but \nwhat is a moral conviction? That is not doctrine. That is a person's \npersonal opinion. A moral conviction, no matter how heartfelt, no \nmatter how sincere, no matter how fully based upon ethical principles, \nis still a person's personal opinion. So we are going to allow the \npersonal opinions of insurance companies and the personal opinions of \nemployers to determine what health care a person gets. What happened to \ndoctors? What happened to the definition of essential health care? So \nthis is not about religious freedom; this is not about religious \nliberty because it is not even about religious institutions. So let's \nget real clear on this Blunt amendment.\n  This amendment is politics masquerading as morality. Make no mistake. \nThe politics is rooted in wanting to derail and dismember the \nAffordable Care Act and our preventive health care amendment.\n  So what the Blunt amendment does, as I said, is allow any insurer or \nany employer to deny coverage based on religious beliefs or moral \nconvictions. Well, what that essentially means is this: Let's look at \nexamples. If an employer has a conviction, a personal opinion, against \nsmoking, they can refuse to cover treatment for lung cancer or \nemphysema. If an employer has a personal opinion that they call a moral \nconviction that doesn't approve of drinking alcohol, they can refuse to \ncover any program for alcohol treatment or substance abuse.\n  Let's say there is an employer who doesn't believe in divorce and \nthey say: I will not cover health care for anybody who is divorced \nbecause I have a moral conviction against that. Suppose a person says--\nthere are some schools of thought that say: I have a moral conviction \nthat a woman can only see a woman doctor, and I will not cover anything \nwhere she is seen by a male physician. Where are we heading? These are \nnot ridiculous examples. It puts the personal opinion of employers and \ninsurers over the practice of medicine.\n  This is outrageous. This is vague. It is going to end up with all \nkinds of lawsuits--let's speak about lawsuits. While some have been \npounding their chests talking about religious freedom and the \nConstitution, what is also in the Blunt amendment is this whole idea \nthat gives employers access to Federal courts if they believe they \ncan't exercise the amendment. This is a new lawyers full employment \nbill.\n  I am shocked because the other party is always trashing lawyers. They \nare always trashing the trial lawyers associations. Now they have \ncreated a whole new right--or an opportunity--for Federal court action, \nclogging the courts on this particular issue.\n  This is why Americans are so fed up. They want us to focus on health \ncare. They want us to focus on how to lead better lives.\n  Let me talk about how we got here in the first place. Do my \ncolleagues remember why we had health reform legislation? I remember \nbecause it still exists: 42 million Americans are uninsured; 42 million \nAmericans are uninsured for health care.\n  This is the fifth anniversary of a little boy in Prince George's \nCounty who died because he could not have access to dental care. His \ninfection was so bad, so severe, and there was nobody to see him. His \nmother was too poor to be able to pay for it. That little boy, in the \nshadow of the Capitol of the United States, died.\n  Now, that is why we work for the Affordable Care Act. People can call \nit ObamaCare. I don't care what people call it. I call it an \nopportunity for the American people to get what a great democratic \nsociety should provide.\n  Then, we not only looked at what was uninsured, we also looked at the \nissues around women. Senator Stabenow held a hearing, and I held a \nhearing, and guess what we found. Women pay more for their health \ninsurance than men of equal age and equal health status. Nobody said \nthat is a social justice issue. Well, I have a moral conviction about \nthat. I have a really deeply felt moral conviction that if you are a \nwoman, you shouldn't be discriminated against by your insurance \ncompany.\n  We also found that women were denied health care because of \npreexisting conditions. We found that in eight States, if a person was \na victim of domestic violence, they were doubly abused--not only by \ntheir spouse, but they couldn't get insurance coverage because they \nsaid the cost of physical and mental health care would be too much. \nWell, I had a moral conviction. I had a moral conviction that if you \nare a victim of domestic violence, you shouldn't be denied health care. \nI had a real strong moral conviction about that.\n  Then, during my hearing, I heard a bone-chilling story. It wasn't \njust me; it was all who attended. There was a woman who testified that \nshe had a medically mandated C-section. Then she was told by her \ninsurance company, in writing, that she had to get sterilized in order \nto receive health insurance. The insurance company was mandating \nsterilization for her to get coverage. I nearly went off my chair.\n  At that hearing there was a representative of the insurance company. \nThey had no moral reaction to that. They had no moral reaction to that. \nI had a reaction. I had a really big one. That is why we got the \namendments we did, where you could not deny health care on the basis of \npreexisting conditions. So I have a lot of moral convictions about \nthis: that in the United States of America no child should die because \nof the absence of health care; no woman should be discriminated against \nin the health care system; and, at the same time, a person needs to be \nable to have the opportunity to get the services their doctor says they \nneed.\n  The other thing on our agenda was to not only save lives, but to save \nmoney, and we knew that prevention was the way to go. I came to the \nfloor and offered the preventive health amendment. It was a great day. \nMany women spoke for it. It was primarily oriented toward women, but it \nwas going to cover men as well. It was going to make sure that early \ndetection and early screening would save lives. We spoke about the \nnecessity for mammograms. We spoke about the necessity for screening \nfor diabetes and heart disease and the kinds of things that, if \ndetected early, could save lives. That bipartisan amendment passed.\n  Then, after it was passed, and after the bill passed, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services said: Preventive benefits should be \ndefined not by politicians and not by a bureaucrat at HHS but by the \nmedical community. So she requested the Institute of Medicine to define \nthe preventive health care benefit. The preventive benefits we are \ntalking about that Senator Blunt says an employer doesn't have to \nprovide came from the Institute of Medicine. It didn't come from the \nCongress. It didn't come from bureaucracy at HHS. It came from a \nlearned, prestigious society that we turn to--the Institute of \nMedicine. This is what they said are the essential preventive services \nthat would save lives as well as save money.\n\n  So this is where this came from. Now, some are on the floor saying: \nIf you have a moral conviction against what the Institute of Medicine \nsays is an essential benefit, you could go ahead and do it. Again, we \nare not talking about religious institutions who are employers; we are \nnot talking about religious-affiliated institutions; we are talking \nabout nonreligious institutions.\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\n  Ordinarily I would call this amendment folly, but this is a \nmasquerade. I think it is just one more excuse to opt out of the \nAffordable Care Act. It is one more excuse to opt out of ObamaCare. \nThey want to opt out, but I think it is a cop-out, and we have to stop \nmasquerading that this is about morality or the first amendment or \nsomeone's religious beliefs.\n  So I hope we defeat this Blunt amendment. Most of all, I wish we \ncould get back to talking about the serious issues affecting the \nAmerican people. I am going to bring those troops home. I sure want to \nfind that cure for cancer and help come up with the resources so we can \ndo it. I am going to be sure that no little boy ever goes through what \nDeamonte Driver and his family had to suffer.\n  Let's defeat the Blunt amendment. Let's get back to the highway bill. \nLet's get America rolling--and how about let's start functioning as an \ninstitution that focuses on civility and finding the sensible center \nthat America has been known for in other years when we had the ability \nto govern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before the Senator from Maryland leaves \nthe floor, I think it is an opportunity to thank her so much for \nspeaking the truth today on the floor of the Senate--just the facts--\nand what the Blunt amendment is about and isn't about. Also, I watched \nher recite the history of trying to bring preventive care and essential \nhealth care benefits to our people, realizing that she was in that \npivotal position in the HELP Committee.\n  I remember her looking at me one day--because we are very close \nfriends; we are not on that particular committee together--and she said \nto me: Senator Kennedy asked me--I just get the chills when I think of \nit--to take on this issue of prevention and work with Tom Harkin and \nChris Dodd and step to the plate on these essential benefits and on \npreventive benefits. She literally raised this issue, particularly on \nthe prevention side--I don't know if the Presiding Officer remembers--\nin caucuses, on the floor, in the committee, at press conferences, that \nwe could have a new day in health care in this country because although \nwe spend more than any country in the world, we are not getting the \nsame results because we haven't invested in prevention.\n  As she said, it is not up to politicians to decide what prevention \nshould look like; it is up to the doctors. Under the Senator's \nleadership and that of Senators Harkin and Dodd and all the wonderful \nmembers of the HELP Committee, as well as the Finance Committee--and, \nyes, Ted Kennedy in the background because he was quite ill, but he \nsent his messages, and his staff helped--they came up with a list of \nessential health care services that nobody could ever quarrel with. \nThey also came up with a list of preventive health care services that \nwere so critical to all of us, particularly to women. The great news: \nProving to us that when we invest in prevention, we save so much down \nthe line. We all know this is a fact.\n  Access to contraception, by the way, was put on the list not by \npoliticians but by the Institute of Medicine because it is known that \nif the individual chooses that route to plan their families, that means \nwe have fewer abortions and it means we will have healthier families, \nhealthier babies. And many people take the birth control pill as \nmedicine to prevent debilitating monthly pain. It is prescribed for \nskin diseases. It is prescribed to make sure cysts on ovaries do not \nkeep growing and growing and possibly lose an ovary.\n\n  But what has happened--and I guess I want to ask my friend one \nquestion before she leaves--is that the Blunt amendment would say that \nanybody, for any reason, any day, could cancel out that whole list of \npreventive and essential health care services that she fought so hard \nfor.\n  So when they say this is about religious freedom, no, no, no; that \nhas been taken care of by our President. In terms of any provider that \nis religious or religiously affiliated, they do not have to provide \ncontraception directly. Even Catholic Charities' response was ``We are \nhopeful that this is a step in the right direction . . . '', the \nCatholic Health Association supports the compromise, and so on. So I \nwant to ask my friend, is she aware that when Congressman Issa held a \nhearing on women's health care, there was not one woman on the panel, \non that first panel? Did she see those photos of that panel that was \ncalled to speak on women's health?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Oh, I sure did, and it was deja vu all over again, I \nsay to my colleague from California, because it was like the Anita Hill \nhearings. The Senator remembers what happened there.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I do.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. During that time, there was not one woman on the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. This is not new. The discrimination against women has \nbeen around a long time. I consider discrimination against women one of \nthe great social justice issues, whether you are a secular humanist or \nyou have core beliefs in an organized religion.\n  I found not only the picture appalling, but I want to reiterate what \nwe have been saying here: There is a systematic war against women. We \ndo not get equal pay for equal work. We are often devalued in the \nworkplace. We worry more about parking lot slots for our cars than \nchildcare slots for our children. Then, when it comes to health care, \nwhat was so great about the preventive amendment was, first of all, we \ntalked not only about family planning, where women could have the \nchildren they knew they could care for, but we talked about prenatal \ncare. We talked about making sure our children had the opportunity for \nviability and survivability at birth.\n  So, yes, it was both a picture of us not being included, but it shows \nwe need to be able to fight to be heard. The issue is, women's voices \nare not being heard, and I am saying today the voices of women are \nbeing heard and the voices of good men who support us. I am telling \nyou--not you, Senator Boxer, but I am saying out loud--if this Blunt \namendment passes, I believe the voices of women will be heard. They \nwill be heard on the Internet. They will be heard in streets and \ncommunities. Most of all, they will be heard in the voting booth.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I just want to thank my colleague from \nMaryland for her eloquence and for her fighting spirit. The year I came \nhere was following on the Anita Hill issue, when the world saw and this \ncountry saw we had no women on the Judiciary Committee. Now, our \nPresiding Officer sits on that committee. Senator Feinstein and Senator \nMoseley-Braun were the two women to serve on that committee after we \nsaw there were no women, and they paved the way for my good friend to \nbring her fabulous background and expertise to the table.\n  But when Congressman Issa, the chairman of the committee that had no \nwomen on a panel talking about women's health--imagine, no women. Do we \nhave that photo, Cerin? Do we have the photo of the five men testifying \nabout women's health, talking about women's access to contraception, \ntalking about birth control? Not one of those men ever gave birth as \nfar as I know, unless they are a medical miracle. This photo I have in \nthe Chamber I think is changing this country this year because a \npicture is worth thousands of words. Look at this picture, and we see \nover on the House side on that Republican side, that is who they want \nto hear from. When a woman in the audience said to the chair of that \ncommittee: Can I speak? I think I have some important information, he \nsaid she was not qualified. So I suppose if a person wants to be \nqualified to speak about women's health, they have to be a man. Her \nstory she wanted to share was of a friend who was unable to get access \nto birth control because her employer did not offer it, and she was too \nfinancially strapped to purchase it. As a result, a cyst on an ovary \nbecame so large and so complicated she lost her ovary.\n  Now, I just want to say to my colleagues, we are on a highway bill. \nWe have to be kidding that we have now wasted 3 weeks because we are so \nconsumed with attacking women's health. Get over it. We are not going \nto go back. The women of this country will not allow it.\n  Look what happened in Virginia. They had a plan. They were going to\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\nmandate an invasive procedure, a humiliating procedure, a medically \nunnecessary procedure to women. In Virginia the women said: What? And \nthe Governor said: Whoops, I have some ambitions to do more than this. \nI better change.\n  I just want to say to my colleagues: Vote this down. Table this \namendment, this Blunt amendment. This is not going to get us anywhere. \nWhat does it do to create one job--except new jobs for attorneys, as it \nsets up a whole no right of action. I am sure the trial lawyers are \ngoing to love the Republicans for this bill. It sets up a whole new \nright of action because somebody is going to say: I have a moral \nobjection against giving cancer treatment to a child because I think \nprayer is the answer. Somebody will sue, and that employer will sue, \nand they will sue and they will sue and there will be money, money, \nmoney going to lawyers. Great. What did that do to help one child? What \ndid that do to make somebody feel better? What did that do to create \none job?\n  I know the leaders on both sides are trying to figure out a pathway \nforward on this highway bill. I am just saying, we better have a \npathway forward. I want to say to the Presiding Officer sitting in the \nchair, who was a proud member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--and I hated to lose her, but everybody wanted her on their \ncommittee, so I lost her--she knows how it is. She lives in a State \nwhere a bridge collapsed. She fought hard to get that bridge rebuilt in \nrecord time. She knows how important it is to protect people by making \nsure our bridges are safe, that we have safe roads to schools, that we \nhave good transit alternatives, that we fix our roads and our highways.\n  Madam President, 70,000 of our bridges are deficient, 50 percent of \nour roads are not up to standard, and we are voting on birth control? \nCome on. What is next? Egypt? They have a whole list of things that \nhave nothing to do with the highway bill. Bring it on. Let the people \nsee who is stopping progress, who is stopping this bill because at the \nend of March do you know what happens. We run out on the authorization \nof the highway bill. We run out on the authorization of the \nTransportation bill. We run out, and we will lose 630,000 jobs right \nthen and there.\n\n  Instead, we can get this bill done. It is terrifically bipartisan. It \ncame out of the committee 18 to 0. It came out of other committees with \na bipartisan vote. We can get on with it, protect 1.8 million jobs, and \ncreate up to another 1 million jobs. Madam President, 2.8 million jobs \nare at stake, and we are debating birth control.\n  I think this is resonating in the country. All of a sudden, people \nwake up and they say: What are they doing there? What is happening \nthere? When they see this, it is going to be very clear we have a bill \nthat has been stuck on the floor for 3 weeks because the Republicans \nare demanding votes on matters that have nothing to do with the highway \nbill. The first one is on birth control. They are talking about \nsomething on Egypt. They are talking about something on--oh, this is a \ngood one--repealing an environmental law that is keeping arsenic, lead, \nand mercury out of the air. They want to repeal that law. Great. That \nis great. That will really do something to make us safe.\n  So I am ready for these amendments. Come on to the floor. Give us a \ntime agreement. Let's get on with it. Let's then allow the germane \namendments to be offered.\n  The last comment I will close with is this because it is haunting me: \nThe picture of 15 football stadiums, with every seat filled, would \nequal the number of unemployed construction workers we have out there \ntoday. Well over 1 million suffering because they cannot find \nconstruction work.\n  So I can only say, it is time to get this birth control amendment \nbehind us. Let's beat it. Let's beat the Blunt amendment. It is a \ndisaster. It is dangerous. It is hurtful. It is irrelevant to this \nbill, and it is dangerous for the country. Stop invoking the name of a \ndeparted colleague. Respect his family. Respect his memory. Let's get \nthis vote over with. Let's go to the business at hand and create the \njobs the American people are crying for.\n  I am very pleased to see a colleague has arrived, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I come here today to speak about my \namendment No. 1591, which is a bipartisan amendment to repeal the \nfreight railroad industry's undeserved exemptions to the antitrust \nlaws, exemptions that result in higher prices to hundreds of businesses \nand millions of consumers every day. These outmoded exemptions do \ndamage to numerous industries across our country--industries that are \nvital to our economy and to the job market.\n  From power companies that rely on coal shipped by rail, to farmers \nshipping grain, to chemical companies that rely on rail to transport \nraw materials, to paper companies that ship their finished products via \nrail, the railroad's antitrust exemption leads to higher prices and \nrenders rail shippers at the mercy of rail monopolies engaged in \nanticompetitive practices.\n  The railroads enjoy these antitrust immunities despite the industry's \nvery high levels of concentration--with four freight railroads \ncontrolling nearly 90 percent of the market as measured by revenue and \ndividing up the country so that they face very little, if any, rail \ncompetition in many areas of our country.\n  This amendment is very simple. Wherever the law provides freight \nrailroads with an antitrust exemption, this amendment repeals it. In \nthis way, the railroads will have to abide by the same rules of free \ncompetition as virtually every other industry. This amendment is \nidentical to the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act, bipartisan \nlegislation that has passed the Judiciary Committee by overwhelming \nmargins in this Congress as well as in the past two.\n  Virtually no industry--other than baseball and insurance--enjoys the \nsweeping nature of the antitrust exemptions as does the freight \nrailroad industry. Yet, paradoxically, the consolidated nature of the \nfreight railroad industry makes full application of antitrust law even \nmore necessary.\n  Just three decades ago there were more than 40 class I freight \nrailroads in the United States. But today, after massive waves of \nconsolidation, nearly 90 percent of industry revenues are controlled by \njust four railroads. Many areas of the country are served by only one, \nleaving their shippers captive to rate increases and anticompetitive \nmeasures.\n  The effects of these antitrust exemptions protecting monopoly \nbehavior are easy to see. Increased concentration, combined with a lack \nof antitrust scrutiny, have had clear price effects. A September 2010 \nstaff report of the Senate Commerce Committee stated:\n\n       The four Class I railroads that today dominate the U.S. \n     rail shipping market are achieving returns on revenue and \n     operating ratios that rank them among the most profitable \n     businesses in the U.S. economy.\n\n  Since 2004, this report found ``Class I railroads have been raising \nprices by an average of 5% a year above inflation.''\n  The four largest railroads nearly doubled their collective profit \nmargins in the last decade to 13 percent, ranking the railroad industry \nthe fifth most profitable industry as ranked by Fortune Magazine. A \n2006 GAO report furthermore found that shippers in many geographical \nareas ``may be paying excessive rates due to a lack of competition in \nthese markets.'' Given the industry's concentration and pricing power, \nthe case for full-fledged application of the antitrust laws is plain.\n  It is more than just railroad shippers who pay the price of a \nrailroad industry unchecked by antitrust oversight. These unjustified \ncost increases cause consumers to suffer higher electricity bills \nbecause a utility must pay for the high cost of transporting coal, \nhigher prices for goods produced by manufacturers who rely on railroads \nto transport raw materials, as well as higher food prices for everyone.\n  Railroad monopoly conduct ripples through the economy, causing pain \nin countless corners of commerce. The current antitrust exemptions \nprotect a wide range of railroad industry conduct from antitrust \nscrutiny. Unlike virtually every other regulated industry, the Justice \nDepartment cannot bring suit to block anticompetitive mergers--a fact \nthat has greatly aided the sharp industry consolidation I have already \ndescribed.\n  Private parties and State attorneys general cannot bring private \nantitrust\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\nlawsuits to obtain injunctive relief, leaving pernicious industry \npractices such as bottlenecks and paper barriers exempt from antitrust \nreview. Railroad practices subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface \nTransportation Board are effectively immunized from antitrust remedies. \nOur amendment will eliminate these exemptions once and for all. \nRailroads will be fully subject to antitrust law and will have to play \nby the same rules of free competition that all other businesses do.\n  The rail industry's widespread grant of antitrust exemptions has its \norigin decades ago when the industry was subject to extensive \nregulation by the long-ago abolished Interstate Commerce Commission. \nBut no good reason exists today for these exemptions to continue.\n  While railroad legislation in recent decades, including, most \nnotably, the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, deregulated much railroad rate-\nsetting from the oversight of the Surface Transportation Board, these \nobsolete antitrust exemptions remained in place, insulating a \nconsolidating industry from obeying the rules of fair competition. \nThere is no reason to treat railroads any differently than dozens of \nother regulated industries in our economy that are fully subject to \nantitrust.\n  When this amendment was filed a couple of weeks ago, the railroad \nindustry responded by claiming this amendment ``goes way beyond \nantitrust laws and looks to create new regulatory law on matters \nunrelated to antitrust, and in so doing treats [railroads] differently \nthan other regulated industries.''\n  These arguments are completely without merit. Nothing in this \namendment goes ``way beyond antitrust law'' or ``looks to create new \nregulatory law.'' In fact, this amendment creates absolutely no new \nregulatory law whatsoever. It simply repeals all of the antitrust \nexemptions enjoyed by the freight railroad industry.\n  This amendment would not treat railroads any differently than other \nregulated industries. The mere fact that an industry is regulated does \nnot exempt it from antitrust law. Many other regulated industries, \nincluding the telecommunications sector regulated by the FCC and the \naviation and trucking industries regulated by the Department of \nTransportation, are fully subject to antitrust law.\n  This amendment simply seeks to end the special exemption from \nantitrust law enjoyed by freight railroads--an exemption which is both \nwholly unwarranted and raises prices to shippers and consumers every \nday.\n  Dozens of organizations and trade groups representing industries \naffected by monopolistic railroad conduct have endorsed the Railroad \nAntitrust Enforcement Act, which is identical to this amendment. \nSupporters of the legislation have included 20 State attorneys general \nin 2009; the leading trade associations for the electrical, \nagricultural, chemical, and paper industries; the National Industrial \nTransportation League; and the Nation's leading consumer groups.\n  In sum, by clearing out this thicket of outmoded antitrust \nexemptions, this amendment will cause railroads to be subject to the \nsame laws as the rest of our economy. Government antitrust enforcers \nwill finally have the tools to prevent anticompetitive transactions and \npractices by railroads. Likewise, private parties will be able to \nutilize the antitrust laws to deter anticompetitive conduct and to seek \nredress for their injuries.\n  In the antitrust subcommittee, we have seen that in industry after \nindustry vigorous application of our Nation's antitrust laws is the \nbest way to eliminate barriers to competition, to end monopolistic \nbehavior, and to keep prices low and quality of service high. The \nrailroad industry is no different. All those who rely on railroads to \nship their products, whether it is an electric utility for its coal, a \nfarmer to ship grain, or a factory to acquire its raw materials or ship \nout its finished product, deserve the full application of the antitrust \nlaws to end the anticompetitive abuses all too prevalent in this \nindustry today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Wilbur K. Hoffman\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, my late friend, the late Alex Haley, \nthe author of ``Roots,'' lived his life by these six words: Find the \nGood and Praise it.\n  I am here today to praise a remarkable hero who served in one of the \nmost difficult battles in our Nation's history and who today at 90 \nyears old lives a quiet life in Memphis with his family.\n  Wilbur K. Hoffman, or ``Bill'' to his fellow Rangers, was a member of \nthe Dog Company of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, which in 1944 was among \nthe select few companies that stormed the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc on D-\nday and turned the war around for the Allies.\n  Forty years after Bill Hoffman and his fellow 2nd Battalion Rangers \nclambered up the rocky cliffs on the shoreline of France, President \nReagan returned to the windswept spot to pay tribute. President Reagan \ncalled them ``the boys of Pointe du Hoc.'' The President said:\n\n       These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the \n     champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes \n     who helped end a war.\n\n  This is Bill Hoffman, a hero who helped free a continent and end a \nwar.\n  Bill volunteered to join the Army in 1942. A year later he \nvolunteered to join the Rangers, a select group that were charged with \nspecial missions. Bill says that because of all of their special \ntraining, they would simply ``get the mission done.''\n\n  Bill got out of the Army in 1945, after the war, but took a look at \nthe job market and said, ``I think I'll go back in.'' Bill served in \nthe Army for 24 years. Bill likes to say, ``Everything that happened, I \nvolunteered for.'' And if you happen to ask how he feels when he looks \nback, he will say just as plainly, ``No regrets.''\n  This year the Army has awarded Bill a Purple Heart. But not for the \nfirst time. During World War II, the Army tried. But Bill, in an Army \nward surrounded by soldiers who had lost arms and legs in fighting, \nbelieved his wounds did not measure up, and so he said, ``I don't think \nso.''\n  Bill's son David, more than 60 years after his father first declined \nthe Purple Heart, contacted the Army about trying again. Capturing his \nfather's humility in declining the medal decades ago, David calls his \ndad ``the nicest guy you'll ever meet. Friendly and outgoing but by the \nsame token, he doesn't like to talk about himself'' says the son.\n  Bill is the father of seven children, and nearly all of them who \ncould join the service did or married someone who did.\n  Bill is not a native Tennessean. He was born in Newark, NJ. He came \nto Tennessee first as a Ranger in training. The Rangers came from all \nover the country and assembled in Camp Forrest in Tullahoma for \ntraining. Bill's wife came down to visit him there for a couple of days \nduring training, and it must have had a real effect on her, because \nmore than 30 years later, after Bill was out of the Army after 24 years \nof service, and they were living in New York State, Bill's wife said to \nhim, ``I want to go to Tennessee. I like it down there.'' So they \npacked up the U-Haul and moved to Ashland City, along the Cumberland \nRiver.\n  Today Bill is one of only three Rangers left from the original 2nd \nBattalion Dog Company. While the Ranger reunions used to occur once \nevery 2 years, the guys are getting old, Bill says, and now they are \ndoing them every year. ``Good bunch of guys,'' Bill calls his fellow \nheroes. ``They say Ranger friendships are forever. It's true.''\n  Bill turns 91 on Friday. It is an honor for me to wish this American \nhero a happy birthday.\n  Congratulations, Bill Hoffman. We're proud of you. Your Nation is \nproud of you. ``Find the good and praise it.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe Transportation reauthorization bill that is currently before the \nSenate. It is called the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century \nAct, so we call it by its acronym, MAP 21. It is a\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\ncritical piece of legislation that will put Americans back to work and \nlay the foundation for future economic growth.\n  Our transportation infrastructure has long been at the heart of \nAmerica's success, from the transcontinental railroad to the interstate \nhighway. Yet, across the country, the infrastructure that helped build \nour great economy has been allowed to fall into disrepair.\n  For evidence of our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, one need look \nno further than my home State of Rhode Island. Anyone who drives to \nwork or school in our State sees the problems--bridges that are subject \nto weight restrictions, highways with lane closures, and roads \neverywhere marked with potholes. Only one-third of our highway miles \nare rated in fair or good condition; the majority are poor or mediocre. \nAccording to a recent report, one in five bridges in Rhode Island is \nstructurally deficient--the fourth highest figure for any State. You \nlook nationwide, and the picture does not improve.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers rates our national \ntransportation systems as near failing. They give our roads and \nhighways a D-minus, our bridges a C, our freight and passenger rail a \nC-minus, and our transit systems a D. This is not the kind of report \ncard you want to post at home on your refrigerator, and it is not one \nour great Nation should tolerate.\n  Instead of committing ourselves to solving our infrastructure \ndeficit, however, we continue to fall short. The civil engineers \nestimate that we would need to dedicate $250 billion each year to bring \nour transportation systems into a state of good repair. At current \nlevels, the United States spends only 2.4 percent of GDP on \ninfrastructure, compared with European nations at 5 percent and China \nand India at about 9 percent.\n  Let's recall why it is so important that we invest in transportation. \nOur economy relies on the ability to get goods and services to where \nthey are needed. An entrepreneur cannot start a business if his \nemployees cannot get to work. A manufacturer cannot stay in business if \nits products cannot reach its customers. A free market can only operate \nif supply can actually get to demand. Our roads, trains, and buses are \nwhat allow this to happen.\n  If we don't make the necessary investment, our global competitors \nnevertheless will. MAP 21 represents a downpayment that will fund \nimportant highway, transit, and rail projects to repair our aging \ntransportation infrastructure and help ensure that America can succeed, \nas it has since we first broke ground on the Interstate Highway System.\n  As important as this bill is to our long-term prosperity and our \nglobal economic position, MAP 21 also provides immediate support to \nlocal construction projects and the quality jobs that go along with \nthem.\n  It is estimated that MAP 21 will protect 1.8 million existing jobs \naround the country, with the potential to create up to a million more \nnew jobs. This is particularly important given the high level of \nunemployment in the construction industry. In my home State of Rhode \nIsland, this bill would support an estimated 8,100 jobs. At a time when \nour State's unemployment rate hovers stubbornly around 10 percent, \nthose jobs are absolutely crucial.\n  Given the decrepit state of our transportation systems, it should be \nobvious that we will have to address our infrastructure needs at some \npoint. We need to do this work sooner or later, and there is no better \ntime to make that investment than now, with so many workers ready to \nget to work and so many projects ready to get underway. I know that in \nRhode Island there is no shortage of workers or worthwhile \ntransportation projects. In fact, Secretary of Transportation LaHood \nwas in Providence today, and I invited him to tour one of the most \nsignificant of Rhode Island's transportation projects, and that is the \nProvidence viaduct. That viaduct is an overland highway bridge that \ncarries Interstate 95 for nearly a quarter mile through downtown \nProvidence, our capital city. It is one of the busiest stretches of the \nentire I 95 corridor.\n  The viaduct runs north and south over U.S. Route 6 and State Route \n10, the Amtrak northeast corridor, commuter, and freight rail lines, \nand over the Woonasquatucket River. It provides access to downtown \nProvidence, four universities, Rhode Island Hospital, our convention \ncenter and arena, and the Providence Place Mall, not to mention the \nnorth-south traffic along the eastern seaboard that traffics through \nthis area.\n  What Secretary LaHood saw on his tour today is a bridge that is quite \nliterally crumbling. The viaduct was built in 1964, and it is showing \nits age. Its deck is badly deteriorated, steel girders are cracked and \ndon't meet minimum specifications for brittleness, and our State \ndepartment of transportation has installed these wooden planks under \nthe I-beams to keep concrete from falling through onto the cars, \npedestrians, and even the trains that travel underneath the highway. \nYou can also see here where a section of the concrete has fallen \nthrough the supports, exposing the steel reinforcement, which is now \nrusting out in the open.\n  While the viaduct remains safe for travel today, it is a weak link in \nthe critical I 95 corridor. It is a potential safety hazard for the \n160,000 vehicles that travel on it each and every day, as well as to \nthe cars and trains that pass underneath. The bridge is inspected on a \nregular basis, just as a precaution. If the viaduct were to fail or \nsimply require posted weight limits, it would cause substantial \nregional disruptions to traffic and commerce and trade.\n  Clearly, this is a problem that needs to be addressed. The cost of \nrepairing the Providence viaduct is estimated at roughly $140 million. \nThis is a reasonable investment to help ensure the flow of commerce \nthrough the entire Northeast, but it represents a very significant \nfinancial burden for a small State such as Rhode Island. Fixing the \nviaduct would take out almost two-thirds of the money that Rhode Island \nwould get from this bill. Rhode Island simply isn't big enough and \ndoesn't have the resources to tackle this important project and still \nmeet our other transportation obligations.\n  I have filed an amendment to MAP 21 to fund the program for the \nProjects of National and Regional Significance Program. The Projects of \nNational and Regional Significance Program is a competitive grant \nprogram that is designed to support critical, high-cost transportation \nprojects that are difficult to complete with existing funding sources. \nThis program can help us address those big infrastructure projects \naround the country--ones such as the viaduct--that are currently being \nkicked down the road because the State DOTs cannot scrape enough money \ntogether to get them underway.\n  The Projects of National and Regional Significance Program is \nauthorized in MAP 21. We got that done in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. Now we need to get that authorized program funded. I \nam pleased to have the support of my senior Senator, Jack Reed, and \nSenator Merkley on this amendment. I look forward to working with them \nand other Senators so that we can start the important work of \nrebuilding critical infrastructure projects, such as the viaduct, that \nare so important to our economy.\n  While I am thanking other Senators, let me recognize Senator Olympia \nSnowe for her work on another amendment that would grant States limited \nflexibility to use congestion mitigation and air quality funds toward \ntheir transit systems. This is an important issue for Rhode Island, as \nwe begin to scale up our new South County commuter rail.\n  I introduced a version of this amendment in committee and continue to \nbelieve that increased flexibility in the Congested Mitigation and Air \nQuality Program, or CMAQ, would promote State-level transit options \nthat we so critically need.\n  Let me thank our chairwoman, Senator Boxer, and her ranking member, \nSenator Inhofe, for their consideration of our amendment and, more \nimportant, for their hard work on this bill overall. As a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I can testify that the \nleadership of Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe, working \ntogether, is what has made the difference for this transportation \nreauthorization. Through their efforts, we were able to unanimously \nvote the bill out of committee, making the important statement that \ninvestment in our Nation's infrastructure\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\nhas strong, bipartisan support. They have set an example that I hope \nultimately will be followed by the handful of Senators who are \nobstructing progress on this transportation bill, and our colleagues on \nthe other side of this building. The American people deserve better \nthan efforts to gut transportation jobs and slash infrastructure \nprograms, or to slow down progress on this bill with irrelevant \namendments.\n\n  With our economy struggling to get back on its feet, with our roads \nand bridges in desperate need of repair, now is not the time to be \ndebating unpopular and misguided efforts to roll back protections for \nwomen's health. Now is not the time, and this is not the bill, to \ndebate whether we should undermine rules that protect our environment \nor fast track a pipeline project that is clearly not ready for prime \ntime. We have a bipartisan bill before us. We have a bill that will \ncreate jobs. We have a bill that will get our economy moving forward. \nThat should be our priority. We should get to the business of \nlegislating on this bill.\n  This is a country that does big things. We built highways and rail \nsystems connecting Americans from coast to coast. We built skyscrapers \nand airplanes and rockets to take us to the Moon and back. Big things \nare part of America's national identity. Just as important, they are a \nvital source of jobs during this trying economic time.\n  Let's keep doing big things. Let's give the people in Rhode Island \nand across the country a transportation infrastructure they can be \nproud of, and let's not cut funding and retreat. We cannot afford to go \nbackward. The infrastructure is what supports our economy. We need to \nrefocus on the job of getting America moving ahead, and MAP 21 is a \nstep forward.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank Senator Whitehouse of Rhode \nIsland for his words. Also, he is an exceptional member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works committee. First and foremost, he brings \nus the point of view of his State and he fights on every issue every \nday. He brings national leadership to the floor on the issue of \ninfrastructure and the need to keep up with our incredible failing \ninfrastructure--the fact that we have to fix these bridges, 70,000 of \nwhich are insufficient, and 50 percent of the roads that are not up to \npar. In Rhode Island, we have serious problems, and the Senator has \nbrought those to the floor. He is a leader on a clean and healthy \nenvironment, protecting the air and water for his people.\n  The Senator could not be more eloquent. He is making a point that we \ncould come up with very difficult amendments and slow things up and gum \nup the works, et cetera, but doesn't my friend think that with so many \nconstruction workers out of work--they have well over 15 percent \nunemployment in the construction industry, which is about twice the \nnational rate, which is too high as it is--we have a chance to protect \n1.8 million jobs and create another million jobs, and isn't it time to \nsay that birth control was an issue that was resolved decades ago and \nlet's move on to the task at hand and put people back to work?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It doesn't make sense. I thank her for getting us to \nthis point. I know how much frustration she must feel, having worked so \nhard and in such a bipartisan way to get us to this point and to now \nhave a process that would get this bill moving forward and get funding \nout there, get infrastructure repaired, put men and women to work in \ngood, solid, high-paying jobs, only to be all snarled up so that a \nsmall group of people can score points with a political issue that has \nnothing to do with transportation, infrastructure, or highways.\n  If people want to have a fight about whether women should get access \nto contraceptive medicine, I suppose that is their right in the Senate. \nBut the idea to stop a highway bill to forge that fight is what to me \nis irresponsible.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know my colleague worked very hard on the health care \nbill, am I right on that?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I remember him being so proud of the prevention piece he \nbrought to us. He made the case to us publicly, and privately in \ncaucus, that it would save so much money for the American people. Right \nnow, we know, for example--and I just read this--if you have colorectal \nscreening, you are 50 percent less likely to die of colorectal cancer. \nThis is a screening test.\n  We certainly know about mammography and all of this. Is my colleague \naware that what the Blunt amendment says is that any employer, \nreligious or not, any insurance company, religious or not, can withhold \nany one of those preventive services from being offered to employees if \nthey had some kind of vague moral objection? Is my colleague aware that \nall the work he put in on making sure that insurers cover our people \nfor preventive services, such as mammography, colorectal screening, HIV \nscreening, and all of these important benefits, plus a list of \nessential benefits just as important, that all of that could come to \nnothing if the Blunt amendment passed and an employer woke up and said: \nI know how to save money, I will have a moral objection and not offer \nanything? Is my friend aware of how deep this Blunt amendment reaches \ninto health care reform?\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank my chairman, and yes, it is kind of \nastonishing, the breadth and the scope of this amendment. As if CEOs \ndon't have enough power over their workforce, as if they haven't done \nenough to send jobs from American factories offshore to factories \noverseas, now they would be able to dictate what kind of health care \ntheir employees can receive, and not based on marketplace \nconsiderations, not based even on health considerations, but based on \ntheir own unchecked moral or religious beliefs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think it is a terrible mistake to go down that \nroad, but I think it is a double mistake: it is wrong to go down that \nroad in the first instance, but it is also wrong while we need jobs so \nurgently, while our highways crumble and our bridges deteriorate and \nwater works continue to fail and we have the ability to put people to \nwork in America at good jobs. You can't offshore a job building an \nAmerican highway; you have to do it right here in this country. These \nare important jobs and this is important work. We should be getting \nabout this.\n  I think it sends a terrible signal to the American people when the \nSenate, taking up this piece of legislation, has to be led off into all \nthese other battles that have nothing to do with highways, that have \nnothing to do with infrastructure, that have nothing to do with jobs, \nbut are simply an exercise in political gamesmanship.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is unfortunate, when there are real stakes for \nreal families on the table and real time slipping by, that we don't get \nthis done. We get jacked up enough around here, but as hard as the \nchairman has worked to bring this to the floor and to be ready, here we \nare, stopped again, dealing with irrelevant issues again, and all for \nthe entertainment and distraction of people. It is not about jobs, it \nis not about the economy, it is not about our infrastructure, it is not \nabout laying the foundation for future prosperity, and so it is \nfrustrating that we have to go through this exercise.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. When I looked at him, I thought, He is \none of the few people who have such a personal stake in two issues that \nhave been merged together, unfortunately: the Blunt amendment, which \nwould allow anyone to opt out from providing so many of the services my \nfriend worked to make sure the American people have, plus 3 weeks we \nare now delayed on a bill my friend helped me with so strongly and so \npowerfully. So I wanted to make sure people in his State understood \nthat he has worked so hard to make sure people have access to health \ncare, and the Blunt amendment would drive a big Mack truck through \nthis--not to use a kind of funny analogy on the highway bill, but that \nis what it would do, in the meantime stopping us from getting on to our \nwork in creating all these jobs.\n  My feeling is we will defeat the Blunt amendment tomorrow. I am very \nhopeful. But with that in mind, Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a number of letters speaking to \nthe Blunt amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1133]]\n\n\n                                          American Cancer Society,\n\n\n                                        Cancer Action Network,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2012.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of millions of cancer patients, \n     survivors and their families, we write to express our \n     opposition to the amendment proposed by Senator Roy Blunt to \n     the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act that \n     would permit employers to refuse employee insurance coverage \n     for any health benefit guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act \n     if the employer raises a religious or moral objection to \n     those benefits.\n       Annually, seven out of ten deaths among Americans are \n     attributed to chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, \n     heart disease and stroke. The Affordable Care Act made \n     significant strides to stem this epidemic by ensuring \n     patients would have access to essential care that could \n     address prevention, early detection, and treatment--all \n     necessary elements to improve the health and well-being of \n     our nation.\n       Unfortunately, the expansive nature of the proposed Blunt \n     amendment would directly undercut this progress. \n     Specifically, it would allow any health insurance plan or \n     employer, with a religious affiliation or not, to exclude any \n     service required by the Affordable Care Act if they object \n     based on undefined ``religious beliefs or moral \n     convictions.'' The implications of this provision could \n     result in coverage denials of lifesaving preventive services \n     such as mammograms or tobacco cessation based on employer \n     discretion. Consider the reality that under the amendment a \n     tobacco manufacturer could refuse coverage of tobacco \n     cessation benefits for its employees.\n       We urge all members of the Senate to consider the undefined \n     impact this amendment could have on employee health care \n     coverage, and to please vote against it. Thank you for your \n     consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Christopher W. Hansen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Trust for America's Health,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2012.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment & Public Works, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Boxer, I am writing to express my deep \n     concern over the Blunt Amendment, which is expected to be \n     offered during the debate over S. 1813, Moving Ahead for \n     Progress in the 21st Century (MAP 21). This amendment would \n     undermine the Affordable Care Act's guarantee that all \n     insurance plans cover preventive services and would do \n     serious harm to our efforts to reduce the rate of chronic \n     disease in this country.\n       One of the most important provisions in the Affordable Care \n     Act (ACA) was the requirement that preventive services be \n     covered with no cost-sharing. Chronic diseases--such as heart \n     disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes--are responsible for 7 \n     out of 10 deaths among Americans each year and account for 75 \n     percent of the nation's health spending. Including preventive \n     services within essential health benefits represents a \n     critical opportunity to ensure that millions of Americans \n     have access to prevention-focused health care and community-\n     based preventive services. This is essential if we are to \n     address risk factors for chronic diseases--such as tobacco \n     use, poor diet, and physical inactivity--which will allow us \n     to improve the health of Americans and reduce health costs \n     over the long term.\n       The Blunt Amendment would allow any health insurance plan \n     or employer, religious or not, to exclude any preventive \n     service if they object based on undefined ``religious beliefs \n     or moral convictions.'' This is an extraordinarily broad \n     provision which could result in coverage denials for \n     virtually any preventive service. Americans should be able to \n     count on a minimum level of coverage no matter where they \n     work, and this amendment sets a dangerous precedent.\n       Transportation legislation is an opportunity to expand \n     access to healthy transportation choices, such as walking and \n     cycling, which will keep our communities moving by providing \n     healthy, safe, and accessible transportation options. It \n     should not be a forum for re-opening the ACA and reversing \n     gains we have made in prevention and public health. I hope \n     the Senate will defeat the Blunt Amendment and instead focus \n     on amendments to MAP 21 that would promote good health and \n     21st century transportation policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jeffrey Levi, Ph.D.\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Feburary 13, 2012.\n       Dear Senator, on behalf of the more than 2.1 million \n     members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), \n     I urge you to oppose an amendment offered by Senator Blunt \n     (S. Amdt. 1520) to the surface transportation, \n     reauthorization bill (S. 1813) that would allow employers to \n     deny coverage for contraception and other critical health \n     care services.\n       The Affordable Care Act, in an enormous step forward for \n     working women and their families, requires all new health \n     insurance plans to cover certain preventive healthcare \n     services with no cost-sharing or co-pays, including \n     mammograms, pap smears, and well-woman yearly exams. Starting \n     this August, most health insurance plans will be required to \n     cover women's preventive services, including contraception. \n     This is a tremendous milestone for women's health and \n     equality in our country.\n       Unfortunately, the Blunt Amendment is an extreme proposal \n     that turns back the clock on this important advance, allowing \n     employers to impose their beliefs on their employees and take \n     away the health care benefits their employees would otherwise \n     be entitled to receive. The Blunt Amendment allows any \n     employer to deny insurance coverage for any essential health \n     benefit or preventive service to which the employer has a \n     religious or moral objection, including contraception, as \n     well as many other health services.\n       As the nation's largest union of nurses, doctors, and \n     healthcare workers, we know that women's healthcare choices \n     are too often driven by the reality that the cost for gas and \n     groceries comes first. Contraceptive use is the rule, not the \n     exception, for women who can afford it. In fact, 99 percent \n     of women overall and 98 percent of Catholic women use \n     contraception at some point in their lives. Women should have \n     the freedom to make personal, private decisions about their \n     families and their future with their doctor and their loved \n     ones. An employer has no place in that decision-making \n     process.\n       We urge you to oppose the Blunt Amendment when it comes up \n     for a vote on the Senate floor. SEIU may add votes on this \n     amendment to our scorecard, located at www.seiu.org. Should \n     you have any questions or concerns, contact Steph Sterling, \n     Legislative Director, at steph.sterling\n     @seiu.org or at 202 730 7232.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mary Kay Henry,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 29, 2011.\n       Friends, this week the Senate may consider an amendment by \n     Senator Blunt (R MO) that would eliminate access to essential \n     health benefits for millions of Americans. The Human Rights \n     Campaign (HRC) strongly urges your boss to vote no on the \n     Blunt Amendment. HRC will consider this a key vote.\n       When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in March of \n     2010, the intent was to ensure that all Americans had access \n     to health insurance. More specifically, it required that a \n     core set of benefits be covered, including preventive care \n     specially designed for women and children. The essential \n     health benefits package was carefully crafted to respect \n     religious interests and individual conscience. To that end \n     the ACA includes a strong exemption, allowing approximately \n     335,000 churches/houses of worship to refuse to provide birth \n     control for their employees. In response to concerns raised \n     by religiously-affiliated hospitals, universities and other \n     facilities, the President has proposed additional protections \n     that would allow those entities--which operate as businesses \n     and serve and employ the broader public--not to provide birth \n     control coverage, but still ensure that their employees have \n     access to that benefit.\n       HRC respects the right of religious groups to maintain \n     their beliefs and the important role religious organizations \n     play in providing important health, education and social \n     services. The ACA and the President's proposed compromise \n     strike a respectful balance between religious interests and \n     the health needs of women. However, HRC is particularly \n     concerned by efforts to go even further and permit the \n     religious or moral beliefs of individuals or private \n     businesses to limit nondiscrimination protections and equal \n     access to services and benefits. When the balance shifts too \n     far in that direction, all too often, lesbian, gay, bisexual \n     and transgender (LGBT) individuals are negatively impacted.\n       The Blunt Amendment would go far beyond the President's \n     reasonable step and dramatically expand the ACA's religious \n     exemption, permitting any employer to opt-out of providing \n     coverage for an essential health benefit or preventive \n     service by asserting it violates its ``religious beliefs or \n     moral convictions,'' regardless of whether that employer is \n     in any way a religious organization. This language would \n     undermine the entire healthcare law by allowing employers to \n     cherry-pick what is covered by their health insurance. While \n     the amendment comes in response to recent debate over the \n     coverage of birth control, it would be all too easy for \n     employers to decide to drop other benefits, like HIV testing, \n     or limit coverage for specific medical conditions, based on a \n     purported religious or moral objection. If enacted, the Blunt \n     Amendment would place the moral objections of any employer \n     over the health of millions of Americans, including members \n     of the LGBT community. For these reasons, HRC strongly urges \n     you to oppose the Blunt Amendment.\n       Should you have any questions at all please feel free to \n     contact me at (202) 216 1515 or allison.herwitta@hrc.org or \n     Andrea Levario at (202) 216 1520 or andrea.levario@ahrc.org.\n                                                  Allison Herwitt,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       To Members of the United States Senate: The undersigned \n     organizations are opposed to the amendment introduced by \n     Senator Roy Blunt (R MO) that would jeopardize quality health \n     insurance coverage for millions of people in this country.\n       The Blunt Amendment #1520 to S. 1813, the Surface \n     Transportation bill, allows any employer or insurance \n     company, religious or not, to deny health insurance coverage \n     for any essential or preventive health care law, service that \n     they object to on the basis of religious beliefs or moral \n     convictions. That\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\n     means employers and insurance companies can not only deny \n     access to birth control, they can deny access to any health \n     care service required under the new health care law including \n     maternity care for unmarried women, vaccines for children, \n     blood transfusions, HIV/AIDS treatment, or type II diabetes \n     screenings. This expansive control over employees' coverage \n     will have a harmful impact on all people, and it will \n     discriminate against those who need access to essential \n     health services the most.\n       In short, the Blunt amendment would eviscerate critical \n     protections in the Affordable Care Act and completely \n     undermine a fundamental principle of the health care law--\n     that everyone in this country deserves a basic standard of \n     health insurance coverage.\n       We urge you to reject the Blunt amendment and oppose all \n     efforts to undermine peoples' access to health care.\n           Sincerely,\n         Advocates for Youth; The AIDS Institute; AIDS United; \n           America Votes; American Academy of Pediatrics; American \n           Association of University Women; American Civil \n           Liberties Union; American College of Nurse-Midwives; \n           American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; \n           American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees; American Medical Student Association; \n           American Medical Women's Association; American Nurses \n           Association; American Public Health Association; Asian \n           Communities for Reproductive Justice; Association of \n           Reproductive Health Professionals; Black Women's Health \n           Imperative; Catholics for Choice; Center for Health and \n           Gender Equity; Center for Reproductive Rights.\n         Center for Women Policy Studies; Coalition of Labor Union \n           Women; Choice USA; Concerned Clergy for Choice; Doctors \n           for America; EQUAL Health Network; Feminist Majority; \n           Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC); Hadassah, The Women's \n           Zionist Organization of America, Inc.; Health Care for \n           America Now; Healthy Teen Network; HIV Medicine \n           Association; Human Rights Campaign; International \n           Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural \n           Implement Workers of America, UAW; International \n           Women's Health Coalition; Jewish Women International; \n           Justice and Witness Ministries of the United Church of \n           Christ; Law Students for Reproductive Justice; \n           MergerWatch; Methodist Federation for Social Action.\n         MoveOn.org Political Action; NARAL Pro Choice America; \n           National Abortion Federation; National Alliance on \n           Mental Illness; National Asian Pacific American Women's \n           Forum; National Center for Transgender Equality; \n           National Coalition for LGBT Health; National Coalition \n           of STD Directors; National Council of Jewish Women; \n           National Council of Women's Organizations; National \n           Education Association; National Family Planning & \n           Reproductive Health Association; National Gay and \n           Lesbian Task Force Action Fund; National Health Law \n           Program; National Immigration Law Center; National \n           Latina Institute for Reproductive Health; National \n           Organization for Women; National Partnership for Women \n           & Families; National Physicians Alliance; National \n           Women's Law Center.\n         New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good; \n           Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health; Planned \n           Parenthood Federation of America; Population \n           Connection; Progressive Majority; Raising Women's \n           Voices for the Health Care We Need; Religious Coalition \n           for Reproductive Choice; Religious Institute; \n           Reproductive Health Technologies Project; Service \n           Employees International Union; Sexuality Information \n           and Education Council of the United States; SisterSong \n           NYC; Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine; The \n           National Alliance to Advance Adolescent Health; The \n           National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned \n           Pregnancy; Trust Women/Silver Ribbon Campaign; Union \n           for Reform Judaism; Unitarian Universalist Association \n           of Congregations; United Methodist Church, General \n           Board of Church & Society; U.S. Positive Women's \n           Network and Women Organized to Respond to Life-\n           threatening Diseases; Women Donors Network.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 27, 2012.\n       Dear Senator: As organizations dedicated to the health, \n     safety, and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and \n     young adults, we strongly urge you to oppose Sen. Blunt's \n     amendment, S. Amdt. 1520, to the Moving Ahead for Progress in \n     the 21st Century Act, S. 1813. Our organizations oppose this \n     amendment that will hinder access to necessary preventive \n     health screenings for infants, children, and their families.\n       The Affordable Care Act made significant progress in \n     prioritizing preventive care, health promotion, and disease \n     prevention in our health care system. The law includes a \n     number of provisions that safeguard children's access to and \n     remove disincentives from accessing preventive health care \n     services. Specifically, the ACA establishes Sec. 2713 of the \n     Public Health Services Act, which requires that individual \n     and group health plans cover preventive health services \n     without any cost-sharing to the patient, including evidence-\n     based services recommended by the United States Preventive \n     Services Task Force; immunizations recommended by the CDC's \n     Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and preventive \n     care and screenings supported by the Health Resources and \n     Services Administration (HRSA), which are outlined in the \n     American Academy of Pediatrics' Bright Futures handbook.\n       Children's health is the foundation of health across the \n     lifespan and preventive health services are the bedrock of \n     pediatric care. All adults once were children, and their \n     health is significantly influenced by preventive care during \n     their early years. Denying childhood preventive care could \n     result in billions of dollars of extra expenditures in adult \n     health care, as we continue the unsustainable system of \n     paying for adult conditions that could have been \n     inexpensively prevented during childhood. Life-saving \n     immunizations, developmental screenings, autism screenings, \n     other behavioral and mental health assessments, hearing and \n     vision testing, body mass index (BMI) measurements, oral \n     health risk assessments, identification of special health \n     care needs, solicitation of parental and child health \n     concerns, and anticipatory guidance are all essential \n     components of a pediatric well-child visit and are all \n     required to be covered without cost-sharing under the ACA. \n     This amendment would undermine efforts to promote pediatric \n     preventive health and would jeopardize the health of infants, \n     children, adolescents and young adults by denying them access \n     to these clinically appropriate services and treatments.\n       Before the law's passage, pediatricians reported that their \n     patients were often required to provide co-pays or provide \n     other cost sharing for preventive health screenings. Co-pays \n     and other cost sharing are often imposed by insurers to \n     decrease health service utilization, even though families \n     already pay a monthly premium. Our organizations have argued \n     that imposing cost sharing is completely inappropriate in the \n     context of pediatric preventive services, as cost sharing has \n     the aggregate effect of limiting clinically appropriate \n     interactions between children and their health providers. \n     Indeed, one of the main reasons that the Academy cautions \n     families to seriously consider alternatives to Consumer-\n     Directed Health Plans is that these plans often do not \n     provide ``first dollar'' coverage for preventive services.\n       Unfortunately, S. Amdt. 1520 would create a substantial \n     loophole in the requirements for preventive health services \n     because insurance plans would not be required to offer the \n     appropriate array of pediatric preventive services and due to \n     the cost sharing disincentive discussed above. Specifically, \n     S. Amdt. 1520 would allow any employer or insurance company \n     to deny health insurance coverage for any service that it \n     finds objectionable on the basis of personal beliefs. The \n     amendment would not only allow employers and insurance \n     companies to deny access to contraception, but would include \n     all preventive health services covered by Sec. 2713 of the \n     Public Health Service Act. For instance, if an employer \n     objects to childhood vaccines on the basis of personal \n     beliefs, he or she could purchase insurance that would not be \n     required to cover these life-saving medical interventions. \n     Our organizations are seriously concerned that if this \n     amendment passes, children will not receive the preventive \n     services they need as a result of the personal beliefs of a \n     single individual, employer, or insurance company.\n       Our organizations urge Congress to oppose S. Amdt. 1520 to \n     the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act and \n     protect children's access to preventive services, including \n     vaccines, well-child check-ups, and other essential health \n     benefits that help children grow to be healthy, productive \n     adults. If you have questions or concerns, please contact \n     Kristen Mizzi with the American Academy of Pediatrics at 202/\n     347 8600 or kmizzi@aap.org.\n           Sincerely,\n         Academic Pediatric Association; American Academy of \n           Pediatrics; American Pediatric Society; Association of \n           Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs; The Society \n           for Adolescent Health and Medicine; Society for \n           Pediatric Research.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Boxer: As organizations committed to the \n     health and wellbeing of infants, children, adolescents, and \n     pregnant women, we urge you to oppose the amendment offered \n     by Senator Roy Blunt (R MO), Senate Amendment 1520, to the \n     Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (S. 1813).\n       Senate Amendment 1520 threatens to undermine crucial \n     clinical and preventive health services by allowing plans, \n     employers, providers, and beneficiaries to refuse coverage \n     for any service currently required under Section 2713 of the \n     Public Health Service Act and Section 1302 of the Public \n     Health Service Act, if deemed objectionable to them on moral \n     or religious grounds. The Amendment would give expansive and \n     explicit license to any employer, health plan, provider, or \n     beneficiary to exclude any health service from insurance \n     coverage. For instance, a small employer or health plan could \n     ban maternity care for women due to religious convictions \n     regarding out-of-wedlock pregnancies. Likewise, a health plan \n     or small\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\n     employer that objects to childhood immunizations, newborn \n     screening for life-threatening genetic disorders, other \n     components of well-child visits, or prenatal care would be \n     fully within the law to deny coverage for any and all of \n     these vital services.\n       The Affordable Care Act has made significant gains toward \n     providing critical health services for infants, children, \n     adolescents, and women of childbearing age. Section 1302 of \n     the Affordable Care Act guarantees that all plans offered in \n     the individual and small group markets must cover a minimum \n     set of ``essential health benefits,'' including maternity and \n     newborn care, pediatric services, including oral and vision \n     care, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, \n     and mental health and substance use disorder services, \n     including behavioral health treatment. Section 2713 of the \n     Public Health Service Act requires that all new health plans \n     cover, without cost-sharing, certain preventive services, \n     including evidence-based services recommended by the United \n     States Preventive Services Task Force; immunizations \n     recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization \n     Practices; preventative care and screening services for \n     children contained in Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health \n     Supervision of Infants, Children and Adolescents; and \n     preventive health care services for women developed by the \n     Institute of Medicine and promulgated by the U.S. Health \n     Resources and Services Administration, such as prenatal care, \n     well woman visits, and breast cancer screening.\n       If passed, Senate Amendment 1520 could limit access to \n     necessary health services well beyond contraceptive coverage, \n     putting infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women in \n     danger of not receiving even the most basic health care and \n     preventive services. We urge you to oppose Senate Amendment \n     1520 to the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century \n     Act.

Madam President, the first letter is from the Cancer \nAction Network asking us to vote no on the Blunt amendment.\n\n       On behalf of millions of cancer patients, survivors and \n     their families, we write to express our opposition to the \n     amendment proposed by Senator Roy Blunt.\n\n  They talk about the fact that it would permit employers to refuse \nemployees insurance coverage for any health care benefit guaranteed by \nhealth reform. And they are very strong on this issue. They say:\n\n       The implications of this provision could result in coverage \n     denials of lifesaving preventive services such as mammograms \n     or tobacco cessation based on employer discretion.\n\n  That is a new letter, dated today.\n  Then we got a letter from the Trust for America's Health. They say:\n\n       The Blunt amendment would allow any health insurance plan \n     or employer, religious or not, to exclude any preventive ser-\n     vice. . . .\n\n  The SEIU--Service Employees International--calls the Blunt amendment \n``an extreme proposal that turns back the clock.''\n  The Human Rights Campaign Letter:\n\n     . . . The Blunt amendment would place the moral objections of \n     any employer over the health of millions of Americans. . . .\n\n  Eighty organizations signed a letter, and, referring to the Blunt \namendment, part of that letter says:\n\n       That means employers and insurance companies can not only \n     deny access to birth control, they can deny access to health \n     care service. . . .\n\n  That is signed by Advocates for Youth, America Votes, the AIDS \nInstitute, American Association of University Women, American College \nof Nurses and Midwives, American Congress of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, American Medical Students, Black Women's Health \nImperative, Catholics for Choice, Reproductive Rights Center, Center \nfor Women Policy Studies, Coalition of Labor Union Women, Choice USA, \nConcerned Clergy for Choice, Doctors for America, EQUAL Health \nNetwork--I mean, this goes on and on--the National Latina Institute for \nReproductive Health, Planned Parenthood, Population Connection, \nProgressive Majority, Society of Adolescent Health and Medicine, \nNational Alliance to Advance Adolescent Health, National Campaign to \nPrevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, Trust Women/Silver Ribbon \nCampaign, Union for Reformed Judaism, Unitarian Universalist \nAssociation of Congregations. This is a long list of organizations that \noppose the Blunt amendment.\n  This letter came in from the Academic Pediatric Association and a \nnumber of other youth organizations. They urge us to oppose the Blunt \namendment because it doesn't protect children's access to preventive \nservices.\n  This is another letter signed by many more organizations, including \nthe Spina Bifida Association, Voices for America's Children, Children's \nHealthcare Is a Legal Duty, Easter Seals, Family Voices, First Focus \nCampaign for Children--it goes on and on--American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees, American Association of Maternal and \nChild Health Programs, Association of University Centers on \nDisabilities, CHILD, Inc. All these organizations have come together, \nand they say:\n\n       As organizations committed to the health and well-being of \n     infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, we urge \n     you to oppose the amendment offered by Senator Roy Blunt. . . \n     .\n\n  So all you are going to hear from the other side is misstatements \nabout how the Blunt amendment is nothing more than what we have always \ndone. Then why are you doing it? It is because it reaches so far.\n  We all support an exemption for religious providers. We all support \nthat. We do not support the ability of any insurance company, \nnonreligious, or any employer, nonreligious, to stand up and say: You \nknow what, I don't believe vaccines work; therefore, I don't think they \nshould be made available to my people. And when you ask why, they say: \nI have a moral conviction. I have a moral conviction that people should \nhave known better before they took that first cigarette when they were \n11 or 12; therefore, I am not going to give any treatment. Too bad. \nThey will just get lung cancer.\n  I mean, seriously. That is what the Blunt amendment will do. It will \nallow anyone--nonreligious--to say they have an objection and not offer \na host of preventive and essential health care services, including \ncontraception.\n  So tomorrow is our time. We are going to defeat the Blunt amendment, \nand when we defeat the Blunt amendment, we are going to move on to the \nhighway bill. Hooray. And maybe, just maybe people will listen to \nSenator Olympia Snowe, who said we should not get tied up in knots over \nthese controversial things and we should do what is right for the \nAmerican people. I certainly support that.\n  There is just one more thing I want to put in the Record.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the testimony of a woman who tried very hard to be allowed to \nspeak with a panel of men at a congressional hearing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Law Students for Reproductive Justice Chapter]\n\n          Testimony From Law Student Barred From House Hearing\n\n       Members of Congress, good morning, and thank you for \n     allowing me to testify. My name is Sandra Fluke, and I'm a \n     third year student at Georgetown Law, a Jesuit school. I'm \n     also a past president of Georgetown Law Students for \n     Reproductive Justice or LSRJ. I'd like to acknowledge my \n     fellow LSRJ members and allies and thank them for being here \n     today.\n       Georgetown LSRJ is here today because we're so grateful \n     that this regulation implements the nonpartisan, medical \n     advice of the Institute of Medicine. I attend a Jesuit law \n     school that does not provide contraception coverage in \n     student health plans. Just as we students have faced \n     financial, emotional, and medical burdens as a result, \n     employees at religiously affiliated hospitals and \n     universities across the country have suffered similar \n     burdens. We are all grateful for the new regulation that will \n     meet the critical health care needs of so many women. \n     Simultaneously, the recently announced adjustment addresses \n     any potential conflict with the religious identity of \n     Catholic and Jesuit institutions.\n\n[[Page S1136]]\n\n       As I have watched national media coverage of this debate, \n     it has been heartbreaking to see women's health treated as a \n     political football. When I turn off the TV and look around my \n     campus, I instead see the faces of the women affected, and I \n     have heard more and more of their stories. You see, \n     Georgetown does not cover contraceptives in its student \n     insurance, although it does cover contraceptives for faculty \n     and staff. On a daily basis, I hear from yet another woman \n     who has suffered financial, emotional, and medical burdens \n     because of this lack of contraceptive coverage. And so, I am \n     here to share their voices and ask that you hear them.\n       Without insurance coverage, contraception can cost a woman \n     over $3,000 during law school. For a lot of students who, \n     like me, are on public interest scholarships, that's \n     practically an entire summer's salary. Forty percent of \n     female students at Georgetown Law report struggling \n     financially as a result of this policy. One told us of how \n     embarrassed and powerless she felt when she was standing at \n     the pharmacy counter, learning for the first time that \n     contraception wasn't covered, and had to walk away because \n     she couldn't afford it. Students like her have no choice but \n     to go without contraception. Just on Tuesday, a married \n     female student told me she had to stop using contraception \n     because she couldn't afford it any longer.\n       You might respond that contraception is accessible in lots \n     of other ways. Unfortunately, that's not true. Women's health \n     clinics provide vital medical services, but as the Guttmacher \n     Institute has documented, clinics are unable to meet the \n     crushing demand for these services. Clinics are closing and \n     women are being forced to go without. How can Congress \n     consider allowing even more employers and institutions to \n     refuse contraceptive coverage and then respond that the non-\n     profit clinics should step up to take care of the resulting \n     medical crisis, particularly when so many legislators are \n     attempting to defund those very same clinics?\n       These denials of contraceptive coverage impact real people. \n     In the worst cases, women who need this medication for other \n     medical reasons suffer dire consequences. A friend of mine, \n     for example, has polycystic ovarian syndrome and has to take \n     prescription birth control to stop cysts from growing on her \n     ovaries. Her prescription is technically covered by \n     Georgetown insurance because it's not intended to prevent \n     pregnancy. At many schools, it wouldn't be, and under Senator \n     Blunt's amendment, Senator Rubio's bill, or Representative \n     Fortenberry's bill, there's no requirement that an exception \n     be made for such medical needs. When they do exist, these \n     exceptions don't accomplish their well-intended goals because \n     when you let university administrators or other employers, \n     rather than women and their doctors, dictate whose medical \n     needs are good enough and whose aren't, a woman's health \n     takes a back seat to a bureaucracy focused on policing her \n     body.\n       In sixty-five percent of cases, our female students were \n     interrogated by insurance representatives and university \n     medical staff about why they need these prescriptions and \n     whether they're lying about their symptoms. For my friend, \n     and 20% of women in her situation, she never got the \n     insurance company to cover her prescription, despite \n     verification of her illness from her doctor. Her claim was \n     denied repeatedly on the assumption that she really wanted \n     the birth control to prevent pregnancy. She's gay, so clearly \n     polycystic ovarian syndrome was a much more urgent concern \n     than accidental pregnancy. After months of paying over $100 \n     out of pocket, she just couldn't afford her medication \n     anymore and had to stop taking it. I learned about all of \n     this when I walked out of a test and got a message from her \n     that in the middle of her final exam period she'd been in the \n     emergency room all night in excruciating pain. She wrote, \n     ``It was so painful, I woke up thinking I'd been shot.'' \n     Without her taking the birth control, a massive cyst the size \n     of a tennis ball had grown on her ovary. She had to have \n     surgery to remove her entire ovary. She's not here this \n     morning. She's in a doctor's office right now. Since last \n     year's surgery, she's been experiencing night sweats, weight \n     gain, and other symptoms of early menopause as a result of \n     the removal of her ovary. She's 32 years old. As she put it: \n     ``If my body is indeed in early menopause, no fertility \n     specialist in the world will be able to help me have my \n     own children. I will have no chance at giving my mother \n     her desperately desired grandbabies, simply because the \n     insurance policy that I paid for totally unsubsidized by \n     my school wouldn't cover my prescription for birth control \n     when I needed it.'' Now, in addition to facing the health \n     complications that come with having menopause at an early \n     age--increased risk of cancer, heart disease, \n     osteoporosis, she may never be able to be a mom.\n       Perhaps you think my friend's tragic story is rare. It's \n     not. One student told us doctors believe she has \n     endometriosis, but it can't be proven without surgery, so the \n     insurance hasn't been willing to cover her medication. Last \n     week, a friend of mine told me that she also has polycystic \n     ovarian syndrome. She's struggling to pay for her medication \n     and is terrified to not have access to it. Due to the \n     barriers erected by Georgetown's policy, she hasn't been \n     reimbursed for her medication since last August. I sincerely \n     pray that we don't have to wait until she loses an ovary or \n     is diagnosed with cancer before her needs and the needs of \n     all of these women are taken seriously.\n       This is the message that not requiring coverage of \n     contraception sends. A woman's reproductive healthcare isn't \n     a necessity, isn't a priority. One student told us that she \n     knew birth control wasn't covered, and she assumed that's how \n     Georgetown's insurance handled all of women's sexual \n     healthcare, so when she was raped, she didn't go to the \n     doctor even to be examined or tested for sexually transmitted \n     infections because she thought insurance wasn't going to \n     cover something like that, something that was related to a \n     woman's reproductive health. As one student put it, ``this \n     policy communicates to female students that our school \n     doesn't understand our needs.'' These are not feelings that \n     male fellow students experience. And they're not burdens that \n     male students must shoulder.\n       In the media lately, conservative Catholic organizations \n     have been asking: what did we expect when we enrolled at a \n     Catholic school? We can only answer that we expected women to \n     be treated equally, to not have our school create untenable \n     burdens that impede our academic success. We expected that \n     our schools would live up to the Jesuit creed of cura \n     personalis, to care for the whole person, by meeting all of \n     our medical needs. We expected that when we told our \n     universities of the problems this policy created for \n     students, they would help us. We expected that when 94% of \n     students opposed the policy, the university would respect our \n     choices regarding insurance students pay for completely \n     unsubsidized by the university, especially when the \n     university already provides contraceptive coverage to faculty \n     and staff. We did not expect that women would be told in the \n     national media that if we wanted comprehensive insurance that \n     met our needs, not just those of men, we should have gone to \n     school elsewhere, even if that meant a less prestigious \n     university. We refuse to pick between a quality education and \n     our health, and we resent that, in the 21st century, anyone \n     thinks it's acceptable to ask us to make this choice simply \n     because we are women.\n       Many of the students whose stories I've shared are Catholic \n     women, so ours is not a war against the church. It is a \n     struggle for access to the healthcare we need. The President \n     of the Association of Jesuit Colleges has shared that Jesuit \n     colleges and universities appreciate the modification to the \n     rule announced last week. Religious concerns are addressed \n     and women get the healthcare they need. That is something we \n     can all agree on. Thank you.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, this is a panel of men who were called \nby House Republican Chairman Issa to testify about women's health--not \none woman there, but they were the experts. They denied this woman the \nchance to speak. If she had been allowed to speak, this is what she \nwanted to say:\n  She had a friend who went to the doctor, and the friend had a cyst on \nher ovary. The doctor said: You have to take birth control. That is \ngoing to help. Those pills are going to help reduce the size of that \ncyst.\n  She couldn't afford the birth control pills and her employer wouldn't \ncover them, so she couldn't take them. She is a student. She wrote her \nfriend saying that the cyst ``was so painful, I woke up thinking I'd \nbeen shot.''\n  I will quote part of the friend's testimony relaying what her friend \ntold her.\n\n       Without taking the birth control, a massive cyst the size \n     of a tennis ball had grown on her ovary. She had to have \n     surgery to remove her entire ovary. She's not here this \n     morning. She's in a doctor's office right now. Since last \n     year's surgery, she has been experiencing night sweats, \n     weight gain, and other symptoms of early menopause as a \n     result of the removal of her ovary. She's 32 years old. As \n     she put it, ``If my body is indeed in early menopause, no \n     fertility specialist in the world will be able to help me \n     have my own children. I will have no chance of giving my \n     mother her desperately desired grandbabies, simply because \n     the insurance policy that I paid for totally unsubsidized by \n     my school wouldn't cover my prescription for birth control \n     when I needed it.''\n\n  And so her friend says:\n\n       Now, in addition to facing the health complications that \n     come with having menopause at an early age--increased risk of \n     cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis--she may never be able to \n     be a mom.\n\n  So when we talk about the Blunt amendment, we are not talking about \nsome obtuse issue, we are not talking about some philosophical issue. \nWhat we are talking about when we talk about the Blunt amendment is a \nyoung woman, a student at law school who couldn't afford to pay for the \nbirth control pills which would have saved her fertility, which would \nhave saved her horrific pain--a painful operation where she lost her \novary simply because she couldn't have access to her birth control \npills.\n  This is not about some argument that doesn't have real consequences \nfor our people. The Presiding Officer's constituents and my \nconstituents deserve\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\nto have access to preventive care. They deserve to have access to \nessential health care. The Blunt amendment will take that away from \nthem. It will take that away from them. And all on a highway bill. All \non a highway bill.\n  So let's keep the Blunt amendment away from this highway bill. This \nhighway bill is a product of strong bipartisanship, as the Presiding \nOfficer has told the Senate. Let's keep it clean. Let's keep out these \nextraneous amendments that will roll back environmental laws that are \ncleaning up the air, that will keep the arsenic and the mercury out of \nthe air and the lead out of the air. Let's not roll back these laws on \na highway bill. Let's get the highway bill done. When we have other \narguments about other issues, let's put those issues on a relevant \nbill.\n  This is the time now for us to pull together, not pull apart. The \nNation needs us to work together. It is an election year, and it is a \ndifficult time. There is a lot of name-calling going on out there on \nthe campaign trail, but we are still here, last I checked, and we are \nsupposed to be doing our work for the American people. We have a chance \nto do it on this highway bill. Let's defeat the Blunt amendment in the \nmorning.\n  I thank my friends for coming over to the floor and speaking so \neloquently today against this dangerous, precedent-setting Blunt \namendment that will turn back the clock on women's health and on our \nfamilies' health.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \nopposition to the amendment offered by Senator Blunt.\n  It is discouraging that when we should be having a debate on our \nNation's infrastructure and surface transportation needs, we are \ninstead talking about women's health and contraception. As the Senator \nfrom California noted earlier, my State is a State that understands the \nimportance of upgrading our infrastructure and investing in surface \ntransportation. I live just a few blocks from the bridge that collapsed \nin the middle of that river on that sunny day in Minnesota, an eight-\nlane highway, in the Mississippi River. So we understand the importance \nof investment in infrastructure, and that is what we should be focusing \non in this bill. Instead, we have taken a different turn.\n  I understand there are many different perspectives and opinions when \nit comes to issues related to contraception and women's health; \nhowever, we shouldn't be talking about them when we are supposed to be \ntalking about infrastructure, highway, roads, and bridges. People are \nfree to give speeches, they are free to talk about whatever they want, \nbut this amendment doesn't belong on this bill. Nevertheless, it is \nhere, and I think it is very important that we address it and the \nAmerican people understand what it would mean.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment impacts more than just contraception. \nThis amendment ultimately limits our ability to address our health care \nchallenges through prevention and wellness. Chronic conditions such as \ndiabetes, heart disease, and cancer can be avoided through prevention, \nearly detection, and treatment. We all know that. That is pretty common \nknowledge in our country.\n  During health care reform, we made great strides in improving the \nhealth and well-being of our Nation by strengthening preventive \nservices. We addressed prohibitive costs by eliminating copays and cost \nsharing for essential services such as mammograms and colonoscopies. We \naddressed access issues by ensuring coverage for preventive autism or \ncholesterol screenings, to name a few. I also fought to include the \nEARLY Act, which promoted early detection for breast cancer for young \nwomen. These types of preventive and early detection services are vital \nto so many people in this country.\n  As a cochair of the Congressional Wellness Caucus, a bipartisan \ncaucus, I have also heard from numerous employers that understand a \nhealthy workforce only increases productivity and output. It would be \nunfortunate if we eliminated access to prevention and wellness services \nthat keep our Nation's workforce strong and productive. Because of the \nnecessity of these services and the benefits they provide to men, \nwomen, and children, including contraception, I asked my colleagues to \noppose the Blunt amendment.\n  The Blunt amendment would allow any employer or insurance company to \nrefuse to cover any of the prevention services, any essential health \nbenefit or any other health service required under the health care law, \nallowing these entities to deny critical health care to the millions \nwho rely on these entities for insurance. The consequences of this \nprovision could mean employers and other organizations for any reason \nrefusing to offer coverage of lifesaving preventive services such as \nmammograms or tobacco cessation would be based on employer discretion. \nThat is why I don't think it is a surprise that organizations such as \nthe American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, and the March of Dimes oppose this \namendment.\n  I think we all know the American Cancer Society, March of Dimes, \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, and these groups tend not to get \ninvolved in contraception issues, and that goes to show us right now \nthis amendment is much broader than just talking about contraception.\n  According to the American Cancer Society:\n\n       Annually, seven out of ten deaths among Americans are \n     attributed to chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, \n     heart disease and stroke. The Affordable Care Act made \n     significant strides to stem this epidemic by ensuring \n     patients would have access to essential care that could \n     address prevention, early detection, and treatment--all \n     necessary elements to improve the health and well-being of \n     our nation. Unfortunately, the expansive nature of the \n     proposed Blunt amendment would directly undercut this \n     progress.\n\n  I am concerned the broad-based nature of this amendment would prevent \nmen, women, and children from getting the preventive services they need \nas a result of the personal beliefs of a single individual or an \nemployer or an insurance company. I do not believe this is the way to \nprotect Americans in need of health care services, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with sadness \nand reluctance because we are actually debating an extraordinarily \nworthwhile, even historic bill that would not only improve our \ninfrastructure--our roads and bridges and highways in the State of \nConnecticut and throughout the country--but also provide jobs, enable \nmore economic growth, and promote the effort to put Connecticut and our \ncountry back to work. My reluctance is we are debating an amendment \nthat distracts from that essential task, the work that the Nation \nelected us to do, to make our priority creating jobs and promoting \neconomic growth.\n  We are debating an amendment that seems fundamentally flawed. I am \nrespectful, as is everyone in this body, of the moral convictions and \nreligious beliefs that others may hold. I believe this amendment is \nunconstitutionally overbroad and vague. It is unacceptably flawed in \nthe way it is written because it essentially gives every employer--\nanytime, anywhere, with respect to any medical condition, any form of \ntreatment--the right to deny that essential health care and those \nservices based on his or her undefined religious beliefs or moral \nconvictions--quoting from the language itself, ``religious beliefs'' or \n``moral convictions''--without any defining limits.\n  Insurance companies can even deny a person coverage for mental health \ntreatment or cancer screening or HIV and AIDS screening simply because \nthat employer or insurance company\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\nmay believe the causes of those conditions somehow violate his or her \nreligious beliefs or moral convictions. This amendment would threaten \naccess to a number of clinical preventive services such as diabetes \nscreening, vaccinations or cancer screenings, essential preventive \nservices that have been proved to reduce health care costs and save \nlives. Those services should be guaranteed to every American without \ncost.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, one of the smallest States in the \ncountry, approximately 270,000 women would lose access to preventive \ncare if this amendment is agreed to. Around the country some 20 million \nwomen would lose that kind of access to preventive care. That is a \nresult that simply is unacceptable. The amendment goes too far. It \nwould endanger the lives of millions of Americans, would completely \nundermine the progress--and we have made progress--in providing crucial \nhealth care services to millions of individuals.\n  I oppose this amendment because of its practical implications, \nbecause of its apparent unconstitutionality, and because it flies in \nthe face of sound public policy. At a time when we are considering a \nbill, the transportation measure that deservedly has broad, widespread, \nbipartisan support in this Chamber and across the country, we are again \npolarized, Republican against Democrat, regrettably divided and \npotentially gridlocked because of an amendment that has nothing to do \nwith transportation or putting America back to work. That should be our \ntask. It is my priority. It should be the priority of this Chamber at \nthis historic moment when we are reviving a still struggling economy, \nwhen people are hurting, striving to find work, and when we should be \ndoing everything in our power to put America and Connecticut back to \nwork and enable economic growth.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak before the \nSenate for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose the \nBlunt amendment, which could lead to devastating health outcomes for \nover 20 million women across our country. Just 2 weeks ago, I applauded \nthe Obama administration's decision to require health insurance plans \nto provide coverage of FDA-approved contraception needed for women's \nhealth care without copays beginning this August. The final rule issued \nby the Department of Health and Human Services was a tremendous step \ntoward improving the health of our Nation's women and their families--a \nstep that was long overdue and one made with due respect for all \nAmericans' religious freedom.\n  Tomorrow, we will be voting on an amendment that would not only undo \nthat progress, it would move us backward. What is especially \nfrightening is that this amendment goes much further than just \nreversing the rule because it is not limited to religiously affiliated \nentities. The proposal would allow any employer or health plan issuer \nto refuse coverage of any service for any reason, not just religious \nobjections. If an employee had any moral objection, it would be \npermitted to refuse coverage for critical care such as alcohol and \nother substance abuse counseling, prenatal care for single women, and \nmental health care too. The way this measure is worded, employees could \ndeny screening and treatment for cervical cancer because it is related \nto HPV or refuse HIV-AIDS testing and treatment due to an objection to \nways the viruses can be transmitted. They could even refuse to cover \ncertain FDA-approved drugs and treatments because they object to the \nresearch that led to the drug's development.\n  Major national pediatric organizations recently voiced their concern \nthat if this amendment becomes law, employers who say they object to \nchildhood vaccines on the basis of personal beliefs could refuse to \ncover these lifesaving and otherwise costly medical services. In short, \nthis amendment allows corporations nationwide to overrule the religious \nand ethical decisions made by the people they employ and to trump the \nhealth care advice of their doctors.\n  If this amendment passes, it will discriminate against most of those \nwho need financial support, and that is not right. All Americans \ndeserve access to health care. We cannot allow partisan ideology to \nhurt the health of our women and children. If we do, our sisters, \ndaughters, and granddaughters will pay the price. If we defeat this \namendment, the final rule will save most American women who use \ncontraceptives hundreds of dollars each year in health care costs. \nHealth experts agree that birth control helps to save lives, prevent \nunintended pregnancies, improve outcomes for children, and reduce the \nincidence of abortion.\n  Another point raised by my colleagues, Senators Gillibrand and \nBoxer--and I thank them for promoting awareness on this issue--is that \n14 percent of women who use birth control pills, and that is 1.5 \nmillion American women, use them to treat serious medical conditions. \nSome of these conditions include endometriosis, ovarian cysts, \ndebilitating monthly pain, and irregular cycles.\n  Religious principles are deeply important to me as a Christian, so I \nam glad the current rule accommodates conscience objections and exempts \nreligiously affiliated organizations from both offering and paying for \nbirth control coverage for their employees. At the same time, the core \nprinciple of ensuring all women's access to fundamental preventive \nhealth care remains protected because the care will be offered directly \nby the insurance companies. To deny any women access to affordable \nhealth care--as this amendment would do--is unconscionable. It could \nhave devastating effects not only on her health but her family's as \nwell.\n  In speaking with women's health advocates and providers in Hawaii and \nacross the country, one of the most common recommendations I hear for \nimproving women's health outcomes is to ensure access to effective \ncontraception. Across the State of Hawaii about 150,000 women seek \naccess to birth control every year, and almost half of them depend on \nfinancial assistance to obtain it. Right now, women in States that do \nnot have plans that cover birth control face costs of around $600 per \nyear. Women and families who cannot afford it can end up facing tens of \nthousands of dollars in costs arising from complications from \nunintended pregnancies and other health care problems, costs that \ntaxpayers often end up supporting.\n  With these facts in mind, I am not surprised that a survey has shown \nthat 71 percent of American voters--including 77 percent of Catholic \nwomen voters--support the administration's requirement to make birth \ncontrol available to all women. I firmly believe religious liberty is \nprotected under the new rule, while access to preventive care does not \ndiscriminate against anyone, no matter whom they work for or what their \noccupation is.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this dangerous \namendment, which would set back improvements in preventive services and \nwomen's health care in this country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, the Senate will vote on \na measure which is controversial and has gathered a lot of attention \nacross America. It is an amendment offered by the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Blunt, and it relates to the health services that will be \navailable to people across America and it calls into question an issue \nwhich we have debated\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\nsince the earliest colonists came to this country; that is, the \nappropriate role of religion and government in America. It is an issue \nwhich has been hotly debated and contested in the earliest days of our \nNation and was finally resolved by our Constitution in a manner that \nhas served us well for over two centuries.\n  The Constitution speaks to the issue of religion in three specific \nplaces. It states in the first amendment that we each have the freedom \nof religion; that is, the freedom to believe or not to believe. It says \nthere will be no official State religion; whereas, in England they \nchose the Church of England, but in our government there will be no \nchoice of any religion.\n  Finally, there is a provision which says that there shall be no \nreligious test for office. These are all constitutional provisions \nwhich, though sparing in language, have guided us carefully through \nover 200 years of history. We see around the world where other \ncountries have not been as fortunate to come together in basic \nprinciples that have kept a diversity of religious belief alive in the \ncountry. Time and again we have seen differences when it comes to \nreligion lead to conflict and death. We see it today in many places \naround the world. So when our government is called on to make a \ndecision relative to the role of religion in American life, we should \ntake care to stick to those basic principles that have guided us for \nover two centuries.\n  The issue before us today is what will be the requirements of health \ninsurance that is offered by employers across America. What we have \ntried to establish are the essentials and basics of health insurance \nand health care. We are mindful of the fact that if the market were to \ndictate health insurance plans and policies, they may not be fair to \nthe people of this country. I recall an instance before I came to \nCongress while working in Illinois where we learned that health \ninsurance companies were offering policies which refused to cover \nnewborn babies in the first 30 days of their life. Of course, that was \ndone for economic reasons, because children born with a serious illness \ncan be extremely expensive in that 30-day period. We changed the law in \nIllinois and said, if you want to cover a maternity, if you want to \ncover a child, it is from the moment of birth. That became the policy: \nto establish basic standards so that families buying these policies \nwould have the most basic protections.\n  This issue we are debating with the Blunt amendment is what will be \nrequired of health insurance policies across America when it comes to \npreventive care. We asked the experts: What basics in preventive care \nshould be included to make certain we don't overlook something that is \nfundamental to a person's survival or life? One of the things they said \nis when it comes to preventive care, to offer to women across America \nfamily planning services. That, of course, is the nub of the \ncontroversy, the center of it.\n  Some religions--the Catholic religion in particular--have strongly \nheld beliefs about family planning. They have been opposed to what they \ncall artificial forms of birth control from the beginning. At this \npoint, the controversy came up--although those religious institutions \nthat are strictly religious, such as the church rectory, the convent, \nand the like, are exempted from any requirements when it comes to \nhealth insurance--what of those religious-sponsored institutions such \nas universities, hospitals, and charities? What should their \nrequirements be when it comes to health insurance for their employees? \nSo the Obama administration said their employees should also receive \nthe most essential and basic services, including preventive care for \nwomen, including family planning, and that is when the controversy lit \nup.\n  The President came to what I thought was a reasonable compromise, and \nhere is what it says: A religious-sponsored university hospital, \ncharity, or the like will not be required to offer health services such \nas family planning if it violates their basic religious beliefs. Their \nhealth insurance policy will not be required to cover those services. \nHowever, if an individual employee of that religious-sponsored \ninstitution chooses on their own initiative to go forward to the health \ninsurance company, they can receive that service without charge. So the \nwomen will be offered these preventive care services, which are \nessential to their health, and yet there will be no requirement of the \nsponsoring institution to include those services. It is strictly a \nmatter of the employee opting for that coverage.\n  Now comes the Blunt amendment. Senator Blunt of Missouri said we \nshould go beyond that and allow employers and insurance companies \nacross America to decide the limitations of health insurance policies \nif those limitations follow the conscience and values of the employer. \nKeep in mind, we have gone way beyond religious-sponsored institutions; \nwe are talking about individual employers making that decision.\n  Think of the diversity of opinion and belief across America, and \nimagine, then, what we will come up with. We have heard many things \nmentioned on the floor. My colleagues have made reference to \nindividuals who may have a particular religious belief, and own a \nbusiness that has no connection at all to a religion otherwise, and \ndecide then that under the Blunt amendment they will limit health \ninsurance coverage accordingly. We can think of possibilities. Someone \nbelieves in conscience that a woman should never use birth control and \nsays, then, that it will be prohibited from being offered by the health \ninsurance policy of that employer. At the end of the day we would have \na patchwork quilt of health insurance coverage and many people in this \ncountry--men and women--denied basic health coverage in their health \ninsurance because the employer believes in conscience it shouldn't be \noffered. That is an impossible situation. It goes beyond the freedom of \nreligion, to imposing someone's religious belief on another, in a \nsituation that could endanger their lives.\n  The Blunt amendment would be a step in the wrong direction for this \ncountry. I think what the President has seized on is a reasonable \ncourse of action, to allow religious-sponsored institutions to follow \ntheir moral dictates when it comes to the health insurance they offer, \nbut to still protect the right of individuals to seek the protection \nthey need. I know it is going to be a controversial vote, but it is one \nthat is important, because I think it strikes the right balance. I \nthink it reflects back on decisions and values we have established as a \ncountry and that we should work to protect, even in the midst of a \nPresidential campaign when the rhetoric involved in it is very hot and \ninflammatory.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak of the atrocities that are being \ncommitted every day by the Syrian Government against its own citizens--\nthousands who have stood bravely month after month against unspeakable \nviolence simply to ask for basic political freedoms we take for granted \nin this country. And I rise to speak of the indefensible and \ninexplicable support of this brutal regime by Russia.\n  It has now been almost one full year since the Syrian uprising began \nin March 2011. By some reports, over 6,000 innocent people--civilians--\nhave lost their lives in Syria. The exact number may never be known. \nHumanitarian groups have been prohibited from even assisting the \nwounded, and reporters prohibited from telling the story to the world. \nSyria's third largest city, Homs, has been bombarded with rockets and \nbombs by the Syrian military for over 3 weeks with scores of deaths, \nshortages of food and medical supplies.\n  One report describes rockets--11 rockets--slamming into a single \napartment building in the space of 2 minutes. As soon as the barrage \nstopped and people started to rush to get away, it started again, \nkilling even more. The result: a horrific trail of death and dying in \nthis building from the fifth floor on down.\n  Those killed in Syria include two western journalists. Some suspect \nthey might have been targeted. The murder of a well-known video \nblogger, Rami el-Sayed, supports that claim.\n  In this photo, my colleagues can see the results of the Syrian \nGovernment's bombardment of the city of Homs. Sadly, this is likely one \nof the many burial ceremonies that the people of that city have had to \nendure recently. Just a few days ago, it was reported that the bodies \nof 64 men were covered in a mass grave on the outskirts of the city. \nThe women and children who were with them have gone missing.\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\n  The Independent National Commission of Inquiry on Syria, working with \nthe U.N., submitted its most recent report on February 26. It said the \nSyrian Government has accelerated the killing of its own people, \nparticularly in Homs, resulting in the deaths of nearly 800 civilians \nin the first 2 weeks of February alone. From the report:\n\n       On several occasions in January and February 2012, entire \n     families--children and adults--were brutally murdered in \n     Homs.\n\n  It is also noted that protesters have been arrested without cause, \ntortured, and even summarily executed.\n  In October, Senators Cardin, Menendez, Boxer, and I sent a letter to \nthe Ambassador to the United Nations from the United States, Susan \nRice, urging that the Syrian Government be referred to the \nInternational Criminal Court for possible indictment for war crimes. \nCertainly the evidence for such charges is overwhelming and continues \nto this day.\n  Assad has paid lip service to reforms such as the sham constitutional \nreferendum last Sunday. The document's most important changes included \ngiant caveats that they would, in effect, maintain the status quo as it \nexists in Syria.\n  One example is Assad's introduction of Presidential term limits to 2 \nterms of 7 years each, but the clock wouldn't start until Assad's \ncurrent term expires in 2014, giving him 14 more years in office, a \ntotal of 28 years. Incomprehensible.\n  Secretary Clinton aptly described the referendum as a cynical ploy, \nto say the least.\n  On February 17, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution that:\n\n       Strongly condemns the government of Syria's brutal and \n     unjustifiable use of force against civilians, including \n     unarmed women and children and its violations of the \n     fundamental human rights and dignity of the people of Syria.\n\n  Additionally, the U.N. General Assembly on February 16 passed a \nresolution by a vote of 137 to 12:\n\n       Strongly condemning continuing widespread and systematic \n     human rights violations by the Syrian authorities.\n\n  Last Friday, more than 60 governments and organizations gathered in \nTunis under the auspices of the Friends of Syria rubric and they called \nfor an immediate cease-fire, the provision of humanitarian aid, and a \nU.N. peacekeeping force.\n  The international community has coalesced in support of the Syrian \npeople. I wish to recognize once again the leadership of the Arab \nLeague in building this consensus against the bloodshed. Even some U.N. \nSecurity Council members such as India and South Africa, that early on \nhad concerns about speaking out, can no longer stand by silently as the \nkilling continues. In the most recent U.N. Security Council vote \nearlier this month, they chose to do the right thing and to vote in \nfavor of the latest resolution backing the Arab League peace plan.\n  However, as sad as it is to report, this resolution was vetoed by \nRussia and China. The exceptions to the international solidarity and \nsupport of the Syrian people have been Iran, China, and Russia. While \nboth Iran and China's support for the Assad regime is deplorable, it is \neven worse in the case of Russia, for it is Russia that has the most \nblood of innocent Syrian women and children on its hands. Russia is not \nonly protecting President Assad as he kills his own people, but it \ncontinues to supply him with the weapons to do it. How can any \nresponsible nation take such action?\n  In an interview following the Friends of Syria meeting, Secretary of \nState Clinton said:\n\n       It's quite distressing to see two permanent members of the \n     Security Council using their veto when people are murdered: \n     Women, children, brave young men. It's just despicable. And I \n     ask, whose side are they on?\n\n  Russia has chosen to align itself with a murderous regime, to impede \ndemocratic reform, and to facilitate the killing of innocent people by \nputting more and more weapons into the hands of those eager to pull the \ntrigger.\n  Despite 6,000 innocent civilians dying, despite the overwhelming \ninternational consensus that Assad has lost legitimacy to lead the \nSyrian people, Russia continues to sell arms to Syria. According to \nmedia reports:\n\n       Shipping data shows at least four cargo ships since \n     December that left the Black Sea port of Oktyabrsk--used by \n     Russian arms exporters for arms shipments have headed for or \n     reached the Syrian port of Tartous. Separately was the \n     Chariot, a Russian ship which docked at the Cypriot port \n     of Limassol during stormy weather in mid-January. It \n     promised to change its destination in accordance with a \n     European Union ban on weapons to Syria but, hours after \n     leaving Limassol, reset its course for Syria.\n\n  The Russian arming of the Syrian murderers continues.\n  A Cypriot source said that ship was carrying a load of ammunition and \na European security source said the ship was hauling ammunition and \nsniper rifles of the kind used increasingly by Syrian Government forces \nagainst protesters.\n  I want to show one other photograph I have here in the Chamber. This \nphoto is of one of those Russian warships--an aircraft carrier--docked \nat the Syrian port of Tartous on January 8. What we could not turn into \na poster is the video clip showing the Russian warship captains being \ngreeted like royalty by the Syrian Minister of Defense who went out to \npersonally welcome their ship.\n  Rebel soldiers and an official who defected from the Government of \nSyria say Moscow's small-arms trade with Damascus is booming, and that \nthe government doubled its military budget in 2011 to pay for the \nbrutal response to this opposition.\n  That said, Russia is in a unique position. It has President Assad's \ntrust and confidence--maybe more than any other country. Should Russia \nchoose, it could use this power and influence to constructively broker \na real transition and an end to this bloodshed.\n  The longer President Assad holds power in Syria, the more innocent \npeople will die. The window for a more peaceful transition and ending \nis closing. Now is the time for Russia to lead in the right direction--\nto be a responsible global partner, and to be part of a solution in \nending the carnage, bloodshed, and death in Syria.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n   Tribute to Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two pillars of \nWest Virginia--an educational institution that is educating the people \nof our State for good-paying jobs they are going to need and a beloved \nfigure who put our State at the forefront of advances in mental health.\n  First, please allow me to recognize Southern West Virginia Community \nand Technical College for its distinguished ranking as the 14th best \ncommunity college in the Nation because of all the work its staff and \nstudents have done together to develop the skills necessary to compete \nin the workplace.\n  All of us in my great State know about Southern's dedication to \nactive and collaborative learning, and we are so proud that Washington \nMonthly recognized the school's achievements in its most recent \nrankings.\n  This accomplishment is not the work of any one person, but a shared \ncommitment to excellence from the school's leadership, faculty, staff, \nand students. I applaud everyone who is involved at Southern for their \nfocus on improving educational quality through strengthened student \nengagement and student success.\n  In addition, I am so pleased that Southern is thriving under the \nsteadfast leadership of President Joanne Jaeger Tomblin, who is also \nserving the public as West Virginia's First Lady. For more than 12 \nyears, Joanne has been the visionary and the driving force behind many \nof these accomplishments. Her unwavering enthusiasm and tireless \ndedication transcend geographical barriers to bring extraordinary \neducational opportunities to all of southern West Virginia.\n  I tell young people all the time that they cannot sit on the \nsidelines and watch life happen. They have to get in the game and start \nmaking the calls. The same goes for those students who are returning to \nschool for training or who are taking the initiative to take their \ncareers to the next level.\n  Southern helps all students--those who are just starting out and \nthose who are in the middle of their careers--build critical skills and \nget an education to become a workforce that will meet our needs in the \n21st century and beyond. Every day, these students and their teachers \nare doing the hard work\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\nthat will make our great State and country competitive by finding new \nways to create good jobs and rebuild our economy.\n  Again, I am so proud of this accomplishment at Southern, and it is \njust one example of what we can achieve when we all work together.\n\n\n                Remembering Dr. Mildred Mitchell-Bateman\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to recognize the accomplishments and \nlife of a mental health pioneer and a most beautiful and true West \nVirginia hero, who we were so sad to lose last month. It is only \nfitting to honor her today on the last day of Black History Month.\n  Dr. Mildred Mitchell-Bateman leaves behind a remarkable legacy. She \ntransformed care for mentally ill patients by working tirelessly to \nprovide hope to people who were once believed to be untreatable. Her \nwork emphasized the importance of family and community--two values we \nhold so dear in West Virginia--and she put a high priority on making \nsure people received care near their homes.\n  Mildred Mitchell made West Virginia her home in 1946, when she was \nhired as a staff physician at West Virginia's Lakin State Hospital, \nwhich at the time was a hospital for mentally ill patients who were \nAfrican American. There she met and married her husband William L. \nBateman, a therapist at Lakin and a native West Virginian.\n  Throughout her 89 years, Mildred Mitchell-Bateman remained committed \nto serving those without a voice in our community. After leaving Lakin \nto practice medicine privately, Mildred returned to the hospital as the \nclinical director, and 3 years later was promoted to superintendent. In \n1962, Mildred was named as the director of the State's Department of \nMental Health, becoming the first African-American woman to lead a West \nVirginia State agency.\n  Mildred's vision for psychiatric care extended beyond West Virginia, \nearning her national recognition and requests for service. In 1973, she \nbecame the first Black woman to serve as vice president of the American \nPsychiatric Association. A short time later, she was appointed to the \nPresident's Commission on Mental Health, where she played an important \nrole in the creation of the 1980 Mental Health Systems Act.\n  Dr. Mitchell-Bateman was a doctor, a teacher, and a pioneer. Her \naccomplishments are made even more remarkable by the adversity she \nfaced. Her life serves as a powerful example to us all of what one can \naccomplish with conviction, dedication, and true West Virginia grit.\n  Mildred Mitchell-Bateman will forever be remembered for her many \nyears of dedicated service to the Mountain State, her passion and \ndedication to the mental health community, and for touching the lives \nof so many patients. On top of that, she was also a loving mother to \nseven children, and a very proud grandmother to ten wonderful \ngrandchildren.\n  Gayle and I are keeping the Mitchell-Bateman families in our hearts \nand prayers. While we know that Mildred Mitchell-Bateman is gone, her \nlegacy and service to the people of West Virginia will keep her alive \nin our hearts forever.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we have had a long discussion today on \nthe amendment to the surface transportation bill offered by my \ncolleague and friend from Missouri, Senator Blunt. I think the \ndiscussion has shown pretty clearly that the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Missouri is both way beyond the scope of what most people \nenvisioned and is extreme. It is way beyond the scope because it would \ncause the deprival of certain types of health care to perhaps millions \nof Americans in areas that go way beyond contraception.\n  All an employer would have to do is say they have a moral objection \nto providing vaccinations and they would not have to provide health \ncare. Maybe the employees could sue or go to court for 10 years and \nfigure this out, but that is not what we want. So it would be a giant \nstep backward in terms of health care.\n  It is also a giant step backward in terms of depriving millions of \nAmerican women of contraception. In a sense, this is a ban on \ncontraception, at least for the millions of American women whose \nemployers would say they do not want to provide contraception. Some \nmight be motivated by religious beliefs, some might be motivated by \nsimply saving money, and we would never know except after long and \ncostly litigation. Again, that would deprive the employee of \ncontraception for a very long time.\n  I think if people listened in on this debate, they would say this was \na debate occurring not in 2012 but maybe in 1912 or even 1812 because \nissues such as a woman's right to contraception without the employer \nmaking a determination have long been decided by this country. We have \nseen the statistics. The overwhelming majority of Americans of every \nfaith believe contraception should be available.\n  So the debate has been pretty clear. I think the other side is making \na huge mistake--certainly substantively, and in my judgment \npolitically--so much so that today the leading Presidential candidate \non the Republican side, when asked whether he supported the Blunt \namendment said, no; he did not think Congress should be getting \ninvolved in contraception. Mr. Romney said we should not be doing this \namendment, and he did not support it, unequivocally and clearly.\n  A few hours later, of course, his folks walked that back, probably \nbecause of political pressure. He is facing Republican primaries where \nthis issue is debated seriously, even if the rest of America does not \nbelieve that it should be debated. But what it shows is even when a \nleading candidate of the other side who is seeking votes from the hard \nright has doubts about whether this is a good idea, those doubts are \nreal.\n  The other side should make a retreat. Our Republican colleagues \nshould not make the same mistake they made on the payroll tax deduction \nby appealing to an extreme group. They should back off this amendment. \nThey should vote with us, and we should move on and debate the highway \nbill and put millions of Americans to work and update our \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment we are considering today \nrepresents a direct assault on access to preventive health care \nservices for millions of women in this country. The ostensible purpose \nof this proposal is to protect the rights of conscience of any employer \nor healthcare insurer, religious or secular, who may have a religious \nor moral objection to providing family planning services free of charge \nto their employees. I respect and will defend the moral values of \nemployers and insurance companies. But I also respect the moral values \nof people who need medical services. So we will end up deciding whether \nor not to deny access to critical and possibly lifesaving health \nservices for millions of people in this country, not whose religious or \nmoral values have precedence.\n  As drafted, Senator Blunt's amendment would grant employers and \nhealth insurance companies the power to deny access to not just \npreventive healthcare services for women, but any healthcare service, \nfor anyone, regardless of its nature. This means any employer could \nchoose to deny employees insurance coverage for such things as \nchildren's immunizations; mammograms; lifesaving cancer treatments; or \nblood transfusions simply because that employer may find these or any \nother healthcare services morally objectionable.\n  For the Senate to pass such a policy would be indefensible. It would \ngo far beyond nullifying the administration's rule to implement \nprovisions in the Affordable Care Act requiring access to some \npreventive services at no cost. Instead, this amendment would codify \ninfringement on personal healthcare decisions, would grant an employer \nthe right to substitute his moral convictions for those of his \nemployees, and would effectively deny access to critical healthcare \nservices.\n  Considering that some of my colleagues vociferously defend the idea \nof personal liberties, I am truly surprised they would support a policy \nto undermine those same liberties by handing\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\npower over an individual's personal healthcare decisions to that \nindividual's employer or his insurance company.\n  This body took a bold and historic step by enacting healthcare reform \nin 2010. We accomplished something that had eluded the country and the \nCongress for decades. The law recognizes that women have specific \nmedical needs and that gaps have historically existed in preventive \ncare for women. And it correctly called for specific steps to address \nthat. We should not now support policies that would not only walk these \nadvances back, but take giant leaps backwards in access to healthcare \nservices for everyone. I urge our colleagues to vote against this \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Kohl and have \nlong supported the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, NOPEC. \nWe were able to pass this NOPEC bill as a response to the OPEC oil \ncartel by a vote of 70 to 23 a few years ago. The Senate should pass it \nagain. This time, the House should also adopt this sensible application \nof our antitrust laws to those who fix prices and manipulate the oil \nmarket to the detriment of American consumers.\n  We should be doing what we can to ensure that oil prices are not \nartificially inflated. That affects gas prices at the pump. This NOPEC \namendment will hold accountable the collusive behavior that \nartificially reduces supply and increases the price of fuel. The rise \nand fall of oil and gas prices has a direct impact on American \nconsumers and our economy. We should increase accountability and take \naway the profits of those who manipulate prices and supply to their \nbenefit and unfairly prey upon consumers.\n  On Monday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that \nprices for regular gas rose 13 cents per gallon last week to a \nnationwide average of $3.78. Gasoline pump prices are up 34 cents a \ngallon over last year. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on \nthe skyrocketing price of oil in May 2008, but these recent increases \nin price have led to renewed calls for investigation into their causes. \nWe already know one significant cause: anticompetitive conduct by oil \ncartels.\n  The artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us. \nFuel prices are on the rise and American consumers and businesses are \nfeeling the pain at the pump. This week Vermonters are paying $ 3.79 \nfor a gallon of regular gasoline; last week, Vermonters were paying \n$3.70--a price jump of 9 cents in just 1 week. In 2011, the price for \ncertain fuels rose by as much as one-third from 2010, according to the \nVermont Department of Public Service. These prices affect everyone. \nThese high fuel prices hit Vermonters especially hard in even the most \nmild of winters.\n  In rural States such as Vermont, the cost of simply getting to work \nor to the grocery store because of high gas prices can further hurt \nalready strapped household incomes. Vermont farmers shoulder the burden \nof surging fuel prices year-round, regardless of the season. Higher \nfuel prices can add thousands of dollars in yearly costs to a 100-head \ndairy operation in the Northeast.\n  As we head into the summer months, when gas prices typically \nincrease, soaring prices at the pump can affect the tourism industry, \nan economic driver in vacation destinations such as Vermont. As our \nsummer months approach, many families in and around Vermont are going \nto find that OPEC has put an expensive crimp in their plans. Some are \nlikely to stay home, others will pay more to drive or to fly so that \nthey can visit their families or take their well-deserved vacations.\n  American consumers should not be held as economic hostages to the \nwhim of those who collude unfairly for their gain. We should not permit \nanyone to manipulate oil prices in an anticompetitive manner. The \ncollusive behavior of certain oil producing nations has artificially \nand drastically reduced the supply and inflated the price of fuel. Put \nsimply, the behavior of these oil cartels, which would be illegal under \nantitrust laws, harms American consumers and businesses and our \nrecovering economy.\n  Authorizing action against illegal oil price fixing and taking that \naction without delay is one thing we can do without additional \nobstruction or delay. Our amendment would allow the Justice Department \nto crack down on illegal price manipulation by oil cartels. This bill \nwill allow the Federal Government to take legal action against any \nforeign state, including members of OPEC, for price fixing and \nartificially limiting the amount of available oil. While OPEC actions \nremain sheltered from antitrust enforcement, the ability of the \ngovernments involved to wreak havoc on the American economy remains \nunchecked.\n  Our antitrust laws have been called the ``Magna Carta of free \nenterprise.'' If OPEC were simply a foreign business engaged in this \ntype of behavior, it would already be subject to them. It is wrong to \nlet OPEC producers off the hook just because their anticompetitive \npractices come with the seal of approval of national governments.\n  In the past, our NOPEC legislation has had bipartisan support. A few \nyears ago it passed overwhelmingly. By passing this legislation, we can \nsay no to OPEC.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PAULINE WHITE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a woman who \nhas answered a call to service, and given so freely of herself over the \ncourse of her fruitful lifetime. Ms. Pauline White of Cumberland, KY, \nhas not ceased giving to her fellow man, even though she is entering \nher 80s. Contrary to what one may think, Ms. White has not let her age \nstop her from participating in the missionary work that is so dear to \nher heart.\n  Ms. White, who was working as a missionary in Sebring, FL, at the \nAssociation for Retarded Citizens in 2002, felt that she was called by \nGod to come and bring aid to eastern Kentucky. She put up a ``For \nSale'' sign in her yard, and called a few of her lady friends to come \nover and help her begin to pack her belongings. Just a few hours later \na couple knocked on the door, asked about the price of the house, and \nended up buying the house in cash later that day. Ms. White did not \nworry about selling her house for long, which she believed was just \nanother sure sign from God that her journey to Kentucky was part of His \nplans.\n  Ms. White is now the director of Shepherd's Pantry, an outreach \nprogram in Cumberland, KY, that provides food for 500 to 900 low-income \nfamilies on the second Wednesday of each month. Families that \nparticipate in the program are assigned appointments to come to the \npantry and receive what Ms. White and her volunteers have worked so \nhard to prepare for them. At the pantry, the families are given food, \npersonal hygiene items, and treats for their children. But according to \nMs. White, the most important thing the families receive from \nShepherd's Pantry is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The volunteers at the \npantry drop gospel tracts in each of the bags that the families \nreceive, and then they wait for the Lord to move. The staff is always \navailable to provide those in need with spiritual counseling.\n  Along with their aid of food to families in need, Shepherd's Pantry \nalso distributes government commodities to low-income families, \nsupplies breakfast for schoolchildren, and provides snacks to mission \ngroups throughout the area.\n  Shepherd's Pantry has attracted volunteers from as far as Florida, \nand as close as London, KY. The volunteers come to witness God's work \nin the community. And according to Ms. White, they have yet to be \ndisappointed. She says that God performs miracles week after week.\n  Ms. White recalls one instance when the computer wiped out all of the\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\nnames of the Pantry's clients and addresses. The staff tried just about \neverything to get the computer to turn back on, but nothing seemed to \nhelp. After much praying, the computer miraculously booted up and \nprinted all 500 names, addresses, and emails. Upon hearing about the \nphenomenon, the mail station company said ``No way!'' Ms. White \nresponded with, ``Yes, God's way!''\n  Ms. White has no intentions of ending her mission work anytime soon. \nShe has handpicked a Bible verse in Psalms Chapter 91, Verse 11, which \nis very dear to her heart: ``For he will command his angels concerning \nyou to guard you in all your ways.'' In Sebring, FL, in 2002, Ms. White \nheard a preacher speak of a lady who was still serving the Lord at 86 \nyears old. She thought to herself, ``I still have 14 years to go!'' Ms. \nWhite offers this advice to other ``old folks'': ``When he calls, I \nthink you need to consider his call and not your age.''\n  The service and good works of Ms. Pauline White and Shepherd's Pantry \nhave contributed mightily to the town of Cumberland, the surrounding \nregion, and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky. Ms. White is providing \nnourishment not just for her neighbors' bellies, but also for their \nspirits. Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my colleagues \nin the U.S. Senate to join me in commemorating the great service of Ms. \nPauline White.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1143-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING RARE DISEASE DAY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, since 2009 the last day of February \nhas been observed as Rare Disease Day. Each rare disease affects a \nsmall patient population--less than 200,000 people--but there are more \nthan 7,000 rare diseases that, combined, affect 30 million Americans. \nSadly, children with rare genetic diseases account for more than half \nof the rare disease population.\n  Patients with rare diseases--such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, \nTay-Sachs, epidermolysis bullosa, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, \nand many childhood cancers--face unique challenges. Too many of these \nconditions lack effective treatments and cures, and too often people \nwith rare diseases experience challenges in obtaining an accurate \ndiagnosis. In addition, there is often difficulty finding physicians or \ntreatment centers with the necessary expertise in rare diseases or \ndisorders.\n  Great strides have been made in research and treatment as the result \nof the Orphan Drug Act, but more must be done to prevent, identify, \ncombat, and treat rare diseases. By designating February 29, 2012, as \nRare Disease Day, I hope we create greater awareness of these \nconditions, encourage accurate and early diagnosis of rare diseases and \ndisorders, and help demonstrate and support a national and global \ncommitment to improve treatment options for individuals with rare \ndiseases and disorders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1143-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        READ ACROSS AMERICA DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nCandonino Agusen and Jackson Button, two students from my State, who \nwere named as top youth volunteers for 2012 by the Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity Awards. The awards were created in 1995 through a partnership \nbetween Prudential and the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals to honor middle and high school students for outstanding \nservice to others at the local, State, and national levels.\n  Every year, the top high school and middle school youth volunteers \nfrom each State and the District of Columbia are selected as State \nHonorees. Each honoree receives a $1,000 award, an engraved silver \nmedallion, and an all-expense paid trip to Washington, D.C. for several \ndays of national recognition events. In addition, other noteworthy \nstudents from each State are named Distinguished Finalists and receive \na bronze medallion for their contributions.\n  After the natural disasters in Japan in 2011, Candonino, a junior at \nKealakehe High School, recruited others to help him purchase temporary \nhousing kits for the victims displaced by the earthquake and tsunami. \nThese kits included a tent, survival equipment, and a month of supplies \nfor up to 10 people. His team raised more than $64,000, enough to take \ncare of 640 earthquake victims for a month. Candonino contributed \nanother $2,000 by making and sending 1,000 paper origami cranes to \nJapan as a symbol of support.\n  Jackson, a middle school student at Hawaii Technology Academy, co-\nfounded a nonprofit organization with his sisters that has raised \nnearly $100,000 to support a wide variety of projects aiding children \nin Africa, Mexico, and the United States. Some of the projects funded \nby the organization include scholarships for children who have lost a \nparent to cancer or other diseases, a solar heater for a Mexican \norphanage, and school supplies for underprivileged students in Hawaii. \nThrough the nonprofit, Jackson and his sisters even arranged for a van \nto take HIV/AIDS orphans in Uganda to medical appointments, and bought \nfour acres of land in that country to grow food and build a new \norphanage.\n  I would also like to recognize Scott Fetz of Kailua-Kona and Jessica \nSonson of Ewa Beach who were named the 2012 Distinguished Finalists \nfrom Hawaii, as well as the many other individuals who contribute to \nthe improvement of our communities every day. Our Nation is a better \nplace because of people like these young leaders, who are making a \ndifference in their communities and around the world. These students, \nlike many volunteers, do not perform these services for recognition. I \nam grateful for awards that acknowledge their selflessness so that \nthese role models can serve as inspiration for others. I am proud of \nall that these students have accomplished, and I wish them the best in \ntheir bright futures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1144-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING MEDSTAR ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of MedStar St. Mary's Hospital in Leonardtown, MD. When St. \nMary's Hospital was founded in 1912, it was Leonardtown's first \ncommunity health care center, located in a modest two-story home. The \nsurrounding population was small and rural, and the hospital's running \nwater was heralded in a local newspaper. The new health care center was \nthe first of many institutions that marked the beginning of St. Mary's \nCounty's transformation into the modern, thriving region it is today.\n  As the county has grown and evolved from humble beginnings, so has \nthe hospital. Today, St. Mary's is a full-service hospital facility \nwhich offers state-of-the-art emergency, acute inpatient and outpatient \ncare. The emergency room serves over 50,000 patients per year, and St. \nMary's is leading the way in using cutting-edge medical technology. St. \nMary's was the first hospital in southern Maryland to achieve full \ncertification as a stroke center and won the prestigious Delmarva \nFoundation Excellence Award five times for consistent improvements in \npatient safety and clinical outcomes. The hospital's fully integrated \nelectronic medical records system is ranked among the top 5 percent \nnationally.\n  St. Mary's is committed to a ``patients first'' philosophy, which is \nevident in consistently high patient satisfaction scores. At St. \nMary's, treating every patient with respect and compassion is an \nessential part of the healing process. The hospital offers dignity, \ncomfort, and support to each and every patient and his or her family.\n  In 2009, St. Mary's joined the MedStar Health System. This \npartnership helps St. Mary's meet the expanding medical needs of the \nsouthern Maryland community and offer the region greater access to \nspecialty care. A new name that blends the hospital's history and \nfuture--MedStar St. Mary's Hospital--has been unveiled to celebrate its \ncentennial.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating MedStar St. Mary's \nHospital on 100 years of providing outstanding patient-centered care to \nthe residents of Leonardtown and the southern Maryland region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1144-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING ST. PAUL'S PARISH\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nwish to recognize St. Paul Roman Catholic Church of the Diocese of \nScranton, PA, as it celebrates its 125th anniversary. Saint Paul's \nchurch and school have been a place of worship and education for my \nfamily for generations.\n  St. Paul's Parish, of the Green Ridge Section of Scranton, was \ncreated by Bishop Reverend William O'Hara in 1887 as the sprawl from \nthe center city of Scranton commenced with growth in the anthracite \ncoal industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The first mass, on March 1, \n1887, was attended by 300 people.\n  A more permanent church, which included classroom space and an \nauditorium, was built just 3 years later in 1890. In 1892, the Sisters \nof the Immaculate Heart of Mary began teaching at the school and \ncontinue to do so today. A convent was built for the sisters in 1898.\n  After 38 years, the building that housed the church and school became \ninsufficient, and in 1928, St. Paul School was built and is still in \noperation. As Green Ridge's population continued to grow, the parish \nbuilt St. Clare School in 1952, St. Clare Church in 1955, and St. Clare \nConvent in 1958. Finally, St. Paul's current church was built in 1952 \nand was renovated in 1999 2000.\n  Under the current leadership of Monsignor William Feldcamp, St. \nPaul's Parish remains vibrant with over 4,500 members.\n  I wish the entire St. Paul community my best as Bishop Joseph C. \nBambera celebrates the 125th anniversary mass on Sunday, March 4, \n2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1144-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1144-S1145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING CHEYNEY UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 175th \nanniversary of Cheyney University. Founded on February 25, 1837, as the \nInstitute for Colored Youth, Cheyney University is the oldest of the \nNation's historically black colleges and universities.\n  Born in an era that legally and commonly defined African Americans as \nproperty, the Institute for Colored Youth sought to provide a pathway \nfor educational enrichment to a community wherein few opportunities \nexisted.\n  Established through the donation of Richard Humphreys, a Quaker \nphilanthropist who settled in Philadelphia in 1764, the Institute for \nColored Youth sought to prepare African Americans to educate their \ncommunities as teachers. Recognizing that African Americans lacked both \nmeans and access to higher education, the Institute for Colored Youth \nprovided classes in classical education to young students at no cost in \nthe first years of its creation.\n  Over time, the vision of the Institute for Colored Youth grew into \nwhat we now know as Cheyney University.\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\nToday, Cheyney University offers a diverse array of academic \nprogramming, including bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees \nin more than 30 fields, master of science and master of education, \nmaster of arts in teaching, and master of public administration. The \nongoing evolution of Cheyney University is evidenced in continuous \nefforts to identify new methods and opportunities to prepare their \nstudents to succeed.\n  As we celebrate African-American achievement and extraordinary \naccomplishments this month, we must also pay tribute to the \ninstitutions that are the foundations of these successes. Cheyney \nUniversity's legacy of academic achievement spans throughout the Civil \nWar, Reconstruction, the era of Jim Crow and the Civil Rights movement \nand continues today. Cheyney University, having grown from the darker \nchapters of American history, has served as a true instrument of change \nin the quest for equal access to opportunities. It is both an honor and \na privilege to commemorate Cheyney University and its tremendous impact \nthroughout Pennsylvania and across the Country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1145-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BILL RAGGIO\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the life \nand work of Bill Raggio, a steadfast Nevadan, my mentor, and dedicated \npublic servant who passed away on February 23, 2012. Our State has lost \na truly devoted leader and influential icon in Nevada politics. We \nmourn the passing of a dear friend and celebrate the life of a man who \nlived and fought for the betterment of our State.\n  The loss of Bill is something that will be felt all across Nevada. He \nwas truly a giant in every sense of the word. His recordbreaking 38 \nyears in the Nevada State Senate can only be described as selfless. \nOver the course of 10 terms, Bill was dedicated beyond question. He not \nonly demonstrated a tactful leadership style but also devoted himself \nto fiscal responsibility. His ability to compromise and his willingness \nto work across party lines helped him to overcome partisan differences \nand legislative hurdles to meet the needs of the great State of Nevada. \nBill influenced my work, and for that I am forever thankful.\n  Never afraid to tackle the difficult problems, Bill pledged his \ncommitment to dutifully protecting the citizens of northern Nevada as \nthe Washoe County district attorney. He was a great man who fought hard \nfor Nevadans and was respected by many. We are fortunate and proud to \nremember Bill, a second-generation Nevadan and Reno native.\n  Bill touched the lives of tens of thousands of Nevada families, \nspanning generations. He served Nevadans with honor and devotion, and \nwe are blessed by Bill's enduring and undeniable passion for public \nservice. I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the life \nof a great statesman who will always be remembered for his unwavering \ncommitment to Nevada. His passing is a tremendous loss, and his legacy \nwill be cherished for generations to come. I wish to extend my deepest \nsympathies and condolences to Bill's wife Dale and the entire Raggio \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1145-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING PENBAY SOLUTIONS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have the privilege \nof hearing countless small business success stories from hard-working \nentrepreneurs across the country. Today I wish to recognize and commend \nthe extraordinary achievements of PenBay Solutions, an award-winning \ngeographic information systems, GIS, firm headquartered in Brunswick, \nME.\n  Since its inception in 1999, PenBay has grown to become a leader in \nthe expanding GIS industry while spurring job creation. Today, the \ncompany employs 26 people in Maine, many of which graduated from the \nUniversity of Maine system, a primer education institution for GIS. \nAdditionally, PenBay employs several individuals working remotely \naround the country as well as in their New York and Washington D.C. \noffices.\n  As a technology leader, PenBay Solutions provides geographic \ninformation to help clients economize space, cut costs, comply with \nbuilding codes, and make better decisions across the board. While GIS \nis an emerging technology, PenBay has been a forerunner in providing \nbusinesses with this vital asset and has distinguished themselves among \nclients in a breadth of industries including: education, health care, \ngovernment, and more.\n  Among their many achievements, PenBay has undertaken several complex \nand fascinating projects of note. In 2006, PenBay assisted the Fire \nDepartment of New York, FDNY, in complying with a New York City law \nthat required the FDNY to review certain buildings and evaluate \ncompliance with new building codes and evacuation procedures. PenBay \nplayed an instrumental role in helping the Department achieve this goal \nby automating over 16,000 floor plans for simple retrieval and \nevaluation. With PenBay's support, the FDNY was able to meet its goals \nand concentrate on its main mission: protecting and saving New York \nCity residents' lives.\n  In addition to working with the FDNY, PenBay has been awarded many \nother government contracts. In late 2008, PenBay assisted the 6th Civil \nEngineering Squadron of MacDill Air Force Base, 6CES, with a \nmaintenance contract of 130 government buildings. In this instance, \n6CES lacked the significant in-building data necessary to make informed \ndecisions about the space and floor materials within each building. \nWith minimal disruption to facility operations and within a remarkable \nturnaround time of 9 days, PenBay Solutions was able to complete Phase \n1 of the project and provide the necessary geospatial data for over 1.7 \nmillion square feet of building space.\n  As a result of the company's valuable work, Stuart Rich, PenBay's \nChief Technology Officer, was honored by the Technology Association of \nMaine with their 2011 CxO of the Year Award in recognition of his \ninnovation in the geographic information systems industry. Mr. Rich was \nalso inducted into the University of Maine's Francis Crowe Society in \n2010. This tremendous honor is bestowed upon University of Maine \nengineering graduates who have made substantial contributions to the \nengineering profession.\n  I applaud PenBay Solutions for being a hallmark example of an \ninnovative American small business. Their incredible contributions to \ngeospatial technology truly demonstrate the entrepreneurial spirit and \nremarkable talent found in my home State of Maine. I am proud to extend \nmy congratulations to everyone at PenBay Solutions, and offer my best \nwishes for their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1145-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1145-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1145-5", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1145-S1146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:26 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1433.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. VITTER (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\n  S. 2138. A bill to establish a pilot program to evaluate the cost-\neffectiveness and project delivery efficiency of non-Federal sponsors \nas the lead project delivery team for authorized civil works flood \ncontrol and navigation construction projects of the Corps of Engineers; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to talk about \nimportant and bipartisan legislation that I am introducing today, along \nwith Senator Bill Nelson of Florida. It is about the Corps of \nEngineers, and it is intended, and will once passed, to make a real \nimpact in terms of lessening the delays, the bureaucracy, and the \nhurdles all of us must go through in terms of seeing important Corps of \nEngineers projects through to fruition. It is called the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers Flood Control and Navigation Project Pilot Program.\n  Let us get right to the heart of the matter. The U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers is a broken bureaucracy. In several significant respects, it \nis simply a badly broken bureaucracy. Let me say upfront that there are \nmany smart, qualified people who work there. They are dedicated. They \nwork long, hard hours in so many cases, and I applaud their efforts. \nBut the overall structure and the overall bureaucracy within which we \nall must work to get important Corps of Engineers work done is simply \nbroken.\n  It takes, on average, about 6 years--6 years--for the Corps not to do \na project but to perform a preliminary study that might lead to an \nimportant flood control or navigation project. Then, when we actually \ntalk about the engineering work, the construction work, it takes at \nleast 20 years, on average, to accomplish any meaningful project. That \nis simply too long.\n  There are many reasons for this, and let me say at the outset that \nnot all those are the Corps of Engineers' fault. We in Congress, the \npublic, the country put so many demands and burdens on them that they \nare simply swamped. They have a backlog that, to some extent, is \nunavoidable, and that backlog for active projects--not projects being \nstudied or considered but the backlog for active approved projects--is \ncurrently $59.6 billion. But even considering that--even considering \nthat avalanche of demands and that backlog--the Corps of Engineers' \nbureaucracy is broken, and it adds to those problems and magnifies them \nenormously by extending the time and the cost of any given project.\n  Of course, when projects get extended in time and are delayed, when \ncosts grow over time. Then the initial problem--the backlog, that \ninitial avalanche of demands--explodes and is multiplied tenfold. This \nis the situation Senator Nelson and I are trying to address in a \nfocused, proactive, positive way.\n  Our bill would do one thing to address this. It would establish a \npilot program whereby the Corps of Engineers selects certain \nsignificant flood control and/or navigation projects and moves project \nmanagement authority, responsibility for those projects, from the Corps \nof Engineers down to the State and/or local sponsors. What do I mean by \nthat? Every project we are talking about, every Corps project, whether \nit is a flood control project or a navigation project, the Corps of \nEngineers doesn't do it alone. They have partners. On the governmental \nside, they specifically have State and/or local partners who almost \nalways pay a significant cost share of the project--usually about 35 \npercent. So those entities are already involved in a very meaningful \nway in these projects.\n  Our pilot program would tell the Corps to take certain select \nprojects which have been delayed, which are sitting on the shelf, with \ncosts and timelines growing, and move the project manager \nresponsibility out of the Corps of Engineers down to the State and \nlocal sponsors. The States and localities are the folks on the ground \nwho have even more of a vested interest and a need to actually get this \nwork done. They have the desire to cut through delays and the \nbureaucracy to get it done in a more aggressive way. So I am absolutely \nconvinced, if we can move this responsibility in a careful, thoughtful \nway down to the State and local sponsors, in virtually all cases that \nwill cut delays, that will cut timeframes, and in doing so it will \nsignificantly cut costs.\n  Again, this is not a radical idea. For one thing, these State and \nlocal entities I am talking about are already intimately involved in \nthese projects. They already have significant capacity to be \nproactively involved in these projects and they already have a stake in \nthe game--in most cases paying 35 percent of the project cost.\n  Secondly, the actual design, engineering and construction work is not \ndone by any of these entities anyway. In almost all cases, the huge \nmajority, or 100 percent, of that work--design, engineering, \nconstruction--is done by private business hired by the Corps, hired by \nthe State and locals to get this done. That will remain the same. So \nthe professionals doing the design, engineering, and construction work \nwill remain the same. That is not changing at all.\n  Third, the reason this idea is not a radical concept but is actually \na proven model is that what I am describing is more or less exactly \nwhat we do for Federal highway projects. It just so happens we are \ndebating a highway bill on the Senate floor, and that is a useful model \nto look to in this context. When we do highway projects, we have a \nFederal Highway Administration and we have significant Federal funds \nthat go to these highway projects, but the Federal agency--in that case \nthe Federal Highway Administration--is not the lead project manager, is \nnot intimately involved day to day, week to week, and year to year in \nmoving those projects along. Quite to the contrary, they are shipped \nand the dollars are shipped to the States and locals. In the huge \nmajority of cases, the States and/or locals are the lead project \nmanager entity taking control and leading the way.\n  So that is a proven model. That model works better compared to the \nway the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers works; that is, broad brush, \nexactly the model we are adopting. It will save time, and in doing so \nit will save significant money.\n  To ensure the Corps does not feel threatened by this, built into the \nbill, Senator Nelson and I have identified an offset. So even though \nthese projects that will be included in the pilot program have money \nthat has been allocated for them, we have an offset so that amount of \nmoney can be spent on those projects without diminishing what will \nremain as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' budget.\n  In fact, the Corps itself faces a win-win with this situation. They \nwill get rid of some of their responsibility and some of their work, \nbut there will not be any Federal U.S. Army Corps of Engineers money \nthat will leave them alone with that responsibility and with that work. \nQuite honestly, the Corps welcomes this, particularly in light of their \nbacklog and particularly in light of the avalanche of demands that are \nplaced on them.\n  For all these reasons, I hope all our colleagues in the Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans, will look carefully at this legislation and \njoin Senator Bill Nelson of Florida and myself. This is something that \nneeds to be done, because as I said at the beginning, the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers, unfortunately, is a badly broken bureaucracy in \nmany respects. It needs to be fixed. We need to respond to these flood \ncontrol and navigation needs on a real-time basis, not with 20, 30 \nyears' delay. We can't continue to compete in a global economy with \nthis sort of delay for vital navigation or vital flood control \nprojects. We need to cut through the bureaucracy and do a lot more with \nless. This legislation will help us get there.\n  I invite, and Senator Bill Nelson invites, all of our colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to look at this legislation. We invite all \nof our colleagues to join us in this very important reform of the Corps \nof Engineers.\n  In closing, let me also say that independent of this legislation, I \nam also pursuing a GAO audit of the Corps. I have already requested \nthat in writing and have received assurances that audit will happen. I \nthink that will be an additional and very helpful and necessary tool \nfor us to see how the Corps does or doesn't effectively do its business \nand to make other needed reforms in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' \nbureaucracy.\n  I look forward to pursuing that audit, getting the results of that, \nand seeing\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nwhere that leads in terms of other necessary Corps reforms in the near \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Johnson of South \n        Dakota, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 2141. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nmake it unlawful for a packer to own, feed, or control livestock \nintended for slaughter; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \ndesigned to help family farmers across this nation have a more level \nplaying field when it comes to livestock markets. The bill would \nprohibit meat packers from owning livestock. The ownership of livestock \nby packers compromises the marketplace and hinders the ability of the \nfarmer to receive a fair price. It is simple, as one meat-packing \nexecutive once told me, packers own livestock so that when prices are \nhigh, they slaughter their own livestock. When prices are low, they buy \nfrom farmers.\n  I would love to say opportunities for independent producers have \ngotten better since the last time we debated this bill during the 2008 \nFarm Bill. But that simply isn't the case. We are to the point where \nmost farmers have to deliver their livestock to one of a few very large \npackers. Farmers' bargaining power is diminished by the sheer size and \neconomic position of the packers. But beyond that, farmers have to \ncompete with the livestock owned by the packing plant itself. The \npacker ban would make sure the forces of the marketplace work for the \nbenefit of the farmer as much as it does for the slaughterhouse.\n  I am sure there will be folks in the packing industry that point out \nthat farmers are doing okay right now, and that's great that farmers \nare experiencing a good period. I am pleased anytime the hard work of \nlivestock farmers results in a good price. But I don't want my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to be lulled to sleep and think just \nbecause prices are good right now means we don't have competition \nissues in the livestock industry that need to be addressed. This is \nabout ensuring farmers are able to get fair prices for years to come. \nWe need to work today, and implement this reform, to ensure the next \ngeneration of independent farmers has an opportunity to raise livestock \nand receive fair prices as a result of their hard work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States;\n       (2) that objective has been attained, and the Interstate \n     System connecting all States is near completion;\n       (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State;\n       (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network \n     of transportation systems, including highways, that best \n     serves the needs of the State;\n       (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs;\n       (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the Federal Government's perceptions of what \n     is best for the States;\n       (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States;\n       (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities;\n       (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, \n     regardless of the different circumstances of the States, \n     cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars \n     on projects, programs, and activities that the States would \n     not otherwise undertake; and\n       (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to return to the individual States maximum \n     discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all \n     elements of the national surface transportation systems that \n     are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;\n       (2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways;\n       (3) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for--\n       (A) design, construction, and preservation of \n     transportation facilities on Federal public land;\n       (B) national programs of transportation research and \n     development and transportation safety; and\n       (C) emergency assistance to the States in response to \n     natural disasters;\n       (4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal \n     obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative \n     solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, \n     and preservation of Federal and State transportation \n     facilities; and\n       (5) with respect to transportation activities carried out \n     by States, local governments, and the private sector, to \n     encourage--\n       (A) competition among States, local governments, and the \n     private sector; and\n       (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector \n     participation, and productivity.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON EXPENDITURES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the \n     Secretary of Transportation determines for any fiscal year \n     that the aggregate amount required to carry out \n     transportation programs and projects under this Act and \n     amendments made by this Act exceeds the estimated aggregate \n     amount in the Highway Trust Fund available for those programs \n     and projects for the fiscal year, each amount made available \n     for such a program or project shall be reduced by the pro \n     rata percentage required to reduce the aggregate amount \n     required to carry out those programs and projects to an \n     amount equal to that available for those programs and \n     projects in the Highway Trust Fund for the fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, before I start the closing script, I want it \nto be spread on the record that we have tried all day to come up with \nan agreement to move forward on this legislation, and we have been \nunsuccessful.\n  This is a piece of legislation that is as bipartisan as is humanly \npossible. We have one of the most progressive Members of the Senate, \nSenator Boxer, and one of the most conservative Members of the Senate, \nJim Inhofe, who are cosponsoring this legislation. It is a piece of \nlegislation that continues the highway program, the surface \ntransportation program. It is so needed.\n  Yesterday, I had the director of the department of transportation in \nNevada, Susan Martinavich, come in. I am confident that most Senators \nhave had someone from their States here and had a conference. It will \nbring construction in Nevada to a standstill on our highways and \nbridges and some of the mass transit programs if we don't move forward. \nBut we can't even get on the bill.\n  I have agreed to do this unrelated amendment. My caucus agreed we \nwill do these. We don't want to; they are not productive. They are \nmessage amendments, and they are not germane or relevant. But we will \ndo a limited number of these bad amendments. There have been over 100 \nof them filed.\n  I am at a loss for words as to what the Republicans expect me to do--\nstand around for another week and look at each other?\n  We started moving to this bill on February 7. The amendment we are \ngoing to vote on tomorrow, out of nowhere, on a transportation bill, is \ndealing with contraception. We have agreed to have votes on it. They \nwill not let us have votes. Yesterday, I had to bring up a Republican \namendment they didn't even bother to file. They just wanted to talk \nabout it and hold press conferences on the issue.\n  Unless something changes, I am going to have to file cloture on this \nbill, and we are going to have to find out if the Republicans really \nwant destruction all across the 50 States and have another hit to our \neconomy by not doing highway construction, especially as the weather is \ngetting better. In the Presiding Officer's State of Oregon, which is \njust like Nevada, where unemployment has not been good, a lot can go \non. I have no alternative but to file cloture to stop the filibuster. \nIt is one of these roving filibusters where all these phantom people \nwill not let us move forward on this legislation.\n  I am almost embarrassed to be saying this in front of the Presiding \nOfficer. I say that because at the beginning of the year the Presiding \nOfficer, along with the junior Senator from New Mexico, thought maybe \nwe should change how this place operates. A number of us, in good \nconscience, believed the few changes we had made would be sufficient to \nestablish a better working situation. It hasn't been better. In fact, I \nam sorry to say, it is worse.\n  So we are going to--unless something happens--have a vote tomorrow. \nCan you imagine, I created a vote because they would not allow us to \nhave a vote? So I don't see what choice I have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/29/senate-section/article/S1156-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, \n                             MARCH 1, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.
