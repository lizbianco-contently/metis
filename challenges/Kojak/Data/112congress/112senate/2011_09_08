Mr. President, tonight, before a joint session of Congress, \nPresident Obama will address the Nation on the single most important \nissue facing our country: the unemployment crisis we have before us. I \nlook forward to hearing the specifics of his plan. I have spoken to \nhim, and I have a pretty good idea of what he is going to talk about.\n  I support his goal to create good jobs for the 14 million people who \nhave no jobs. This is a time of dark economic times, and it is \nimportant that we do this. I applaud the commonsense, bipartisan \napproach the President will unveil tonight to invest in badly needed \ninfrastructure and to cut taxes for working families and small \nbusinesses to spur job creation.\n  These are ideas around which Members of both parties should rally. \nRepublicans have always supported tax cuts. They have done it in the \npast, and they agree we must bring America's infrastructure up to 21st-\ncentury standards. I hope that in fact is the case. But\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\nif my Republican friends oppose these proposals now--proposals they \nhave supported in the past--the reason will be very clear: partisan \npolitics. Republicans seem convinced that a failing economy is good for \ntheir politics. They think that if they kill every jobs bill and stall \nevery effort to revive the economy, President Obama will lose. My good \nfriend the Republican leader has said so. He has said the Republican \nParty's No. 1 goal in this Congress is to defeat the President. But \nRepublicans aiming at the President have caught innocent Americans in \nthe crossfire.\n  This week, Republican leaders have said they want to work with the \nPresident and Democrats in Congress. They want to work on job creation \nin a bipartisan way, they say. I hope that in fact is the case, but \ntheir actions over the last 8 months speak much louder than their words \nof the last few days.\n  For example, Republicans opposed the reauthorization of the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research Program and the Economic Development \nAdministration. Both have proven track records of spurring innovation, \nencouraging entrepreneurship, and creating jobs. Republicans were \nwilling to put more than \\1/2\\ million Americans' jobs at risk and, in \nfact, eliminate those jobs rather than work with us to pass that \nlegislation.\n  The Senate passed much needed patent reform in March. Yet House \nRepublicans stalled for months before sending us back their version of \nthe bill, which we will vote on today. I am hopeful we can send it back \nto the House untouched.\n  Republicans wasted weeks threatening to shut down the economy this \nspring. They held our economy hostage for months this summer over a \nroutine vote on whether to pay the Nation's bills. Congress took the \nsame vote 18 times while President Reagan was President and 7 times \nwhile George W. Bush was President and never was the vote time-\nconsuming or contentious. Through it all, Republicans hacked away at \nfunding for the very programs that were helping to get this Nation's \neconomy back on its feet.\n  The results of their stall tactics, obstructionism, and mindless \nbudget cuts are beginning to show. Although the private sector created \njobs for the 18th month in a row, August saw no change in the national \nunemployment rate. Unemployment in Nevada is still the highest in the \nNation. But in spite of all this, the Republicans have refused to allow \nus to focus on unemployment. As Democrats introduced jobs bill after \njobs bill, Republicans made it clear they were more interested in \npursuing a political agenda than a jobs agenda.\n  We will no longer allow our Republican colleagues to put politics \nahead of the American people. There are two things we must get done \nthis work period and both will create and save jobs immediately. We \nneed to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration to protect both \nair travelers and airline workers--that is 80,000 jobs--and we must \npass a highway bill to fund construction projects across the Nation. \nThese two bills combined will save about 2 million jobs, including many \njobs in the struggling construction industry, and it will do it now. \nBut we need Republican help. We can't get it done without them. This is \ntheir chance to prove they remember the meaning of the word \n``bipartisan.'' It is time for necessity to trump ideology.\n  Senator Robert Byrd once said, ``Potholes know no parties.'' The \nchallenges this Nation faces today are greater than any speed bump, but \nthe road to recovery is the same: cooperation. Partisanship will not \nsolve our jobs crisis, but setting aside politics in service to our \ncountry certainly will.\n  Mr. President, we have been able to move forward this week and get \nsome work done. I especially appreciate very much the work of Senator \nKyl, who is the Republican whip. His work to put the patent bill in the \nposition it is in so we can finish that bill today--we certainly hope \nto be able to do that--has been very exemplary, and I appreciate it \nvery much.\n  Next week, likely, our first vote will be to do something about \nFEMA--the Federal Emergency Management Agency--which is broke. We have \nhad a string of natural catastrophes that have been just awful--Irene, \nLee, and tornadoes that don't have names, but the one that struck \nJoplin, MO, killed almost 200 people and devastated that town.\n  I went down to S-120 last night, and they had a number of scientists \nshowing some of the things they have developed. One of the things they \nhave developed--and these are things they have done at universities, \nhandmade pieces of magnificent equipment that do many things--is \nsomething they can place in the path of a storm--they have never been \nable to do that before--to determine from which direction the wind is \ncoming and how hard it blows. Without belaboring the point, one of the \ninstruments there recorded the strongest winds ever recorded in the \nhistory of the world--more than 300 miles an hour. That is basically \nwhat we had in Joplin, MO. There is no building that can withstand \nthat. It is devastating.\n  The pictures you see of Joplin, MO, look like a series of bombs hit. \nEvery building was affected, most of them knocked down. The reason I \nmention that is that FEMA has stopped work in Joplin, MO. People were \nthere working for $9 an hour, just putting things back into some \nsemblance of order, but that work has stopped. FEMA has had to look at \nthe places that are impacted right now. They are still trying to get \nthe water out of some places because of Lee and to restore some of the \nimmediate damage done by Irene. We have to do something to replenish \nthat money.\n  I was happy to see some of the statements from one of the Republican \nleaders in the House yesterday in effect changing his position on how \nall this has to be paid for. As we speak, we are spending billions of \ndollars every week in Iraq and Afghanistan. I understand that. But that \nis all unpaid for--unpaid for.\n  Certainly, we have to do something to help the American people in an \nemergency and figure out some other way in the future to look at how to \nhandle other disasters. We try to prefund what we think will happen as \na result of disasters, but these are acts of God--that is what we learn \nin law school--these hurricanes and tornadoes and floods. Along the \nMississippi River, we have more than 3 million acres underwater. This \nis farmland. It is not just vacant land, it is farmland underwater. \nThese people need help, and the Federal Government can help them. So we \nneed to do that, and that is why we will have a vote, as soon as I can \narrange it next week, on funding FEMA so they can continue doing the \nwork that is so important for our country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5396-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later today both Houses of Congress \nwill welcome President Obama to speak about a very serious crisis we \nface as a nation, namely, an economic climate that is making it \nimpossible for millions of Americans to find the work they need to \nsupport themselves and their families.\n  In a two-party system such as ours, it shouldn't be surprising that \nthere would be two very different points of view about how to solve \nthis particular crisis. What is surprising is the President's apparent \ndetermination to apply the same government-driven policies that have \nalready been tried and failed. The definition of insanity, as Albert \nEinstein once famously put it, is to do the same thing over and over \nagain and to expect a different result. Frankly, I can't think of a \nbetter description of anyone who thinks the solution to this problem is \nanother stimulus. The first stimulus didn't do it. Why would another?\n  This is one question the White House and a number of Democrats \nclearly don't want to answer. That is why some of them are out there \ncoaching\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\npeople not to use the word ``stimulus'' when describing the President's \nplan. Others are accusing anybody who criticizes it of being \nunpatriotic or playing politics. Well, as I have said before, there is \na much simpler reason to oppose the President's economic policies that \nhas nothing whatsoever to do with politics: They simply don't work. \nYet, by all accounts, the President's so-called jobs plan is to try \nthose very same policies again and then accuse anyone who doesn't \nsupport them this time around of being political or overly partisan, of \nnot doing what is needed in this moment of crisis.\n  This isn't a jobs plan. It is a reelection plan. That is why \nRepublicans have continued to press for policies, policies that empower \njob creators, not Washington.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, nearly a third of the \nunemployed have been out of work for more than a year. The average \nlength of unemployment is now greater than 40 weeks, higher than it was \neven during the Great Depression. As we know, the longer you are out of \na job, the harder it is to find one. That means, for millions of \nAmericans, this crisis is getting harder every day. It is getting worse \nand worse.\n  We also know this: The economic policies this President has tried \nhave not alleviated the problem. In many ways, in fact, they have made \nthings worse. Gas prices are up. The national debt is up. Health \ninsurance premiums are up. Home values in most places continue to fall. \nAnd, 2\\1/2\\ years after the President's signature jobs bill was signed \ninto law, 1.7 million fewer Americans have jobs. So I would say \nAmericans have 1.7 million reasons to oppose another stimulus. That is \nwhy many of us have been calling on the President to propose something \nentirely different tonight--not because of politics but because the \nkind of policies he has proposed in the past haven't worked. The \nproblem here isn't politics. The problem is the policy. It is time the \nPresident start thinking less about how to describe his policies \ndifferently and more time thinking about devising new policies. And he \nmight start by working with Congress instead of writing in secret, \nwithout any consultation with Republicans, a plan that the White House \nis calling bipartisan.\n  With 14 million Americans out of work, job creation should be a no-\npolitics zone. Republicans stand ready to act on policies that get the \nprivate sector moving again. What we are reluctant to do, however, is \nto allow the President to put us deeper in debt to finance a collection \nof short-term fixes or shots in the arm that might move the needle \ntoday but which deny America's job creators the things they need to \nsolve this crisis--predictability, stability, fewer government burdens, \nand less redtape. Because while this crisis may have persisted for far \ntoo long and caused far too much hardship, one thing we do have right \nnow is the benefit of hindsight. We know what doesn't work.\n  So tonight the President should take a different approach. He should \nacknowledge the failures of an economic agenda that centers on \ngovernment and spending and debt, and work across the aisle on a plan \nthat puts people and businesses at the forefront of job creation.\n  If the American people are going to have control over their own \ndestiny, they need to have more control over their economy. That means \nshifting the center of gravity away from Washington and toward those \nwho create jobs. It means putting an end to the regulatory overreach \nthat is holding job creators back. It means being as bold about \nliberating job creators as the administration has been about shackling \nthem. It means reforming an outdated Tax Code and getting out of the \nbusiness of picking winners and losers. It means lowering the U.S. \ncorporate tax rate, which is currently the second highest in the world. \nAnd it means leveling the playing field with our competitors overseas \nby approving free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South \nKorea that have been languishing on the President's desk literally for \nyears.\n  Contrary to the President's claims, this economic approach isn't \naimed at pleasing any one party or constituency. It is aimed at giving \nback to the American people the tools they need to do the work \nWashington has not been able to do on its own, despite its best efforts \nover the past few years.\n  The President is free to blame his political adversaries, his \npredecessor, or even natural disasters for America's economic \nchallenges. Tonight, he may blame any future challenges on those who \nchoose not to rubberstamp his latest proposals. But it should be noted \nthat this is precisely what Democratic majorities did during the \nPresident's first 2 years in office, and look where that got us. But \nhere is the bottom line: By the President's own standards, his jobs \nagenda has been a failure, and we can't afford to make the same mistake \ntwice.\n  After the President's speech tonight calling for more stimulus \nspending, the Senate will vote on his request for an additional $500 \nbillion increase in the debt limit, so Senators will have an \nopportunity to vote for or against this type of approach right away.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5397-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tonight we welcome President Obama to \nthe Congress to deliver a jobs address. The President will be coming at \na time when we have had persistent unemployment at a greater rate than \nat any time since the Great Depression. No one should blame our \nPresident for problems with an economy that he inherited, but the \nPresident should take responsibility for making the economy worse.\n  Unemployment is up. The debt is up. Housing values are down. The \nmorning paper reports we may be on our way--at least the chances are \n50-50, the newspaper says this morning--to a double-dip recession. The \nnumber of unemployed Americans is up about 2 million since the \nPresident took office. The amount of Federal debt is up about $4 \ntrillion.\n  As I mentioned in discussing the proposals of the Senator from \nNebraska, the President's policies, rather than helping over the last \n2\\1/2\\ years, have thrown a big wet blanket over private sector job \ncreation. They have made it more expensive and more difficult for the \nprivate sector to create jobs for Americans.\n  Let me be specific about that. The President chose, 2 years ago, \nrather than to focus exclusively on jobs, to focus on health care. His \nproposal was to expand a health care delivery system that already cost \ntoo much, that was already too expensive. So we have new health care \ntaxes and mandates that make the economy worse.\n  Why do I say that? I met, for example, with the chief executive \nofficers of several of the nation's largest restaurant companies. They \nreminded me that restaurants and hospitality organizations in the \nUnited States are the largest employers, outside of government, and \nthat their employees are mostly young and mostly low income. One of the \nchief executives said because of the mandates of the health care law it \nwould take all of his profits from last year to pay the costs, when it \nis fully implemented, so he will not be\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\ninvesting in any new restaurants in the United States. Another said \nthey operate with 90 employees per store, but as a result of the \nmandates and taxes in the health care law, their goal will be to \noperate with 70 employees per store. One of the largest employers is \nsaying instead of having 90 employees per store, we are going to have \n70. That doesn't help create new jobs in the United States.\n  Let's take the debt. The President inherited the debt but he has made \nit worse. The economists who look at debt say we are heading toward a \nlevel that will cost us, in the United States, 1 million jobs every \nyear.\n  Undermining the right-to-work law--the President's appointees to the \nNational Labor Relations Board have told the Nation's largest \nmanufacturer of large airplanes that they cannot build a plant in South \nCarolina. It is the first new plant to build large airplanes in 40 \nyears in this country. The Boeing Company sells those airplanes \neverywhere in the world. It could build them anywhere in the world. We \nwant them to build them in the United States. Those kinds of actions by \nthe National Labor Relations Board make it worse.\n  Regulations that put a big wet blanket over job creation, such as the \none the Senator from Nebraska talks about, make it worse. The \nPresident's refusal to send trade agreements to Congress makes it \nworse. Let's be clear about this. Since the day the President took \noffice, he has had on his desk three trade agreements, already signed \nby both countries. They simply need approval by Congress--one with \nPanama, one with South Korea, one with Colombia. We are ready to \napprove them in a bipartisan way if he will send them here. What will \nthat mean in Tennessee? We make a lot of auto parts in Tennessee. We \ncan sell them to South Korea. At the present time, Europeans sell them \nto South Korea at a lower price because of the tariff situation, \nbecause the President has not sent the three trade agreements to \nCongress. So all these steps have made the economy worse. Of course, \nwith a bad economy home values have stayed down. That is making it \nworse, too.\n  So what can we do about this? What are the kinds of things the \nPresident could talk about tonight and that we could work on together \nto make it easier and cheaper to create private sector jobs? We could \nchange the tax structure in a permanent way, not short-term fixes but \nlong-term lowering of tax rates for everyone, closing loopholes, \ncreating a situation where our businesses are more competitive in the \nworld marketplace. That is one thing we could do.\n  We could stop the avalanche of regulations that is throwing the big \nwet blanket over job growth. The Senator from Nebraska suggested a \nfew--a moratorium on new regulations; avoiding guidance, as he \nsuggested, that circumvents the rules or regulations; stopping wacky \nideas such as regulating farm dust, as if everybody did not know that \nall farms create dust.\n  More exports--the President could send, today, the three trade \nagreements to Congress. We could ratify them and then crops grown in \nTennessee and Nebraska and every other State in this country, and auto \nparts, and medical devices, could be sold around the world. Our State \nalone has $23 billion and tens of thousands of jobs tied up in exports. \nThis could add to that.\n  In addition to that, we could agree on advanced research. The \nPresident's recommendations have been good on that. But we should agree \non that and move ahead with appropriations bills and a fiscal situation \nthat permits us to do the kind of advanced research we need to do to \ncreate jobs.\n  We need to fix No Child Left Behind. Better schools mean better jobs. \nWe need a long-term highway bill. We need roads and bridges in order to \nhave the kind of country we want. We need to find more American energy \nand use less. We should be able to agree on that.\n  There is an agenda, not of more spending, not of more taxes, not of \nmore regulation, but an agenda that would make it easier and cheaper to \ncreate private sector jobs and get the economy moving again.\n  In another time a President named Eisenhower said ``I should go to \nKorea'' and he was elected President. He went to Korea before he was \ninaugurated and then he said ``I shall focus my time on this single \nobjective until I see it all the way through to the end.'' The country \nfelt good about that, they had confidence in him, he did that, and the \nKorean war was ended.\n  President Obama chose, instead of focusing on jobs 2\\1/2\\ years ago \nin the same sort of Presidential way, to expand a health care delivery \nsystem that already was too expensive and in fact makes the problem \nworse. Tonight is an opportunity to make it better and we are ready to \njoin with him in doing that, especially if he were to recommend lower \ntax rates, fewer loopholes on a permanent basis, fewer regulations, and \nif he were to send the three trade agreements to us to ratify.\n  I wish to turn my attention to a different subject. September 11 is \nSunday. I listened carefully, as most of us in the Senate do, to words \nthat seem to resonate with my audiences. I have consistently found \nthere is one sentence that I usually cannot finish without the audience \ninterrupting me before breaking into applause, and it is this: ``It is \ntime to put the teaching of American history and civics back into its \nrightful place in our schools so our children can grow up learning what \nit means to be an American.'' The terrorists who attacked us on \nSeptember 11 were not just lashing out at buildings and people. They \nwere attacking who we are as Americans. Most Americans know this, and \nthat is why there has been a national hunger for leadership and \ndiscussion about our values. Parents know our children are not being \ntaught our common culture and our shared values.\n\n  National tests show that three-fourths of the Nation's 4th, 8th, and \n12th graders are not proficient in civics knowledge, and one-third \ndon't even have basic knowledge, making them civic illiterates. That is \nwhy I made making American history and civics the subject of my maiden \nspeech when I first came to the Senate in 2003, and by a vote of 90 to \n0 the Senate passed my bill to create summer residential academies for \noutstanding teachers of American history and civics. Every year I bring \nthem on the Senate floor, and those teachers from all over our country \nhave a moment to think about this Senate. They usually go find a desk \nof the Senator from Alaska, if they are an Alaskan teacher, or the \nSenator from Tennessee, or Daniel Webster's desk, or Jefferson Davis's \ndesk, and they stop and think about our country in a special way.\n  The purpose of those teachers is better teaching, and the purpose of \nthe academy is more learning of key events, key persons, key ideas, and \nkey documents that shape the institutions of the democratic heritage of \nthe United States.\n  If I were teaching about September 11, these are some of the issues I \nwould ask my students to consider. No. 1, is September 11 the worst \nthing that ever happened to the United States? Of course the answer is \nno, but I am surprised by the number of people who say yes. It saddens \nme to realize that those who make such statements were never properly \ntaught about American history. Many doubted that we would win the \nRevolutionary War. The British sacked Washington and burned the White \nHouse to the ground in the War of 1812. In the Civil War we lost more \nAmericans than in any other conflict, with brother fighting against \nbrother. The list goes on. Children should know why we made those \nsacrifices and fought for the values that make us exceptional.\n  The second question I would talk about is, What makes America \nexceptional? I began the first session of a course I taught at \nHarvard's Kennedy School of Government 10 or 11 years ago by making a \nlist of 100 ways America is exceptional, unique--not always better but \nunique. America's exceptionalism has been a source of fascination ever \nsince Tocqueville's trip across America in 1830 when he met Davy \nCrockett and Jim Bowie on the Mississippi River. His book, ``Democracy \nin America,'' is the best description of America's unique ideals in \naction. Another outstanding text is ``American Exceptionalism'' by \nSeymour Martin Lipset.\n  A third question I ask my students is, Why is it you cannot become \nJapanese or French, but you must become an American? If I were to \nimmigrate to Japan, I could not become Japanese. I\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nwould always be an American living in Japan. But if a Japanese citizen \ncame here, they could become an American, and we would welcome that \nperson with open arms. Why? It is because our identity is not based on \nethnicity but on a creed of ideas and values in which most of us \nbelieve.\n  The story Richard Hofstadter wrote:\n\n       It is our fate as a nation not to have ideologies, but to \n     be one.\n\n  To become American citizens immigrants must take a test demonstrating \ntheir knowledge of American history and civics.\n  Fourth, what are the principles that unite us as Americans? In \nThanksgiving remarks after the September 11 attacks, President George \nW. Bush praised our Nation's response to terror. ``I call it the \nAmerican character,'' he said.\n  Former Vice President Gore, in his speech after the attacks, said:\n\n       We should fight for the values that bind us together as a \n     country.\n\n  In my Harvard course that I mentioned, we put together a list of some \nof those values: liberty, e. pluribus unum, equal opportunity, \nindividualism, rule of law, free exercise of religion, separation of \nchurch and state, laissez-faire, and the belief in progress, the idea \nthat anyone can do anything. Anything is possible if we agree on those \nprinciples.\n  I would say to my students, Why is there so much division in American \npolitics? Just because we agree on the values doesn't mean we agree on \nhow to apply those values. Most of our politics, in fact, is about the \nhard work of applying those principles to our everyday lives. When we \ndo, we often conflict.\n  For example, when discussing President Bush's proposals to let the \nFederal Government fund faith-based charities, we know, in God we \ntrust--we have it here in the Senate--but we also know we don't trust \ngovernment with God. When considering whether the Federal Government \nshould pay for scholarships that middle- and low-income families might \nuse at any accredited school--public, private, or religious--some \nobject that the principle of equal opportunity can conflict with the \nprinciple of separation of church and state.\n  What does it mean to be an American? After September 11, I proposed \nan idea I call Pledge Plus Three. Why not start each school day with \nthe Pledge of Allegiance--as many schools still do--and then ask a \nteacher or a student to take 3 minutes to explain what it means to be \nan American. I would bet the best 3-minute statements of what it means \nto be an American would come from the newest Americans. At least that \nwas the case with my university students. The newest Americans \nappreciated this country the most and could talk about it the best.\n  Ask students to stand and raise their right hands and recite the oath \nof allegiance just as immigrants do when they become American citizens. \nThis is an oath that goes all the way back to the days of George \nWashington and Valley Forge. It reads like it was written in a tavern \nby a bunch of patriots in Williamsburg late one night. I recited this \nwith my right hand up during a speech I recently gave on my American \nhistory and civics bill. It is quite a weighty thing and startles the \naudience to say:\n\n       I absolutely renounce and abjure all allegiance and \n     fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \n     sovereignty [and agree to] bear arms on behalf of the United \n     States when required by the law.\n\n  The oath to become an American taken by George Washington and his men \nand now taken today in courthouses all across America is a solemn, \nweighty matter. Our history is a struggle to live up to the ideas that \nhave united us and that have defined us from the very beginning, the \nprinciples of what we call the American character. If that is what \nstudents are taught about September 11, they will not only become \nbetter informed, they will strengthen our country for generations to \ncome.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time is left on the majority \nside in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now approaching the 10th \nanniversary of 9/11. As with countless others who experienced all that \nhappened that day, recounting 9/11, assessing its implications on our \nNation is both a profound and deeply personal undertaking.\n  I will never forget the moments when I learned what happened. I was \nin the House gym. I was a Senator then and still went to the House gym. \nThere is a little TV on top of the lockers, and somebody pointed out--\none of our colleagues who was in the House with me from the other side \nof the aisle said: Look on the TV. It looks like a plane has crashed \ninto the World Trade Center.\n  We all gathered around and watched the TV and came to the conclusion \nthat it was probably a little turbo plane that had lost its way. We \nkept our eyes on the TV, and then, of course, we saw the second plane \nhit the second tower, and we knew it was not just an accident.\n  I quickly showered, dressed, rushed to get into my car, and as I was \ndriving quickly to my office, I saw another plane flying low over the \nPotomac, and I saw a big plume of smoke, which obviously was the plane \naimed at the Pentagon. I said to myself, ``World War III has started.''\n  I quickly called my wife, and our first concern was our daughter who \nwent to high school just a few blocks from the World Trade Center. We \ndidn't know what happened. The towers were on fire. We actually took \nout the almanac to see how high the trade center was to see whether it \ncould fall in the direction of her school and whether it would hit it. \nFor 5 hours, we couldn't find Jessica. They had successfully evacuated \nthe school, but because they shut down the elevators in the school, \nthey all had to walk down the stairs. She was on the ninth floor, and, \nbeing Jessica, she escorted an elderly teacher who couldn't get down \nvery quickly and lost her way from the group. Of course, praise God, we \nfound her.\n  That was just the beginning of the anguish. The next day, Senator \nClinton and I flew to New York. I will never forget that scene. I think \nof it just about every day. The smell of death was in the air. The \ntowers were still burning. People were rushing to the towers--\nfirefighters, police officers, construction workers--to see if they \ncould find the missing. The most poignant scene I think of all the time \nis literally hundreds of people, average folks of every background, \nholding up little signs--``Have you seen my daughter Sally?'' with a \npicture, ``Have you seen my husband Bill?''--because at that point we \ndidn't know who was lost and who was not. It was a very rough time, and \nwe think of it every day.\n  We know what happened, and it is something that will remain in our \nminds for the rest of our lives but, of course, not close to those who \nlost loved ones either during the horrible conflagration or in these \nlater years. Now is the time for the 10th anniversary, so it is a good \ntime to take stock of the effect of the trauma and what it means, both \nlocally and nationally.\n  Obviously, every one of us in America was scared, shocked, \ntraumatized, horrified, angry, and heartbroken. At first, we didn't \nknow what happened. Then, as we learned who had attacked us and why, we \nhad to confront a crisis for which we didn't feel prepared. It was an \nexperience we as New Yorkers and Americans were not used to at all. We \nfelt so vulnerable. Were we now going to be the subject of attack after \nattack from stateless, nihilistic enemies we poorly understood and were \neven more poorly prepared to fight? There was this doctrine of \nasymmetrical power: Small groups living in caves were empowered by \ntechnology to do damage to us--horrible damage--that we couldn't stop. \nCould it be that our vast military was a poor match for a small group \nof technologically savvy extremists bent on mass murder and mayhem, \ndirected from half a world away? It seemed more likely--certain even--\nthat attack after attack would\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\ncome our way from a small group willing to use any tactic, from a box \ncutter and a loaded plane to weapons of mass destruction, focused \nsolely on massive loss of life and damage to the economy, not to \nmention to our collective psyche and confidence as a people.\n  It certainly was a hammer blow to the great city in which I live and \nhave lived my whole life. It raised the question of its future. People \neverywhere were writing the obituaries on downtown Manhattan. People \nand businesses were leaving or seriously contemplating leaving. Being \ndiffuse was the answer, not concentrated. Some wrote that maybe now \ndensely populated, diverse cities such as New York would no longer have \na future. A permanent exodus seemed imminent. Downtown New York would \nbecome a ghost town. Who would work here again? Who would live here? \nWho would dine or see a show here? What global firm would locate \nthousands of jobs here? It was not an exaggeration to say that New \nYork's days as the leading city on the global stage seemed as though \nthey could be over.\n  But our response was immediate, proactive, unified, and successful. \nIn the days, weeks, and first months after 9/11, America as a society \nand, by extension, its political system came together and behaved in a \nremarkable way. New Yorkers, as always, did the same. There immediately \ndeveloped a sense of shared sacrifice and common purpose that gave rise \nto a torrent of actions in the private and public spheres.\n  Amongst the American people, there was an unprecedented outpouring of \nvoluntary help--a tradition deeply rooted in our American tradition of \ncommunity service and voluntary action noted by observers as far back \nas Alexis de Tocqueville, who, in the earliest days of our Republic, \nobserved:\n\n       Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly \n     unite. Not only do they have commercial and industrial \n     associations in which all take part, but they also have a \n     thousand other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very \n     general and very particular, immense and very small.\n\n  Fueled by this reaction, our government went to work immediately, at \nall levels, collaborating on the Federal, State, and local levels.\n  In Washington, DC, the policy response to the situation at hand was \nremarkable for its productivity, its extraordinary speed, and, overall, \nthe positive impacts it made both in the short term and long term. All \nof what we did was far from perfect, but when our government is able to \nbe this nimble, responsive, and effective, it is worth asking what the \nelements of its success were so that we might think about how we can \napply them to future situations such as the one we are in now.\n  If I were to characterize our policy actions post-9/11, I would say \nthey were nonideological, practical, partisanship was subdued; the \nactions were collaborative, not vituperative; they were balanced and \nfair; they were bold and decisive; and they were both short- and long-\nterm focused. Let's take a quick look at each.\n  We were nonideological. Post-9/11, we were driven primarily by facts, \nnot primarily by ideology. We asked, ``What does the situation require \nand how might we best execute that'' not, ``How can I exploit this \nsituation to further my world view or political agenda or pecuniary \nself-interest?'' We didn't have a debate about the nature of government \nand whether or how we ought to support disaster victims or the need for \nhousing or to get small businesses and not-for-profits back open, nor \ndid we wring our hands about the appropriateness of rebuilding \ninfrastructure or responding to the lack of insurance available for \ndevelopers; rather, we attacked each problem as it became apparent. We \nprofessionally engaged, we compromised, and we hammered out a plan to \naddress each problem as it arose. And we did it fast.\n  We were tempered in our partisanship. Partisanship is never absent \nfrom the public stage, but the degree to which it is the dominant \nelement in the many influences on public policy waxes and wanes. In the \ndays after 9/11, we were able to keep partisanship on a short leash.\n  I remember being in the Oval Office the day after I visited New York \nwith Senator Clinton, and we told President Bush of the damage in New \nYork. I asked the President: We need $20 billion in New York; we need a \npledge immediately. Without even thinking, the President said yes. New \nYork is a blue State, one that didn't support President Bush. He didn't \nstop and weigh and calculate politically; he said yes, and, to his \ncredit, he stuck by that promise in the years to come.\n  We were collaborative, not vituperative, unlike recent tragedies, \nsuch as the Fort Hood shooting, where some sought to heap blame on \nPresident Obama, or the Gabby Giffords shooting, where premature blame \nwas mistakenly directed at the rightwing for spurring the attacker \nwhich, in turn, begat a round of unseemly recriminations. Unlike those \nexamples, following 9/11, people refrained from using the powerful and \nexploitable event as an opportunity to blame President Bush or \nPresident Clinton for letting an attack happen.\n  Rather than looking back and hanging an iron collar of blame around \nthe neck of a President to score political points, people from both \nparties were willing to look forward, to plan forward, and to act \nforward. This, in turn, helped create a climate where collaboration was \npossible. And, to his credit, the President, as I mentioned, did not \nthink about the electoral map or political implications of supporting \nNew York.\n  We were bold and decisive. We did not shrink from the big thing or \nfail to act on multiple levels at once. On one front, we crafted the \n$20 billion aid package to rebuild New York. On another, we crafted the \nPATRIOT Act. On still another, the military and intelligence \ncommunities planned the invasion of Afghanistan to root out al-Qaida. \nThese were big moves, with massive implications for life, the national \ncoffers, and the structure of our society. None of the moves was \nperfect, but rather than, for example, derail the $20 billion aid \npackage to New York because you might think we do not have the money to \nspend or blocking the PATRIOT Act because you believe it does not do \nenough to produce civil liberties, in the period after 9/11, those with \nobjections made a good-faith effort to have their points included in \nnascent legislation, and had some real success, such as building in \npunishments against those who leak information obtained from wiretaps \nor preventing information from unconstitutional searches from abroad \nfrom being used in a legal proceeding.\n  But, in the end, on the PATRIOT Act, for example, Democrats--who were \nin the minority and could have played the role of blocker--let it pass \nwith a pledge to improve it over time, rather than scuttling it \nentirely, because while there were parts of it that some disagreed with \nstrongly, there were parts that were absolutely necessary.\n  Compare this to our current stalemate on fiscal policy and the \neconomy, where time after time the ``my way or the highway'' view seems \nto prevail, leading to inaction, gridlock, and failure to do what the \neconomy truly needs.\n  We were balanced and fair. On the one hand, we were pragmatic. We \nmade the airlines and owners of the World Trade Center and other \npotential targets immune from potentially bankrupting lawsuits. It was \nnot an easy decision. It was strenuously opposed by some in the trial \nbar and other Democratic allies, but it was a reasonable one.\n  On the other hand, we were just. We created, with billions in \nfinancing, the Victims Compensation Fund, the VCF, so no victim or \ntheir loved one would be denied access to justice. It proved to be a \nwin-win. The crippled airline industry, so critical to our economy, was \nable to get back up and running, and every injured person or loved one \nof those lost had an expedited and fair system to pursue a claim of \nloss.\n  This harkened back to the kind of grand bargains on big issues that \nare the very foundation of effective government in the system of \ndiffused power that we were bequeathed by our Founders, the kind of \nbargains the current state of politics make so elusive today.\n  We were short- and long-term focused. We were concerned with both \nshort-term support, via FEMA aid to\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\nhomeowners, renters, and small businesses, and with long-term \ncompetitiveness. We invested heavily in transportation infrastructure \nto move millions in and out of the central business districts, even \nwhile we supported the arts, community groups, parks, nonprofits, and \nmore to create the vibrant and growing 24/7 downtown we have today--a \nhub that is at the very center of the Nation's economy and culture--far \nfrom the horrible view we had that the downtown would become a ghost \ntown shortly after 9/11.\n  In short, the response to 9/11 by all Americans, by both parties, is \na roadmap for how our political system ought to function but is not now \nfunctioning.\n  I am not a Pollyanna. I understand the inherent nature of conflict in \nthe political realm, and I often partake in it. I also know the trauma \nof 9/11 was uncommon, and made possible uncommon action. Then we had \nboth the shocking murder of thousands of innocent victims, the heroism \nof the responders to inspire us, and the advantage of a common enemy to \nunite us.\n  But what we were able to achieve then in terms of common purpose and \neffective collective action provides us with a model for action that we \nin Washington must strive to emulate and--even if just in part, even if \njust sporadically--to recreate. We should look back to what happened \nduring 9/11 and apply it to our own time and see how we can make \nourselves better and break the kind of gridlock, partisanship, finger \npointing that seems to dominate our politics today, only 10 years \nlater.\n  As we survey the current state of our national psyche and the ability \nof our political system to debate and then implement effective policy \nactions for the challenges that confront us, it is painfully clear \nthat, in a relative blink of the eye, the ability of our political \nsystem to muster the will to take necessary actions for the common good \nhas degenerated to a place that is much too far away from our actions \nafter 9/11.\n  The question that haunts me--and should haunt all of us--is this: If, \nGod forbid, another 9/11-like attack were to happen tomorrow, would our \nnational political system respond with the same unity, \nnonrecrimination, common purpose, and effective policy action in the \nway it did just 10 years ago or are our politics now so petty, \nfanatically ideological, polarized, and partisan that we would instead \ndescend into blame and brinksmanship and direct our fire inward and \nfail to muster the collective will to act in the interests of the \nAmerican people?\n  As I ponder it, I have every confidence that the first responders--\ncops, firefighters, and others--would do now as they did then. Their \nawe-inspiring selflessness and bravery continues to be a humbling \nwonder and an inspiration.\n  I know our building trades workers would again drop everything and \nshow up, put their lives on the line, and throw their backs into the \ntask at hand without waiting to be asked.\n  I am certain that the American people would come together and find \ncountless ways to donate their time, their energy, their ideas, and \ntheir compassion to the cause at hand.\n  But what of our political system?\n  I am an optimist, so I want to believe the answer is yes. But I am \nalso a realist, and a very engaged player on the Washington scene, who \nhas just been through the debt ceiling brinksmanship, amongst other \nrecent battles, and that realistic part of me is not so sure the answer \nis yes.\n  Today, would we still pass a bipartisan $20 billion aid package to \nthe afflicted city or would we say that is not my region or would we \nfail to take the long view and say we cannot afford to spend lavish \nsums of money like that; we have to spend within our means.\n  Would we be capable of coming together to pass a grand bargain such \nas the one that immunized the airlines from lawsuits and created the \nVictims Compensation Fund or instead would we embrace the politics of \nasphyxiation and find every excuse to block getting to ``yes'' in order \nto prevent our political opponents from appearing to achieve something \npositive.\n  Would all parties refrain from using the occasion to place blame on \nthe President and on each other to gain relative political advantage or \nwould we hear, first, the leaked whispers, then the chatter, then the \nrecriminations that build to the ugly echo chamber of vituperation that \nhas been the sad hallmark of more recent tragedies and national \nsecurity events.\n  This political accord following 9/11 had its limits, especially in \nthe aftermath of our invasion of Iraq, when one key rationale for going \nto war was discredited. But even for those who came to view our \ninvolvement as distracting and wrong--distracting from the more \nimportant political objective of rooting out al-Qaida and wrong because \nit could not work; and there was a great loss of life and treasure--\neven for those of us who came to abhor the war in Iraq, it would have \nbeen unthinkable then to root against our country's eventual success in \nIraq. Compare that to now, when it is fathomable that some would rather \nAmerica not recover its economic strength and prowess just yet.\n  When we think back to where we were then and to how we reacted and \ncompare it to challenges we confront today, it is clear that while the \nsacrifice of the victims and the heroism of the responders were \neternal, our ability to sustain both the common purpose and effective \npolitical action they inspired has proved all too ephemeral.\n  I will not recount details of our current dysfunction, but suffice it \nto say our politics are paralyzed. Domestically, we are frozen in an \nillogical arm-wrestling match between the need to get people back to \nwork and jump-start the economy and the drive to rein in the deficit. \nGlobally, we are confronted by an uncertain place in an increasingly \ncompetitive world.\n  Finally, our challenges are psychological and emotional and \naspirational, much as they were in the darkest hours and days after 9/\n11, and these doubts whisper to us the following questions: Are we no \nlonger able to tackle the big issues? Are we a nation in decline?\n  I am not saying the challenges we face today are an exact parallel \nfor what we faced then. It is obvious they are not. Nor are all the \nconditions the same. But today's challenges--from the economic to the \nglobal to the social--are not intractable, and if any one of our \ncurrent dilemmas were subject to the same policy environment we had \npost-9/11, I have no doubt we would make substantial progress in \ntackling it.\n  Confronted with a more profound, complex, and existential challenge \non 9/11, we rose to the occasion. We confronted the problem before us \nwith uniquely American doggedness, pragmatism, creativity, \ncollaboration, and optimism--optimism--because that is what Americans \ndo and that is who we are. We believe that no matter how bad it gets--\nwhether hunkered down for the winter in Valley Forge after a series of \nhumiliating military defeats or arriving, like Lincoln, in Washington, \nDC, in 1860 to find half our Nation and next-door neighbor States are \nattempting to destroy our Union or FDR confronting, in 1932, 25-percent \nunemployment and an unprecedented deflationary spiral in a modern \nindustrial-financial economy or believing that, indeed, all people are \ncreated equal, even while you were rudely ushered to the back of the \nbus or facing down the totalitarian threats of fascism and communism, \nand believing that, yes, we will tear that wall down--Americans believe \nin a brighter tomorrow. We believe in our ability as a people, \nindividually and collectively, both through private action and via our \nelected representatives who make our Nation's policy, to get things \ndone to make that brighter tomorrow a reality.\n  We have, as a nation, faced bigger challenges. We have answered the \ncall, and 9/11 was one shining example. We are in better shape now on \nmany fronts as a result of the actions we took in the immediate \naftermath of 9/11, and those are well known: rebuilding New York City, \ncompensating families, flushing al-Qaida from its base in Afghanistan, \nleading to the fact that Osama bin Laden is dead.\n  In the Middle East it is not, as we feared after 9/11, the hateful, \nmyopic, reactive philosophy of bin Laden that took hold and changed \ntheir societies. Rather, it is imbued with some decent measure of hope \nand optimism and courage that created a cascading wave of political, \nsocial, and economic aspiration that has transformed this region from \nTunisia and Libya to Egypt and Syria, added and abetted by \nentrepreneurial innovations pioneered here in\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nAmerica. This transformation is not without enormous dangers and \nchallenges, but consider how much worse it would have been if a pro-bin \nLaden movement were fueling this transformation.\n\n  It is plain we need more of what we had post-9/11 now. I am not \nnaive. I know it cannot be conjured up or wished into existence. But if \nwe are optimistic, if we are inspired by the Americans who died here, \nif we truly understand our shared history and the sacred place \ncompromise and rationality hold at the very center of the formation of \nour Nation and the structure of our Constitution, then we can again \ntake up the mantle of shared sacrifice and common purpose that we wore \nafter 9/11 and apply some of those behaviors to the problems we now \nconfront.\n  The reality of our current political climate is that both sides are \noff in their corners; the common enemy is faded. Some see Wall Street \nas the enemy many others see Washington, DC, as the enemy and to still \nothers any and all government is the enemy.\n  I believe the greatest problem we face is the belief that we can no \nlonger confront and solve the problems and challenges that confront us; \nthe fear that our best days may be behind us; that, for the first time \nin history, we fear things will not be as good for our kids as they are \nfor us. It is a creeping pessimism that cuts against the can-do and \nwill-do American spirit. And, along with the divisiveness in our \npolitics, it is harming our ability to create the great works our \nforbears accomplished: building the Empire State building in the teeth \nof the Great Depression, constructing the Interstate Highway System and \nthe Hoover Dam, the Erie Canal, and so much more.\n  While governmental action is not the whole answer to all that faces \nus, it is equally true that we cannot confront the multiple and complex \nchallenges we now face with no government or a defanged government or a \ndysfunctional government.\n  As we approach the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the focus on what \nhappened that day intensifies--what we lost, who we lost, and how we \nreacted--it becomes acutely clear that we need to confront our current \nchallenges imbued with the spirit of 9/11 and determine to make our \ngovernment and our politics worthy of the sacrifice and loss we \nsuffered that day.\n  To return to de Tocqueville, he also remarked that:\n\n       The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened \n     than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair \n     her faults.\n\n  So, like the ironworkers and operating engineers and trade workers \nwho miraculously appeared at the pile hours after the towers came down \nwith blowtorches and hard hats in hand, let's put on our gloves, pick \nup our hammers and get to work fixing what ails the body politic. It is \nthe least we can do to honor those we lost.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 600\n\n (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the calculation of the \n        60-day period for application of patent term extension)\n\n       On page 149, line 20, strike all through page 150, line 16.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered is a \nvery important amendment. It is one that I believe is important to the \nintegrity of the U.S. legal system and to the integrity of the Senate. \nIt is a matter that I have been wrestling with and objecting to for \nover a decade. I thought the matter had been settled, frankly, but it \nhas not because it has been driven by one of the most ferocious \nlobbying efforts the Congress maybe has seen.\n  The House patent bill as originally passed out of committee and taken \nto the floor of the House did not include a bailout for Medco, the \nWilmerHale law firm, or the insurance carrier for that firm, all of \nwhom were in financial jeopardy as a result of a failure to file a \npatent appeal timely.\n  I have practiced law hard in my life. I have been in court many \ntimes. I spent 12 years as a U.S. Attorney and tried cases. I am well \naware of how the system works. The way the system works in America, you \nfile lawsuits and you are entitled to your day in court. But if you do \nnot file your lawsuit in time, within the statute of limitations, you \nare out.\n  When a defendant raises a legal point of order--a motion to dismiss--\nbased on the failure of the complaining party to file their lawsuit \ntimely, they are out. That happens every day to poor people, widow \nladies. And it does not make any difference what your excuse is, why \nyou think you have a good lawsuit, why you had this idea or that idea. \nEveryone is required to meet the same deadlines.\n  In Alabama they had a situation in which a lady asked a probate judge \nwhen she had to file her appeal by, and the judge said: You can file it \non Monday. As it turned out, Monday was too late. They went to the \nAlabama Supreme Court, and who ruled: The probate judge--who does not \nhave to be a lawyer--does not have the power to amend the statute of \nlimitations. Sorry, lady. You are out.\n  Nobody filed a bill in the Congress to give her relief, or the \nthousands of others like her every day. So Medco and WilmerHale seeking \nthis kind of relief is a big deal. To whom much has been given, much is \nrequired. This is a big-time law firm, one of the biggest law firms in \nAmerica. Medco is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the \ncountry. And presumably the law firm has insurance that they pay to \ninsure them if they make an error. So it appears that they are not \nwilling to accept the court's ruling.\n  One time an individual was asking me: Oh, Jeff, you let this go. Give \nin and let this go. I sort of as a joke said to the individual: Well, \nif WilmerHale will agree not to raise the statute of limitations \nagainst anybody who sues their clients if they file a lawsuit late, \nmaybe I will reconsider. He thought I was serious. Of course WilmerHale \nis not going to do that. If some poor person files a lawsuit against \nsomeone they are representing, and they file it one hour late, \nWilmerHale will file a motion to dismiss it. And they will not ask why \nthey filed it late. This is law. It has to be objective. It has to be \nfair.\n  You are not entitled to waltz into the U.S. Congress--well \nconnected--and start lobbying for special relief.\n  There is nothing more complicated about that than this. So a couple \nof things have been raised. Well, they suggest, we should not amend the \nHouse patent bill, and that if we do, it somehow will kill the \nlegislation. That is not so. Chairman Leahy has said he supports the \namendment, but he doesn't want to vote for it because it would keep the \nbill from being passed somehow.\n  It would not keep it from being passed. Indeed, the bill that was\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\nbrought to the House floor didn't have this language in it. The first \nvote rejected the attempt to put this language in it. It failed. For \nsome reason, in some way, a second vote was held, and it was passed by \na few votes. So they are not going to reject the legislation if we were \nto amend it.\n  What kind of system are we now involved in in the Senate if we can't \nundo an amendment? What kind of argument is it to say: Jeff, I agree \nwith your amendment, and I agree it is right that they should not get \nthis special relief, but I can't vote for it because it might cause a \nproblem? It will not cause a problem. The bill will pass. It should \nnever have been put in there in the first place.\n  Another point of great significance is the fact that this issue is on \nappeal. The law firm asserted they thought--and it is a bit unusual--\nthat because it came in late Friday they had until Monday. We can count \nthe days to Monday--the 60 days or whatever they had to file the \nanswer. I don't know if that is good law, but they won. The district \ncourt has ruled for them. It is on appeal now to the court of appeals.\n  This Congress has no business interfering in a lawsuit that is \nongoing and is before an appeals court. If they are so confident their \ndistrict court ruling is correct, why are they continuing to push for \nthis special relief bill, when the court of appeals will soon, within a \nmatter of months, rule?\n  Another point: We have in the Congress a procedure to deal with \nspecial relief. If this relief is necessary at all, it should go \nthrough as a special relief bill. I can tell you one reason it is not \ngoing there now: you can't ask for special relief while the matter is \nstill in litigation, it is still on appeal. Special relief also has \nprocedures that one has to go through and justify in an objective way, \nwhich I believe would be very healthy in this situation.\n  For a decade, virtually--I think it has been 10 years--I have been \nobjecting to this amendment. Now we are here, I thought it was out, and \nall of a sudden it is slipped in by a second vote in the House, and we \nare told we just can't make an amendment to the bill. Why? The Senate \nset up the legislation to be brought forward, and we can offer \namendments and people can vote for them or not.\n  This matter has gotten a lot of attention. The Wall Street Journal \nand the New York Times both wrote about it in editorials today. This is \nwhat the New York Times said today about it:\n\n       But critics who have labeled the provision ``The Dog Ate My \n     Homework Act'' say it is really a special fix for one drug \n     manufacturer, the Medicines Company, and its powerful law \n     firm, WilmerHale. The company and its law firm, with hundreds \n     of millions of dollars in drug sales at stake, lobbied \n     Congress heavily for several years to get the patent laws \n     changed.\n\n  That is what the Wall Street Journal said in their editorial. The \nWall Street Journal understands business reality and litigation \nreality. They are a critic of the legal system at times and a supporter \nat times. I think they take a principled position in this instance. The \nWall Street Journal editorial stated:\n\n       We take no pleasure in seeing the Medicine Company and \n     WilmerHale suffer for their mistakes, but they are run by \n     highly paid professionals who know the rules and know that \n     consistency of enforcement is critical to their businesses. \n     Asking Congress to break the rules as a special favor \n     corrupts the law.\n\n  I think that is exactly right. It is exactly right. Businesses, when \nthey are sued by somebody, use the statute of limitations every day. \nThis law firm makes hundreds of millions of dollars in income a year. \nTheir partners average over $1 million a year, according to the New \nYork Times. That is pretty good. They ought to be able to pay a decent \nmalpractice insurance premium. The New York Times said WilmerHale \nreported revenues of $962 million in 2010, with a profit of $1.33 \nmillion per partner.\n  Average people have to suffer when they miss the statute of \nlimitations. Poor people suffer when they miss the statute of \nlimitations. But we are undertaking, at great expense to the taxpayers, \nto move a special interest piece of legislation that I don't believe \ncan be justified as a matter of principle. I agree with the Wall Street \nJournal that the adoption of it corrupts the system. We ought not be a \npart of that.\n  I love the American legal system. It is a great system, I know. I \nhave seen judges time and time again enter rulings based on law and \nfact even if they didn't like it. That is the genius and reliability \nand integrity of the American legal system. I do not believe we can \njustify, while this matter is still in litigation, passing a special \nact to give a wealthy law firm, an insurance company, and a health care \ncompany special relief. I just don't believe we should do that. I \noppose it, and I hope my colleagues will join us.\n  I think we have a real chance to turn this back. Our Congress and our \nSenate will be better for it; we really will. The Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste have taken an interest in this matter for some time. \nThey said:\n\n       Congress has no right to rescue a company from its own \n     mistakes.\n\n  Companies have a right to assert the law. Companies have a right to \nassert the law against individuals. But when the time comes for the \nhammer to fall on them for their mistake, they want Congress to pass a \nspecial relief bill. I don't think it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, let's boil it down to several things. First, if the \ncompany is right and the law firm is right that they did not miss the \nstatute of limitations, I am confident the court of appeals will rule \nin their favor, and it will not be necessary for this Senate to act. If \nthey do not prevail in the court of appeals and don't win their \nargument, then there is a provision for private relief in the Congress, \nand they ought to pursue that. There are special procedures. The \nlitigation will be over, and they can bring that action at that time.\n  That is the basic position we ought to be in. A bill that comes out \nof the Judiciary Committee ought to be sensitive to the legal system, \nto the importance of ensuring that the poor are treated as well as the \nrich. The oath judges take is to do equal justice to the poor and the \nrich.\n  How many other people in this country are getting special attention \ntoday on the floor of the Senate? How many? I truly believe this is not \ngood policy. I have had to spend far more hours fighting this than I \nhave ever wanted to when I decided 10 years ago that this was not a \ngood way to go forward. Many battle this issue, and I hope and trust \nthat the Members of the Senate who will be voting on this will allow it \nto follow the legitimate process. Let the litigation work its way \nthrough the system.\n  If they do not prevail in the litigation, let a private relief bill \nbe sought and debated openly and publicly to see if it is justified. \nThat would be the right way to do it--not slipping through this \namendment and then not voting to remove it on the basis that we should \nnot be amending a bill before us. We have every right to amend the \nbill, and we should amend the bill. I know Senator Grassley, years ago, \nwas on my side. I think it was just the two of us who took this \nposition.\n  I guess I have more than expressed my opinion. I thank the chairman \nfor his leadership. I thank him and Senator Grassley for their great \nwork on this important patent bill. I support that bill. I believe they \nhave moved it forward in a fair way.\n  The chairman did not put this language into the bill; it was put in \nover in the House. I know he would like to see the bill go forward \nwithout amendments. I urge him to think it through and see if he cannot \nbe willing to support this amendment. I am confident it will not block \nfinal passage of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak later about the comments made \nby the distinguished Senator from Alabama. He has been very helpful in \ngetting this patent bill through. He is correct that this amendment he \nspeaks to is one added in the other body, not by us. We purposely \ndidn't have it in our bill. I know Senator Grassley will follow my \nremarks.\n  There is no question in my mind that if the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Alabama were accepted, it in effect will kill the bill. \nIrrespective of the merits, it can come up on another piece of \nlegislation or as freestanding legislation. That is fine. But on this \nbill, after 6 years of effort to get this far, this bill would die \nbecause the other body will not take it up again.\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\n                            Hurricane Irene\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will use my time to note some of the \nthings happening in my own very special State of Vermont, the State in \nwhich I was born.\n  As Vermonters come together and continue to grapple with the \naftermath of storm damage from Irene, I wish to focus today on the \nagriculture disaster that has hit us in Vermont and report to the \nSenate and our fellow citizens across the Nation about how the raging \nfloodwaters wreaked havoc on our farming lands and infrastructure in \nVermont.\n  It was 12 days ago now that this enormous, slow-moving storm hit \nVermont and turned our calm, scenic brooks and creeks into raging \ngushers. In addition to our roads and historic covered bridges that \nwere destroyed or carried away, we had barns, farmhouses, crops, parts \nof fields, and livestock washed away in the rising floodwaters. I \nrecall the comments of one farmer who watched his herd of cows wash \ndown the river, knowing they were going to die in the floodwaters.\n  Now the cameras have begun to turn away, but the cleanup and urgent \nrepairs are underway. For major parts of Vermont's economy, the worst \neffects of this storm are yet to come. For our dairy farmers, who are \nthe bedrock of our economy and keystones of our communities, the toll \nof this disaster has been heavy and the crises has lasted longer as \nthey have struggled to take care of their animals while the floodwaters \nrecede.\n  This is a photograph of East Pittsford, VT, taken by Lars Gange just \nover a week ago. The water we see is never there. It is there now. Look \nat this farm's fields, they are destroyed. Look at homes damaged and \nthink what that water has done.\n  As I went around the state with our Governor and Vermont National \nGuard General Dubie the first couple of days after the storm hit, we \nwent to these places by helicopter and I cannot tell you how much it \ntore at my heart to see the state, the birthplace to me, my parents, \nand grandparents. To see roads torn up, bridges that were there when my \nparents were children, washed away. Historic covered bridges, mills, \nbarns, businesses just gone and what it has done to our farmers, it is \nhard, I cannot overstate it.\n  Our farmers have barns that are completely gone, leaving no shelter \nfor animals. They are left struggling to get water for their animals, \nto rebuild fencing, to clean up debris from flooded fields and barns, \nand then to get milk trucks to the dairy farms. Remember, these cows \nhave to be milked every single day. We also have farmers who do not \nhave any feed or hay for their animals because it all washed away. As \none farmer told me, the cows need to be milked two or three times every \nday, come hell or high water. This farmer thought he had been hit with \nboth, hell and high water.\n  While reports are still coming in from the farms that were affected, \nthe list of damages and the need for critical supplies, such as feed, \ngenerators, fuel, and temporary fencing is on the rise. As we survey \nthe farm fields and communities, we know it will be difficult to \ncalculate the economic impacts of this violent storm on our agriculture \nindustry in Vermont.\n  Many of our farmers were caught by surprise as the unprecedented, \nrapidly rising floodwaters inundated their crops, and many have had to \ndeal with the deeply emotional experience of losing animals to the \nfast-moving floodwaters. We have farms where whole fields were washed \naway and their fertile topsoil sent rushing down river. The timing \ncould not have been worse. Corn, which is a crucial winter feed for \ndairy cows, was just ready for harvest, but now our best corn is in the \nriver bottoms and is ruined. Other farms had just prepared their ground \nto sow winter cover crops and winter greens; they lost significant \namounts of topsoil.\n  River banks gave way, and we saw wide field buffers disappear \novernight, leaving the crops literally hanging on ledges above rivers, \nas at the Kingsbury farm in Warren, VT. Vegetable farming is Vermont's \nfastest growing agricultural sector, and, of course, this is harvest \nseason. Our farmers were not able to pick these crops, this storm \npicked many fields clean.\n  Many Vermonters have highly productive gardens that they have put up \nfor their families to get through the winter by canning and freezing. \nThose too have been washed away or are considered dangerous for human \nconsumption because of the contaminated floodwaters. Vermont farmers \nhave a challenging and precarious future ahead of them as they look to \nrebuild and plan for next year's crops, knowing that in our State it \ncan be snowing in 1\\1/2\\ or 2 months.\n  I have been heartened, however, by the many stories I have heard from \ncommunities where people are coming together to help one another. For \ninstance, at the Intervale Community Farm on the Winooski River, \nvolunteers came out to harvest the remaining dry fields before the \nproduce was hit by still rising floodwaters.\n  When the rumors spread that Beth and Bob Kennett at Liberty Hill Farm \nin Rochester had no power and needed help milking--well, people just \nstarted showing up. By foot, on bike, all ready to lend a hand to help \nmilk the cows. Fortunately for them and for the poor cows, the Vermont \nDepartment of Agriculture had managed to help get them fuel and the \nKennetts were milking again, so asked the volunteer farm hands to go \ndown the road, help somebody else and they did.\n  Coping with damage and destruction on this scale is beyond the means \nand capability of a small State such as ours, and Federal help with the \nrebuilding effort will be essential to Vermont, as it will be to other \nStates coping with the same disaster. I worry the support they need to \nrebuild may not be there, as it has been in past disasters, when we \nhave rebuilt after hurricanes, floods, fires and earthquakes to get \nAmericans back in their homes, something Vermonters have supported even \nthough in these past disasters Vermont was not touched.\n  So I look forward to working with the Appropriations Committee and \nwith all Senators to ensure that FEMA, USDA and all our Federal \nagencies have the resources they need to help all our citizens at this \ntime of disaster, in Vermont and in all our states. Unfortunately, \nprograms such as the Emergency Conservation Program and the Emergency \nWatershed Protect Program have been oversubscribed this year, and USDA \nhas only limited funds remaining. We also face the grim fact that few \nof our farms had bought crop insurance and so may not be covered by \nUSDA's current SURE Disaster Program.\n  But those are the things I am working on to find ways to help our \nfarmers and to move forward to help in the commitment to our fellow \nAmericans. For a decade, we have spent billions every single week on \nwars and projects in far-away lands. This is a time to start paying \nmore attention to our needs here at home and to the urgent needs of our \nfellow citizens.\n  I see my friend from Iowa on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 600\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to rebut the points Senator \nSessions made, and I do acknowledge, as he said on the floor, that 2 or \nmore years ago I was on the same page he is on this issue. What has \nintervened, in the meantime, that causes me to differ from the position \nSenator Sessions is taking? It is a district court case giving justice \nto a company--as one client--that was denied that sort of justice \nbecause bureaucrats were acting in an arbitrary and capricious way.\n  Senator Sessions makes the point you get equal justice under the law \nfrom the judicial branch of government and that Congress should not try \nto override that sort of situation. Congress isn't overriding anything \nwith the language in the House bill that he wants to strike because \nthat interest was satisfied by a judge's decision; saying that a \nparticular entity was denied equal justice under the law because a \nbureaucrat, making a decision on just exactly what counts as 60 days, \nwas acting in an arbitrary and capricious way. So this language in the \nHouse bill has nothing to do with helping a special interest. That \nspecial interest was satisfied by a judge who said an entity was denied \nequal justice under the law because a bureaucrat was acting in an \narbitrary and capricious manner.\n  This amendment is not about a special interest. This amendment is \nabout\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\nuniformity of law throughout the country because it is wrong--as the \njudge says--for a bureaucracy to have one sort of definition of when 60 \ndays begins--whether it is after business hours, if something goes out, \nor, if something comes in, it includes the day it comes in. So we are \ntalking about how we count 60 days, and it is about making sure there \nis a uniform standard for that based upon law passed by Congress and \nnot upon one judge's decision that applies to one specific case.\n  I would say, since this case has been decided, there are at least \nthree other entities that have made application to the Patent Office to \nmake sure they would get equal justice under the law in the same way \nthe entity that got help through the initial decision of the judge. So \nthis is not about special relief for one company. This is about what is \na business day and having a uniform definition in the law of the United \nStates of what a business day is, not based upon one district court \ndecision that may not be applied uniformly around our Nation.\n  So it is about uniformity and not about some bailout, as Senator \nSessions says. It is not about some ferocious lobbying effort, as \nSenator Sessions has said. It is not just because one person was 1 hour \nlate or 1 day late, because how do you know whether they are 1 hour \nlate or 1 day late if there is a different definition under one \ncircumstance of when 60 days starts and another definition under other \ncircumstances of when a 60-day period tolls?\n  Also, I would suggest to Senator Sessions that this is not Congress \ninterfering in a court case that is under appeal because the government \nlost this case and the government is not appealing. Now, there might be \nsome other entity appealing for their own interests to take advantage \nof something that is very unique to them.\n  But just in case we have short memories, I would remind my colleagues \nthat Congress does sometimes interject itself into the appeal process, \nand I would suggest one time we did that very recently, maybe 6 years \nago--and that may not be very recent, but it is not as though we never \ndo it--and that was the Protection of Lawful Commerce Act of 2005, when \nCongress interjected itself into an issue to protect gun manufacturers \nfrom pending lawsuits. It happens that 81 Senators supported that \nparticular effort to interject ourselves into a lawsuit.\n  So, Mr. President, in a more formal way, I want to repeat some of \nwhat I said this past summer when I came to the Senate floor and \nsuggested to the House of Representatives that I would appreciate very \nmuch if they would put into the statutes of the United States a uniform \ndefinition of a business day and not leave it up to a court to maybe \nset that standard so that it might not be applied uniformly and, \nsecondly, to make sure it was done in a way that was treating everybody \nthe same, so everybody gets equal justice under the law, they know what \nthe law is, and they don't have to rely upon maybe some court decision \nin one part of the country that maybe they can argue in another part of \nthe country, and also to tell bureaucrats, as the judge said, that you \ncan't act in an arbitrary and capricious way. But bureaucrats might act \nin an arbitrary and capricious way, in a way unknown to them, if we \ndon't have a uniform definition of what a business day is.\n  So I oppose the effort to strike section 37 from the patent reform \nbill for the reasons I have just given, but also for the reasons that \nwere already expounded by the chairman of this committee that at this \nlate date, after 6 years of trying to get a patent reform bill done--\nand we haven't had a patent reform bill for over a decade, and it is \nbadly needed--we shouldn't jeopardize the possible passage of this bill \nto the President of the United States for his signature by sending it \nback to the other body and perhaps putting it in jeopardy. But, most \nimportant, I think we ought to have a clear signal of what is a \nbusiness day, a definition of it, and this legislation and section 37 \nmakes that very clear.\n  This past June, I addressed this issue in a floor statement, and I \nwant to quote from that because I wanted my colleagues to understand \nwhy I hoped the House-passed bill would contain section 37 that was not \nin our Senate bill but that was passed out of the House Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously. Speaking as ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee now and back in June when I spoke, I wanted the \nHouse Judiciary Committee to know that several Republican and \nDemocratic Senators had asked me to support this provision as well.\n  Section 37 resulted from a recent Federal court case that had as its \ngenesis the difficulty the FDA--the Food and Drug Administration--and \nthe Patent Office face when deciding how to calculate Hatch-Waxman \ndeadlines. The Hatch-Waxman law of the 1980s was a compromise between \ndrug patent holders and the generic manufacturers. Under the Waxman-\nHatch law, once a patent holder obtains market approval, the patent \nholder has 60 days to request the Patent Office to restore the patent \nterms--time lost because of the FDA's long deliberating process eating \nup valuable patent rights.\n  The citation to the case I am referring to is in 731 Federal \nSupplement 2nd, 470. The court found--and I want to quote more \nextensively than I did back in June. This is what the judge said about \nbureaucrats acting in an arbitrary and capricious way and when does the \n60 days start.\n\n       The Food and Drug Administration treats submissions to the \n     FDA received after its normal business hours differently than \n     it treats communications from the agency after normal \n     business hours.\n\n  Continuing to quote from the decision:\n\n       The government does not deny that when notice of FDA \n     approval is sent after normal business hours, the combination \n     of the Patent and Trademark Office's calendar day \n     interpretation and its new counting method effectively \n     deprives applicants of a portion of the 60-day filing period \n     that Congress expressly granted them . . . Under PTO's \n     interpretation, the date stamped on the FDA approval letter \n     starts the 60-day period for filing an application, even if \n     the Food and Drug Administration never sends the letter . . . \n     An applicant could lose a substantial portion, if not all, of \n     its time for filing a Patent Trademark Extension application \n     as a result of mistakes beyond its control . . . An \n     interpretation that imposes such drastic consequences when \n     the government errs could not be what Congress intended.\n\n  So the judge is telling us in the Congress of the United States that \nbecause we weren't precise, there is a question as to when Congress \nintended 60 days to start to toll. And the question then is, If it is \ntreated one way for one person and another way for another person, or \nif one agency treats it one way and another agency treats it another \nway, is that equal justice under the law? I think it is very clear that \nthe judge said it was not. I say the judge was correct. Congress \ncertainly should not expect nor allow mistakes by the bureaucracy to \nup-end the rights and provisions included in the Hatch-Waxman Act or \nany other piece of legislation we might pass.\n  The court ruled that when the Food and Drug Administration sent a \nnotice of approval after business hours, the 60-day period requesting \npatent restoration begins the next business day. It is as simple as \nthat.\n  The House, by including section 37, takes the court case, where \ncommon sense dictates to protect all patent holders against losing \npatent extensions as a result of confused counting calculations. \nRegrettably, misunderstandings about this provision have persisted, and \nI think you hear some of those misunderstandings in the statement by \nSenator Sessions.\n  This provision does not apply to just one company. The truth is that \nit applies to all patent holders seeking to restore the patent term \ntime lost during FDA deliberations--in other words, allowing what \nHatch-Waxman tries to accomplish: justice for everybody. In recent \nweeks, it has been revealed that already three companies covering four \ndrug patents will benefit by correcting the government's mistake.\n  It does not cost the taxpayers money. The Congressional Budget Office \ndetermined that it is budget-neutral.\n  Section 37 has been pointed out as maybe being anticonsumer, but it \nis anything but anticonsumer. I would quote Jim Martin, chairman of the \n60-Plus Association. He said:\n\n       We simply can't allow bureaucratic inconsistencies to stand \n     in the way of cutting-edge medical research that is so \n     important to the increasing number of Americans over the age \n     of 60. This provision is a commonsense response to a problem \n     that unnecessarily has ensnared far too many pharmaceutical \n     companies and caused inexcusable delays in drug innovations.\n\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\n\n  We have also heard from prominent doctors from throughout the United \nStates. They wrote to us stating that section 67 ``is critically \nimportant to medicine and patients. In one case alone, the health and \nlives of millions of Americans who suffer from vascular disease are at \nstake . . . Lives are literally at stake. A vote against this provision \nwill delay our patients access to cutting-edge discoveries and \ntreatments. We urgently request your help in preserving section 37.''\n  So section 37 improves our patent system fairness through certainty \nand clarity, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to preserve \nthis important provision as an end in itself, but also to make sure we \ndo not send this bill back to the House of Representatives and instead \nget it to the President, particularly on a day like today when the \nPresident is going to be speaking to us tonight about jobs. I think \nhaving an updated patent law will help invention, innovation, research, \nand everything that adds value to what we do in America and preserve \nAmerica's greatness in invention and the advancement of science.\n  In conclusion, I would say it is very clear to me that the court \nconcluded that the Patent and Trademark Office, and not some company or \nits lawyers, had erred, as is the implication here. A consistent \ninterpretation ought to apply to all patent holders in all cases, and \nwe need to resolve any uncertainty that persists despite the court's \ndecision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nfor his words, and I join with the Senator from Iowa in opposing the \namendment for two reasons. First, as just simply as a practical matter, \nthe amendment would have the effect, if it passed, of killing the bill \nbecause it is not going to be accepted in the other body, and after 6 \nyears or more of work on the patent bill, it is gone. But also, on just \nthe merits of it, the provision this amendment strikes, section 37 of \nH.R. 1249, simply adopts the holding of a recent district court \ndecision codifying existing law about how the Patent and Trademark \nOffice should calculate 5 days for the purpose of considering a patent \nterm extension. So those are the reasons I oppose the amendment to \nstrike it.\n  The underlying provision adopted by the House is a bipartisan \namendment on the floor. It was offered by Mr. Conyers, and it has the \nsupport of Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Berman on the Democratic side and the \nsupport of Mr. Cantor, Mr. Paul, and Mrs. Bachmann on the Republican \nside. I have a very hard time thinking of a wider range of bipartisan \nsupport than that.\n\n  The provision is simply about how they are calculating filing dates \nfor patent extensions, although its critics have labeled it as \nsomething a lot more. A patent holder on a drug is entitled by statute \nto apply for an extension of its patent term to compensate for any \ndelay the Food and Drug Administration approval process caused in \nactually bringing the drug to market. The patent holder not only has to \nfile the extension within 60 days beginning on the date the product \nreceived permission for marketing, but there is some ambiguity as to \nwhen the date is that starts the clock running.\n  Only in Washington, DC, could the system produce such absurd results \nthat the word ``date'' means not only something different between two \nagencies--the PTO and the FDA--but then it is given two different \nconstructions by the FDA. If this sounds kind of esoteric, it is. I \nhave been working on this for years and it is difficult to understand. \nBut the courts have codified it. Let's not try to change it yet again.\n  What happens is that the FDA treats submissions to it after normal \nhours as being received the next business day. But the dates of \nsubmissions from the FDA are not considered the next business day, even \nif sent after hours. To complicate matters, the PTO recently changed \nits own method of defining what is a ``date.''\n  If this sounds confusing even in Washington, you can imagine how it \nis outside of the bureaucracy. Confusion over what constitutes the \n``date'' for purposes of a patent extension has affected several \ncompanies. The most notable case involves the Medicines Company's \nANGIOMAX extension application request.\n  The extension application was denied by the PTO because of the \ndifference in how dates are calculated. MedCo challenged the PTO's \ndecision in court, and last August the federal district court in \nVirginia held the PTO's decision arbitrary and capricious and MedCo \nreceived its patent term extension.\n  Just so we fully understand what that means, it means PTO now abides \nby the court's ruling and applies a sensible ``business day'' \ninterpretation to the word ``date'' in the statute. The provision in \nthe America Invents Act simply codifies that.\n  Senator Grassley has spoken to this. As he said a few weeks ago, this \nprovision ``improves the patent system fairness through certainty and \nclarity.''\n  This issue has been around for several years and it was a \ncontroversial issue when it would have overturned the PTO's decision \nlegislatively. For this reason Senator Grassley and others opposed this \nprovision when it came up several years ago. But now that the court has \nruled, it is a different situation. The PTO has agreed to accept the \ncourt's decision. The provision is simply a codification of current \nlaw.\n  Is there anyone who truly believes it makes sense for the word \n``date'' to receive tortured and different interpretations by different \nparts of our government rather than to have a clear, consistent \ndefinition? Let's actually try to put this issue to bed once and for \nall.\n  The provision may solidify Medco's patent term extension, but it \napplies generally, not to this one company, as has been suggested. It \nbrings common sense to the entire filing system.\n  However, if the Senate adopts the amendment of the Senator from \nAlabama, it will lead to real conflict with the House. It is going to \ncomplicate, delay, and probably end passage of this important \nbipartisan jobs-creating legislation.\n  Keep in mind, yesterday I said on the floor that each one of us in \nthis body could write a slightly different patent bill. But we do not \npass 100 bills, we pass 1. This bill is supported by both Republicans \nand Democrats across the political spectrum. People on both sides of \nthe aisle have been working on this issue for years and years in both \nbodies. We have a piece of legislation. Does everybody get every single \nthing they want? Of course not. I am chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I don't have everything in this bill I want, but I have \ntried to get something that is a consensus of the large majority of the \nHouse and the Senate, and we have done this.\n  In this instance, in this particular amendment, the House expressly \nconsidered this matter. They voted with a bipartisan majority to adopt \nthis provision the amendment is seeking to strike. With all due respect \nto the distinguished Senator from Alabama, who contributed immensely to \nthe bill as ranking member of the committee last Congress, I understood \nwhy he opposed this provision when it was controversial and would have \nhad Congress override the PTO. But now that the PTO and court have \nresolved the matter as reflected in the bill, it is not worth delaying \nenactment of much-needed patent reform legislation. It could help \ncreate jobs and move the economy forward.\n  We will have three amendments on the floor today that we will vote \non. This one and the other two I strongly urge Senators, Republicans \nand Democrats, just as the ranking member has urged, to vote them down. \nWe have between 600,000 and 700,000 patents applications that are \nwaiting to be taken care of. We can unleash the genius of our country \nand put our entrepreneur class to work to create jobs that can let us \ncompete with the rest of the world. Let's not hold it up any longer. We \nhave waited long enough. We debated every bit of this in this body and \npassed it 95 to 5. On the motion to proceed, over 90 Senators voted to \nproceed. It has passed the House overwhelmingly. It is time to stop \ntrying to throw up roadblocks to this legislation.\n  If somebody does not like the legislation, vote against it. But this \nis the product of years of work. It is the best we are going to have. \nLet us get it done. Let us unleash the ability and inventive genius of \nAmericans. Let us go forward.\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\n  We have a patent system that has not been updated in over a half \ncentury, yet we are competing with countries around the world that are \nmoving light years ahead of us in this area. Let's catch up. Let's put \nAmerica first. Let's get this bill passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 595\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I call up Cantwell amendment No. 595.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 595.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a transitional program for covered business \n                            method patents)\n\n       On page 119, strike line 21 and all that follows through \n     page 125, line 11, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 18. TRANSITIONAL PROGRAM FOR COVERED BUSINESS-METHOD \n                   PATENTS.\n\n       (a) References.--Except as otherwise expressly provided, \n     wherever in this section language is expressed in terms of a \n     section or chapter, the reference shall be considered to be \n     made to that section or chapter in title 35, United States \n     Code.\n       (b) Transitional Program.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Director shall issue regulations \n     establishing and implementing a transitional post-grant \n     review proceeding for review of the validity of covered \n     business-method patents. The transitional proceeding \n     implemented pursuant to this subsection shall be regarded as, \n     and shall employ the standards and procedures of, a post-\n     grant review under chapter 32, subject to the following \n     exceptions and qualifications:\n       (A) Section 321(c) and subsections (e)(2), (f), and (g) of \n     section 325 shall not apply to a transitional proceeding.\n       (B) A person may not file a petition for a transitional \n     proceeding with respect to a covered business-method patent \n     unless the person or his real party in interest has been sued \n     for infringement of the patent or has been charged with \n     infringement under that patent.\n       (C) A petitioner in a transitional proceeding who \n     challenges the validity of 1 or more claims in a covered \n     business-method patent on a ground raised under section 102 \n     or 103 as in effect on the day prior to the date of enactment \n     of this Act may support such ground only on the basis of--\n       (i) prior art that is described by section 102(a) (as in \n     effect on the day prior to the date of enactment of this \n     Act); or\n       (ii) prior art that--\n\n       (I) discloses the invention more than 1 year prior to the \n     date of the application for patent in the United States; and\n       (II) would be described by section 102(a) (as in effect on \n     the day prior to the date of enactment of this Act) if the \n     disclosure had been made by another before the invention \n     thereof by the applicant for patent.\n\n       (D) The petitioner in a transitional proceeding, or his \n     real party in interest, may not assert either in a civil \n     action arising in whole or in part under section 1338 of \n     title 28, United States Code, or in a proceeding before the \n     International Trade Commission that a claim in a patent is \n     invalid on any ground that the petitioner raised during a \n     transitional proceeding that resulted in a final written \n     decision.\n       (E) The Director may institute a transitional proceeding \n     only for a patent that is a covered business-method patent.\n       (2) Effective date.--The regulations issued pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) shall take effect on the date that is 1 year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act and shall apply to \n     all covered business-method patents issued before, on, or \n     after such date of enactment, except that the regulations \n     shall not apply to a patent described in section 6(f)(2)(A) \n     of this Act during the period that a petition for post-grant \n     review of that patent would satisfy the requirements of \n     section 321(c).\n       (3) Sunset.--\n       (A) In general.--This subsection, and the regulations \n     issued pursuant to this subsection, are repealed effective on \n     the date that is 4 years after the date that the regulations \n     issued pursuant to paragraph (1) take effect.\n       (B) Applicability.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), this \n     subsection and the regulations implemented pursuant to this \n     subsection shall continue to apply to any petition for a \n     transitional proceeding that is filed prior to the date that \n     this subsection is repealed pursuant to subparagraph (A).\n       (c) Request for Stay.--\n       (1) In general.--If a party seeks a stay of a civil action \n     alleging infringement of a patent under section 281 in \n     relation to a transitional proceeding for that patent, the \n     court shall decide whether to enter a stay based on--\n       (A) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will simplify \n     the issues in question and streamline the trial;\n       (B) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date \n     has been set;\n       (C) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, would unduly \n     prejudice the nonmoving party or present a clear tactical \n     advantage for the moving party; and\n       (D) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will reduce the \n     burden of litigation on the parties and on the court.\n       (2) Review.--A party may take an immediate interlocutory \n     appeal from a district court's decision under paragraph (1). \n     The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n     shall review the district court's decision to ensure \n     consistent application of established precedent, and such \n     review may be de novo.\n       (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``covered business method patent'' means a patent that claims \n     a method or corresponding apparatus for performing data \n     processing operations utilized in the practice, \n     administration, or management of a financial product or \n     service, except that the term shall not include patents for \n     technological inventions. Solely for the purpose of \n     implementing the transitional proceeding authorized by this \n     subsection, the Director shall prescribe regulations for \n     determining whether a patent is for a technological \n     invention.\n       (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as amending or interpreting categories of patent-\n     eligible subject matter set forth under section 101.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, simply my amendment restores section \n18 of the language that was passed out of the Senate. Basically it \nimplements the Senate language.\n  I come to the floor today with much respect for my colleague Chairman \nLeahy, who has worked on this legislation for many years, and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who have tried to work on \nthis important legislation and move it forward. I am sure it has been \nchallenging. I mean no offense to my colleagues about this legislation. \nIt simply is my perspective about where we need to go as a country and \nhow we get there.\n  I am excited that we live in an information age. In fact, one of the \nthings that I count very fortunate in my life is that this is the age \nwe live in. I often think if I lived in the agrarian age, maybe I would \nbe farming. That is also of great interest, given the State of \nWashington's interests in agriculture. Maybe I would live in the \nindustrial age when new factories were being built. That would be \ninteresting. But I love the fact that whether you are talking about \nagriculture, whether you are talking about automotive, whether you are \ntalking about health care, whether you are talking about software, \nwhether you are talking about communications, whether you are talking \nabout space travel, whether you are talking about aviation, we live in \nan information age where innovation is created every single day. In \nfact, we are transforming our lives at a much more rapid pace than any \nother generation because of all that transformation.\n  I love the fact that the United States has been an innovative leader. \nI love the fact that the State of Washington has been an innovative \nleader. If there is one thing I pride myself on, it is representing a \nState that has continued to pioneer new technology and innovations. So \nwhen I look at this patent bill, I look at whether we are going to help \nthe process of making innovation happen at a faster rate or more \nproducts and services to help us in all of those industries I just \nmentioned or whether we are going to gum up the wheels of the patent \nprocess. So, yes, I joined my colleagues who have been out here on the \nSenate floor, such as Senator Feinstein and others who debated this \nissue of changing our patent system to the ``first to file,'' which \nwill disadvantage inventors because ``first to file'' will lead to big \ncompanies and organizations getting the ability to have patents and to \nslow down innovation.\n  If you look at what Canada and Europe have done, I don't think \nanybody in the world market today says: Oh, my gosh, let's change to \nthe Canadian system because they have created incredible innovation or \nlet's look to Europe because their ``first to file'' has created such \ninnovation.\n  In fact, when Canada switched to this ``first to file'' system, that \nactually slowed down the number of patents filed. So I have that \nconcern about this legislation.\n  But we have had that discussion here on the Senate floor. I know my \ncolleague is going to come to the floor and talk about fee diversion, \nwhich reflects the fact that the Patent Office actually\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\ncollects money on patents. That is a very viable way to make the Patent \nOffice effective and efficient because it can take the money it \ncollects from these patents and use it to help speed up the process of \nverifying these patents and awarding them. But the Senate chose good \naction on this issue, and good measure, and simply said that the money \ncollected by the Patent Office should stay in the Patent Office budget.\n  But that is not what the House has done. The House has allowed that \nmoney to be diverted into other areas of appropriations, and the \nconsequence will be that this patent reform bill will basically be \ntaking the economic engine away from the Patent Office and spreading it \nout across government. So the reform that we would seek in patents, to \nmake it a more expeditious process, is also going to get down.\n  I could spend my time here today talking about those two things and \nmy concerns about them, but that is not even why I am here this \nmorning. I am here to talk about how this legislation has a rifleshot \nearmark in it for a specific industry, to try to curtail the validation \nof a patent by a particular company. That is right, it is an earmark \nrifleshot to try to say that banks no longer have to pay a royalty to a \nparticular company that has been awarded a patent and that has been \nupheld in court decisions to continue to be paid that royalty.\n  That is why I am here this morning. You would say she is objecting to \nthat earmark, she is objecting to that personal approach to that \nparticular industry giveaway in this bill. Actually, I am concerned \nabout that, but what I am concerned about is, given the way they have \ndrafted this language to benefit the big banks of America and screw a \nlittle innovator, this is basically drafted so broadly that I am \nworried that other technology companies are going to get swept up in \nthe definition and their patents are also going to be thrown out as \ninvalid. That is right. Every State in the United States could have a \ncompany that, under this language, could now have someone determine \nthat their patent is no longer viable even though the Patent Office has \nawarded them a patent. Companies that have revenue streams from \nroyalties that are operating their companies could now have their bank \nfinancing, everything pulled out from under them because they no longer \nhave royalty streams. Businesses could lay off people, businesses could \nshut down, all because we put in broad language in the House version \nthat exacerbates a problem that was in the Senate version to begin \nwith.\n\n  Now I could say this is all a process and legislation follows a \nprocess, but I object to this process. I object to this language that \nbenefits the big banks but was never debated in the committee of \njurisdiction, the Judiciary Committee. It was not debated. It was not \nvoted on. It was not discussed there. It was put into the managers' \namendment which was brought to the Senate floor with little or no \ndebate because people wanted to hurry and get the managers' amendment \nadopted.\n  Now, I objected to that process in driving this language because I \nwas concerned about it. I sought colloquy at that point in time and was \nnot able to get one from any of my colleagues, and I so opposed this \nlegislation. Well, now this legislation has been made even worse in the \nHouse of Representatives by saying that this language, which would \nnullify patents--that is right. The Senate would be participating in \nnullifying patents that the Patent Office has already given to \ncompanies, and it can now go on for 8 years--8 years is what the \nlanguage says when it comes back from the House of Representatives.\n  All I am asking my colleagues to do today is go back to the Senate \nlanguage they passed. Go back to the Senate language that at least says \nthis earmark they are giving to the big banks so they can invalidate a \npatent by a company because they don't like the fact they have to pay a \nroyalty on check imaging processing to them--I am sorry you don't like \nto pay the royalty. But when somebody innovates and makes the \ntechnology, they have the right to charge a royalty. You have been \npaying that royalty. I am sorry, big banks, if you don't like paying \nthat royalty anymore. You are making a lot of money. Trying to come to \nthe Senate with an earmark rifle shot to X out that competition because \nyou don't want to pay for that technology--that is not the way the \nSenate should be operating.\n  The fact that the language is so broad that it will encompass other \ntechnologies is what has me concerned. If all my colleagues want to \nvote for this special favor for the big banks, go ahead. The fact that \nmy colleagues are going to basically pull us in to having other \ncompanies covered under this is a big concern.\n  The section I am concerned about is business method patents, and the \nterm ``covered business method patent'' means patents or claims or \nmethod or corresponding apparatus for performing data processing or \nother operations. What does ``or other operations'' mean? How many \ncompanies in America will have their patents challenged because we \ndon't know what ``or other operations'' means? How many? How many \ninventors will have their technology basically found null and void by \nthe court process or the Patent Office process because of this \nconfusing language?\n  I am here to ask my colleagues to do a simple thing: revert to the \nSenate language. It is not a perfect solution. If I had my way, I would \nstrip the language altogether. If I had my way, I would have much more \nclarity and predictability to patent lawyers and the Patent Office so \nthe next 3 or 4 years will not be spent in chaos between this change in \nthe patent business method language and the whole process that is going \nto go on. Instead, we would be moving forward with predictability and \ncertainty.\n  I ask my colleagues to just help this process. Help this process move \nforward by going back to the Senate language. I know my colleagues \nprobably want to hurry and get this process done, but I guarantee this \nlanguage with the Senate version could easily go back to the House of \nRepresentatives and be passed. What I ask my colleagues to think about \nis how many companies are also going to get caught in this process by \nthe desire of some to help the big banks get out from under something \nthe courts have already said they don't deserve to get out of.\n  I hope we can bring closure to this issue, and I hope we can move \nforward on something that gives Americans the idea that people in \nWashington, DC, are standing up for the little guy. We are standing up \nfor inventors. We are standing up for those kinds of entrepreneurs, and \nwe are not spending our time putting earmark rifle shot language into \nlegislation to try to assuage large entities that are well on their way \nto taking care of themselves.\n  I hope if my colleagues have any questions on this language as it \nrelates to their individual States, they would contact our office and \nwe would be happy to share information with them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to urge this body to \ncomplete the extensive work that has been done on the Leahy-Smith \nAmerica Invents Act and send this bill to the President for signature.\n  The America Invents Act has been years in the making. The time has \ncome to get this bill done once and for all.\n  The importance of patent law to our Nation has been evidenced since \nthe founding. The Constitution sets control over patent law as one of \nthe enumerated powers of the Congress. Specifically, it gives the \nCongress the power ``To promote the Progress of Science and useful \nArts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \nexclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.''\n  Today we take an important step toward ensuring that the \nconstitutional mandate of Congress is met as we modernize our patent \nsystem. This bill is the first major overhaul of our patent laws in \nliterally decades.\n  My colleagues have spoken at length about the myriad ways the America \nInvents Act will bring our patent law\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\ninto the 21st century. What I want to focus on, of course, is jobs.\n  The America Invents Act is fundamentally a jobs bill. Innovation and \nintellectual property has always been and always will be at the heart \nof the American economy. By rewarding innovators for inventing newer \nand better products, we keep America's creative and therefore economic \ncore healthy.\n  Over the last few decades, however, innovation has outpaced our \npatent system. We have an enormous backlog at the PTO. The result of \nthis backlog is that it is much harder for creators to obtain the \nproperty rights they deserve in their inventions. That challenge in \nturn makes it harder for inventions to be marketed and sold, which \nreduces the incentive to be innovative. Eventually, this vicious cycle \nbecomes poisonous.\n  The America Invents Act cuts this cycle by making our patent system \nmore efficient and reliable. By providing the Patent and Trademark \nOffice the resources it needs to reduce the backlog of nearly 700,000 \npatent applications, the bill will encourage the innovation that will \ncreate and protect American jobs. In addition, the bill streamlines \nreview of patents to ensure that the poor-quality patents can be weeded \nout through administrative review rather than costly litigation.\n  I am especially pleased that H.R. 1249 contains the Schumer-Kyl \nprovisions that we originally inserted in the Senate to help cut back \non the scourge of business method patents that have been plaguing \nAmerican businesses. Business method patents are anathema to the \nprotection that the patent system provides because they apply not to \nnovel products or services but to abstract and often very common \nconcepts of how to do business. Often business method patents are \nissued for practices that have been in widespread use for years, such \nas check imaging or one-click checkout. Imagine trying to patent the \none-click checkout long after people have been using it.\n  Because of the nature of the business methods, these practices aren't \nas easily identifiable by the PTO as prior art, and bad patents are \nissued. Of course, this problem extends way beyond the financial \nservices industry. It includes all businesses that have financial \npractices, from community banks to insurance companies to high-tech \nstartups. Section 18, the Schumer-Kyl provision, allows for \nadministrative review of those patents so businesses acting in good \nfaith do not have to spend the millions of dollars it costs to litigate \na business method patent in court.\n  That is why the provision is supported not only by the Financial \nServices Roundtable and the Community Bankers, but by the Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Retail Foundation, and in my home State by the \nPartnership for a Greater New York.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of \nsection 18 from all of these organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                                           Bankers of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 2011.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of ICBA's nearly 5,000 \n     community bank members, I write to voice strong support for \n     Section 18 of the America Invents Act (H.R. 1249), which \n     addresses the issue of poor-quality business-method patents. \n     I strongly urge you to oppose efforts to strike or weaken the \n     language in Section 18, which creates a program to review \n     business-method patents against he best prior art.\n       Poor-quality business-method patents represent an extremely \n     problematic aspect of the current system for granting, \n     reviewing and litigating patents. The problems with low-\n     quality patents are well documented and beyond dispute. On an \n     escalating basis, financial firms are the target of meritless \n     patent lawsuits brought by non-practicing entities. Such \n     entities exploit flaws in the current system by bringing \n     action in friendly venues, where they wring money from \n     legitimate businesses by asserting low-quality business-\n     method patents.\n       Section 18 addresses this problem by establishing an \n     oppositional proceeding at the United States Patent and \n     Trademark Office (PTO), where business-method patents can be \n     re-examined, using the best prior art, as an alternative to \n     costly litigation. This program applies only to business-\n     method patents, which are defined using suggestions proffered \n     by the PTO. Concerns about the scope of the definition have \n     been addressed by exclusion of technological innovations. \n     Additionally, it has been well-settled law for over 25 years \n     that post-grant review of patent validity by the PTO is \n     constitutional. The Federal Circuit explained that a \n     defectively examined and therefore erroneously granted patent \n     must yield to the reasonable Congressional purpose of \n     facilitating the correction of governmental mistakes. This \n     Congressional purpose is presumptively correct and \n     constitutional. Congress has given the PTO a tool to ensure \n     confidence in the validity of patents. Section 18 furthers \n     this important public purpose by restoring confidence in \n     business-method patents.\n       I urge you to oppose changes to Section 18, including \n     changes that would create a loophole allowing low-quality \n     business-method patent holders to wall off their patents from \n     review by the PTO. Congress should ensure that final patent-\n     reform legislation addresses the fundamental, and \n     increasingly costly, problem of poor-quality business-method \n     patents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Camden R. Fine,\n\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 2011.\n       To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, \n     and region, supports H.R. 1249, the ``America Invents Act,'' \n     which would encourage innovation and bolster the U.S. \n     economy. The Chamber believes this legislation is crucial for \n     American economic growth, jobs, and the future of U.S. \n     competitiveness.\n       A key component of H.R. 1249 is section 22, which would \n     ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark \n     Office (PTO) fund the office and its administration of the \n     patent system. PTO faces significant challenges, including a \n     massive backlog of pending applications, and this backlog is \n     stifling domestic innovators. The fees that PTO collects to \n     review and approve patent application are supposed to be \n     dedicated to PTO operation. However, fee diversion by \n     Congress has hampered PTO's efforts to hire and retain a \n     sufficient number of qualified examiners and implement \n     technological improvements necessary to ensure expeditious \n     issuance of high quality patents. Providing PTO with full \n     access to the user fees it collects is an important first \n     step toward reducing the current backlog of 1.2 million \n     applications waiting for a final determination and pendency \n     time of 3 years, as well as to improve patent quality.\n       In addition, the legislation would help ensure that the \n     U.S. remains at the forefront of innovation by enhancing the \n     PTO process and ensuring that all inventors secure the \n     exclusive right to their inventions and discoveries. The bill \n     shifts the U.S. to a first-inventor-to-file system that we \n     believe is both constitutional and wise, ending expensive \n     interference proceedings. H.R. 1249 also contains important \n     legal reforms that would help reduce unnecessary litigation \n     against American businesses and innovators. Among the bill's \n     provisions, Section 16 would put an end to frivolous false \n     patent marking cases, while still preserving the right of \n     those who suffered actual harm to bring actions. Section 5 \n     would create a prior user right for those who first \n     commercially use inventions, protecting the rights of early \n     inventors and giving manufacturers a powerful incentive to \n     build new factories in the United States, while at the same \n     time fully protecting universities. Section 19 also restricts \n     joinder of defendants who have tenuous connections to the \n     underlying disputes in patent infringement suits. Section 18 \n     of H.R. 1249 provides for a tailored pilot program which \n     would allow patent office experts to help the court review \n     the validity of certain business method patents using the \n     best available prior art as an alternative to costly \n     litigation.\n       The Chamber strongly opposes any amendments to H.R. 1249 \n     that would strike or weaken any of the important legal reform \n     measures in this legislation, including those found in \n     Sections 16, 5, 19 and 18. The Chamber supports H.R. 1249 and \n     urges the House to expeditiously approve this necessary \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2011.\n     Hon. Lamar S. Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers: I am \n     writing in support of Section 18 of H.R. 1249, the American \n     Invents Act of 2010. This provision would provide the Patent \n     and Trademark Office (PTO) the ability to re-examine \n     qualified business method patents against the best prior art.\n       As the world's largest retail trade association, the \n     National Retail Federation's global membership includes \n     retailers of all sizes, formats and channels of distribution \n     as well as chain restaurants and industry partners from the \n     U.S. In the U.S., NRF represents the breadth and diversity of \n     an industry with more than 1.6 million American companies \n     that employ nearly 25 million workers and\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\n     generated 2010 sales of $2.4 trillion. Retailers have been \n     inundated by spurious claims, many of which, after prolonged \n     and expensive examination, are subsequently found to be less \n     than meritorious.\n       Increasingly, retailers of all types are being sued by non-\n     practicing entities for infringing low-quality business \n     method patents which touch all aspects of our business: \n     marketing, payments, and customer service to name a few \n     aspects. A vast majority of these cases are brought in the \n     Eastern District of Texas where the statistics are heavily \n     weighted against defendants forcing our members to settle \n     even the most meritless suits.\n       Section 18 moves us closer to a unified patent system by \n     putting business method patents on par with other patents in \n     creating a post-grant, oppositional proceeding that is a \n     lower cost alternative to costly patent litigation. The \n     proceeding is necessary to help ensure that the revenues go \n     to creating jobs and bringing innovations to our customers, \n     not paying litigation costs in meritless patent infringement \n     litigation.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to support this important \n     section and oppose any efforts to strike or weaken the \n     provision. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any \n     questions.\n           Best regards,\n\n                                                 David French,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                             Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. A patent holder whose patent is solid has nothing to \nfear from a section 18 review. Indeed, a good patent will come out of \nsuch a review strengthened and validated. The only people who have any \ncause to be concerned about section 18 are those who have patents that \nshouldn't have been issued in the first place and who were hoping to \nmake a lot of money suing legitimate businesses with these illegitimate \npatents. To them I say the scams should stop.\n  In fact, 56 percent of business patent lawsuits come in to one court \nin the Eastern District of Texas. Why do they all go to one court? Not \njust because of coincidence. Why do people far and wide seek this? \nBecause they know that court will give them favorable proceedings, and \nmany of the businesses that are sued illegitimately spend millions of \ndollars for discovery and everything else in a court they believe they \ncan't get a fair trial in, so they settle. That shouldn't happen, and \nthat is what our amendment stops. It simply provides review before \ncostly litigation goes on and on and on.\n  Now, my good friend and colleague, Senator Cantwell, has offered an \namendment that would change the section 18 language and return to what \nthe Senate originally passed last March. Essentially, Senator Cantwell \nis asking the Senate to return to the original Schumer-Kyl language. Of \ncourse, I don't have an inherent problem with the original Schumer-Kyl \nlanguage. However, while I might ordinarily be inclined to push my own \nversion of the amendment, I have to acknowledge that the House made \nsome significant improvements in section 18.\n  First, H.R. 1249 extends the transitional review program of section \n18 from 4 to 8 years in duration. This change was made to accommodate \nindustry concerns that 4 years was short enough, that bad actors would \njust wait out the program before bringing their business method patent \nsuits. The lying-in-wait strategy would be possible under the Cantwell \namendment because section 18 only allows transitional review \nproceedings to be initiated by those who are facing lawsuits.\n  On a 20-year patent, it is not hard to wait 4 years to file suit and \ntherefore avoid scrutiny under a section 18 review. It would be much \nharder, however, to employ such an invasive maneuver on a program that \nlasts 8 years.\n  Second, the Cantwell amendment changes the definition of business \nmethod patents to eliminate the House clarification that section 18 \ngoes beyond mere class 705 patents. Originally, class 705 was used as \nthe template for the definition of business method patents in section \n18. However, after the bill passed the Senate, it became clear that \nsome offending business method patents are issued in other sections. So \nthe House bill changes the definition only slightly so that it does not \ndirectly track the class 705 language.\n  Finally, the Cantwell amendment limits who can take advantage of \nsection 18 by eliminating access to the program by privies of those who \nare sued. Specifically, H.R. 1249 allows parties who have shared \ninterests with a sued party to bring a section 18 proceeding. The \nCantwell amendment would eliminate that accommodation.\n  All of the House changes to section 18 of the Senate bill are \npositive, and I believe we should keep them. But to my colleagues I \nwould say this in closing: The changes Senator Cantwell has proposed do \nnot get to the core of the bill, and the most profound effect they \nwould have is to delay passage of the bill by requiring it to be sent \nback to the House, which is something, of course, we are all having to \ndeal with on all three of the amendments that are coming up.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember that this bill and the 200,000 jobs \nit would create are too important to delay it even another day because \nof minor changes to the legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the amendment of my good friend Maria Cantwell and move the \nbill forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to express my continued support \nfor the America Invents Act. We have been working on patent reform \nlegislation for several years now--in fact, almost the whole time I \nhave been in the Senate--so it is satisfying to see the Senate again \nvoting on this bipartisan bill.\n  It is important to note that this bill before us is the same one that \nwas passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives in \nJune. I commend House Judiciary chairman Lamar Smith for his leadership \non this monumental legislation. He has worked hard on this for many \nyears, and I wish to pay a personal tribute to him.\n  I also wish to recognize the efforts of my colleague from Vermont, \nSenate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy. Over the years, he \nand I have worked tirelessly to bring about long overdue reform to our \nNation's patent system, and I personally appreciate Pat for his work on \nthis matter.\n  I also wish to recognize the efforts of Senate Judiciary Committee \nranking member Chuck Grassley of Iowa, as well as many other Senate \ncolleagues who have been instrumental in this legislative process.\n  The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and the shortest \noperating Constitution in the world. America's Founders put only the \nmost essential provisions in it, listing the most essential rights of \nindividuals and the most essential powers the Federal Government should \nhave. What do we think made it on to that short list? Raising and \nsupporting the Army and maintaining the Navy? No question there. \nCoining money? That one is no surprise. But guess what else made the \nlist. Here is the language: The Founders granted to Congress the power \n``To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for . \n. . Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their Respective \nWriting and Discoveries.''\n  In other words, the governance of patents and copyrights is one of \nthe essential, specifically enumerated powers given to the Federal \nGovernment by our Nation's Founders. In my view, it is also one of the \nmost visionary, forward-looking provisions in the entire U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Thomas Jefferson understood that giving people an exclusive right to \nprofit from their inventions would give them ``encouragement . . . to \npursue ideas which may produce utility.'' Yet Jefferson also recognized \nthe importance of striking a balance when it came to granting patents--\na difficult task. He said:\n\n       I know well the difficulty of drawing a line between the \n     things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an \n     exclusive patent and those which are not.\n\n  As both an inventor and a statesman, he understood that granting a \nperson an exclusive right to profit from their invention was not a \ndecision that should be taken lightly.\n  This bill is not perfect, but I am pleased with the deliberative \nprocess that led to its development, and I am confident that Congress \nfollowed Jefferson's lead in striking a balanced approach to patent \nreform.\n  There can be no doubt that patent reform is necessary, and it is long \noverdue. Every State in the country has a vested interest in an updated \npatent system. When patents are developed commercially they create \njobs, both for the company marketing products and for their suppliers, \ndistributors,\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\nand retailers. One single deployed patent affects almost all sectors of \nour economy.\n  Utahns have long understood this relationship. Ours is a rich and \ndiverse and inventive legacy. In the early 1900s, a young teenager \napproached his teacher after class with a sketch he had been working \non. It was a drawing inspired by the rows of dirt in a potato field the \nteenager had recently plowed. After examining the sketch, the teacher \ntold the young student that he should pursue his idea, and he did. That \nteenager was Philo Farnsworth, a Utah native who went on to patent the \nfirst all-electronic television.\n  Farnsworth had to fight for many years in court to secure the \nexclusive rights to his patent, but he continued to invent, developing \nand patenting hundreds of other inventions along the way.\n  Another Utah native developed a way to amplify sound after he had \ntrouble hearing in the Mormon Tabernacle. His headphones were later \nordered by the Navy for use during World War I. His name was Nathaniel \nBaldwin.\n  William Clayton, an early Mormon pioneer, grew tired of manually \ncounting and calculating how far his wagon company had traveled each \nday. So, in the middle of a journey across the plains, he and others \ndesigned and built a roadometer, a device that turned screws and gears \nat a set rate based on the rotation of the wagon wheel. It worked based \non the same principles that power modern odometers.\n  John Browning, the son of a pioneer, revolutionized the firearm, \nsecuring his inventions through a patent. He is known all over the \nworld for the work he did.\n  Robert Jarvik, who worked at the University of Utah--a wonderful \ndoctor whom I know personally--invented the first successful permanent \nartificial heart while at the University of Utah.\n  These and countless other stories illustrate the type of ingenuity \nthat was required by the men and women who founded Utah, the type of \ningenuity that has been exemplified in every generation since.\n  Last year, Utah was recognized as one of the most inventive States in \nthe Union. Such a distinction did not surprise me, especially since the \nUniversity of Utah recently logged the university's 5,000th invention \ndisclosure and has over 4,000 patent applications filed to date. This \nimpressive accomplishment follows on the heels of news that the \nUniversity of Utah overtook MIT in 2009 to become America's No. 1 \nresearch institution for creating startup companies based on university \ntechnology.\n  A group of students at Brigham Young University recently designed a \ncircuit that was launched with the shuttle Endeavour, and another group \ndeveloped a prosthetic leg that costs $25 versus the $10,000 a \nprosthetic leg may typically cost. Utah inventors contribute to \neverything from electronic communications, to biotechnology, to \ncomputer games.\n  Like my fellow Utahns, citizens across the country recognize that \ntechnological development is integral to the well-being of our economy \nand the prosperity of our families and communities. As technology \nadvances, it is necessary at times to make adjustments that will ensure \nCongress is promoting the healthy progress of science and useful arts.\n  The America Invents Act will improve the patent process, giving \ninventors in Utah and across the country greater incentives to \ninnovate. Strengthening of our patent system will not only help lead us \nout of these tough economic times, but it will help us maintain our \ncompetitive edge both domestically and abroad. Take, for example, the \ntransition to a first-inventor-to-file system and the establishment of \na post-grant review procedure. These changes alone will decrease \nlitigation costs so that small companies and individuals will not be \ndissuaded from protecting their patent rights by companies with greater \nresources.\n  This bill provides the USPTO with rulemaking authority to set or \nadjust its own fees for 7 years without requiring a statutory change \nevery time an adjustment is needed. Providing the USPTO with the \nability to adjust its own fees will give the agency greater flexibility \nand control, which, in the long run, will benefit inventors and \nbusinesses.\n  The legislation enables patent holders to request a supplemental \nexamination of a patent if new information arises after the initial \nexamination. By establishing this new process, the USPTO would be asked \nto consider, reconsider, or correct information believed to be relevant \nto the patent.\n  Further, this provision does not limit the USPTO's authority to \ninvestigate misconduct or to sanction bad actors. I am confident this \nnew provision will remove the uncertainty and confusion that defines \ncurrent patent litigation, and I believe it will enhance patent \nquality.\n  The America Invents Act creates a mechanism for third parties to \nsubmit relevant information during the patent examination process. This \nprovision will provide the USPTO with better information about the \ntechnology and claimed invention by leveraging the knowledge of the \npublic. This will also help the agency increase the efficiency of \nexamination and the quality of patents.\n  This bill would create a reserve fund for user fees that exceed the \namount appropriated to the USPTO. I prefer the language in the Senate-\npassed bill, which created a new revolving fund for the USPTO separate \nfrom annual appropriations. Certainty is important for future planning, \nbut the appropriations process is far from reliable.\n  While conceptually I understand why our House counterparts revised \nthe Senate-passed language--and I am in agreement about maintaining \ncongressional oversight--I believe this is one area that should be \nreconsidered. It is just that important. That is why I support Senator \nTom Coburn's amendment. If passed, his amendment will preserve \ncongressional oversight and give the USPTO the necessary flexibility to \noperate during these critical times.\n  The House-passed compromise language is a step in the right \ndirection, especially since the chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee has committed that all fees collected by the USPTO in excess \nof its annual appropriated level will be available to the USPTO. \nHowever, I remain concerned that the budget uncertainties that exist \ntoday may negatively impact the USPTO and its ability to implement many \nof the new responsibilities required by the America Invents Act.\n  I remain concerned about some provisions the House either expanded or \nadded. On balance, however, the positives of this legislation far \noutweigh the negatives, and I am confident it will contribute to the \ngreater innovation and productivity our economy demands. It provides \nessential improvements to our patent system, such as changes to the \nbest mode disclosure requirement; expansion of the prior user rights \ndefense to affiliates, with an exemption for university-owned patents; \nincentives for government laboratories to commercialize inventions; \nrestrictions on false marking claims; removal of restrictions on the \nresidency of Federal circuit judges; clarification of tax strategy \npatents; providing assistance to small businesses through a patent \nombudsman program and establishing additional USPTO satellite offices.\n  We all know every piece of legislation has its shortcomings. That is \nthe reality of our legislative process. However, taken as a whole, the \nAmerica Invents Act further builds upon our country's rich heritage of \nintellectual property protections--a cornerstone provided by article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution.\n  Passage of the America Invents Act will update our patent system, \nhelp strengthen our economy, and provide a springboard for further \nimprovements to our intellectual property laws. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join in this monumental undertaking, and I appreciate \nthose who have worked so hard on these programs. Again, I mentioned \nwith particularity the Congressman from Texas, Lamar Smith, and also my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Leahy, and others as well, Senator \nGrassley especially. There are others as well whom I should mention, \nbut I will leave it at that for this particular time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a matter of great \nimportance to our country, and that is jobs and our economy. I know the \nPresident will be speaking this evening. I want to emphasize the \nimportance that we focus on a long-term strategy to get our economy \ngoing. By that I mean a pro-jobs, progrowth economic strategy for our \ncountry.\n  The things that go into that include building the best possible \nbusiness climate. We have got to have a business climate that will \nstimulate private investment, that will stimulate entrepreneurship, \ningenuity, that will stimulate job creation by businesses small and \nlarge across our economy. We need to build a strong business climate. \nWe need a long-term, progrowth economic strategy to do that.\n  We also need to control our spending and live within our means. We \nneed a comprehensive energy policy. All three of these things go into \nthe right kind of long-term comprehensive approach this country needs \nto get our economy growing and get people back to work.\n  I wish to start by taking a minute to look at our current situation, \nto talk about where we are. If you look at unemployment, unemployment \nis more than 9 percent, and it has been more than 9 percent for an \nextended period of time. Weekly jobless claims: more than 400,000. We \nhave more than 14 million people who are out of work. That does not \ninclude people who are underemployed or people who are no longer \nlooking for work because they have been discouraged and are not \nincluded in the workforce--14 million people we need to get back to \nwork.\n  We also have a tremendous deficit problem. If you look at our \nrevenues today, we have revenues of about $2.2 trillion. Our spending \nis at a rate of $3.7 trillion. That is a $1.5 trillion deficit. That is \nadding up to more than a $14 trillion dollar debt--a $14 trillion debt \nthat weighs on our economy. If we do not deal with it, it is a debt our \nchildren will have to pay. That is not acceptable for us and we have to \ndeal with it at the same time we get this economy going.\n  If you look at our current situation, we are borrowing 40 cents of \nevery dollar we spend, and deficit and our debt is growing at $4 \nbillion a day. I brought some graphs so we can look at it graphically. \nHere you see revenues and spending.\n  Unfortunately, the spending line is the red line along the top here. \nSpending is more than $3.7 trillion a year. At the same time, our \nrevenues are $2.2 trillion. That gap is a $1.5 trillion budget deficit \nwe are accumulating on an annual basis. As I say, it is now leading to \na debt that is more than $14 trillion.\n  If you look at this next chart, we talk about unemployment. Here you \nsee annual unemployment. Currently we are at 9.1 percent. We have been \nthere for an extended period of time. Again, that represents more than \n14 million people who are unemployed that we need to get back to work.\n  The other thing you will notice on this chart is the blue line. This \nblue line is the chart for my home State. There you will see our \nunemployment is about 3.2 to 3.3 percent. For the last decade in our \nState, we have focused on a progrowth, pro-jobs economic strategy. By \nthat I mean building the best possible business climate, making sure we \nlive within our means, and building a comprehensive energy approach to \ndevelop all of our energy resources. There is no reason we cannot do \nthe same thing at the Federal level. In fact, we need to do exactly \nthat at the Federal level. So I am here today to talk about some of the \nthings we need to do to make that happen.\n  The first is that I emphasize by building a good business climate, I \nmean a legal, tax, and regulatory certainty so businesses know the \nrules of the road so they can invest. They can invest shareholders' \ndollars so entrepreneurs can start new businesses, so existing \nbusinesses can expand. But to do that, they need to know the rules of \nthe road. They need to know what our tax policy is. Right now we have a \ntax policy that expires at the end of the next year. So how do you as a \nbusiness person go out there and start making investments when you do \nnot know what the tax policy is going to be beyond the end of next \nyear? We need tax reform.\n  How about regulation? We have an incredible regulatory burden. How do \nyou go out there and make an investment, get a business going, hire \npeople, if you do not know what the regulatory requirements are? We \nneed to reduce that regulatory burden.\n  We need to pass trade agreements so our companies can sell not just \nhere in the United States but they can sell globally. If you look at \nthe history of our country, that is how we have grown this economy, how \nwe have become the most dynamic economic engine in the world. It is \nthrough that private investment, that entrepreneurship, that American \ningenuity.\n  The role of government is to create a business climate that unleashes \nthat potential. We have got to roll back the regulatory burden. We have \ngot to create clear, understandable rules and tax policy to follow so \nthese companies can make these investments, get those 14-plus million \npeople back to work, get a growing economy, at the same time that we \nget a grip on our spending and start living within our means. That is \nhow we not only raise our standard of living and our quality of life, \nbut we make sure we do not pass on a huge debt to our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Let me talk about some of the kinds of laws and legislation we need \nto pass to make sure that happens.\n  Not too long ago, President Obama issued an Executive order. I hope \nit is something he talks about this evening in his address to the joint \nsession of Congress. In that Executive order, he said all of the \nagencies--all of the Federal agencies--need to look at their \nregulations, at their existing regulations and any regulations they are \nputting out, and make sure that if those regulations are costly, \nburdensome, if they do not make sense, if they are outmoded or \noutdated, they are eliminated, they are stripped away, so we empower \npeople and companies throughout this great country to do business. He \nsaid in that Executive order make sure all of our agencies look at \ntheir regulations and eliminate those that do not make sense, that are \ncostly, and that are burdensome, so we can stimulate economic activity \nand job creation in this country. I think we need to do exactly that. \nIn fact, let's make it a law. Let's make it the law that all of the \nregulatory agencies need to look at their existing regulations and any \nregulations they are looking at putting out, to make darn sure they are \nclear, straightforward, understandable, that they are workable, and not \nonly that our regulations are clear and understandable, that the \nregulators work with Americans and American companies to make sure they \nunderstand them and they are able to meet them so they can pursue their \nbusiness plans, their business growth, their business investment, and \nthat they hire and put people back to work. That is how it is supposed \nto work.\n  Together, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, myself, and others have put \nforward the Regulatory Responsibility for Our Economy Act. That is just \nwhat it says. How much more bipartisan can we get than that? The \nPresident puts out an Executive order saying we need to roll back some \nof these regulations that are burdening our business base, and we as \nRepublican Senators say: Okay, here is an act to put that Executive \norder into law. Let's work together in a bipartisan way to reduce this \nregulatory burden that is stifling economic growth and job creation in \nour country.\n  That is what Congress is supposed to do. That is what we need to do. \nThat is what the people of this country want us to do on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  When the President comes to the Capitol this evening and talks about \nhow we get business going, let's get it going by reducing this \nregulatory burden so private investment can get people back to work in \nthis country. It is not about more government spending, it is about \nprivate investment and initiative. We have to create the framework to \nmake it happen. We can do it, and we can do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Another example is that the United States has been the leader in \naviation throughout its history. Throughout the\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\nhistory of aviation, since Kitty Hawk, the United States has led the \nworld in aviation, in invention, development, and innovation, and all \nthe things that have gone into the development of aviation. Again, \nthroughout its history, the United States has been the leader. One of \nthe key areas for growth in aviation right now is UAS, unmanned aerial \nsystems or unmanned aircraft. They call them remotely piloted aircraft. \nOur military uses them to tremendous benefit in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \naround the world.\n  Even though our military flies UAS all over the globe, we can't fly \nthem here in the United States together with manned aircraft. Yet if we \nare going to continue to lead the world in aviation innovation, we have \nto find a way to fly both manned and unmanned aircraft together in our \nairspace in the United States.\n  Others and I have been talking to the FAA and working with the FAA, \nsaying that you have to promulgate rules, set the rules of the road--\nor, in this case, the rules of the air--so we can fly both manned and \nunmanned aircraft together in the U.S. airspace. The FAA has been \nworking on this for I don't know how long but a long period of time. As \nof yet, they have not come out with those rules so we can fly both \nmanned and unmanned aircraft in our airspace. But we need to, because \nif we don't, other countries will, and they will move ahead of us--\nmaybe not in military aviation, where we are flying unmanned aircraft \nall over the world, but how about in commercial and general aviation \nand all the other applications it will have for unmanned aircraft.\n  The FAA bill, which we are now working to complete--a version was \npassed in the House and a version was passed in the Senate, and we are \ntrying to reconcile the two versions. Again, we need to do this in a \nbipartisan way. I have included language that authorizes--in fact \nrequires--that the FAA set up airspace in the United States so that \nmanned and unmanned aircraft can be flown concurrently. Again, it is \nabout making sure that we not only maintain our lead in aviation but \ncreate those exciting, good-paying jobs of the future. If the agency \nisn't going to take that step, we as the Congress have to make sure we \ntake that step and move the aviation industry forward.\n  Another example is how we have to create the environment, the forum \nthat encourages that type of innovation, entrepreneurship, and \ninvestment in job creation. That is our role, our responsibility, in \nthis most important of all issues, which is getting the economy going \nand getting people back to work.\n  On the free trade agreements, we have three of them pending--one with \nSouth Korea, the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, another is the \nPanama Free Trade Agreement, and the other is with Colombia. Those \ntrade agreements have been negotiated for some time. For three years \nthose trade agreements have been pending. It is time to take them from \npending to being passed. We need the administration to bring those free \ntrade agreements to the Senate and to the House and we will pass them. \nWe have worked across the aisle in a bipartisan way to make sure that \nwhatever issues needed to be dealt with to bring them to the Congress--\nwhether it is trade adjustment authority or whatever, we have worked \ntogether in a bipartisan way to say, look, we have addressed the \nissues. Now the administration needs to bring the free trade agreements \nto the Senate floor. We will pass them.\n  With just one of those free trade agreements--for example, if we take \nthe South Korea free trade agreement--we are talking about more than \n$10 billion in trade every year for our U.S. companies.\n  These free trade agreements reduce tariffs on the order of 85 \npercent. We are talking more than a quarter of a million jobs that will \nbe created if we pass these agreements. For every 4-percent increase in \ntrade, we are talking about 1 million American jobs that we can create. \nAgain, it is about creating the environment that empowers investment, \nempowers our entrepreneurs in this country, and empowers businesses \nlarge and small to invest and get our economy going.\n  At the same time we get this economy growing, we have to start living \nwithin our means. Right now, as I indicated, we have a $1.5 trillion \ndeficit and a debt that is closing in on $14.5 trillion. So at the same \ntime we get the economy growing, which will grow our revenues--not \nhigher taxes, but grow revenues from a growing economy, and with tax \nreform that empowers that economic growth, at the same time, we have to \nget control of our spending and live within our means.\n  Along with some fellow Senators, we have sponsored a number of pieces \nof legislation that I believe we can pass in a bipartisan way to make \nsure we get spending under control. The first is a balanced budget \namendment. I come from a State where I was Governor for 10 years. We \nhave a balanced budget amendment. Every year, we are required by our \nConstitution to balance the budget. States have a balanced budget \nrequirement, and businesses and families and communities all have to \nlive within their means. Our Federal Government has to live within its \nmeans.\n  If you think about it, a balanced budget amendment gets everybody \ninvolved. We not only have to pass it in the Senate and in the House \nwith a two-thirds majority, but then it goes out to the States for \nratification. What better way to get everybody throughout the country \ndirectly involved in making sure that we control our spending. Every \nState has to deal with a balanced budget amendment. So it is all of us \nworking together as Americans, and it is the Congress going to the \npeople of this great country and saying: Here is a balanced budget \namendment, you tell us what you think. Again, what a great way to get \neverybody involved, the way we should get everybody involved in making \nsure we live within our means not only today but tomorrow and \nthroughout future generations.\n  At the same time, we need to pass other tools that can help us get \ncontrol of our spending. For example, the Reduce Unnecessary Spending \nAct. This is a bipartisan act that I think was originally sponsored by \nSenator Tom Carper, a former Governor, a Democrat from Delaware, and \nSenator John McCain. I am proud to be a cosponsor. One of the key \nprovisions is to give the President a line-item veto. Reaching across \nthe aisle, we are giving our President a tool--a line-item veto--to \nmake sure we cut out waste, fraud, and abuse, and that we control our \nspending. As a Governor, the most effective tool I had was the line-\nitem veto. We need to make sure our President has it as well.\n  I think we also need to look at a biennial budget, so that we pass a \nbudget on a two-year cycle--make sure we get it passed and the next \nyear we can come back and make the adjustments we have to make; but at \nthe same time we have time for oversight and making sure spending is \ngoing in accordance with the directive of the Congress, and whether it \nis waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication, that we cut it out. Again, this \nis absolutely what the American people want us to do.\n  The third area I will touch on for a minute--and I will go to the \nnext chart--is building the right kind of energy plan, a comprehensive \nenergy policy that will help this country develop all of its energy \nresources. We did it in North Dakota. I know we can do it at the \nFederal level.\n  If you think about it, energy development in this country is an \nincredible opportunity. It is an opportunity to produce more energy \nmore cost effectively, with better environmental stewardship that will \nenable all of our industries to compete in a global high-tech economy. \nIn addition, what a great opportunity it is to create high-paying jobs. \nAgain, I go back to what I said before. For our energy companies \nlooking to invest hundreds of millions and billions of dollars, they \nneed to know the rules of the road. It comes back to creating a \ncomprehensive energy policy that sets up those rules of the road so \nthey know what their tax situation is and what the regulation and \nregulatory requirements are. When they make those investments to \nproduce more energy more cost effectively, with good environmental \nstewardship, they have to know they are going to be able to get a \nreturn. They have to know they can meet the regulatory requirements. \nThose investments may last 40 and 50 years, and they know they are \ngoing to have to be able to recoup those investments.\n  This first chart gives an example of some of the energy development \nin our\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nState. Out West, there is oil and gas. North Dakota is now the fourth \nlargest oil-producing State in the country. We have passed Oklahoma and \nLouisiana, and people don't realize it. Every State has some kind of \nenergy. If you look at this map, we have oil, gas, coal, and wind. We \nare in the top 10 wind producers. We have biofuels, biomass, solar--we \nhave all of them. Different States have different strengths. A lot of \nStates have oil, gas, coal, or certainly wind, or they can develop the \nbiofuels.\n  It comes down to creating that environment that stimulates private \ninvestment so companies will come in and do exactly what I am talking \nabout--at the Federal level, as well as at the State level.\n  This next chart shows what is actually happening at the Federal \nlevel. This chart is the cost of major new regulations. What it shows \nover the last three decades is the cost of regulation by year, over the \nlast 30 years. When the cost of regulation is high, if you go back and \ncheck, you will see our economy wasn't doing very well. When the cost \nof regulation was low, you will see that it was doing much better. Look \nat the cost of regulation today. It was $26.5 billion in 2010, the cost \nof meeting the regulatory requirements. That is what I am talking \nabout. That is what is impeding job growth and economic growth and \nbusiness investment. We have to address that. We have to roll back the \nregulatory burdens our companies and entrepreneurs face today.\n\n  This last chart gives one example of some of the new regulations EPA \nis putting out that somebody who wants to develop energy has to meet. \nIf you are an energy company or a young person with a good idea to \ndevelop a new type of energy, or existing type of energy with a new \ntechnology, can you meet all of these requirements? Can you even begin \nto understand them? Do you have a big enough legal team and scientific \nteam, or a deep enough wallet to try to figure that all out before you \nput your money or your shareholders' money at risk? That is what is \nimpeding economic growth in our country, and we have to deal with it. \nCongress has to deal with it.\n  Again, this is not rocket science, and it is not about spending more \nFederal dollars. We have to create an environment that will encourage, \nstimulate, and empower private investment. It is that private \ninvestment throughout this land that will get our economy going and get \npeople back to work. We can do it. It has to be a long-term strategy. \nIt can't be a few stopgap measures that we put into place now for the \nnext 90 days or for 1 year at a time. It has to be on a long-term \nsustained basis. I believe that is what the people want to hear this \nevening. I think they want to hear that kind of commitment to a long-\nterm strategy, a progrowth, pro-jobs economic strategy that will get \nthis economy going now, tomorrow, and for the long term. It has to be \ndone in a bipartisan way to get it through this Congress and signed by \nthe President. But it is that kind of vision we need for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, U.S. job creation in this country, as \nyou know, has come to a halt. The Labor Department reported last Friday \nthat zero jobs were created in August. The economic recovery that was \nhoped for failed to materialize, and unemployment remains at 9.1 \npercent.\n  Hope is not enough. Our economy is stagnant. The President's latest \npivot to jobs is anchored on blaming the previous administration, which \nis now nearly 3 years past. Yet, despite repeated assurances of \nimprovement, President Obama's own economic policies have failed. The \nPresident's stimulus plan failed to produce the 3.5 million jobs he \npromised. His ``green jobs'' initiative gave us more red ink but never \ncame close to the 5 million new jobs he predicted it would. All the \nwhile the Federal bureaucracy he controls churns out expansive and \nexpensive new regulations that amount to an assault on private sector \njob creation.\n\n  The facts are inescapable. Since President Obama took office, America \nhas lost approximately 2.3 million jobs. We are in an economic crisis--\na crisis that extends to America's confidence in the President to do \nanything that will change the current course. What the American people \nwant is a plan, a plan that will yield results. They want leadership, \nand they have rejected the President's insistence that the only way \nforward is through more spending.\n  Today, western Members of the Senate and House are calling on the \nPresident to accept a new way--a progrowth plan to create jobs in the \nWest that will lead to broader economic recovery all across the \ncountry. The western caucus Jobs Frontier report was produced by \nMembers of the Senate and congressional western caucuses. It contains \nlegislative proposals already introduced in both Houses of Congress, \nand these are proposals that create jobs now.\n  The proposals we support speak largely to the economic challenges \nfaced by Western States. They are also aimed at ruinous regulations and \nreliance on foreign energy and lawsuit abuse that continues to stifle \nour entire economy. These bills are ready to pass. They are ready to \ncreate jobs today.\n  Any serious job creation proposal has to start with serious steps to \nincrease affordable American energy. For decades, westerners have \nworked in high-paying energy jobs, and these jobs have good benefits. \nSince taking office, the Obama administration has consistently pushed \nextreme policies and heavy-handed regulations that make it harder to \ndevelop American energy. Very simply: Fewer energy projects mean fewer \nAmerican jobs. Members of the Senate and House western caucuses have \nproposed a wide range of proposals to increase the number of red, \nwhite, and blue jobs all across the country.\n  Encouraging the development of all-of-the-above energy resources will \ncreate thousands of jobs in the West and make our country less \ndependent on foreign energy. This administration has consistently shut \ndown offshore energy exploration. It has arbitrarily canceled existing \nleases, and it continues to try to impose additional hurdles to onshore \nproduction, such as redundant environmental reviews, burdensome \npermitting review requirements, and delays in processing of \napplications.\n  Our bills--the ones in this report--will streamline the permitting \nprocess and break down the barriers imposed by President Obama. This \nwill make it cheaper and easier--cheaper and easier--for the private \nsector to create jobs.\n  Westerners recognize we cannot pick and choose which forms of energy \nto support. When it comes to energy, we need it all, and we need it \nnow. That is why we need a bill that will let energy producers tap \nexisting resources of American oil and natural gas. Our plan has a bill \nthat will do that. It is called the Domestic Jobs, Domestic Energy, and \nDeficit Reduction Act. It has been introduced by both Representative \nRob Bishop of Utah and Senator David Vitter of Louisiana.\n  This bill would force the Department of the Interior to stop blocking \noffshore energy exploration. That department's stall tactics have gone \nso far that even President Bill Clinton has called them ridiculous. The \nDomestic Jobs, Domestic Energy, and Deficit Reduction Act would force \nthe Obama administration to quit stalling.\n  The barrage of new regulations coming out of Washington continues to \nbe a big wet blanket--a big wet blanket--thrown over the job creators \nin our country. In July of 2011, this administration issued 229 rules, \nand it finalized 379 additional rules that are going to cost our job \ncreators over $9.5 billion. That is in July alone.\n  Our plan includes a bill I have introduced, called the Employment \nImpact Act. This bill forces Washington regulators to look before they \nleap when it comes to regulations that could hurt American jobs. Under \nthe bill I have introduced, every regulatory agency would be required \nto prepare a jobs impact statement. They would have to do it with every \nnew rule they propose. That statement would include a detailed \nassessment of the jobs that would be lost or gained or sent overseas by \nany given rule. It would consider whether new rules would have a bad \nimpact on our job market in general.\n  The administration has also attempted to drastically increase \nwilderness areas, to expand Washington's jurisdiction on private \nwaters, and to misuse the Endangered Species Act.\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\nWestern lawmakers are proposing to reassert congressional authority to \nensure a proper balance between job creation and conservation. Our \nbills in this report will increase transparency and stop any \nadministration from issuing regulations without considering the local \neconomic impact.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, American farmers and ranchers have \nprovided an affordable, abundant, and safe domestic supply of food and \nenergy. In recent years, America's agricultural and forestry industries \nhave been increasingly threatened by the surge of regulations coming \nfrom Washington--especially those from the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Our plan is going to push back. We will strengthen these \nindustries and their ability to meet the world's growing food and \nenergy needs.\n  Westerners also recognize the mining sector is vital to our economic \nrecovery. We know manufacturing jobs cannot be created without the raw \nmaterials needed to produce goods. Since the Obama administration will \nnot break down barriers to American minerals, our Nation is growing \nincreasingly dependent on foreign minerals--countries such as China and \nRussia. This inaction is unacceptable and it is inexcusable.\n  Our plan includes Senator Murkowski's bill, the Critical Minerals \nPolicy Act, which will ensure long-term viability of American mineral \nproduction. Her bill requires the U.S. Geological Survey to establish a \nlist of minerals critical to the U.S. economy and then provide a \ncomprehensive set of policies to address each economic sector that \nrelies upon those critical minerals. It also creates a high-level \ninteragency working group to optimize the efficiency of permitting in \norder to facilitate increased exploration and production of domestic \ncritical minerals.\n  These are just some of the ideas included in our jobs frontier plan. \nAs it says: ``Breaking Down Washington's Barriers to America's Red, \nWhite and Blue Jobs.'' We eliminate back-door cap-and-tax regulations. \nFinally, we will take on excessive lawsuits against Federal agencies \nthat have increased dramatically and destroyed jobs in the West.\n  Every single one of the bills in the Republican jobs plan has been \nwritten and introduced in one or both Houses of Congress. This is a \nplan that can be implemented now. This is a plan that will work to \ncreate jobs. This is a plan that will reduce the cost of energy and \nrestart the economy.\n  There is a lot that needs to be done to fix our ailing economy. These \nare some ideas--western ideas--that come from the lawmakers that know \nbest how our rural communities are suffering and how we can get folks \nback to work. Many of these proposals come from the States. They have \nthe support of our western Governors and legislators. These are ideas \nnot born in Washington.\n  Recent jobless numbers confirm the current approach from Washington \nhas failed. If the President is serious about incorporating the ideas \nof every American in every part of the country, then he needs to look \nbeyond Washington.\n  I thank every Member of the Senate and congressional western caucuses \nfor their work and their expertise on this report. I look forward to \nturning these ideas into policies and in that way putting all of \nAmerica back to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                    Afghanistan and Aid to Pakistan\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I want to take some time today to talk about \nmy views on Afghanistan and why we should rethink aid to Pakistan.\n  I just completed my third 2-week reserve assignment in Afghanistan. \nWhile many Members of Congress get a firsthand look at the situation on \nfactfinding missions, my time provided me a more indepth view, with a \nfocus on the counternarcotics objectives of NATO's ISAF mission.\n  Now, first, the good news. The work of our soldiers, marines, sailors \nand airmen is nothing short of amazing. Serving in one of the poorest, \nroughest, and most remote parts of the globe, they have crushed al-\nQaida's training bases, they have driven the Taliban from government, \nthey have fostered a new elected government, and welded 47 allies into \na force for human rights, development, and education--especially for \ngirls.\n  Now, 42 percent of Afghans live on just $1 a day. Only one in four \ncan read. Malnutrition is a serious problem, and infant mortality is \nthe third highest of any country. According to the United Nations, \nnearly 40 percent of Afghan children under 3 are moderately or severely \nunderweight, and more than 50 percent of children under 3 experience \nstunted growth. Afghanistan has more than twice the population of \nIllinois, but its electricity generation for the entire year is less \nthan 2 percent of the electricity generated in Illinois just for the \nmonth of May.\n  The nearly 30 million people of Afghanistan are victimized by a \nnumber of terrorist groups beyond just the Taliban, such as the HIG, \nthe ETIM, and a new threat called the Haqqani network, which I will go \ninto detail about. But the Afghans are mostly victimized by their \nneighbors, the Pakistanis.\n  I served as a reservist in Afghanistan for the first time in 2008, \nand I believed then that Pakistan was complicated; that we have many \nissues there and that we should advance our own interests \ndiplomatically. I no longer agree with that.\n  Pakistan has now become the main threat to Afghanistan. Pakistan's \nintelligence service is the biggest danger to the Afghan Government. \nPakistan also poses a tremendous threat to the lives of American \ntroops. Let me be clear: Many Americans died in Afghanistan because of \nPakistan's ISI.\n  Sitting in our commander's briefs for 2 weeks and talking to our \nheadquarters' leaders and spending a few days in the field, it became \nclear to me if we were working in Afghanistan alone we would have had a \nmuch better chance to turn that country around more quickly, restoring \nit to its status as an agricultural economy with a loose government and \na high degree of autonomy given to each tribe or region. But we are not \nalone.\n  While our military reduced al-Qaida in Afghanistan to a shadow of its \nformer self, a new force is emerging. On the 10th anniversary of 9/11, \nal-Qaida, I must report, is still armed and dangerous, but it is far \nless numerous or capable than it once was. But al-Qaida is not the most \npotent force that is arrayed against us.\n  The new face of terror is called the Haqqani network. Built around \nits founder Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Siraj, it has become the \nmost dangerous, lethal, and cancerous force in Afghanistan.\n  One other thing. As much as Pakistani officials claim otherwise, the \nHaqqanis are backed and protected by Pakistan's own intelligence \nservice. Statements by Pakistani Government officials to the contrary \nare direct lies. The Haqqani network kills Americans, it attacks the \nelected Government of Afghanistan, and remains protected in its \nPakistani headquarters of Miriam Shah. Without that Pakistani safe \nhaven, the Haqqani network would suffer the same fate as al-Qaida. \nAfghan and U.S. special operations teams take out many Taliban and al-\nQaida commanders, and these operators operate each night also against \nnumerous Haqqani leaders. But the Haqqanis are able to spend all day \nplanning attacks on Afghans and Americans and then sleeping soundly in \ntheir beds in Pakistan.\n  In such an environment, with our deficits and debt, military aid to \nPakistan seems naive at best and counterproductive at worst. I am \nseriously thinking we should reconsider assistance to the Pakistani \nmilitary.\n  Recently, our President chose to withdraw 33,000 American troops from \nthe Afghan battle. General Petraeus and Admiral Mullen did not choose \nthis option. Nevertheless, I think our new commander, General Allen, \ncan withdraw the first 10,000 American troops by Christmas without \nsuffering a military reversal in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's Army and \npolice are growing in size--now numbering over 300,000--and capability. \nDespite recent reports of desertions, Afghan security forces will soon \nreach a level where some of our troops may safely leave the country. As \nwe withdraw, we should consider enablements, such as a pay raise for \nAfghan troops, to improve their retention and morale.\n  I spoke with General Allen about a commander's assessment that should \nbe delivered at the end of the year. After withdrawing 10,000 troops, I \nhope\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\nhe will clearly define when the next 23,000 can come out.\n  In the United States, politically there is little difference between \nwithdrawing at the end of the year and withdrawing at the end of the \nfiscal year, but militarily there is a world of difference. The \nfighting season in Afghanistan runs through October. If General Allen \nis ordered to withdraw his troops by September 30, then many of his \nforces will disappear during the Taliban's key offensive months. But if \nthe troops leave in November-December, we will guarantee another bad \nmilitary year for the Taliban and the Haqqanis and an even stronger \nAfghan Army in the long term.\n  I hope the President sets an end-of-year deadline rather than an end-\nof-fiscal-year deadline. It is right to do militarily and politically. \nIf he does this, he reduces the chance of a radical Islamic extremist \nvictory on the Afghan battlefield in 2012.\n  While in Afghanistan, I worked to help update and rewrite ISAF's \ncounternarcotics plan. Afghanistan is the source of over 80 percent of \nthe world's heroin and opium. The drug economy fuels the insurgency and \ncorruption of the Afghan Government itself. From 2001-09, Secretary \nRumsfeld and then-Ambassador Holbrooke blocked ISAF from doing much \nabout narcotics. This left a huge funding source for the insurgency \nuntouched.\n  ISAF was able to change direction slightly in 2009 and 2010 by \nsupporting interdiction and eradication and alternative livelihoods for \nAfghan farmers. While commendable, these programs didn't work and the \nsize of the Afghan poppy crop is likely to go up.\n  The plan I worked on advocates a shift in ISAF to apply its military \nstrength of intelligence, helicopters, and special operations to \nsupport Afghan decisions to arrest the top drug lords of Afghanistan, \nstarting with the ones who heavily financially back the insurgency. We \njoined in 2005 to arrest bin Laden's banker Haji Bashir Noorzai, and we \nshould do it again.\n  I strongly back the Afghan Counternarcotics Ministry idea to announce \na top 10 drug lord list to emulate the early success of J. Edgar Hoover \nwhen he established the reputation of the FBI. In our remaining 2 years \nin Afghanistan, we can do a lot to cripple the insurgency and help the \n2014 elections by removing a number of key bad actors from the \nbattlefield.\n  What about the future? The President says our formal current mission \nwill end in 2014. Much of his vision will be approved at the Chicago \nNATO summit in May of 2012. By 2014, I believe Afghans will be able to \ndo nearly all of the conventional fighting, with some U.S. special \noperations support remaining.\n  But remember, while the Afghan Army is likely to win, its budget for \nthis year is $11 billion. The Afghan Government collected only $1 \nbillion in tax revenue in 2010. We will have to help. Without regular \nU.S. combat troops, we risk a Taliban-Haqqani-ISI alliance winning \nunless we do help that Afghan military.\n  On the 10th anniversary of 9/11, we should all agree that Afghanistan \nshould never become a major threat to American families again. Should \nPakistan not change its ways, we can do one other thing: an American \ntilt toward India, to encourage the world's largest democracy to \nbankroll an Afghan Government that fights terror and the ISI. Given the \noutright lying and duplicity of Pakistan, it appears a tilt toward \nIndia will allow us to reduce our forces in Afghanistan, knowing India \nwill help bankroll an Afghan Government. This would allow us to reduce \nour troops while also reducing the possibility of Afghanistan once \nagain becoming a terrorist safe haven.\n  Pakistanis would object to this pro-Indian outcome, but they will \nonly have their own ISI to blame. September 11 teaches us that neither \nthe United States nor India can tolerate a new formal Afghan terror \nstate. It is too bad Pakistan has chosen to back the losing side--the \nterrorists--against the Afghan people and the two largest democracies \non Earth.\n  Finally, a word about our troops. Each night they combat the most \ndangerous narco-insurgents on Earth, and many 19- and 20-year-old \nAmericans volunteer to serve over 7,000 miles from home. Their \ngeneration is named after September 11, but these Americans in uniform \nnot only carry their generation's label, they are personally employed \nin risking their lives to ensure that all Americans will never again \nwitness another September 11.\n  They are America's best hope, and I hope to God when I am older some \nof them run for President. From my own nursing home, I know the country \nwould be in good hands if one of these young Americans were to guide \nour Nation's destiny.\n  I am lucky to know many of their names. MAJ Fred Tanner, U.S. Army; \nLT Doug McCobb, Air Force; MG Mick Nicholson, Army; and our allies, Wg \nCdr Howard Marsh, Royal Air Force; GEN Renee Martin, French Army; RADM \nTony Johnstone-Brute, Royal Navy; and COL Robin Vickers, British Army. \nI honor them and their younger comrades, wishing all the military \npersonnel of ISAF's 47 nations a very good day as they awake in \nAfghanistan tomorrow morning for another hard day's work on one of the \ntoughest battlefields in the world.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about an amendment, but \nalso I had one of my colleagues who was sitting in your position as \nPresident pro tempore notice an error I made on July 27. Senator \nWhitehouse questioned my numbers and, in fact, he was right. I said \n$115 million in regard to the savings on limousines. It was $11.5 \nmillion per year, not $115 million. It was $115 million over 10 years. \nSo I wish to stand to put that in the Record that I was in error and \nSenator Whitehouse as a cordial colleague questioned me on it and I \nthank him for his accountability.\n  We have before the Senate now a patent bill. There is no question \nthere is a lot of work we need to do on patents. I know the President \npro tempore sits on the committee that I do and we have spent a lot of \ntime on this. But I am very concerned, I have to say, about what we are \nhearing in the Senate about why we wouldn't do the right thing that \neverybody agrees we should be doing because somebody doesn't want us to \ndo that in the House, and I think it is the worst answer we could ever \ngive the American people.\n  When we have a 12-percent approval rating, and the Republicans have \nworse than that, why would we tell the American people we are not going \nto do the right thing for the right reason at the right time because \nsomebody in the House doesn't want us to and that we are going to say \nwe are not going to put these corrections into a patent bill that are \nobviously important and we are going to say it is going to kill the \nbill when, in fact, it is not going to kill the bill? But that is what \nwe use as a rationalization. So let me describe for a minute what has \ngone on over the years and what has not happened.\n  The first point I would make is there has not been one oversight \nhearing of the Patent Office by the Appropriations Committee in either \nthe House or the Senate for 10 years. So they haven't even looked at \nit. Yet the objection to, and what we are seeing from an appropriations \nobjection is--and even our chairman of our Committee on the Judiciary, \nwho is an appropriator, supports this amendment but isn't going to vote \nfor it because somebody in the House is going to object to it.\n  But the point is, we have money that people pay every day. From \nuniversities to businesses to individual small inventors, they pay \nsignificant dollars into the Patent Office. Do you know what has \nhappened with that money this year? Eighty-five million dollars that \nwas paid for by American taxpayers for a patent examination and first \nlooks didn't go to the Patent Office. Yet we have over 1 million \npatents in process at the Patent Office, and over 700,000 of those \nhaven't ever had their first look.\n  So when we talk about our economy and we talk about the fact that we \nwant to do what enhances intellectual property in our country--which is \none of our greatest assets--and then we don't allow the money that \npeople actually pay for that process to go for that process and we have \nbacklogged for years now patent applications, we have done two things. \nOne is we have limited the intellectual property we can capture. No. 2 \nis we have allowed people to take those same patents,\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\nwhen we have limited ability, especially some of our smaller \norganizations, and patent them elsewhere. So the lack of a timely \napproach on that is lacking.\n  The process is broken. Since 1992, almost $1 billion has been taken \nout of the Patent Office. So we wonder, why in the world is the Patent \nOffice behind?\n  The Patent Office is behind because we will not allow them to have \nthe funds the American taxpayers who are trying to get ideas and \ninnovations, copyrights, trademarks, and patents done--we will not \nallow the Patent Office to have the money.\n  The amendment I am going to be offering--and I have a modification on \nit that is trying to be cleared on the other side, and I will not \nactually call up the amendment at this time until I hear whether that \nhas been accepted. The amendment I have says we will no longer divert \nthe money that American businesses, American inventors, American \nuniversities pay to the Patent Office to be spent somewhere else; that \nit has to be spent on clearing their patents.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record--and I will \nsubmit a copy at this time--a letter I received August 1 from the head \nof the Patent Office.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     United States\n\n\n                                  Patent and Trademark Office,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, Aug. 1, 2011.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: Per your request, I am writing today \n     to follow up on our discussion last week regarding United \n     States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) funding.\n       As you know, the House-passed version of the America \n     Invents Act (H.R. 1249) replaces a key funding provision that \n     would have created the USPTO Public Enterprise Fund--\n     effectively sheltering the USPTO from the uncertainties of \n     the appropriations process and ensuring the agency's ability \n     to access and spend all of the fees it collects--with a \n     provision creating the Patent and Trademark Reserve Fund. \n     This provision keeps the USPTO in the current appropriations \n     process, but requires that all fees collected in excess of \n     the annual appropriated amount be deposited into the Reserve \n     Fund, where they will be available to the extent provided for \n     in appropriations acts. In a June 22, 2011 letter to Speaker \n     Boehner, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers \n     committed to ensuring that the Committee on Appropriations \n     carry language providing that all fees collected in excess of \n     the annual appropriated amount would be available until \n     expended only to the USPTO for services in support of fee-\n     paying patent and trademark applicants. I was pleased to see \n     that the fiscal year 2012 appropriations bill reported by the \n     Committee did in fact carry this language.\n       I would like to reiterate how crucial it is for the USPTO \n     to have access to all of the fees it collects. This year \n     alone, we anticipate that the agency will collect \n     approximately $80 million in fees paid for USPTO services \n     that will not be available for expenditure in performing \n     those services. Quite clearly, since the work for which these \n     fees were paid remains pending at USPTO, at some point in the \n     future we will have to collect more money in order to \n     actually perform the already-paid-for services. If USPTO had \n     received the authority to expend these funds, we would have \n     paid for activities such as overtime to accelerate agency \n     efforts to reduce the backlog of nearly 700,000 patent \n     applications, as well as activities to improve our decaying \n     IT systems, which are a constant drag on efficiency. As \n     history has demonstrated, withholding user fees from USPTO is \n     a recipe for failure. Effecting real reforms at the USPTO \n     requires first and foremost financial sustainability. \n     Ensuring that the agency has consistent access to adequate \n     funding is a key component of achieving this.\n       Further, the unpredictability of the annual appropriations \n     cycle severely hinders USPTO's ability to engage in the kind \n     of multi-year, business-like planning that is needed to \n     effectively manage a demand-driven, production-based \n     organization. The only way we will be able to effectively \n     implement our multi-year strategic plan, and achieve our \n     goals of reducing the patent backlog and pendency to \n     acceptable levels, is through an ongoing commitment to \n     ensuring the USPTO has full access to its fee collections--\n     not just in fiscal year 2012, but for each and every year \n     beyond FY 2012. Only this assurance will enable the agency to \n     move forward with the confidence that we are basing critical \n     multi-year decisions about staffing levels, IT investment, \n     production, and overtime on an accurate and reliable funding \n     scenario.\n       Along these lines, if America is to maintain its position \n     as the global leader in innovation, it is essential that \n     American businesses and inventors not suffer the adverse \n     effects of drawn-out continuing resolutions (CR), which have \n     become common in recent years. The constant stops and starts \n     associated with the CR cycle can have disastrous \n     consequences, especially for a fee-based agency with a \n     growing workload, as is the case for USPTO. The challenges \n     presented by the pending patent reform legislation will be \n     particularly difficult to undertake if the agency is not \n     allowed to grow along a steady path to address our increasing \n     requirements. As such, we must be assured that the USPTO will \n     have full access to its fees throughout the year--not just \n     after a full year appropriations act is enacted. Therefore, a \n     commitment to include language in future continuing \n     resolutions that will address the USPTO's unique resource \n     needs is paramount.\n       As outlined in our Strategic Plan and in our FY 2012 budget \n     submission, USPTO has a multi-year plan in place to reduce \n     patent pendency to 10 months first action and 20 months final \n     action pendency, and to reduce the patent application backlog \n     to 350,000. During the next three to four years, we will \n     continue and accelerate implementation of a series of \n     initiatives to streamline the examination process, including \n     efforts to improve examination efficiency and provide a new, \n     state-of-the-art end-to-end IT system, which will support \n     each examiner's ability to process applications efficiently \n     and effectively.\n       While efficiency gains are essential, we will not reach our \n     goals without also increasing the capacity of our examination \n     core. As outlined in the FY 2012 budget, we plan to hire an \n     additional 1,000 patent examiners in FY 2012, with another \n     1,000 examiner hires planned for FY 2013. This added \n     capacity, combined with full overtime, will allow us to bring \n     the backlog and pendency down to an acceptable level.\n       Let me also be clear that while these enhancements are \n     necessary to allow the USPTO to tackle the current backlog, \n     the agency is not planning to continue growing indefinitely. \n     An important part of our multi-year plan is an eventual \n     moderation of our workforce requirements, once we have \n     achieved a sustainable steady state.\n       At the same time that USPTO is working to achieve these \n     goals, we will also be working to restructure our fees to \n     ensure that the agency is recovering adequate costs to \n     sustain the organization. Once our fees have been set, we \n     will continually monitor our collections over the next \n     several years to ensure that our operating reserve does not \n     grow to unacceptably high levels at the expense of USPTO's \n     stakeholders.\n       Thank you again for your support and your superb leadership \n     on this important issue. With the continued commitment of the \n     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations to ensuring the \n     USPTO's ongoing ability to utilize its fee collections, we \n     can put the agency on a path to financial sustainability, and \n     enable it to deliver the services paid for and deserved by \n     American innovators.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David J. Kappos,\n                                     Under Secretary and Director.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I must tell you that we are so fortunate that we have \nDirector Kappos. We have a true expert in patents, with great \nknowledge, who has made tremendous strides in making great changes at \nour Patent Office. But he requires a steady stream of money, and he \nrequires the ability to manage the organization in a way where he can \nactually accomplish what we have asked him to do.\n  Frankly, I have spent a lot of time working with the Patent Office--\nnot with everybody else who wants an advantage in the patent system but \nwith the Patent Office--and I am convinced we have great leadership \nthere.\n  In his letter, he talks about their inability to update their IT \nbecause the money is not there because we will not let him have the \nmoney--their money, the money from the American taxpayers.\n  Let me give a corollary. If, in fact, you drive your car into the gas \nstation, you give them $100 for 25 or 28 gallons of gas, and they only \ngive you 12 gallons of gas and they say: Sorry, the Appropriations \nCommittee said you couldn't have all the gas for the money you paid, \nyou would be outraged. If you go to the movie, you pay the fee to go to \nthe movie and you buy a ticket, you walk in, and halfway through the \nmovie they stop the projection and say: Sorry, we are not going to give \nyou the second half of the movie even though you paid for it--inventors \nin this country have paid the fees to have their patents examined and \nevaluated and reviewed. Yet we, because of the power struggle, have \ndecided we are not going to let that money go to the Patent Office. The \namendment I have says we are going to allow that to happen. If money is \npaid and it goes into a proper fund that is allocatable only to the \nPatent Office, it cannot be spent anywhere else and has to go to the \nPatent Office.\n  Some of the objections, especially from the House Appropriations \nCommittee, are that there is no oversight.\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\nThe reason there is no oversight is because they have not done any \noversight and neither have we, so you cannot claim that as an excuse as \nto why you are afraid. This patent bill will give an authorization for \n7 years for the fees. We can change that if we want, but the fact is \nthat we are never going to know if we need to change it if we never do \noversight, which we have not done. Nobody has done oversight on \npatents. I am talking aggressive oversight: What did you start? What \nwas your end? How much did you spend? Where did you spend the money? \nWhat is your employee turnover? What is your employee productivity? \nWhat should we expect?\n  None of that has been asked. I believe it is probably pretty good \nbased on the fact that I have a lot of confidence in the management at \nthe Patent Office, especially what I have seen in terms of performance \nfor the last couple of years versus before that, but the fact is that \noversight has not been done.\n  It is not just the Patent Office. It hasn't been done anywhere. Very \nlittle oversight has been done by the Senate, and it is one of the \nbiggest legitimate criticisms that can be made of us as a body, that we \nare lazy in our oversight function. Of the $3.7 trillion that is going \nto be spent, we are going to have oversight of about $100 billion of \nthe total.\n  The amendment does a couple of things. Let me kind of detail that for \na moment. One of the things is that by returning the money to the \nPatent Office, the Director thinks he can actually cut the backlog in \nhalf. In other words, we have over 700,000 patents that have never been \nlooked at sitting at the Patent Office now, and he believes that in a \nvery short period of time they could cut that to 350,000.\n  From 1992 through 2011, $900 million has been taken from the PTO. In \n2004 Congress diverted $100 million, in 2007 it diverted $12 million, \nlast year it diverted $53 million, and it is $80 million to $85 million \nthat is going to be diverted this year. In 4 years out of the last 10, \nCongress gave the Patent Office all the money because it was so slow, \nso lethargic in terms of meeting the needs of inventors. The only thing \nwe have in the current bill is the promise of a Speaker and the promise \nof a chairman that they will do that. There is nothing in law that \nforces them to do it. There is nothing that will make sure the money is \nthere. No matter how good we fix the patent system in this country, if \nthere is not the money to implement it, we will not have solved the \nproblems.\n  In June of 2000, the House debated the PTO funding, and an \ninteresting exchange took place between Representative Roybal-Allard \nand Representative Rogers, who was a cardinal at the time. \nRepresentative Allard discussed the problem of PTO fee diversion and \nthe need for user fees to pay for the work of the agency. She asked--in \nthe documentation of the Congressional Record, she asked Chairman \nRogers if 100 percent of the user fees would go to the PTO, and Mr. \nRogers stated that the fees would not be siphoned off for any other \nagency or purpose and remain in the account for future years. But \naccording to the PTO, in fiscal year 2000, $121 million was, in fact, \ndiverted. So when we have the chairman of the committee say we should \nnot doubt the word of the Appropriations Committee, yet we have in the \nRecord the exact opposite of what the Appropriations Committee said was \ngoing to happen, we should be concerned and we should fix it to where \nthe money for patent examination goes for patent examination. So we \nhave a clear record of a statement that says it was not going to \nhappen, and, in fact, $121 million was diverted from the Patent Office.\n  Finally, from 1992 to 2007, $750 million more in patent and trademark \nfees was collected than was allowed to be spent by the Patent and \nTrademark Office. Had they had that money, we would have a backlog of \nabout 100,000 patents right now, not 750,000. We would have \nintellectual property as a greater value in our country, with greater \nadvantage over our trading partners because that money would have been \neffectively used.\n  On July 12, former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin wrote to Senators \nReid and McConnell noting:\n\n       The establishment of the Patent and Trademark reserve fund \n     in H.R. 1249 would be ineffective in stopping the diversion \n     of the fees from the U.S. Patent Office.\n\n  In other words, what is in this bill now will not stop the diversion \nof the fees.\n  Just so people think I am not just picking on one area, this is a bad \nhabit of Congress. It is not just in the Patent and Trademark Office \nthat we tell people to pay a fee to get something done and we steal the \nmoney and use it somewhere else. For example, in the Nuclear Waste Fund \nat the Department of Energy, utility payments by individual consumers \npay for a nuclear waste fee. That money has been spent on tons of other \nthings through the years rather than on the collection and management \nof nuclear waste. To the tune of $25 billion has been spent on other \nthings.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission is a fee-based agency. Since \nthe SEC was established, it has collected money via user fees, charged \nfor various transactions in order to cover the cost of its regulation. \nThe primary fees are for sales of stock, registration of a new stock, \nmergers, tender offers. It also collects fees for penalty fines, for \nbad behavior. They go into the Treasury's general fund, and amounts \ncollected above the SEC budget were diverted to other government \nprograms.\n  In 2002, Congress changed the treatment of the fees of the SEC so \nthey would only go to a special appropriation account solely for the \nSEC. SEC would not have access to the fees, however, should it collect \nmore than its appropriation.\n  In the Dodd-Frank bill, Congress again changed the treatment of the \nfees and required some of the fees to go to the General Treasury and \nothers to the reserve fund. As a result, lots of complaints with the \nSEC, and they still do not have access to their funds. Thus, like the \nPTO, if Congress chooses not to provide all the funds in the initial \nappropriation, they will not have them.\n  In the 2012 budget justification from the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, they noted it had significant challenges maintaining a \nstaffing level sufficient to carry out its core mission. From 2005 to \n2077, SEC had frozen or reduced budgets that forced reduction of 10 \npercent of their staff and 50 percent of technology investment. What \nhappened in 2007 in this country? What were the problems? So the \ndiversion of the money from the SEC actually contributed to the \nproblems we had in this country. So it does not work.\n  Finally, one that is my favorite and that I have fought against every \nyear that I have been here is the Crime Victims Fund, and that is a \nfund where people who are criminals actually have to pay into a fund to \ndo restitution for criminal victims, and we have stolen billions of \ndollars from that fund. They are not taxes, they are actually \nrestitution moneys, but the Congress has stolen it and spent it on \nother areas. The morality of that I don't think leads anybody to \nquestion that that is wrong.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 599, as Modified\n\n  Now, if I may, let me call up amendment 599. I ask that the pending \namendment be set aside and ask that the amendment be modified with the \nchanges at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Oklahoma \nknows that the basic thing he is trying to do is something I had \nsupported. As he knows, I put it in the managers' package. He also is \naware that my belief is--obviously we disagree--my belief is that the \nacceptance of his amendment will effectively kill the bill. Even today \nthe leadership in the House told me they would not accept that bill \nwith it. I say this only because tactically it would be to my advantage \nto object to the amendment. But the distinguished Senator is one of the \nhardest working members of the Judiciary Committee. He is always there \nwhen I need a quorum. Out of respect for him, I will not object.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for this. This is a minor technical \ncorrection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself, Mr. \n     DeMint, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Udall of Colorado, \n     Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Burr, proposes an amendment (No. 599), as \n     modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the provision relating to funding the Patent and \n Trademark Office by establishing a United States Patent and Trademark \n         Office Public Enterprise Fund, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 137, line 1, strike all through page 138, line 9, \n     and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 22.

I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I noted \nearlier, before I came to the floor, he supported it in principle and \nwe have a difference in principle about what would happen to the bill. \nThis is a minimal technical correction that was recommended to us, and \nI appreciate the Senator for allowing that to be considered.\n  Let me spend a moment talking about the chairman and his belief that \nthis will not go anywhere. This is a critical juncture for our country, \nwhen we are going to make a decision to not do what is right because \nsomebody is threatening that they do not agree with doing what is right \nand that they will not receive it. In my life of 63 years, that is how \nbullies operate, and the way you break a bully is you challenge a \nbully.\n  The fact is, I have just recorded into the history of the House the \nstatements by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the House \nin terms of his guarantee for protecting the funds for PTO, which he \nturned around and took $121 million out of the funds that very same \nyear that he guaranteed on the floor that he wouldn't do. So what I \nwould say is we ought not worry about idle threats. What we ought to be \nworried about is doing what is best and right for our country. What is \nbest and right is to give the money to the Patent Office that people \nare paying for so the patents will get approved and our technological \ninnovations will be protected. I don't buy the idea the House is not \ngoing to take this if we modify it.\n\n  Actually, what 95 percent of the people in this country would agree \nto is that the Patent Office ought to get the money we are paying for \npatent fees, just as the FDA should get the money paid by drug \ncompanies for new applications, just as the Park Service should put the \nmoney for the camping sites--the paid-for camping sites--back into the \ncamping sites. Why would we run away from doing the right thing?\n  I find it very difficult when we rationalize down doing the correct \nthing that everybody agrees should be done but we will not do it for \nthe right reasons. That is why we have a 12-percent approval rating. \nThat is why people don't have confidence in Congress--because we walk \naway from the tough challenges of bullies who say they won't do \nsomething if we do what is right. I am not going to live that way. I am \nnot going to be a Senator that way. I am going to stand on the position \nof principle.\n  This is a principle with which 95 Senators in this body agree. We are \ngoing to have several of our leaders try to get them not to do that on \nthe basis of rationalization to a bully system that says: We will not \ndo the oversight, but we still want to be in control.\n  In fact, in the process of that, America loses because we have \n750,000 patents that are pending right now, and there should only be \nabout 100,000.\n  The bullies have won in the past, and I am not going to take it \nanymore. I am going to stand up and challenge it every time. I am going \nto make the argument that if a person pays a fee for something in this \ncountry for the government to do, that money ought to be spent doing \nwhat it was paid to the government to do. It is outside of a tax; it is \na fee. It is immoral and close\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nto being criminal to not correctly spend that money from that fee.\n  If our body decides today we are going to table this amendment, the \nquestion the American people have to ask is, Where is the courage in \nthe Senate to do what is best for our country? Why are the Senators \nhere if they are not going to do what is best for the country? Why are \nthey going to play the game of rationalization and extortion on \nprinciples that matter so much to our future? I will not do that \nanymore. Everybody knows this is the right thing to do. We are \nbabysitting some spoiled Members of Congress who don't want to carry \nout their responsibilities in an honorable way and do the oversight \nthat is necessary. What they want to do is complain that they do not \nhave control.\n  Well, this bill authorizes funds for 7 years. We can change that \nnumber of years. We can actually change the actual amount of fees if, \nin fact, they are not doing a good job. But right now, as already put \nin the Record, there is no history of significant oversight to the \nPatent Office, so they would not know in the first place. So what we \nare asking is to do what is right, what is transparent, what is morally \ncorrect and give the Patent Office the opportunity to do for America \nwhat it can do for them instead of handcuffing us and handicapping us \nwhere we cannot compete on intellectual property in our country.\n  I have said enough. I will reserve the remainder of my time when I \nfinish talking about one other item.\n  There is an earmark in this patent bill for The Medicines Company. It \nought not be there. This is something that is being adjudicated in the \ncourts right now. Senator Sessions has an amendment that would change \nit. I believe it is inappropriate to specify one company, one situation \non a drug that is significant to this country, and we are fixing the \nwrong problem. We probably would not win that amendment. I think it is \nsomething the American people ought to look at and say: Why is this \nhere? Why is something in this big bill that is so important to our \ncountry?\n  I agree with our chairman. He has worked months, if not years, over \nthe last 6 years trying to get to this process, and now we have this \nput in. We did not have it in ours. The chairman did not have it in \nours. It came from the House.\n  We ought to ask the question Why is it there? Why are we interfering \nin something that is at the appellate court level right now? Why are we \ndoing that? None of us can feel good about that. None of us can say it \nis the right thing to do. Why would we tolerate it?\n  It is this lack of confidence in America; it is about a lack of \nconfidence in us. When people know and find out what has happened here, \nthey are going to ask the question. The powerful and the wealthy \nadvantage themselves at the expense of everybody else. They have \naccess. Those who are lowly, those who are minimal in terms of their \nmaterial assets do not. It is the type of thing that undermines the \nconfidence we need to have.\n  I just wanted to say I am a cosponsor of Senator Sessions' amendment. \nI believe he is accurate. I think they have won this in court. It is on \nappeal. They will probably win it on appeal. This will end up being \nnecessary, and there is a way for us to fix it if, in fact, they lose, \nif it is appropriate to do that. I believe it is inappropriate at this \ntime.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sessions \namendment which seeks to remove an egregious example of corporate \nwelfare and blatant earmarking, to benefit a single interest, in the \notherwise worthwhile patent reform bill before the Senate. Needed \nreform of our patent laws should not be diminished nor impaired by \ninclusion of the shameless special interest provision, dubbed ``The Dog \nAte My Homework Act'' that benefits a single drug manufacturer, \nMedicines & Company, to excuse their failure to follow the drug patent \nlaws on the books for over 20 years.\n  The President tonight will deliver another speech to tell us that \nunemployment is too high and that we need to get America back to work \nto turn around our near stagnant economy. While it may end up being \nmore of the same policies that have not worked for the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, I look forward to hearing what he has to say. But, look at what \nis going on here today, just a couple hours before the President tells \nus how he proposes to fix the economy, there are 14 million Americans \nout of work and a full day of the Senate's time is being spent debating \na bailout of a prominent law firm and a drug manufacturer. I think the \nAmerican people would be justified in wondering if they were in some \nparallel universe.\n  Patent holders who wish to file an extension of their patent have a \n60-day window to make the routine application. There is no ambiguity in \nthis timeframe. In fact, there is no reason to wait until the last day. \nA patent holder can file an extension application any time within the \n60-day period. Indeed, hundreds and hundreds of drug patent extension \napplications have been filed since the law was enacted. Four have been \nlate. Four!\n  Why is this provision in the patent reform bill? One reason: special \ninterest lobbying to convince Congress to relieve the company and its \nlaw firm from their mistakes. Millions of dollars in branded drug \nprofits are at stake for a single company who will face generic \ncompetition much earlier than if a patent extension would have been \nfiled on time.\n  Let me read from the Wall Street Journal Editorial page today:\n\n       As blunders go, this was big. The loss of patent rights \n     means that generic versions of Angiomax might have been able \n     to hit pharmacies since 2010, costing the Medicines Co. \n     between $500 million and $1 billion in profits.\n       If only the story ended there.\n       Instead, the Medicines Co. has mounted a lobbying offensive \n     to get Congress to end run the judicial system. Since 2006, \n     the Medicines Co. has wrangled bill after bill onto the floor \n     of Congress that would change the rules retroactively or give \n     the Patent Office director discretion to accept late filings. \n     One version was so overtly drawn as an earmark that it \n     specified a $65 million penalty for late filing for ``a \n     patent term extension . . . for a drug intended for use in \n     humans that is in the anticoagulant class of drugs.''\n       . . . no one would pretend the impetus for this measure \n     isn't an insider favor to save $214 million for a Washington \n     law firm and perhaps more for the Medicines Co. There was \n     never a problem to fix here. In a 2006 House Judiciary \n     hearing, the Patent Office noted that of 700 patent \n     applications since 1984, only four had missed the 60-day \n     deadline. No wonder critics are calling it the Dog Ate My \n     Homework Act.\n\n  The stakes are also high for patients in our health care system. Let \nme read an excerpt from the Generic Pharmaceutical Association letter \ndated July 20, 2011:\n\n       The Medicines Company amendment adopted during House \n     consideration of H.R. 1249 modifies the calculation of the \n     60-day period to apply for a patent term extension and \n     applies that new definition to ongoing litigation. We are \n     deeply concerned about the precedent of changing the rules of \n     the patent extension process retroactively, which appears to \n     benefit only one company--The Medicines Company, which missed \n     the filing deadline for a patent extension for its patent on \n     the drug Angiomax.\n       If enacted into law, this provision would change the rules \n     to benefit one company that, by choice, waited until the last \n     minute to file a simple form that hundreds of other companies \n     have filed in a timely manner since the enactment of the \n     Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984. In doing so, the amendment would \n     ultimately cost consumers and the government hundreds of \n     millions of dollars by delaying the entry of safe, affordable \n     generic medications. . . .\n       The rules and regulations that govern patents and \n     exclusivity pertaining to both generic and brand drugs are \n     important public policy. While it is Congress's prerogative \n     to change or clarify statutory filing deadlines, we strongly \n     urge you to do so in a manner that does not benefit one \n     company's litigating position. GPhA urges you to strike \n     section 37 from H.R. 1249.\n\n  Passing the Sessions amendment and removing the provision from the \nbill is not detrimental to passing the patent reform bill. The bailout \nprovision was not included in the Senate-passed patent bill earlier \nthis year. It was added in the House. The provision can and should be \nstripped in this vote today. The House can easily re-pass the bill \nwithout the bailout provision and send it to the President.\n  Support the Sessions amendment and send a loud signal to the American \npublic, who are watching what we do, that laws matter and that this \nkind of business has no place in Congress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is an amendment that can derail and \neven kill this bill--a bill that would otherwise help our recovering \neconomy, unleash innovation and create the jobs\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\nthat are so desperately needed. I have worked for years against Patent \nOffice fee diversion, but oppose this amendment at this time. Its \nformulation was rejected by the House of Representatives, and there is \nno reason to believe that the House's position will change. Instead, \nfor ideological purity, this amendment can sink years of effort and \ndestroy the job prospects represented by this bill. So while I oppose \nfee diversion, I also oppose the Coburn amendment.\n  I kept my commitment to Senator Coburn and included his preferred \nlanguage in the managers' amendment which the Senate considered last \nMarch. The difference between then and now is that the Republican \nleadership of the House of Representatives rejected Senator Coburn's \nformulation. They preserved the principle against fee diversion but \nchanged the language.\n  The language in the bill is that which the House devised and a \nbipartisan majority voted to include. It was worked out by the House \nRepublican leadership to satisfy House rules. The provision Senator \nCoburn had drafted and offers again with his amendment today apparently \nviolates House Rule 21, which prohibits converting discretionary \nspending into mandatory spending. So instead of a revolving fund, the \nHouse established a reserve fund. That was the compromise that the \nRepublican House leadership devised between Chairmen Smith, Rogers and \nRyan. Yesterday I inserted in the Record the June letter for \nCongressmen Rogers and Ryan to Chairman Smith of the House Judiciary \nCommittee. Today I ask consent to insert into the Record the commitment \nletter from Chairman Rogers to Speaker Boehner.\n  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, continues to make \nimportant improvements to ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office (USPTO) are used for Patent and Trademark Office \nactivities. That office is entirely fee-funded and does not rely on \ntaxpayer dollars. It has been and continues to be subject to annual \nappropriations bills. That allows Congress greater opportunity for \noversight.\n  The legislation that passed the Senate in March would have taken the \nPatent and Trademark Office out of the appropriations process, by \nsetting up a revolving fund that would have allowed the office to set \nfees and collect and spend money without appropriations legislation and \ncongressional oversight. Instead of a revolving fund, the House \nformulation against fee diversion establishes a separate account for \nthe funds and directs that they be used for U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice. The House Appropriations Chairman has committed to abide by \nthat legal framework.\n  The House forged a compromise. Despite what some around here think, \nthat is the essence of the legislative process. The Founders knew that \nwhen they wrote the Constitution and included the Great Compromise. \nIdeological purity does not lead to legislative enactments. This House \ncompromise can make a difference and make real progress against fee \ndiversion. It is something we can support and there are many, many \ncompanies and organizations that do support this final workout in order \nto get the bill enacted without further delay, as do I.\n  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, creates a new Patent \nand Trademark Fee Reserve Fund (the ``Reserve Fund'') into which all \nfees collected by the USPTO in excess of the amount appropriated in a \nfiscal year are to be deposited. Fees in the Reserve Fund may only be \nused for the operations of the Patent and Trademark Office. Through the \ncreation of the Reserve Fund, as well as the commitment by House \nappropriators, H.R. 1249 makes important improvements in ensuring that \nuser fees collected for services are used by the Patent and Trademark \nOffice for those services.\n  Voting for the Coburn amendment is a vote to kill this bill. It could \nkill the bill over a formality--the difference between a revolving fund \nand a reserve fund. It would require the House to reconsider the whole \nbill again. They spent days and weeks working out their compromise in \ngood faith. And it was worked out by the House Republican leadership. \nThere is no reason to think they will reconsider and allow the original \nCoburn language to violate their rules and avoid oversight. They have \nalready rejected that language, the very language proposed by the \nCoburn amendment.\n  We should not kill this bill over this amendment. We should reject \nthe amendment and pass the bill. The time to put aside individual \npreferences and ideological purity is upon us and we need to legislate. \nThat is what the American people elected us to do and expect us to do. \nThe time to enact this bill is now. Vote no on the Coburn amendment.\n  I have listened to the Senator from Oklahoma, and no matter what we \nsay about it, his is an amendment that can derail and even kill this \nbill. He expresses concern as to why the bill should be sought because \nsomebody objects to the bill. I sometimes ask myself that question. Of \ncourse, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has objected to many \nitems going forward on his own behalf, but this is an amendment that \ncould derail or even kill the bill. This is a bill that would otherwise \nhelp our recovering economy to unleash innovation, create the jobs so \ndesperately needed.\n  I probably worked longer in this body than anybody against Patent \nOffice fee diversion. As the Senator from Oklahoma knows, I put a \nprovision in the managers' package to allow the fees to go to the \nPatent Office. Now it is a lobby to keep that in in the other body. Its \nformulation was rejected by the House of Representatives.\n  There is no reason to believe the House position will change. I \nchecked with both the Republican and Democratic leaders over there. \nThere is no reason to believe their position will change, but we insist \non ideological purities--including something I would like. The \namendment would take years of effort, destroy the job prospects \nrepresented by this bill. While I oppose the fee diversion, I also \noppose this amendment.\n  Does this bill have every single thing in it I want? No. We could \nwrite 100 patent reform legislations in this body where each one of us \nhas every single thing we want, and we would have 100 different bills. \nWe only have one. It does not have all the things I like, but that is \npart of getting legislation passed.\n  I did keep my commitment to Senator Coburn. I kept his language in \nthe managers' amendment, and I caught a lot for doing that--I am a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee--but I kept it in there. The \ndifference between then and now is that the Republican leadership of \nthe House of Representatives rejected Senator Coburn's formulation. \nThey preserved the principle against fee diversion but changed the \nlanguage. In doing that, however, it is not a total rejection. They \nactually tried to work out a compromise. The language of the bill, \nwhich the House devised--a bipartisan majority voted to include--was \nworked out by the House Republican leadership to satisfy the House \nrules.\n  The provision that Senator Coburn has drafted and offers, again, with \nhis amendment today apparently violates House rule 21 which prohibits \nconverting discretionary spending into mandatory spending.\n  What the House did--and actually accomplished what both Senator \nCoburn and I and others want--instead of a revolving fund was to \nestablish the reserve fund. That was the compromise that the Republican \nHouse leadership devised between Chairman Smith, Chairman Rogers, and \nChairman Ryan.\n  Yesterday, I inserted into the Record the June letter from \nCongressmen Rogers and Ryan to Chairman Smith to the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the commitment \nletter from Chairman Rogers to Speaker Boehner.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2011.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Eric Cantor,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor: I write regarding \n     provisions in H.R. 1249, The America Invents Act, affecting \n     funding of the Patent Trademark Office (PTO). Following \n     constructive discussions with Chairman Smith of the Judiciary \n     Committee, this legislation now includes language that will \n     preserve Congress' ``power of\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n     the purse,'' under Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the \n     Constitution. The language ensures: the PTO budget remains \n     part of the annual appropriations process; all PTO collected \n     fees will be available only for PTO services and activities \n     in support of the fee paying community; and finally, this \n     important agency will continue to be subject to oversight and \n     accountability by the Congress on an annual basis.\n       To assure that all fees collected for PTO remain available \n     for PTO services, H.R. 1249 provides that if the actual fees \n     collected by the PTO exceed its appropriation for that fiscal \n     year, the amount would continue to be reserved only for use \n     by the PTO and will be held in a ``Patent Trademark Fee \n     Reserve Fund''.\n       At the same time, consistent with the language included in \n     H.R. 1249, the Committee on Appropriations will also carry \n     language that will ensure that all fees collected by PTO in \n     excess of its annual appropriated level will be available \n     until expended only to PTO for support services and \n     activities in support of the fee paying community, subject to \n     normal Appropriations Committee oversight and review.\n       I look forward to working with the relevant stakeholders in \n     efficiently implementing this new process.\n       I believe this approach will help U.S. innovators remain \n     competitive in today's global economy and this in turn will \n     contribute to significant job creation here in the United \n     States, while holding firm to the funding principles outlined \n     in the Constitution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Harold Rogers,\n                      Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would note that it has been suggested somehow the \nAppropriations chairman is not going to keep his word. Well, Chairman \nRogers is a Republican. I have worked with him a lot. He has always \nkept his word to me, just as we have the most decorated veteran of our \nmilitary serving in either body as chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, the only Medal of Honor recipient now \nserving, Senator Inouye. Both he and the ranking Republican, Senator \nCochran, have always kept their word to me certainly in more than the \nthird of a century I have served on that committee.\n  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, continues to make \nimportant improvements. It ensures the fees collected by the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office are used for Patent and Trademark Office \nactivities. The one thing in there is that we in the Congress at least \nhave a chance to make sure they are using it the way they are supposed \nto.\n  The office is entirely fee funded. It does not rely on taxpayer \ndollars. It has been and continues to be subject to the annual \nappropriations bill which allows the oversight that we are elected and \npaid for by the American people to do.\n  The legislation we passed in March would have taken the Patent \nTrademark Office out of the appropriations process by setting up a \nrevolving fund. Instead of a revolving fund, the House formulation \nagainst fee diversion established a separate account and directs that \naccount be used only by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The House \nAppropriations chairman is committed to abide by that legal framework. \nThe Speaker is committed to that. The House forged a compromise. That \nis the essence of the legislative process.\n  The Founders knew when they wrote the Constitution to include the \nGreat Compromise. Ideological purity does not lead to legislative \nenactments. Ideological purity does not lead to legislative enactments.\n  The House compromise can make a difference. It made real progress \nagainst fee diversion, which is something we can support. There are \nmany companies and organizations that do support this in order to get \nthe bill enacted without delay. After 6\\1/2\\ years, let's not delay any \nmore.\n  This is going to create jobs. We have 600,000 to 700,000 patents \nsitting there waiting to be processed. Let's get on with it. For all of \nthese fees and the reserve fund can only be used for the operations of \nthe Patent and Trademark Office. I don't know what more we can do. But \nI would say I am perfectly willing to accept what the House did because \nit assures that the fees go to the Patent Office.\n\n  I am also well aware that voting for this amendment kills the bill. \nIt could kill the bill over a formality--the difference between a \nreserve fund and a revolving fund.\n  I think the House Republican leadership worked out their compromise \nin good conscience, and I agree with it.\n  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is funded entirely by user fees, \nand the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act will ensure the PTO has access \nto the fees it collects. We have heard from a number of organizations \nwhich agree with that, and I ask unanimous consent that a sample of \nthese letters from the Business Software Alliance, the Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship Council, DuPont, and other financial organizations \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Business Software Alliance,\n\n                                                    June 29, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: We urge you to \n     bring H.R. 1249 to the Senate floor as soon as the Senate's \n     schedule permits.\n       The Business Software Alliance (BSA) strongly supports \n     modernizing our patent system. An efficient and well-\n     operating patent system is necessary to promote healthy and \n     dynamic innovation. Innovation is critically important to \n     software and computer companies' ability to provide new and \n     better tools and technologies to consumers and customers.\n       BSA member companies believe H.R. 1249 establishes a \n     transparent and efficient patent system. It will make the \n     Patent and Trademark Office more accessible and useful to all \n     inventors, large and small. In addition, the provisions of \n     H.R. 1249 on Patent and Trademark Office funding will ensure \n     that the user fees paid to the USPTO will be available to the \n     Office for processing patent applications and other important \n     functions of the Office.\n       H.R. 1249 and S. 23 are the products of many years of \n     skillful and difficult legislative work in both the House and \n     the Senate. H.R. 1249 represents a thoughtful and balanced \n     compromise that is endorsed by virtually all stakeholders. We \n     urge the Senate to adopt H.R. 1249 as acted upon by the House \n     and pass it without amendment as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Robert W. Holleyman,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  SBE Council,\n\n                                        Oakton, VA, June 29, 2011.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: The Small \n     Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) has been a \n     leading advocate for patent reform within the small business \n     community, and we urge you to work with the leadership of the \n     Senate to bring the America Invents Act (H.R. 1249) to the \n     Senate floor for approval.\n       H.R. 1249 would improve the patent system in key ways. For \n     example, the U.S. patent system would be brought in step with \n     the rest of the world. The U.S. grants patents on a first-to-\n     invent basis, rather than the first-inventor-to-file system \n     that the rest of the world follows. First-to-invent is \n     inherently ambiguous and costly, and that's bad news for \n     small businesses and individual inventors.\n       A shift to a ``first-inventor-to-file'' system creates \n     greater certainty for patents, and amounts to a far simpler \n     and more transparent system that would reduce costs in the \n     rare cases when conflict exists over who has the right to a \n     patent. By moving to a first-inventor-to-file system, small \n     firms will in no way be disadvantaged, as some claim, while \n     opportunities in international markets will expand.\n       In addition, an Associated Press report, for example, noted \n     ``that it takes an average of three years to get a patent \n     approved and that the agency has a backlog of 1.2 million \n     pending patents, including more than 700,000 that haven't \n     reached an examiner's desk.'' Part of the problem here is \n     that revenues from patent fees can be drained off by Congress \n     to be spent elsewhere.\n       The agreement reached in the House on USPTO funding will \n     assure that the fees paid to the USPTO by inventors will not \n     be diverted elsewhere, but instead be made available for \n     processing patent applications. While the Senate's approach \n     in S. 23 to prevent diversion of USPTO funds would have been \n     a better choice, the House bill still provides an effective \n     option.\n       Patent reform is needed to clarify and simplify the system; \n     to properly protect legitimate patents; and to reduce costs \n     in the system, including when it comes to litigation and the \n     international marketplace. All of this, of course, would aid \n     small businesses and the overall economy.\n       H.R. 1249, like S. 23, is a solid bill, and the opportunity \n     for long overdue and much-needed patent reform should not be \n     lost.\n       Thank you for considering the views of the small business \n     community. Please feel free to contact SBE Council with \n     questions or if we can be of assistance on this important \n     issue for small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan.\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                       Dupont,\n\n                                     Wilmington, DE, July 6, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As a world \n     leader in science and innovation, including agriculture and \n     industrial biotechnology, chemistry, biology, materials \n     science and manufacturing, DuPont recognizes the nation's \n     patent system is a cornerstone in fostering innovation and \n     creating jobs. Patents continue to be one of the engines for \n     innovation and a process for discovery that leads to rich, \n     new offerings for our customers and gives our company the \n     edge to continue transforming markets and society. Our stake \n     in the patent system is significant--in 2010, DuPont filed \n     over 2,000 patent applications and was awarded almost 700 \n     U.S. patents. Given the importance of its patents, DuPont has \n     been a strong supporter of efforts to implement patent reform \n     legislation that will improve patent quality and give the \n     U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the resources it needs to \n     examine and grant patents in a timely manner.\n       We believe that any changes to the patent system need to be \n     made in a way that strengthens patents and supports the \n     important goals of fostering innovation and creating jobs. In \n     our view, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, H.R. 1249, \n     achieves these objectives, and we urge you to consider \n     adoption of this bill.\n       The agreement reached in the House on USPTO funding will \n     assure that the fees paid to the USPTO by inventors will not \n     be diverted and will be made available to the Office for \n     processing patent applications and other important functions \n     of the Office. While we would have preferred the Senate's \n     approach in S. 23 to prevent diversion of USPTO funds, we \n     believe that acceptance of the House bill provides an \n     effective and the most immediate path forward to address \n     problems of the patent office. H.R. 1249, like S. 23, is an \n     excellent bill. These bills are the product of many years of \n     skillful and difficult legislative work in both the House and \n     the Senate. We believe the time has now come for the Senate \n     to take the final legislative act required for enactment of \n     these historic reforms.\n       We look forward to patent reform becoming a reality in the \n     112th Congress, due in significant measure to your \n     leadership, and we thank you for your efforts in this \n     critical policy area.\n           Very truly yours,\n     P. Michael Walker,\n       Vice President, Assistant General Counsel and Chief \n     Intellectual Property Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 29, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: We are writing to \n     encourage you to bring H.R. 1249, the ``Leahy-Smith America \n     Invents Act,'' to the Senate floor at your earliest possible \n     convenience and send the bill to the President's desk to be \n     signed into law. H.R. 1249 closely mirrors the Senate bill \n     that passed earlier this year by an overwhelming 95-5 vote.\n       Patent reform is essential legislation: enactment will spur \n     innovation creating jobs and ensure that the Patent and \n     Trademark Office (PTO) has the tools necessary to maintain \n     our patent system as the best in the world. We strongly \n     support the improved re-examination procedures in H.R. 1249, \n     which will allow the experts at PTO to review low-quality \n     business-method patents against the best prior art. Equally \n     important, the bill provides the PTO with increased and \n     predictable funding. This certainty is absolutely critical if \n     the PTO is to properly allocate resources and hire and retain \n     the expertise necessary to benefit the entire user-community.\n       This bill has been nearly a decade in the making and is \n     supported by a vast cross-section of all types of inventors \n     and businesses. It is time to send patent reform to the \n     President for signature, and we strongly encourage the Senate \n     to take up and pass H.R. 1249 without delay.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Bankers Association, American Council of Life \n           Insurers, American Financial Services Association, \n           American Insurance Association, The Clearing House \n           Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Credit Union \n           National Association, The Financial Services \n           Roundtable, The Independent Community Bankers of \n           America, Mortgage Bankers Association, National \n           Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, Property \n           Casualty Insurers Association of America, Securities \n           Industry and Financial Markets Association.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to respond to my chairman's \ncomments. First of all, what we have proposed came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the House 32 to 3. In other words, only three people on \nthe Judiciary Committee in the House objected to this.\n  The other point I wish to make is the letter from Chairman Rogers \ndoes not bind the next Appropriations Committee chairman. I think \neverybody would agree with that. It only binds him and it only binds \nhim as long as he honors his commitment. I have no doubt he will honor \nhis commitment as long as he is chairman.\n  The third point I wish to make is what the House has set up doesn't \nmake sure the funds go to the PTO, it just means they can't go \nsomewhere else. That is what they have set up. They do not have to \nallow all the funds collected to go to the PTO. So they can reserve \n$200 million or $300 million a year and put it over there in a reserve \nfund and send it to the Treasury which will cause us to borrow less, \nbut the money won't necessarily go to the PTO. There is nothing that \nmandates the fees collected go to the Patent and Trademark Office.\n  I understand my chairman. I understand his frustration with trying to \nget this bill through, and I understand that he sees this as a \ncompromise. I don't. I understand we are going to differ on that and \nagree to disagree.\n  With that, I yield the floor to allow the chairman to speak, and I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator. I reserve the remainder of my time \nand suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Flooding in Vermont\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to pick up on a point the senior \nSenator from Vermont made earlier today. Both he and I have had the \nopportunity to travel throughout the State of Vermont to visit many of \nour towns which have been devastated by one of the worst natural \ndisasters in our State's history.\n  We have seen in the southern part of the State--in Wilmington, for \nexample--the entire business district severely damaged. I have seen in \ncentral Vermont a mobile home park almost completely wiped out, with \npeople who are in their eighties and are now having to look to find new \nplaces in which to live. I have seen a public housing project for \nseniors in Brattleboro severely damaged. A lot of seniors there are now \nhaving to find new places to live. We have seen the State office \ncomplex in Waterbury--the largest State office building in the State, \nhousing 1,700 Vermont workers, the nerve center of the State--\ndevastated. Nobody is at work there today.\n  We have seen hundreds of bridges and roads destroyed, and right now, \nas we speak, there are rains coming in the southern part of the State, \ncausing more flooding, more damage. We have seen a wonderful gentleman \nfrom Rutland lose his life because he was doing his job to make sure \nthe people of that area were protected. So we have seen damage the \nlikes of which we have never seen in our lifetime.\n  What I would say--and I know I speak for the senior Senator from \nVermont as well--is that our country is the United States of America--\nthe United States of America. What that means is we are a nation such \nthat when disaster strikes in Louisiana or Mississippi in terms of \nHurricane Katrina--I know the Presiding Officer remembers the \noutpouring of support from Vermont for the people in that region. All \nof our hearts went out to the people in Joplin, MO, when that community \nsuffered an incredible tornado that took 150 or so lives and devastated \nthat city. What America is about and what a nation is about is that \nwhen disaster hits one part of the country, we unite as a nation to \ngive support to\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\nhelp those communities, those businesses, those homeowners who have \nbeen hurt get back on their feet.\n  I know the senior Senator from Vermont has made this point many \ntimes: Right now we are spending billions of dollars rebuilding \ncommunities in Afghanistan and Iraq. Well, I think I speak for the vast \nmajority of the people in this country and in my State of Vermont that \nif we can spend billions rebuilding communities in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, we surely can rebuild communities in Vermont, New Jersey, \nNorth Carolina, and other parts of the United States of America that \nhave been devastated by Hurricane Irene.\n  I think as a body, as a Congress, the House and Senate have to work \nas expeditiously as we can to come up with the funds to help rebuild \nall of the communities that have been so severely damaged by this \nterrible flood. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make \nthat happen.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the America Invents Act was first \nconsidered by the Senate last March, I spoke about the contributions \nVermonters have made to innovation in America since the founding of our \nNation. The distinguished Presiding Officer and I know about what \nVermont has done. I wish to remind everybody that from the first patent \never issued by our government to cutting-edge research and inventions \nproduced today Vermonters have been at the forefront of innovation \nsince the Nation's birth.\n  Many may think of our Green Mountain State as being an unlikely \nhotbed of innovation, but we have actually over the last few years \nissued the most patents per capita of any State in the country--\nactually more patents than a lot of States that are larger than we are. \nIt is a small State, to be sure, but it is one that is bursting with \ncreativity.\n  The rich history of the inventive spirit of Vermont is long and \ndiverse. Vermonters throughout have pursued innovations from the time \nof the Industrial Revolution to the computer age. Vermont inventors \ndiscovered new ways to weigh large objects as well as ways to enjoy the \noutdoors. They have perfected new ways to traverse rivers and more \nenvironmentally friendly ways to live in our homes. Over the years, as \nAmerica has grown and prospered, Vermont's innovative and creative \nspirit has made the lives of all Americans better and possibly made \nthem more productive. The patent system in this country has been the \ncatalyst that spurred these inventors to take the risks necessary to \nbring these ideas to the marketplace.\n  The story of innovation in Vermont is truly the American story. It \nhas been driven by independent inventors and small businesses taking \nchances on new ideas. A strong patent system allowed these ideas to \nflourish and brought our country unprecedented economic growth. These \nsame kinds of inventors exist in Vermont today, as they do throughout \nour great country.\n\n  But these inventors need to be assured that the patent system that \nserved those who came before them so well can do the same today. The \nAmerica Invents Act will provide that assurance for years to come.\n  My distinguished colleague from Vermont and I have both spoken \nseveral times on the Senate floor since the Senate came back in session \nabout the devastation in Vermont. I cannot help but think of the \ndevastation that Irene has caused in so many of our communities at \nhome. Just as Senator Sanders and Congressman Welch and Governor \nShumlin, I have seen the damage and heartbreak firsthand. But I also \nsaw the fruits of innovation that will help bring recovery to \ncommunities throughout Vermont: the heavy machinery that helped to \nclear debris and that will build our roads and our bridges and our \nhomes; the helicopters that brought food and water to stranded \nresidents; and the bottles that allowed safe drinking water to reach \nthem.\n  The American patent system has helped to develop and refine countless \ntechnologies that drive our country in times of prosperity but also in \ntimes of tragedy. It is critical we ensure that this system remains the \nbest in the world.\n  Vermont and the rest of the country deserve the world's best patent \nsystem. The innovators of the past had exactly that, but we can ensure \nthat the innovators who are among us today and those who will come in \nsucceeding generations will have it as well by passing the America \nInvents Act.\n  I am proud of the inventive contributions that Vermonters have made \nsince the founding of this country. I hope to honor their legacy. I \nhope to inspire the next generation by securing the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I have been here for a number of years, but this is one of those \nhistoric moments. The patent system is one of the few things enshrined \nin our Constitution, but it is also something that has not been updated \nfor over half a century. We can do that. We can do that today with our \nvote. We can complete this bill. We can send it to the President. The \nPresident has assured me he will sign it. We will make America \nstronger. We will create jobs. We will have a better system. And it \nwill not cost American taxpayers anything.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, regarding the parliamentary situation, \nhow much time remains for Senator Cantwell?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes remains.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding that Senator Cantwell wants to \npreserve a component of that, so I would, on behalf of Senator \nCantwell, yield myself 5 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 600\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of our friend \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions, regarding his amendment to strike \nsection 37 of the patent reform bill, but I disagree with him on \nsubstantive terms, and I ask our colleagues to look carefully at the \nsubstance of this amendment and the importance of this amendment with \nrespect to precedent not for one company from Massachusetts or for one \nentity but for companies all over the country and for the application \nof patent law as it ought to be applied.\n  The only thing section 37 does--the only thing--is it codifies what a \nFederal district court has already said and implements what the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office is already doing. There is no breaking of \nnew ground here. This is codifying a Federal district court, codifying \nwhat the Patent Office has done, and, in fact, codifying common sense. \nIt is putting into effect what is the right decision with respect to \nhow we treat patents in our country.\n  Section 37 is, in fact, a very important clarification of a currently \nconfusing deadline for filing patent term extension applications under \nthe Hatch-Waxman Act. Frankly, this is a clarification, I would say to \nthe Senator from Alabama, that benefits everybody in the country. In \nfact, this is a clarification which has already been put into effect \nfor other types of patents that were once upon a time treated with the \nsame anomaly. They rectified that. They haven't rectified it with \nrespect to this particular section of patent law.\n  So all we are doing is conforming to appropriate law, conforming to \nthe standards the Patent Office applies, and conforming for all \ncompanies in the country, for any company that might be affected \nsimilarly. If this were a bailout for a single firm or a pharmaceutical \ncompany, as some have tried to suggest it might be, why in the world \ndid a similar provision previously get reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee by a vote of 14 to 2? How in the world could this \nprovision have then passed the House of Representatives as it did? And \nwhy would many House Republicans have supported it as they did? The \nanswer is very simple: Because it is the right thing to do under the \nlaw and under the common sense of how we want patents treated in the \nfiling process.\n  The law as currently written, frankly, was being wrongly applied by \nthe Patent and Trademark Office. And you don't have to take my word for \nthat; that is what a Federal court has said on more than one occasion. \nEach time, the court has ruled that it was the Patent and Trademark \nOffice, not an individual firm called WilmerHale or Medicines Company--\nnot those two--that made a mistake.\n  Let me make that very clear so the record is as clear as it can be. \nThe current law as it is written says that ``to obtain an extension of \nthe term of a patent under this section, the owner of record of the \npatent or its agent shall submit an application to the Director. . . . \nSuch an application may be only submitted within the sixty-day period \nbeginning on the date the product received permission'' under the \nappropriate provision of law.\n  Now, the FDA reasonably interprets this language to mean that if \nsomething is received after the close of business on a given business \nday, it is deemed to be received the next business day. Under this \ninterpretation, the filing by the Medicines Company was indisputably \ntimely.\n  So my colleagues should not come to the floor and take away from \nentities that are trying to compete and be in the marketplace over some \ntechnicality: the suggestion that because something was filed \nelectronically on a particular given day at 5 o'clock in the afternoon \nwhen people had gone home--they weren't open--that somehow they deem \nthat not to have been appropriately filed.\n  But rather than accept that commonsense interpretation, the Patent \nand Trademark Office told the Medicines Company it was late. They just \ndecided that. They said: You are late, despite the fact that \ninterpretation contradicted the same-business-day rule the FDA uses \nwhen interpreting the very same statute. So as a result, the issue went \nto court, and guess what. The court told the PTO it was wrong. A \nFederal judge found that the Patent Office and FDA had been applying \ninconsistent interpretations of the exact same statutory language in \nthe Hatch-Waxman Act. The FDA uses one interpretation that has the \neffect of extending its own internal deadlines, but the PTO insisted on \nusing a different interpretation. The result was a ``heads I win, tails \nyou lose.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. For companies investing in innovative medicines, the court \nfound that the PTO failed to provide any plausible explanation for this \ninconsistent approach. It further found that the PTO's interpretation \nhad the effect of depriving applicants of a portion of their time for \nfiling an application.\n  After considering all the relevant factors, the court adopted the \nFDA's interpretation. So the court told the PTO that they were wrong \nand it was they, and not the Medicines Company, who made a mistake.\n  So this is not an earmark. It isn't, as Senator Sessions contends, a \nsingle-company bailout. It is a codification of a court ruling. It is a \nclarification. It is common sense. It puts a sensible court decision \ninto legislative language, and it is legislative language that applies \nto all companies across the country equally. It doesn't single out any \nparticular company but amends the patent law for the benefit of all \napplicants.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the Sessions amendment on the merits. \nMore importantly, we need to move forward with this important bill on \nwhich Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley have worked so hard. Passing \nthe Sessions amendment would stop that. It would require a House-Senate \nconference on the bill, and it would at best seriously delay and at \nworst make it impossible to exact patent reform during this Congress. \nSo\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\nthis is, on the merits, for all companies. This is common sense. This \nis current law. This is current practice. So I ask my colleagues \naccordingly to vote appropriately.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to the votes in relation to the amendments and passage of H.R. \n1249, the America Invents Act, with all other provisions of the \nprevious order remaining in effect; that the final 10 minutes of debate \nbe equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee or their designees, with the chairman controlling \nthe final 5 minutes; further, that there be 4 minutes equally divided \nbetween proponents and opponents prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of Senator \nCantwell's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I inquire of the Chair how much time remains for me \nto speak before getting to the last order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\n\n                            Texas Wildfires\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to speak for about 4\\1/2\\ minutes \non the natural disasters that have been confronting our Nation and in \nparticular Texas, where the State has had about 3\\1/2\\ million acres of \nland burned, with many people now finding themselves literally homeless \nas a result of fires that many of my colleagues have seen on TV or \nwatched on the Internet but which, frankly, do not capture the scale of \nthe devastation.\n  Just to give you an idea of the scope of this natural disaster, so \nfar, in 2011, more than 18,000 wildfires have been reported in the \nState. As I mentioned, it has burned an area roughly the size of \nConnecticut. Nearly 2,900 structures have been lost and, unfortunately, \nthere has also been a loss of life in these fires, as well as 5,000 \nTexans have now been evacuated from their homes. Unfortunately, these \nfires have been a feature of life in parts of Texas for most of the \nyear because we are in the middle of a historic drought where, because \nof La Nina, the weather pattern, we have had an abnormally dry year, \nand, indeed, it has caused more than $5 billion of agricultural losses \nalone as a result of that drought.\n  I have not only seen some of the devastation myself before I left \nAustin, but I have also talked to a number of people on the ground who \nare well informed.\n  Representative Tim Kleinschmidt, who represents the Texas district \neast of Austin in sort of the Bastrop area, told me that as many as \n1,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in that area and have \nbeen living in shelters since Sunday. Water and electricity are also \ndown in many areas, and the wind has unfortunately swept the fire into \nother areas and now is only about 30 percent contained.\n  I have also talked to some of our other local leaders, our county \njudges, such as Grimes County judge Betty Shiflett, who told me that \nwhile they have no unmet needs right now, they are very concerned about \nthe threat to life and property and are working as hard as they can to \ncontain the fires.\n  I have also talked to our outstanding chief of the Texas Department \nof Emergency Management and the Director of the Texas Forest Service \nwho tell me that as many as 2,000 Americans from places other than \nTexas have come to the State to help fight these fires and help protect \nproperty and life.\n  We have had a good Federal response to one extent, and that is the \nU.S. Forest Service has provided planes, bulldozers, and other \nequipment. Unfortunately, we have seen the White House so far not \nextend the disaster declaration beyond the original 52 counties \napproved for FEMA assistance on May 3. I should say that assistance ran \nout on May 3, more than 4 months ago. Suffice it to say, the disaster \ndeclaration should be extended to cover the rest of the State, at least \n200 more Texas counties that need Federal assistance.\n  I am informed from reading the newspaper that President Obama reached \nout to Governor Perry yesterday to extend his condolences. But, \nfrankly, more than condolences, what we need are the resources to help \nfight these fires to deal with the disaster and to help get people back \ninto their homes as soon as possible.\n  I would just say in conclusion, Madam President, that the majority \nleader has raised the question of whether disaster relief should be \npaid for or whether it should be borrowed money. I come down on the \nside of believing that we can't keep borrowing money we don't have. \nThat is what the American people keep telling us. That is what the last \nelection was all about. That is what the financial markets are telling \nus, and I believe the American people believe we have plenty of money \nin the Federal Government for Congress to do its job by setting \npriorities and funding those priorities.\n  I believe emergency assistance to the people who have been hit \nhardest by these natural disasters is one of those priorities. We \nshould fund it instead of funding wasteful spending and duplicative \nprograms and engaging in failed Keynesian stimulus schemes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               Section 5\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, a significant change contained in H.R. \n1249 from S. 23, the version of the bill debated and overwhelmingly \npassed by the Senate earlier this year, is the inclusion of the defense \nof prior commercial use against infringement of a later granted patent. \nSpecifically, section 5 of H.R. 1249 creates a prior user right for \nprocesses, or machines, or compositions of matter used in a \nmanufacturing or other commercial process, that would otherwise \ninfringe a claimed invention if: (1) the person commercially used the \nsubject matter in the United States, either in connection with an \ninternal commercial use or an actual arm's length sale or other arm's \nlength commercial transfer of a useful end result of such commercial \nuse; and (2) the commercial use occurred at least one year before the \nearlier of either the effective filing date of the claimed invention or \nthe date on which the claimed invention was disclosed to the public in \na manner that qualified as an exception from prior art.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary \nknows, such prior user rights, if properly crafted and understood, can \nbe of great benefit to keeping high paying jobs in this country by \ngiving U.S. companies a realistic option of keeping internally used \ntechnologies as trade secrets.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my colleague and friend from Missouri is \ncorrect Prior user rights, if properly crafted and asserted, can be of \ngreat benefit to keeping high-paying jobs here at home.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my good friend. A robust prior user right is not \nneeded in today's first-to-invent regime. This is because, if a prior-\nuser was sued for infringement, the patent could be invalidated under \nsection 102(g)(2) because the prior-user was the first-to-invent. \nHowever, should H.R. 1249's first-to-file system become law, the prior \ninvention bar to patentability under section 102(g)(2) will be \neliminated. This switch to first-to-file then presents the question of \nwhether a non-patent-filing manufacturer should be given some prior \nuser rights that would continue to allow these non-patented internal \nuses. Section 5 of H.R. 1249 attempts to settle the question by \ngranting prior user rights but only when the prior use is for certain \n``commercial'' uses.\n  The prior user rights provided under section 5 of H.R. 1249 will \nallow developers of innovative technologies to keep internally used \ntechnologies in-house without publication in a patent. This will help \nU.S. industry to keep jobs at home and provide a basis for restoring \nand maintaining a technology competitive edge for the U.S. economy. For \nthese reasons, I believe the Senate should support this valuable \naddition to the America Invents Act and I applaud the leadership of my \nfriend from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BLUNT. However, as noted a moment ago, the utility of the prior \nuser defense is linked to its clarity surrounding its scope and its \nlimitations. Many innovative companies may be reticent to opt for the \nprotection of prior user rights for fear that the defense may not stand \nagainst a charge of infringement by a later patent owner who sues for \ninfringement. Many innovators may feel the need to rush to\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nthe patent office in order to assure their long term freedom to \noperate. I do not need to belabor my colleagues with the attendant \nbenefit the publication of patents provides to global competitors who \nare not respectful of intellectual property rights.\n  The reason for this detrimental reliance on patents for internal \ntechnology is that the utility and reliability of section 5 is \ndependent on the prior use being an ``internal commercial use''--a term \nfor which there is no readily available judicial precedent. Should \nsection 5 of H.R. 1249 become law, an innovator and his legal counsel \nneed some reasonable assurance that an internal use will, in fact, be \ndeemed to be a commercial use protectable under the law. These \nassurances are all the more important for U.S. companies in the \nbiotechnology field with extraordinarily long lead times for \ncommercialization of its products. Does my colleague from Vermont \nunderstand the concern I am raising?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will say to my good friend that he is \nnot the first to raise this issue with me and the other Members of the \nHouse and Senate Judiciary Committees who have worked on this bill. I \nhave discussed section 5 at length with the distinguished House \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith. Perhaps I can help provide \nsome of the needed clarity for my colleague concerning what we intend \nto be within the confines of the definition of ``internal commercial \nuse'' as it is used in section 5 of the bill.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my colleague for his willingness to discuss this \nmatter here on the floor of the Senate. It is my reading of the bill's \nlanguage under section 5 that prior use rights shall vest when \ninnovative technology is first put into continuous internal use in the \nbusiness of the enterprise with the objective of developing \ncommercializable products. Does the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nshare this understanding?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. My colleague and I are in agreement that it is our \nintention, as the sponsors of this comprehensive measure, that the \nprior use right set forth in section 5 of H.R. 1249 shall vest when \ninnovative technology is first put into continuous internal use in the \nbusiness of an innovator's enterprise with the objective of making a \ncommercializable product.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my colleague from Vermont. If he would permit me \nto clarify this matter further. Am I correct in understanding that, so \nlong as that use begins more than 1 year prior to the effective filing \ndate of a subsequent patent or publication by a later inventor, the \ninitiation of continuous internal use by an original innovator in a \nmanufacturing of a product should guarantee the defense of prior use \nregardless of whether the product is a prototype with a need for \nquality improvements?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my colleague for the question. His understanding \nis correct. So long as the prior use begins more than 1 year prior to \nthe effective filing date of a subsequent patent or publication by a \nlater inventor, the initiation of continuous internal use in the \nmanufacture of products should guarantee the defense of prior use.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my colleague. Let me illustrate by showing the \nimpact of the ambivalence of the statutory language on agricultural \nresearch which is a major industry not only in Midwestern States like \nMissouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Illinois, but in States ranging from \nCalifornia to Connecticut from Texas to Minnesota from North Carolina \nto Idaho. Virtually every State in this Union has an investment in \nagricultural research. The productivity of U.S. farmers provides a \nsignificant positive input to the U.S. balance of trade due in large \npart to the high technology adopted by U.S. farmers. That high \ntechnology is provided from multiple sources ranging from research at \nland grant universities, the USDA and private for-profit companies all \nof whom have internal technology that provides a competitive edge for \nmaintaining agricultural competitive advantage for the U.S. economy.\n  To specifically illustrate let us consider that U.S. researchers are \nleading the world in discovering genetic markers that are associated \nwith important agronomic traits which serves as breeding production \ntools. Instead of teaching foreign competitors these production tools, \na preferred alternative may be to rely on prior user rights for such \ninnovative crop breeding technology which is used in the manufacture of \nnew plant varieties although the use may only occur once a year after \neach growing season and for many years to selectively manufacture a \nperfected crop product that is sold.\n  As another example let us consider an innovation in making potential \nnew genetically modified products all of which need years of testing to \nverify their viability, repeatabilty and commercial value. Of the \nthousands of new potential prototype products made, only a few may \nsurvive initial screening to begin years of field trials. We should \nagree that a continuously used process qualifies as internal commercial \nuse despite the fact that many prototypes will fail to have commercial \nmerit.\n  As my examples illustrate, for section 5 to have its intended \nbenefit, internal commercial use must vest when an innovator reduces \ntechnology to practice and takes diligent steps to maintain continuous, \nregular commercial use of the technology in manufacturing operations of \nthe enterprise.\n  Mr. LEAHY. My colleague is correct in his reasoning and his \nunderstanding of what is intended by section 5. The methods used by \nEdison in producing multiple failures for electric light bulbs were no \nless commercial uses before the ultimate production of a commercially \nsuccessful light bulb. Let us agree that internally used methods and \nmaterials do qualify for the defense of prior user rights when there is \nevidence of a commitment to put the innovation into use followed by a \nseries of diligent events demonstrating that the innovation has been \nput into continuous--into a business activity with a purpose of \ndeveloping new products for the benefit of mankind.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                               Section 5\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I have long supported reforming our patent \nsystem and was pleased with the bill the Senate passed in March. It was \nnot what everyone wanted, but it was an effective compromise that would \nspur innovation and economic growth. I am disappointed with changes the \nHouse made to the bill, specifically the expansion of the ``prior user \nrights'' defense a provision which raises serious concerns for the \nUniversity of Wisconsin's patent licensing organization which fosters \ninnovative discoveries, spawning dozens of small businesses and \nspurring economic growth in Wisconsin.\n  Let me explain why. A patent grants an innovator the right to exclude \nothers from using an invention in exchange for making that invention \npublic. The publication of patents and the research behind them advance \nfurther innovation and discovery. Anyone who uses the invention without \npermission is liable for infringement, and someone who was using the \ninvention prior to the patent has only a limited defense for \ninfringement. The purpose of limiting this defense to infringement is \nto encourage publication and disclosure of inventions to foster \ninnovation. So by expanding the prior user defense we run the real risk \nof discouraging disclosure through the patent system. This is \nconcerning to the University of Wisconsin because they depend on \npublication and disclosure to further research and innovation.\n  I appreciate the inclusion of a carve-out to the prior user rights \ndefense provision so that it does not apply to patents owned by a \nuniversity ``or a technology transfer organization whose primary \npurpose is to facilitate the commercialization of technologies \ndeveloped by one or more such institutions of higher education.'' \nHowever, I have some concerns about how the carve out will work in \npractice and I would like to clarify its application.\n  It is my understanding that the term ``primary purpose'' in this \nexception is intended to be consistent with and have a similar scope as \nthe ``primary functions'' language in the Bayh-Dole Act. In particular, \nif a nonprofit entity is entitled to receive assignment of inventions \npursuant to section 207(c)(7) of title 35 because one of its primary \nfunctions is the management of inventions, presumably it falls under \nthe primary purpose prong of the prior user rights exception. Is that \nthe Senator's understanding of the provision?\n  Mr LEAHY. The senior Senator from Wisconsin is correct. That is also \nmy\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nview of the exception. I understand the Senator has consistently \nopposed the expansion of prior user rights, but I agree with his \nanalysis of the scope of the exception in section 5 of H.R. 1249.\n\n\n                               Section 18\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would like to ask my colleague from Vermont, the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee and lead sponsor of the America \nInvents Act before us today, to further clarify an issue relating to \nSection 18 of that legislation. Ideally, I would have liked to modify \nthe Section 18 process in accordance with the Cantwell amendment. It is \nof crucial importance to me that we clarify the intent of the process \nand implement it as narrowly as possible.\n  As I understand it, Section 18 is intended to enable the PTO to weed \nout improperly issued patents for abstract methods of doing business. \nConversely, I understand that Section 18 is not intended to allow \nowners of valid patents to be harassed or subjected to the substantial \ncost and uncertainty of the untested review process established \ntherein. Yet I have heard concerns that Section 18 would allow just \nsuch harassment because it enables review of patents whose claims have \nbeen found valid both through previous reexaminations by the PTO and \njury trials. In my mind, patent claims that have withstood multiple \nadministrative and judiciary reviews should be considered presumptively \nvalid. It would not only be unfair to the patent holder but would be a \nwaste of both PTO's time and resources to subject such presumptively \nvalid patent claims to yet another administrative review. It would be \nparticularly wasteful and injurious to legitimate patent holders if the \n``transitional review'' only considered prior art that was already \nconsidered in the previous administrative or judicial proceedings. Can \nthe Chairman enlighten me as to how the PTO will ensure that the \n``transitional process'' does not become a tool to harass owners of \nvalid patents that have survived multiple administrative and judicial \nreviews''?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The proceeding created by Section 18 is modeled on the \nproposed post-grant review proceeding under Section 6 of the Act. As in \nother post-grant proceedings, the claims should typically be evaluated \nto determine whether they, among other things, meet the enablement and \nwritten description requirements of the act, and contain patentable \nsubject matter under the standards defined in the statutes, case law, \nand as explained in relevant USPTO guidance. While the program will \ngenerally otherwise function on the same terms as other post-grant \nproceedings, the USPTO should implement Section 18 in a manner that \navoids attempts to use the transitional program against patent owners \nin a harassing way. Specifically, to initiate a post issuance review \nunder the new post grant or transitional proceedings, it is not enough \nthat the request show a substantial new question of patentability but \nmust establish that ``it is more likely than not that at least 1 of the \nclaims challenged in the petition is unpatentable.'' The heightened \nrequirement established by this bill means that these proceedings are \neven better shielded from abuse than the reexamination proceedings have \nbeen. In fact, the new higher standard for post issuance review was \ncreated to make it even more difficult for these procedures to be used \nas tools for harassment. Therefore, the rule that bars the PTO from \nreconsidering issues previously considered during examination or in an \nearlier reexamination still applies. While a prior district court \ndecision upholding the validity of a patent may not preclude the PTO \nfrom considering the same issues resolved in that proceeding, PTO \nofficials must still consider the court's decision and deviate from its \nfindings only to the extent reasonable. As a result, I expect the USPTO \nwould not initiate proceedings where the petition does not raise a \nsubstantial new question of patentability than those that had already \nbeen considered by the USPTO in earlier proceedings. Does that answer \nmy colleague's question?''\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank my colleague for that explanation.\n\n\n                               Section 18\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to clarify an issue with my colleague from \nNew York, who is the author of Section 18. Legislative history created \nduring earlier consideration of this legislation makes clear that the \nbusiness method patent problem that Section 18 is intended to address \nis fundamentally an issue of patent quality. Does the Senator agree \nthat poor quality business method patents generally do not arise from \nthe operation of American companies who use business method patents to \ndevelop and sell products and employ American workers in doing so?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My friend from Illinois is correct. I have previously \ninserted into the Record a March 3 letter from the Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America which stated that ``Under the current \nsystem, business method patents of questionable quality are used to \nforce community banks to pay meritless settlements to entities that may \nhave patents assigned to them, but who have invented nothing, offer no \nproduct or service and employ no one.  . . . The Schumer-Kyl amendment \nis critical to stopping this economic harm.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I want to point out that there are a \nnumber of examples of companies that employ hundreds or thousands of \nAmerican workers in developing and commercializing financial sector \nproducts that are based on business method patents. For example, some \ncompanies that possess patents categorized by the PTO as class 705 \nbusiness method patents have used the patents to develop novel software \ntools and graphical user interfaces that have been widely \ncommercialized and used within the electronic trading industry to \nimplement trading and asset allocation strategies. Additionally, there \nare companies that possess class 705 patents which have used the \npatents to manufacture and commercialize novel machinery to count, \nsort, and authenticate currency and paper instruments. Are these the \ntypes of patents that are the target of Section 18?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No. Patent holders who have generated productive \ninventions and have provided large numbers of American workers with \ngood jobs through the development and commercialization of those \npatents are not the ones that have created the business method patent \nproblem. While merely having employees and conducting business would \nnot disqualify a patent-holder from Section 18 review, generally \nspeaking, it is not the understanding of Congress that such patents \nwould be reviewed and invalidated under Section 18.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, today, I rise to discuss section 18 of \nH.R. 1249, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. Consistent with the \nstatement in the Record by Chairman Lamar Smith on June 23, 2011, I \nunderstand that section 18 will not make all business method patents \nsubject to review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Rather, \nsection 18 is designed to address the problem of low-quality business \nmethod patents that are commonly associated with the Federal circuit's \n1998 State Street decision. I further understand that section 18 of the \nbill specifically exempts ``patents for technological inventions'' from \nthis new review at USPTO.\n  Patents for technological inventions are those patents whose novelty \nturns on a technological innovation over the prior art and are \nconcerned with a technical problem which is solved with a technical \nsolution. The technological innovation exception does not exclude a \npatent from section 18 simply because it recites technology. Inventions \nrelated to manufacturing and machines that do not simply use known \ntechnology to accomplish a novel business process would be excluded \nfrom review under section 18.\n  For example, section 18 would not cover patents related to the \nmanufacture and distribution of machinery to count, sort, and \nauthenticate currency. It is the intention of section 18 to not review \nmechanical inventions related to the manufacture and distribution of \nmachinery to count, sort, and authenticate currency like change sorters \nand machines that scan paper instruments, including currency, whose \nnovelty turns on a technological innovation over the prior art. These \ntypes of patents would not be eligible for review under this program.\n  American innovation is an important engine for job growth and our \neconomic revitalization. To this end, the timely consideration of \npatent applications and the issuance of quality patents are critical \ncomponents and should remain\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nthe primary goal of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise today to say a few words about \naspects of the present bill that differ from the bill that passed the \nSenate in March. I commented at length on the Senate bill when that \nbill was before this body. Since the present bill and the Senate bill \nare largely identical, I will not repeat what I said previously, but \nwill simply refer to my previous remarks, at 157 Cong. Rec. 1368-80, \ndaily ed. March 8, 2011, which obviously apply to the present bill as \nwell.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Smith negotiated his bill with Senators \nLeahy, Grassley, and me as he moved the bill through the House of \nRepresentatives. The final House bill thus represents a compromise, one \nwhich the Senate supporters of patent reform have agreed to support in \nthe Senate. The provisions that Mr. Smith has added to the bill are \nones that we have all had an opportunity to consider and discuss, and \nwhich I fully support.\n  Section 19(d) of the present bill adds a new section 299 to title 35. \nThis new section bars joinder of accused infringers as codefendants, or \nconsolidation of their cases for trial, if the only common fact and \ntransaction among the defendants is that they are alleged to have \ninfringed the same patent. This provision effectively codifies current \nlaw as it has been applied everywhere outside of the Eastern District \nof Texas. See Rudd v. Lux Products Corp., 2011 WL 148052. (N.D. Ill. \nJanuary 12, 2011), and the committee report for this bill at pages 54 \nthrough 55.\n  H.R. 1249 as introduced applied only to joinder of defendants in one \naction. As amended in the mark up and in the floor managers' amendment, \nthe bill extends the limit on joinder to also bar consolidation of \ntrials of separate actions. When this change was first proposed, I was \nskeptical that it was necessary. A review of legal authority, however, \nreveals that under current law, even if parties cannot be joined as \ndefendants under rule 20, their cases can still be consolidated for \ntrial under rule 42. For example, as the district court held in Ohio v. \nLouis Trauth Dairy, Inc., 163 F.R.D. 500, 503 (S.D. Ohio 1995), \n``[e]ven when actions are improperly joined, it is sometimes proper to \nconsolidate them for trial.'' The same conclusion was reached by the \ncourt in Kenvin v. Newburger, Loeb & Co., 37 F.R.D. 473 (S.D.N.Y. \n1965), which ordered severance because of misjoinder of parties, \nconcluding that the claims against the defendants did not arise out of \nsingle transaction or occurrence, but then suggested the desirability \nof a joint trial, and expressly made its severance order without \nprejudice to a subsequent motion for consolidation under rule 42(a). \nSimilarly, in Stanford v. TVA, 18 F.R.D. 152 (M.D. Tenn. 1955), a court \nfound that the defendants had been misjoined, since the claims arose \nout of independent transactions, and ordered them severed. The court \nsubsequently found, however, that a common question existed and ordered \nthe defendants' cases consolidated for trial.\n  That these cases are not just outliers is confirmed by Federal \nPractice and Procedure, which comments as follows at Sec. 2382:\n\n       Although as a general proposition it is true that Rule \n     42(a) should be construed in harmony with the other civil \n     rules, it would be a mistake to assume that the standard for \n     consolidation is the same as that governing the original \n     joinder of parties or claims. . . . [M]ore than one party can \n     be joined on a side under Rule 20(a) only if there is \n     asserted on behalf of or against all of them one or more \n     claims for relief arising out of the same transaction or \n     occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences. This is \n     in addition to the requirement that there be some question of \n     law or fact common to all the parties. But the existence of a \n     common question by itself is enough to permit consolidation \n     under Rule 42(a), even if the claims arise out of independent \n     transactions.\n\n  If a court that was barred from joining defendants in one action \ncould instead simply consolidate their cases for trial under rule 42, \nsection 299's purpose of allowing unrelated patent defendants to insist \non being tried separately would be undermined. Section 299 thus adopts \na common standard for both joinder of defendants and consolidation of \ntheir cases for trial.\n  Another set of changes made by the House bill concerns the \ncoordination of inter partes and postgrant review with civil \nlitigation. The Senate bill, at proposed sections 315(a) and 325(a), \nwould have barred a party or his real party in interest from seeking or \nmaintaining an inter partes or postgrant review after he has filed a \ndeclaratory-judgment action challenging the validity of the patent. The \nfinal bill will still bar seeking IPR or PGR after a declaratory-\njudgment action has been filed, but will allow a declaratory-judgment \naction to be filed on the same day or after the petition for IPR or PGR \nwas filed. Such a declaratory-judgment action, however, will be \nautomatically stayed by the court unless the patent owner countersues \nfor infringement. The purpose of allowing the declaratory-judgment \naction to be filed is to allow the accused infringer to file the first \naction and thus be presumptively entitled to his choice of venue.\n\n  The House bill also extends the deadline for allowing an accused \ninfringer to seek inter partes review after he has been sued for \ninfringement. The Senate bill imposed a 6-month deadline on seeking IPR \nafter the patent owner has filed an action for infringement. The final \nbill extends this deadline, at proposed section 315(b), to 1 year. \nHigh-technology companies, in particular, have noted that they are \noften sued by defendants asserting multiple patents with large numbers \nof vague claims, making it difficult to determine in the first few \nmonths of the litigation which claims will be relevant and how those \nclaims are alleged to read on the defendant's products. Current law \nimposes no deadline on seeking inter partes reexamination. And in light \nof the present bill's enhanced estoppels, it is important that the \nsection 315(b) deadline afford defendants a reasonable opportunity to \nidentify and understand the patent claims that are relevant to the \nlitigation. It is thus appropriate to extend the section 315(b) \ndeadline to one year.\n  The final bill also extends intervening rights to inter partes and \npost-grant review. The bill does not allow new matter to be introduced \nto support claims in IPR and PGR and does not allow broadening of \nclaims in those proceedings. The aspect of intervening rights that is \nrelevant to IPR and PGR is section 252, first paragraph, which provides \nthat damages accrue only from the date of the conclusion of review if \nclaim scope has been substantively altered in the proceeding. This \nrestriction applies even if the amendment only narrowed the scope of \nthe claims. See Engineered Data Products, Inc. v. GBS Corp., 506 \nF.Supp.2d 461, 467 (D. Colo. 2007), which notes that ``the Federal \nCircuit has routinely applied the intervening rights defense to \nnarrowing amendments.'' When patent-defeating prior art is discovered, \nit is often impossible to predict whether that prior art will be found \nto render the entire invention obvious, or will only require a \nnarrowing amendment. When a challenger has discovered such prior art, \nand wants to practice the invention, intervening rights protect him \nagainst the risk of gong forward--provided, of course, that he is \ncorrect in his judgment that the prior art at least requires a \nsubstantive narrowing of claims.\n  The final bill also adds a new subsection to proposed section 257, \nwhich authorizes supplemental examination of patents. The new \nsubsection provides that the Director shall refer to the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral any ``material fraud'' on the Office that is discovered during \nthe course of a Supplemental Examination. Chairman Smith's explanation \nof this addition, at 157 Cong. Rec. E1182-83 (daily ed. June 23, 2011), \nclarifies the purpose and effect of this new provision. In light of his \nremarks, I find the addition unobjectionable. I would simply add to the \nChairman's remarks that, in evaluating whether a fraud is ``material'' \nfor purpose of referral, the Director should look to the Federal \nCircuit's decision in Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson and Co., \n__F.3d__, 2011 WL 2028255 (May 25, 2011). That case holds, in relevant \npart, that:\n\n       [T]he materiality required to establish inequitable conduct \n     is but-for materiality. When an applicant fails to disclose \n     prior art to the PTO, that prior art is but-for material if \n     the PTO would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of \n     the undisclosed prior art. Hence, in assessing the \n     materiality of a withheld reference, the court must determine \n     whether the PTO would have allowed the claim if it had been \n     aware of the undisclosed reference.\n\n  Finally, perhaps the most important change that the House of \nRepresentatives has made to the America Invents\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\nAct is the addition of a prior-commercial-use defense. Current law, at \nsection 273, creates a defense of prior-user rights that applies only \nwith respect to business-method patents. The final bill rewrites \nsection 273, creating a PCU defense that applies to all utility \npatents.\n  University researchers and their technology-transfer offices had \nearlier objected to the creation of such a defense. Their principal \nconcern was that the defense would lead to a morass of litigation over \nwhether an infringer was entitled to assert it, and the expense and \nburden of this litigation would ultimately prevent universities and \nsmall companies from enforcing valid patents. The compromise reached in \nthe House of Representatives addresses university concerns by requiring \na defendant to show that he commercially used the subject matter that \ninfringes the patent at least 1 year before the patent owner either \nfiled an application or disclosed the invention to the public. The \nHouse compromise also precludes assertion of the defense against most \nuniversity-owned patents.\n\n  The PCU defense is similar to the prior-user right that exists in the \nUnited Kingdom and Germany. The defense is a relatively narrow one. It \ndoes not create a general license with respect to the patented \ninvention, but rather only allows the defendant to keep making the \ninfringing commercial use that he establishes that he made 1 year \nbefore the patentee's filing or disclosure. The words ``subject \nmatter,'' as used in subsection (a), refer to the infringing acts of \nthe defendant, not to the entire patented invention. An exception to \nthis limit, which expands the defense beyond what would be allowed in \nthe United Kingdom, appears in subsection (e)(3), which allows the \ndefendant to increase the quantity or volume of the use that he \nestablishes that he made of the invention. Subsection (e)(3) also \nconfirms that the defendant may improve or otherwise modify his \nactivities in ways that do not further infringe the patent, although \none would think that this would go without saying.\n  The PCU defense is principally designed to protect the use of \nmanufacturing processes. For many manufacturing processes, the patent \nsystem presents a catch-22: if the manufacturer patents the process, he \neffectively discloses it to the world. But patents for processes that \nare used in closed factories are difficult to police. It is all but \nimpossible to know if someone in a factory in China is infringing such \na patent. As a result, unscrupulous foreign and domestic manufacturers \nwill simply use the invention in secret without paying licensing fees. \nPatenting such manufacturing processes effectively amounts to giving \naway the invention to competitors. On the other hand, if the U.S. \nmanufacturer does not patent the process, a subsequent party may obtain \na patent for it, and the U.S. manufacture will be forced to stop using \na process that he was the first to invent and which he has been using \nfor years.\n  The prior-commercial-use defense provides relief to U.S. \nmanufacturers from this Catch-22, allowing them to make long-term use \nof a manufacturing process without having to give it away to \ncompetitors or run the risk that it will be patented out from under \nthem.\n  Subsection (a) expands the defense beyond just processes to also \ncover products that are used in a manufacturing or other commercial \nprocess. Generally, products that are sold to consumers will not need a \nPCU defense over the long term. As soon as the product is sold to the \npublic, any invention that is embodied or otherwise inherent in that \nproduct becomes prior art and cannot be patented by another party, or \neven by the maker of the product after the grace period has expired. \nSome products, however, consist of tools or other devices that are used \nonly by the inventor inside his closed factory. Others consist of \nsubstances that are exhausted in a manufacturing process and never \nbecome accessible to the public. Such products will not become prior \nart. Revised section 273 therefore allows the defense to be asserted \nwith respect to such products.\n  The defense can also be asserted for products that are not used to \nmake a useful end result that is sold to others, but that are used in \nan internal commercial process. This would include, for example, \ncustomized software that is used to run a company's human-resources \nsystem. So long as use of the product is integrated into an ongoing \ncommercial process, and not merely fleeting or experimental or \nincidental to the enterprise's operations, the PCU defense can be \nasserted with respect to that product.\n  The present bill requires the defendant to commercially use the \ninvention in order to be able to assert the defense. Chairman Smith has \nsuggested, at 157 Cong. Rec. E1219 (daily ed. June 28, 2011), that in \nthe future Congress should expand the defense so that it also applies \nwhen a company has made substantial preparations to commercially use an \ninvention. Some have also suggested that the defense should be expanded \nto cover not just using, but also making and selling an invention if \nsubstantial preparations have been made to manufacture the invention. \nThis would expand the defense to more fully compensate for the repeal \nof current section 102(g), which allows a party to invalidate a patent \nasserted against it if the party can show that it had conceived of the \ninvention earlier and diligently proceeded to commercialize it.\n\n  On the one hand, universities and others have expressed concern that \na ``substantial preparations'' predicate for asserting the PCU defense \nwould lead to expensive and burdensome litigation over whether a \ncompany's activities reflect conception and diligent commercialization \nof the invention. Some argue that it is often the case that different \ncompanies and researchers are working on the same problem, and it is \neasy for the unsuccessful parties to later recharacterize their past \nefforts as capturing or diligently implementing the successful \nresearcher's invention. Questions have also arisen as to how tentative \npreparations may be and still qualify as ``substantial preparations.'' \nFor example, if a company had not broken ground for its factory, but \nhad commissioned an architect to draw up plans for it, would that \nqualify? Would taking out a loan to build the factory qualify as \nsubstantial preparations?\n  On the other hand, proof of conception and diligent commercialization \nare currently used to apply section 102(g)(2), and I have not heard \ncomplaints that the current defense has resulted in overly burdensome \nlitigation.\n  In the end, however, a substantial-preparations predicate is not \nincluded in this bill simply because that was the agreement that was \nstruck between universities and industry in the House of \nRepresentatives last summer, and we are now effectively limited to that \nagreement. Perhaps this issue can be further explored and revisited in \na future Congress, though I suspect that many members will want a \nrespite from patent issues after this bill is completed.\n  The final bill also drops the requirement of a showing of a reduction \nto practice that previously appeared in subsection (b)(1). This is \nbecause the use of a process, or the use of product in a commercial \nprocess, will always constitute a reduction to practice.\n  One change made by the original House bill that proved contentious is \nthe expansion of the personal nature of the defense, now at subsection \n(e)(1)(A), to also include uses of the invention made by contractors \nand vendors of the person asserting the defense. The House bill \noriginally allowed the defendant to assert the defense if he performed \nthe commercial use or ``caused'' its performance. The word ``caused,'' \nhowever, could be read to include even those uses that a vendor made \nwithout instructions or even the contemporaneous knowledge of the \nperson asserting the defense. The final bill uses the word \n``directed,'' which limits the provision only to those third-party \ncommercial uses that the defendant actually instructed the vendor or \ncontactor to use. In analogous contexts, the word ``directed'' has been \nunderstood to require evidence that the defendant affirmatively \ndirected the vendor or contractor in the manner of the work or use of \nthe product. See, for example, Ortega v. Puccia, 75 A.D. 54, 59, 866 \nN.Y.S.2d 323, 328 (N.Y. App. 2008).\n  Subsection (e)(1)(A)'s reference to entities that ``control, are \ncontrolled by, or under common control with'' the defendant borrows a \nterm that is used in several federal statutes. See 12 U.S.C. 1841(k), \ninvolving bank holding companies, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(vi), involving \nsecurities regulation, 15 U.S.C. 6809(6), involving financial privacy, \nand 49 U.S.C. 30106(d)(1), involving motor vehicle safety. Black's Law \nDictionary 378 (9th ed. 2009) defines ``control'' as the ``direct or \nindirect power to govern\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\nthe management and policies of a person or entity, whether through \nownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise; the power or \nauthority to manage, direct, or oversee.''\n  A few other aspects of the PCU defense merit brief mention. \nSubsection (e)(5)(A), the university exception, was extended to also \ninclude university technology-transfer organizations, such as the \nWisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Subparagraph (B), the exception \nto the university exception, is only intended to preclude application \nof subparagraph (A) when the federal government is affirmatively \nprohibited, whether by statute, regulation, or executive order, from \nfunding research in the activities in question.\n  In the course of the recodification of former subsection (a)(2) as \nnew (c)(2), the former's subparagraph (B) was dropped because it is \nentirely redundant with subparagraph (A).\n  Finally, subsection (e)(4), barring assertion of the defense if use \nof the subject matter has been abandoned, should not be construed to \nnecessarily require continuous use of the subject matter. It is in the \nnature of some subject matter that it will be used only periodically or \nseasonally. If such is the case, and the subject has been so used, its \nuse has not been abandoned.\n  I would also like to take a moment to once again address the question \nof the grace period created by this bill. During the House and Senate \ndebates on the bill, opponents of the first-to-file system have \noccasionally asserted that they oppose the bill's move to first to file \nbecause it weakens the grace period. See 157 Cong. Rec. S1094, S1096, \nS1112 (daily ed. March 2, 2011), and 157 Cong. Rec. H4424, H4430 (daily \ned. June 22, 2011).\n  Some of these arguments are difficult to understand, in part because \nopponents of first to file have used the term ``grace period'' to mean \ndifferent things. Some have used the term to mean the period between \nthe time when the inventor conceives of the invention and the time when \nhe files a full or even provisional application. Obviously, if the \n``grace period'' is defined as the first-to-invent system, then the \nmove to first to file eliminates that version of the grace period. \nOthers, however, have suggested that public uses, sales, or ``trade \nsecrets'' will bar patenting under new section 102(b), even if they \nconsist of activities of the inventor during the year before filing.\n  This is not the case, and I hope that courts and executive officials \ninterpreting this act will not be misled by arguments made by opponents \nof this part of the bill. The correct interpretation of section 102 and \nthe grace period is that which has been consistently advanced in the \n2007 and 2011 committee reports for this bill, see Senate Report 110-\n259, page 9, and House Report 112-98, page 43, as well as by both \nChairman Smith and Chairman Leahy, see 157 Cong. Rec. S1496-97 (daily \ned. March 9, 2011), and 157 Cong. Rec. H4429 (daily ed. June 22, 2011). \nThese two chairmen are the lead sponsors and authorizing chairmen of \nthis year's bills, which are identical with respect to section 102. As \nChairman Smith most recently explained in his June 22 remarks, \n``contrary to current precedent, in order to trigger the bar in new \n102(a) in our legislation, an action must make the patented subject \nmatter `available to the public' before the effective filing date.'' \nTherefore, ``[i]f an inventor's action is such that it triggers one of \nthe bars under 102(a), then it inherently triggers the grace period in \nsection 102(b).''\n  When the committee included the words ``or otherwise available to the \npublic'' in section 102(a), the word ``otherwise'' made clear that the \npreceding items are things that are of the same quality or nature. As a \nresult, the preceding events and things are limited to those that make \nthe invention ``available to the public.'' The public use or sale of an \ninvention remains prior art, thus making clear that an invention \nembodied in a product that has been sold to the public more than a year \nbefore an application was filed, for example, can no longer be \npatented. Once an invention has entered the public domain, by any \nmeans, it can no longer be withdrawn by anyone. But public uses and \nsales are prior art only if they make the invention available to the \npublic.\n  In my own remarks last March, I cited judicial opinions that have \nconstrued comparable legislative language in the same way. Since that \ntime, no opponent of the first-to-file transition has identified any \ncaselaw that reads this legislative language any other way, nor am I \naware of any such cases. I would hope that even those opponents of \nfirst to file who believe that supporters of the bill cannot rely on \ncommittee reports and sponsors' statements would at least concede that \nCongress is entitled to rely on the consistent judicial construction of \nlegislative language.\n  Finally, I would note that the interpretation of 102 that some \nopponents appear to advance--that nondisclosing uses and sales would \nremain prior art, and would fall outside the 102(b) grace period--is \nutterly irrational. Why would Congress create a grace period that \nallows an invention that has been disclosed to the world in a printed \npublication, or sold and used around the world, for up to a year, to be \nwithdrawn from the public domain and patented, but not allow an \ninventor to patent an invention that, by definition, has not been made \navailable to the public? Such an interpretation of section 102 simply \nmakes no sense, and should be rejected for that reason alone.\n\n  Let me also address two other misstatements that have been made about \nthe bill's first-to-file system. In remarks appearing at 157 Cong. Rec. \nS1095 (daily ed. March 2, 2011), it was suggested that a provisional \napplication filed under the first-to-file system will be vulnerable to \nan attack that the inventor failed to disclose the best mode of the \ninvention. This is incorrect. Section 15 of this bill precludes the use \nof the best-mode requirement as a basis for cancelling a claim or \nholding it invalid. It was also suggested, at the same place in the \nrecord, that discovery would not be allowed in the derivation \nproceedings created by section 3(i) of the bill. That is incorrect. \nSection 24 of title 35 allows discovery in any ``contested case.'' The \nPatent Office's regulations, at 37 CFR 41.2(2), indicate that contested \ncases included Board proceedings such as interferences. It is not \napparent to me why these laws and regulations would suggest anything \nother than that discovery will be allowed in derivation proceedings.\n  Finally, let me close by commenting on section 18 of the bill. Some \nlegitimate interests have expressed concern that non-business-method \npatents will be subject to challenge in this proceeding. I have been \nasked to, and am happy to, reiterate that technological inventions are \nexcluded from the scope of the program, and that these technological \ninventions include inventions in the natural sciences, engineering, and \ncomputer operations--and that inventions in computer operations \nobviously include software inventions.\n  This does not mean that a patent is ineligible for review simply \nbecause it recites software elements or has been reduced to a software \nprogram. If that were the case, then very few of even the most \nnotorious business-method patents could be reviewed under section 18. \nRather, in order to fall within the technological-invention exclusion, \nthe invention must be novel as software. If an invention recites \nsoftware elements, but does not assert that it is novel as software, or \ndoes not colorably appear to be so, then it is not ineligible for \nreview simply because of that software element. But an actual software \ninvention is a technological invention, and is not subject to review \nunder section 18.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I support the America Invents Act.\n  Right now, as our economy struggles to recover, this legislation is \nneeded to help create jobs and keep our manufacturers competitive. It \nwill further strengthen and expand the ability of our universities to \nconduct research and turn that research into innovative products and \nprocesses that benefit Michigan and our Nation.\n  Because of this legislation, we will be able to see that boost up \nclose in my home State of Michigan, where a new satellite Patent and \nTrademark Office will be established in Detroit. This office will help \nmodernize the patent system and improve the efficiency of patent review \nand the hiring of patent examiners.\n  In addition, in an important victory after years of effort to address \nthe problem, section 14 of the act finally\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nbans tax patents, ending the troubling practice of persons seeking \npatents for tax avoidance strategies.\n  Issuing such patents abuses the Tax Code by granting what some could \nsee as a government imprimatur of approval for dubious tax strategies, \nwhile at the same time penalizing taxpayers seeking to use legitimate \nstrategies. The section makes it clear that patents can still be issued \nfor software that helps taxpayers prepare their tax returns, but that \nprovision is intended to be narrowly construed and is not intended to \nauthorize patents for business methods or financial management \nsoftware.\n  The bill will put a halt to both new and pending tax patent \napplications. Although it does not apply on its face to the 130-plus \ntax patents already granted, if someone tries to enforce one of those \npatents in court by demanding that a taxpayer provide a fee before \nusing it to reduce their taxes, I hope a court will consider this \nbill's language and policy determination when deciding whether such \nefforts are consistent with public policy.\n  This legislation is an important step forward and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I would like to clarify the record on a \nfew points related to section 18 of the America Invents Act. Section \n18, of which Senator Kyl and I were the authors, relates to business \nmethod patents. As the architect of this provision, I would like to \nmake crystal clear the intent of its language.\n  It is important that the record reflect the urgency of this \nprovision. Just today, while the Senate has been considering the \nAmerica Invents Act, Data Treasury--the company which owns the \nnotorious check imaging patents and which has already collected over \nhalf a billion dollars in settlements--filed suit in the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas against 22 additional defendants, primarily community \nbanks. These suits are over exactly the type of patents that section 18 \nis designed to address, and the fact that they continue to be filed \nhighlights the urgency of signing this bill into law and setting up an \nadministrative review program at the PTO.\n  I would like to elucidate the intent behind the definition of \nbusiness method patents. Other Members have attempted to suggest a \nnarrow reading of the definition, but these interpretations do not \nreflect the intent of Congress or the drafters of section 18. For \nexample, in connection with the House vote on the America Invent Act, \nH.R. 1249, Congressman Shuster submitted a statement in the Record \nregarding the definition of a ``covered business method patent'' in \nsection 18. 157 Cong. Rec. H4497 (daily ed. June 23, 2011).\n  In the statement, Mr. Shuster states: ``I would like to place in the \nrecord my understanding that the definition of `covered business method \npatent' . . . is intended to be narrowly construed to target only those \nbusiness method patents that are unique to the financial services \nindustry.'' Mr. Shuster's interpretation is incorrect.\n  Nothing in the America Invents Act limits use of section 18 to banks, \ninsurance companies or other members of the financial services \nindustry. Section 18 does not restrict itself to being used by \npetitioners whose primary business is financial products or services. \nRather, it applies to patents that can apply to financial products or \nservices. Accordingly, the fact that a patent is being used by a \ncompany that is not a financial services company does not disqualify \nthe patent from section 18 review. Conversely, given the statutory and \nregulatory limitations on the activities of financial services \ncompanies, if a patent is allegedly being used by a financial services \ncompany, the patent will qualify as a ``covered business method \npatent.''\n  The plain meaning of ``financial product or service'' demonstrates \nthat section 18 is not limited to the financial services industry. At \nits most basic, a financial product is an agreement between two parties \nstipulating movements of money or other consideration now or in the \nfuture. Types of financial products include, but are not limited to: \nextending credit, servicing loans, activities related to extending and \naccepting credit, leasing of personal or real property, real estate \nservices, appraisals of real or personal property, deposit-taking \nactivities, selling, providing, issuing or accepting stored value or \npayment instruments, check cashing, collection or processing, financial \ndata processing, administration and processing of benefits, financial \nfraud detection and prevention, financial advisory or management \nconsulting services, issuing, selling and trading financial instruments \nand other securities, insurance products and services, collecting, \nanalyzing, maintaining or providing consumer report information or \nother account information, asset management, trust functions, \nannuities, securities brokerage, private placement services, investment \ntransactions, and related support services. To be eligible for section \n18 review, the patent claims must only be broad enough to cover a \nfinancial product or service.\n  The definition of ``covered business method patent'' also indicates \nthat the patent must relate to ``performing data processing or other \noperations used in the practice, administration, or management'' of a \nfinancial product or service. This language makes it clear that section \n18 is intended to cover not only patents claiming the financial product \nor service itself, but also patents claiming activities that are \nfinancial in nature, incidental to a financial activity or \ncomplementary to a financial activity. Any business that sells or \npurchases goods or services ``practices'' or ``administers'' a \nfinancial service by conducting such transactions. Even the notorious \n``Ballard patents'' do not refer specifically to banks or even to \nfinancial transactions. Rather, because the patents apply to \nadministration of a business transactions, such as financial \ntransactions, they are eligible for review under section. To meet this \nrequirement, the patent need not recite a specific financial product or \nservice.\n  Interestingly, Mr. Shuster's own actions suggest that his \ninterpretation does not conform to the plain meaning of the statute. In \naddition to his statement, Mr. Shuster submitted an amendment to the \nRules Committee that would exempt particular types of business-method \npatents from review under section 18. That amendment was later \nwithdrawn. Mr. Shuster's subsequent statement in the Record appears to \nbe an attempt to rewrite through legislative history something that he \nwas unable to change by amendment.\n  Moreover, the text of section 18 further demonstrates that section 18 \nis not limited to patents exclusively utilized by the financial \nservices industry. As originally adopted in the Senate, subsection \n(a)(1)(B) only allowed a party to file a section 18 petition if either \nthat party or its real parties in interest had been sued or accused of \ninfringement. In the House, this was expanded to also cover cases where \na ``privy'' of the petitioner had been sued or accused of infringement. \nA ``privy'' is a party that has a direct relationship to the petitioner \nwith respect to the allegedly infringing product or service. In this \ncase, it effectively means customers of the petitioner. With the \naddition of the word ``privy,'' a company could seek a section 18 \nproceeding on the basis that customers of the petitioner had been sued \nfor infringement. Thus, the addition of the ``privy'' language clearly \ndemonstrates that section 18 applies to patents that may be used by \nentities other than the financial services industry.\n  The fact that a multitude of industries will be able to make use of \nsection is evident by the broad based support for the provision, \nincluding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail \nFederation, among many others.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I support H.R. 1249, the Leahy-Smith \nAmerica Invents Act, because this long-overdue patent reform will spur \ninnovation, create jobs and strengthen our economy.\n  In particular, I am proud that this legislation contains a provision \nI worked to include in the Senate companion, S.23, that would establish \nthe US Patent and Trademark Office Ombudsman Program to assist small \nbusinesses with their patent filing issues. This Ombudsman Program will \nhelp small firms navigate the bureaucracy of the patent system. Small \nbusinesses are the economic engine of our economy. According to the \nSmall Business Administration, these companies employ just over half of \nall private sector employees and create over fifty percent of our \nnonfarm GDP. Illinois alone is\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\nhome to over 258,000 small employers and more than 885,000 self-\nemployers. Small businesses are also helping to lead the way on \nAmerican innovation. These firms produce thirteen times more patents \nper employee than large patenting firms, and their patents are twice as \nlikely to be the most cited among all patents. Small business \nbreakthroughs led to the development of airplanes, FM radio and the \npersonal computer. It is vital that these innovators spend their time \ndeveloping new products and processes that will build our future, not \nwading through government red tape.\n  However, I vote for this legislation with the understanding that \nSection 18, which establishes a review process for business-method \npatents, is not too broadly interpreted to cover patents on tangible \nproducts that claim novel and non-obvious software tools used to \nexecute business methods. H.R. 1249 seeks to strengthen our patent \nsystem in order to incentivize and protect our inventors so that \nAmericans can grow our economy and bolster our global competiveness. \nThus, it would defy the purpose of this bill if its authority were used \nto threaten the viable patents held by companies that employ hundreds \nof Americans by commercializing software products they develop and \nengineer.\n  Our Founding Fathers recognized the importance of a strong patent \nsystem. I am proud to support H.R. 1249, which will provide strong \nintellectual property rights to further our technological advancement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the Leahy-Smith \nAmerica Invents Act. This is bipartisan legislation that will enhance \nand protect innovation in our country. I want to commend Senator Leahy, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his leadership and \ntireless work on this bill. I also want to commend my Republican \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee, particularly Senators Grassley, \nKyl, and Hatch, who have worked diligently with Chairman Leahy in this \neffort to reform our patent system.\n  In this country, if you have a good idea for a new and useful \nproduct, you can get a patent and turn that idea into a thriving \nbusiness. Millions of good American jobs are created in this way. The \ngoals of today's legislation are to improve the operations of the \nPatent and Trademark Office and to help inventors in this country \nbetter protect their investments in innovation. By protecting \ninnovations, we will help grow our economy and help businesses create \njobs for American workers.\n  I regret that after the Senate passed a version of this legislation \nin March in a broadly bipartisan vote of 95-5, the House of \nRepresentatives modified the Senate-passed legislation. Not all of \nthose changes improved the bill. Today, we voted on several amendments \nthat responded to changes made by the House. I voted in support of an \namendment that sought to strike Section 37, which the House had added \nto the bill. This section unnecessarily interferes with a matter that \nis currently being considered on appeal in the federal courts. I also \nvoted reluctantly to table an amendment to restore the Senate-passed \nlanguage regarding funding of the Patent and Trademark Office. I \nsupported the tabling motion because of the significant risk that the \nbill would fail if the Senate sent it back to the House with that \namendment included. It is unfortunate that disagreement between the \nHouse and Senate has prevented the PTO funding issue from being more \nclearly resolved in the current legislation, and I believe Congress \nmust work diligently in the future to ensure PTO has the funding and \nresources it needs to effectively carry out its mission.\n  I also voted against an amendment relating to section 18 of the bill \nwhich creates a transitional review process for certain business method \npatents. I cast this vote after receiving assurances from my colleagues \nthat the scope and application of section 18 would be appropriately \nconstrained, as it is critically important that this section not be \napplied in a way that would undermine the legislation's focus on \nprotecting legitimate innovation and job creation.\n  I want to note specifically that there are companies in many states, \nincluding my state of Illinois, that employ large numbers of American \nworkers in bringing to market legitimate, novel and non-obvious \nproducts that are based on and protected by business method patents. \nExamples of such patent-protected products include machinery that \ncounts, sorts or authenticates currency and paper instruments, and \nnovel software tools and graphical user interfaces that are used by \nelectronic trading industry workers to implement trading or asset \nallocation strategies. Vibrant industries have developed around the \nproduction and sale of these tangible inventions, and I appreciate that \npatents protecting such job-creating products are not understood to be \nthe target of section 18.\n  I also note that there is an exemption in section 18 for patents for \ntechnological inventions. House Judiciary Chairman Smith provided \nuseful clarification with respect to the scope of that exemption in the \nJune 23, 2011, Record, stating that:\n\n       Patents for technological inventions are those patents \n     whose novelty turns on a technological innovation over the \n     prior art and are concerned with a technical problem which is \n     solved with a technical solution. The technological \n     innovation exception does not exclude a patent simply because \n     it recites technology. Inventions related to manufacturing \n     and machines that do not simply use known technology to \n     accomplish a novel business process would be excluded from \n     review under Section 18.\n       Section 18 would not cover patents related to the \n     manufacture and distribution of machinery to count, sort, and \n     authenticate currency. It is the intention of Section 18 to \n     not review mechanical inventions related to the manufacture \n     and distribution of machinery to count, sort and authenticate \n     currency like change sorters and machines that scan currency \n     whose novelty turns on a technological innovation over the \n     prior art. These types of patents would not be eligible for \n     review under this program.\n\n  I agree with Chairman Smith, and would note again that vibrant and \njob-creating industries have developed around the types of mechanical \ninventions he describes that deal with the counting, sorting, \nauthentication and scanning of currency and paper instruments. I am \nconfident that the PTO will keep this in mind as it works to craft \nregulations implementing the technological invention exception to \nsection 18. I also expect the PTO to keep in mind as it crafts these \nregulations Congress's understanding that legitimate and job-creating \ntechnological patents such as those protecting the novel electronic \ntrading software tools and graphical user interfaces discussed above \nare not the target of section 18.\n  Overall, I am pleased that the Congress has passed patent reform \nlegislation with strong bipartisan support and has sent the legislation \nto the President's desk. It has been a long time in the making, and I \nagain want to congratulate Chairman Leahy for his leadership and hard \nwork on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to oppose all \nthree amendments to the patent bill so we can send this important jobs \nbill to the President of the United States for his signature.\n  I then urge my colleagues to support final passage of the Leahy-Smith \nAmerica Invents Act. This is a strong bipartisan bill that will enhance \nAmerica's innovation and give us economic growth. It will protect \ninventors' rights and improve transparency and third-party \nparticipation in the patent review process. It will strengthen patent \nquality and reduce costs and will curb litigation abuses and improve \ncertainty for investors and innovators.\n  The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act will also help small entities \nwith their patent applications and provide for reduced fees for micro \nentities and small businesses. It will help companies do business more \nefficiently both here and abroad.\n  The bill includes a provision that will prevent patents from being \nissued on claims of tax strategies. These strategies can add \nunwarranted fees on taxpayers for attempting to comply with the Tax \nCode.\n  Finally, the bill will enhance the operations of the Patent and \nTrademark Office with administrative reforms, give the Patent and \nTrademark Office fee-setting authority which we hope will then lead to \na reduction of backlog and improve the ability of the Patent and \nTrademark Office to manage its affairs.\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\n  I thank Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch, the lead sponsors of this \nlegislation, for the tremendous amount of work they put into this \nAmerica Invents Act, not only for this Congress but over the past 3 to \n4 years that this bill has been worked on. This has been a long process \nspanning those several Congresses, and without the leadership of these \ntwo Senators on patent reform we wouldn't be ready to cross the finish \nline today.\n  In addition, I thank the staff of the Judiciary Committee: Bruce \nCohen, Aaron Cooper, Curtis LeGeyt of Chairman Leahy's staff, Matt \nSandgren of Senator Hatch's staff, and Joe Matal of Senator Kyl's \nstaff. I would like to thank the floor staff for their help in \nprocessing this bill in an efficient manner, and I would like to \nespecially thank Kolan Davis and Rita Lari Jochum of my staff for their \nhard work on the bill.\n  So for a third time I urge my colleagues to vote for the Leahy-Smith \nAmerica Invents Act and to oppose the three amendments we are going to \nbe voting on so we can keep the bill clean and send it to the President \nwithout delay.\n  Senator Leahy has made it very clear to all 100 Senators that, if we \nsupport this bill, it is a gamble to say it will be law if we have to \nmove it beyond the Senate to the House. This bill will help American \ninventors create innovative new products and services and stimulate job \ncreation. The bill will upgrade and strengthen our patent system and \nkeep America competitive in an increasingly global economy. This is a \ngood bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would urge my colleagues--because I rebut Senator \nSessions' amendment--to keep in mind that when somebody tells us this \nis to bail out one company, understand that one company has gotten \njustice from the judicial branch of our government because a judge has \nsaid for that company that they were denied their rights under the 60-\nday rule to file for an extension of patent. So what that judge said \nwas bureaucrats in our agencies acted in an arbitrary and capricious \nmanner by not having the same rules that designate when the 60-day \nperiod of time starts.\n  So we have a judge that says so, so maybe people can refer to that \nopinion and get what they want. But we ought to have it in the statute \nof what is uniform, and that is what the bill does, and the Sessions \namendment would strike that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the remainder of \nthe time until 4 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIowa for his strong support of this bill.\n  In a few moments the Senate is going to have the opportunity to make \nsignificant reforms to our Nation's patent system for the first time in \nmore than half a century.\n  The America Invents Act is the product of extensive consideration. We \nhave worked on this for four Congresses. We have had dozens of \nhearings, weeks of committee debate, and I have lost count of the \nhundreds of other meetings we have had. This bill is an opportunity to \nshow the American people that Democrats and Republicans can come \ntogether to enact meaningful legislation for the American people. The \ntime to do that is now.\n  The only remaining issues that stand in the way of this long overdue \nreform are three amendments. Each of them carries some merit. In the \npast, I might have supported them. But this is a compromise. No one \nSenator can have everything he or she may want.\n  The underlying issues have been debated. The bill as written \nrepresents a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that should be passed \nwithout changes. Any amendment to this bill risks killing it.\n  I would urge all Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, to join \nme and join Senator Grassley in opposing these amendments. They are the \nfinal hurdles standing in the way of comprehensive patent reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nbusinesses and workers representing the spectrum of American industry \nand labor urging the Senate to pass the America Invents Act without \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    The Coalition for 21st Century\n\n\n                                                Patent Reform.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. ``Chuck'' Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We urge \n     you to work with the leadership of the Senate to bring H.R. \n     1249 to the Senate floor as soon the Senate's schedule might \n     permit and pass the bill as is.\n       Our Coalition believes that this legislation will fully \n     modernize our patent laws. Indeed, it will give the world the \n     first truly 21st century patent law--creating patentability \n     standards that are transparent, objective, predictable and \n     simple in their application. It will enhance the inventor-\n     friendly and collaboration-friendly features of our existing \n     patent law. At the same time, it will increase public \n     participation in the patenting process, while maintaining \n     strong protections for inventors in the provisions that do \n     so.\n       The agreement reached in the House on USPTO funding will \n     assure that the fees paid to the USPTO by inventors will not \n     be diverted and will be made available to the Office for \n     processing patent applications and other important functions \n     of the Office. While we would have preferred the Senate's \n     approach in S. 23 to prevent diversion of USPTO funds, we \n     believe that acceptance of the House bill provides an \n     effective and the most immediate path forward to address \n     problems of the patent office. H.R. 1249, like S. 23, is an \n     excellent bill. These bills are the product of many years of \n     skillful and difficult legislative work in both the House and \n     the Senate. We believe the time has now come for the Senate \n     to take the final legislative act required for enactment of \n     these historic reforms.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gary L. Griswold.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Coalition for Patent Fairness,\n\n                                                    June 27, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: After \n     years of effort, both houses of Congress have now \n     successfully passed patent reform by impressive margins. On \n     behalf of the high tech community, we congratulate you, as \n     well as your House colleagues, on this achievement.\n       The Coalition for Patent Fairness supports Senate \n     acceptance of H.R. 1249 as passed by the House. While neither \n     bill is as we would have written it, we believe that the \n     House passed bill represents the best opportunity to improve \n     the patent system at the present time. We are also quite \n     aware that House leaders worked very hard to take into \n     account the views of the Senate during their deliberations.\n       H.R. 1249, as passed, offers us a chance of consensus and \n     we believe it should be passed and signed into law. We are \n     looking forward to advancing other policy matters that boost \n     innovation and growth in this country.\n           Sincerely,\n     Coalition for Patent Fairness.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 6, 2011.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, strongly supports H.R. 1249, the ``America Invents \n     Act,'' which would encourage innovation and bolster the U.S. \n     economy. The Chamber believes this legislation is crucial for \n     American economic growth, jobs, and the future of U.S. \n     competitiveness.\n       A key component of H.R. 1249 is section 22, which would \n     help ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office (PTO) fund the office and its administration \n     of the patent system. PTO faces significant challenges, \n     including a massive backlog of pending applications, and this \n     backlog is stifling domestic innovators. The fees that PTO \n     collects to review and approve patent applications should be \n     dedicated to PTO operation. However, fee diversion by \n     Congress has hampered PTO's efforts to hire and retain a \n     sufficient number of qualified examiners and implement \n     technological improvements necessary to ensure expeditious \n     issuance of high quality patents. Though the PTO funding \n     compromise embodied in the House-passed bill could be \n     strengthened to match the fee diversion provision originally \n     passed by the Senate, as crafted, Section 22 represents a \n     meaningful step toward ensuring that PTO has better access to \n     the user fees it collects, and would better allow the agency \n     to address the current backlog of 1.2 million applications \n     waiting for a final determination and pendency time of three \n     years, as well as to improve patent quality.\n       In addition, the legislation would help ensure that the \n     U.S. remains at the forefront of\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\n     innovation by enhancing the PTO process and ensuring that all \n     inventors secure the exclusive right to their inventions and \n     discoveries. The bill shifts the U.S. to a first-inventor-to-\n     file system that the Chamber believes is both constitutional \n     and wise, ending expensive interference proceedings. H.R. \n     1249 also contains important legal reforms that would help \n     reduce unnecessary litigation against American businesses and \n     innovators. Among the bill's provisions, Section 16 would put \n     an end to frivolous false patent marking cases, while still \n     preserving the right of those who suffered actual harm to \n     bring actions. Section 5 would create a prior user right for \n     those who first commercially use inventions, protecting the \n     rights of early inventors and giving manufacturers a powerful \n     incentive to build new factories in the United States, while \n     at the same time fully protecting universities. Section 19 \n     also restricts joinder of defendants who have tenuous \n     connections to the underlying disputes in patent infringement \n     suits. Section 18 of H.R. 1249 provides for a tailored pilot \n     program which would allow patent office experts to help the \n     court review the validity of certain business method patents \n     using the best available prior art as an alternative to \n     costly litigation.\n       The Chamber strongly opposes any amendments to H.R. 1249 \n     that would strike or weaken any of the important legal reform \n     measures in this legislation, including those found in \n     Sections 16, 5, 19 and 18.\n       The Chamber strongly supports H.R. 1249. The Chamber may \n     consider votes on, or in relation to, H.R. 1249--including \n     procedural votes, and any weakening Pamendments--in our \n     annual How They Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the United Steelworkers, \n     I am writing to urge you to consider support for the recently \n     passed House bill, H.R. 1249. Over the past several years the \n     USW has been deeply involved in discussions concerning \n     comprehensive patent reform. We were principally concerned \n     with issues dealing with how damages are calculated for \n     infringed patents, new post-grant review procedures, and \n     publication requirements for pending patents. H.R. 1249, as \n     did S. 23 which passed earlier this year, satisfactorily \n     addresses these issues and has our support. While we prefer \n     the provision in the Senate bill dealing with USPTO funding, \n     we nevertheless believe that the House bill moves in the \n     right direction and will help insure that the patent office \n     has the appropriate and necessary resources to do its \n     important work.\n       Certainly, no bill is perfect. But H.R. 1249 goes a long \n     way toward balancing different interests on a very difficult \n     and contentious issue. We believe it warrants your favorable \n     consideration and enactment by the Senate so that it can be \n     moved to the President's desk and signed into law without \n     undue delay.\n       We worked closely with your office, and others in the \n     Senate, in finding a consensus approach that would promote \n     innovation, investment, production and job creation in the \n     U.S. We believe that H.R. 1249, which builds on your work in \n     the Senate, strikes a proper balance.\n       The U. S. economy remains in a very fragile state with high \n     unemployment and stagnant wages. Patent reform can be an \n     important part of a comprehensive approach to getting the \n     economy moving again and I urge its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Leo W. Gerard,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 27, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     on behalf of six university, medical college, and higher \n     education associations to encourage you to work with the \n     leadership of the Senate to bring H.R. 1249 before the Senate \n     as soon as possible for a vote on passage of the bill as is.\n       The patent system plays a critical role in enabling \n     universities to transfer the discoveries arising from \n     university research into the commercial sector for \n     development into products and processes that benefit society. \n     H.R. 1249 closely resembles S. 23; both bills contain \n     provisions that will improve patent quality, reduce patent \n     litigation costs, and provide increased funding for the \n     USPTO. Although we preferred the USPTO revolving fund \n     established in S. 23, we believe that the funding provisions \n     adopted by the House in the course of passing H.R. 1249 \n     provide an effective means of preventing fee diversion. \n     Together with the expanded fee-setting authority included in \n     both bills, H.R. 1249 will provide USPTO with the funding \n     necessary to carry out its critical functions.\n       We very much appreciate the leadership of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee in crafting S. 23, which brought together \n     the key elements of effective patent reform and formed the \n     basis for H.R. 1249. These bills represent the successful \n     culmination of a thorough, balanced effort to update the U.S. \n     patent system, strengthening the nation's innovative capacity \n     and job creation in the increasingly competitive global \n     economic environment of the 21st century. Senate passage of \n     H.R. 1249 will assure that the nation secures these benefits.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hunter R. Rawlings III,\n       President, Association of American Universities.\n     Molly Corbett Broad,\n       President, American Council on Education.\n     Darrell G. Kirch,\n       President and CEO, Association of American Medical \n     Colleges.\n     Peter McPherson,\n       President, Association of Public and Land-grant \n     Universities.\n     Robin L. Rasor,\n       President, Association of University Technology Managers.\n     Anthony P. DeCrappeo,\n       President, Council on Governmental Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 25, 2011.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As an \n     independent inventor and someone who has personally \n     interacted with thousands of other independent inventors and \n     entrepreneurs, we urge you to work with the leadership of the \n     Senate to bring H.R. 1249 to the Senate floor as soon the \n     Senate's schedule might permit and pass the bill as is.\n       Over the past few months, my enthusiasm and belief in the \n     legislative process has grown as I have participated in the \n     debate over patent reform. I believe that this legislation \n     will fully modernize our patent laws. It will give \n     independent inventors and entrepreneurs the speed and \n     certainty necessary to go out and commercialize their \n     inventions, start companies, and create jobs.\n       There has been a great deal of compromise amongst \n     industries to balance the unique needs of all constituents. \n     The independent inventor has been well represented throughout \n     this process and we are in a unique situation where there is \n     overwhelming support for this legislation.\n       The fee diversion debate has been important, since it has \n     shed light on the fact that nearly a billion dollars has been \n     diverted from the USPTO. These are dollars that inventors \n     have paid to the USPTO expecting the funds to be used to \n     examine applications as expeditiously as possible. While I \n     would have preferred the Senate's approach in S. 23 to \n     prevent diversion of USPTO funds, I believe that acceptance \n     of the House bill provides the best way to ensure that the \n     funds paid to the patent office will be available to hire \n     examiners and modernize the tools necessary for it to operate \n     effectively.\n       H.R. 1249 is the catalyst necessary to incentivize \n     inventors and entrepreneurs to create the companies that will \n     get our country back on the right path and generate the jobs \n     we sorely need. I hope that you will take the needs of the \n     ``little guy'' into consideration and move this legislation \n     forward and enact these historic reforms.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Louis J. Foreman,\n                                                              CEO.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The bill is important for our economy. It is important for \njob creation. It is a product of bipartisan and bicameral \ncollaboration. It is the way our system is supposed to work. I look \nforward to passing the bill and sending it directly to the President's \ndesk for his signature.\n  I know my friends both on the Republican side and Democratic side \nhave amendments to this bill, but they are not amendments that should \npass. I mentioned the one earlier. I talked about the amendment that \nwould put all our--well, Madam President, which amendment is the first \nin order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sessions amendment No. 600.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield the floor. I know both Senator \nSessions and Senator Grassley wish to speak to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators will have 4 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the oath that judges take is to do \nequal justice, and it says for the poor and the rich.\n  Every day statutes of limitations require that a litigant file a \nlawsuit within so many days and file petitions in so many days. I see \nSenator Cornyn, a former justice on the Texas Supreme Court and \nattorney general of Texas. He fully understands that. I know he \nsupports my view of this issue; that is, that the rules have to be \nequally applied.\n  It is just not right to the little widow lady, it is not right that \nsomebody\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\nwith a poor lawyer, or whatever, misses a deadline and a judge throws \nthe case out. And they do. Big law firms such as WilmerHale file \nmotions every day to dismiss cases based on delay in filing those \ncases. Big insurance companies file lawsuits, file motions to dismiss \nevery day against individuals who file their claims too late--and they \nwin. So when this big one has a good bit of risk, presumably they have \na good errors and omissions policy--that is what they are supposed to \ndo.\n  One reason they get paid the big bucks--and the average partner makes \n$1 million-plus a year--is because they have high responsibilities, and \nthey are required to meet those responsibilities and be responsible.\n  So I believe it is improper for us, while this matter is on appeal \nand in litigation, to take action driven by this continual lobbying \npressure that would exempt one company. They can say it is others \ninvolved, but, look, this is always about one company. I have been here \nfor 10 years. I know how it is played out. I have seen it. I have \ntalked to the advocates on their behalf. I just haven't been able to \nagree to it because I see the average person not getting the benefit \nthey are due.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join in support of this amendment. The \nWall Street Journal and others have editorialized in favor of it, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think the Senator from Alabama has given me a reason \nto suggest the importance of the language of the bill he wants to \nstrike because he said that law ought to be equally applied.\n  The law for this one company is that they were not given justice by \nbureaucrats who acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and they \nwere denied their rights under the law. So that company is taken care \nof because there was an impartial judge who believed they had been \nabused in their rights under Hatch-Waxman to be able to extend their \npatent.\n  You might be able to argue in other places around the country when \nyou are likewise denied your right that you have this court case to \nback you up, but we cannot have one agency saying when a 60-day period \nof time starts for mail going in or mail going out to exercise your 60-\nday period, and for another agency to do it another way. That is \nbasically what the judge said, that Congress surely could not have \nmeant that.\n  The language of this section 37 does exactly what Senator Sessions \nwants, which is to guarantee in the future that no bureaucrat can act \nin an arbitrary and capricious way when they decide when does the 60-\nday period of time start. We put it in the statute of the United States \nso the courts look at it and the bureaucrats look at it in exactly the \nsame way.\n  If you are a citizen of this country, you ought to know what your \nrights are. You ought to know that a bureaucrat treats you the same way \nthey treat, in like situations, somebody else. You cannot have this \nsort of arbitrary and capricious action on the part of faceless \nbureaucrats that denies the rights. This puts it in statute and \nsolidifies it so everybody knows what the law is, rather than relying \nupon one judge or in the future having to rely upon the court someplace \nelse. I ask my colleagues not to support the Sessions amendment because \nit would deny equal rights to some people in this country, as this \njudge said those equal rights were already denied.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The time has expired. The \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nfirst vote--we have several more votes--the remaining votes be 10-\nminute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Sessions amendment No. 600.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Coats).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 4 minutes equally divided \nprior to a vote in relation to the Cantwell amendment.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I encourage my colleagues to support \nthe Cantwell amendment. The Cantwell amendment is the reinstatement of \nsection 18 language as it passed the Senate. So casting a vote for the \nCantwell amendment will be consistent with language previously \nsupported by each Member.\n  The reason we are trying to reinstate the Senate language is because \nthe House language broadens a loophole that will allow for more \nconfusion over patents that have already been issued. It will allow for \nthe cancellation of patents already issued by the Patent Office, \nthrowing into disarray and legal battling many companies that already \nbelieve they have a legitimate patent.\n  The House language, by adding the word ``other,'' broadens the \ndefinition of section 18 and extends it for 8 years, so this chaos and \ndisarray that is supposedly targeted at a single earmark for the \nbanking industry to try to get out of paying royalties is now so \nbroadened that many other technology companies will be affected.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment and reinstate \nthe language that was previously agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nof my dear friend, Senator Cantwell.\n  Business method patents are a real problem. They never should have \nbeen patented to begin with. Let me give an example: double click. We \ndouble click on a computer or something such as that and after it \nbecomes a practice for awhile, someone files a patent and says they \nwant a patent on double clicking. Because of the way the Patent Office \nworks, the opponents of that never get a chance to weigh in as to \nwhether it should be a patent. The Patent Office has gone way overboard \nin allowing these business method patents.\n  One might say: Then you get your day in court. That is true, except \n56\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\npercent--more than half--of all the business method patent litigation \ngoes to one district, the Eastern District of Texas, which is known to \nbe extremely favorable to the plaintiffs. It takes about 10 years to \nlitigate. It costs tens of millions of dollars. So the people who are \nsued over and over for things such as double clicking or how to \nphotograph a check--common things that are business methods and not \npatents--settle. It is a lucrative business for a small number of \npeople, but it is wrong.\n  What this bill does is very simple. What the bill does, in terms of \nthis amendment, is very simple. It says the Patent Office will make an \nadministrative determination before the years of litigation as to \nwhether this patent is a legitimate patent so as not to allow the kind \nof abuse we have seen. It applies to all financial transactions, \nwhether it be a bank or Amazon or a store or anybody else, and it makes \neminent sense.\n  So as much respect as I have for my colleague from Washington, I must \nstrongly disagree with her argument and urge that the amendment be \nvoted down.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL (when his name was called).

There is now 4 minutes equally divided prior \nto the vote in relation to the Coburn amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a straightforward amendment that \nsays if you pay into the Patent Trademark Office to have a patent \nevaluated, that money ought to be spent on the process. We have now \nstolen almost $900 million from the Patent Office. We have almost a \nmillion patents in arrears. We have fantastic leadership in the Patent \nOffice, and we will not send them the money to do their job. It is \nunconscionable that we will not do this.\n  I understand the arguments against it, and I reserve the remainder of \nour time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of Senator \nCoburn's amendment to prevent the diversion of patent and trademark \nfees to other purposes.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I believe this \namendment is critical for this bill to have the innovation-encouraging, \njob-creating effects that its proponents say it will.\n  Prior to 1990, taxpayers supported the operations of the Patent and \nTrademark Office, or PTO. In 1990, this was changed through a 69 \npercent user fee ``surcharge,'' so that the PTO became funded entirely \nthrough fees paid by its users, the American inventors who seek to \nprotect the genius of their inventions from those who would copy these \ninnovations for their own profit.\n  In short order, Congress began using the funds that inventors paid to \nprotect their inventions for other purposes. In 1992, $8.1 million in \nuser fees were diverted. In 1993, $12.3 million was diverted. In 1994, \n$14.7 million. And so it continued, escalating every year, until what \nstarted as a trickle became a flood in 1998, with $200.3 million in PTO \nuser fees diverted. All told, since 1992, an estimated $886 million in \nfees that were paid for the efficient and effective operation of the \nPatent and Trademark Office have been diverted to other uses, according \nto the Intellectual Property Owners Association.\n  Meanwhile, at the same time that these fees were being taken away, \nthe length of time that it takes to get a patent out of the Patent \nOffice has steadily increased. In fiscal year 1991, average patent \npendency was 18.2 months. By fiscal year 1999, it had increased to 25 \nmonths. By fiscal year 2010, average patent pendency had increased all \nthe way to 35.3 months.\n  These are not just numbers. This is innovation being stifled from \nbeing brought to market. The longer it takes to get a patent approved, \nthe longer a new invention, a potential technological breakthrough, \nsits on the shelf gathering dust instead of spurring job growth and \nscientific and economic progress.\n  Ultimately, this hurts the competitiveness of the American economy. \nAmerica has a stunning record of leading the world in innovation, which \nhas provided us a competitive edge over the decades and even centuries. \nBy stifling the progress of our innovation within the PTO, we are \ndulling that competitive edge.\n  Obviously, there is a direct relationship between fee diversion and \npatent pendency. The more fees that are diverted away from the PTO, the \nfewer patent examiners they can hire, the more patents each examiner \nhas to process, and the longer it takes them to get to any individual \npatent--a longer patent pendency.\n  The manager of this bill, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has argued that ``the bill will speed the time it takes for \napplications on true inventions to issue as high quality patents, which \ncan then be commercialized and used to create jobs. . . . The America \nInvents Act will ensure that the PTO has the resources it needs to work \nthrough its backlog of applications more quickly. The bill accomplishes \nthis objective by authorizing the PTO to set its fees . . .''\n  But what this bill gave with the one hand, in authorizing the PTO to \nset its fees, the House of Representatives took away with the other \nhand, by striking the strong antifee diversion language that the Senate \nincluded in its patent bill earlier this year. Setting higher fee \nlevels to reduce patent pendency does no good if those fees are simply \ndiverted away from the PTO, and not used to hire additional patent \nexaminers. Indeed, requiring the payment of higher patent fees which \nare then used for general government purposes really amounts to a tax \non innovation--which is the last thing we should be burdening in \ntoday's technology-driven economy.\n  The chairman argues that the bill ``creates a PTO reserve fund for \nany fees collected above the appropriated amounts in a given year--so \nthat only the PTO will have access to these fees.'' However, with all \ndue respect, the language that the House put into the bill is not \nreally different from previous bill language that proved ineffective to \nprevent diversion.\n  The 1990 law that authorized the patent user surcharge provided that \nthe surcharges ``shall be credited to a separate account established in \nthe Treasury . . .; '' and ``shall be available only\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\nto the Patent and Trademark Office, to the extent provided in \nappropriation Acts. . . .''\n  However, notwithstanding this language, the Congressional Budget \nOffice found in 2008 that $230 million had been diverted from the \nsurcharge account.\n  Similarly, the House changed the bill before us today to \n``establish[] in the Treasury a Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund . \n. .; '' and ``to the extent and in the amounts provided in \nappropriations Acts, amounts in the Fund shall be made available until \nexpended only for obligation and expenditure by the Office . . .''\n  The key language is the same--``to the extent provided in \nappropriation Acts.'' Calling it a ``fund'' rather than an ``account'' \nshould not lead anyone to expect a different result.\n  Indeed, the Senate bill that we passed earlier this year explicitly \nstruck the existing statutory language, ``To the extent and in the \namounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts . . .'' And the \nHouse specifically restored that language, omitting only the words ``in \nadvance.'' The Coburn amendment would restore the changes we made \nearlier this year, eliminating that language again.\n  The Coburn amendment, like the Senate bill, contains other key \nlanguage, providing that amounts in the fund it establishes ``shall be \navailable for use by the Director without fiscal year limitation.'' The \nbill before us today provides no such protection against diversion.\n  In short, this bill will permit the continued diversion of patent \nfees, to the detriment of American inventors and innovation.\n  But don't just take my word for this. The Intellectual Property \nOwners Association, which includes more than 200 companies, just \nyesterday said:\n\n       The greatest disappointment with the House-passed patent \n     reform bill H.R. 1249 . . . is its failure to stop USPTO fee \n     diversion. The House-passed patent reform bill creates \n     another USPTO account, a ``reserve fund,'' but nothing in the \n     proposed statutory language guarantees the USPTO access to \n     the funds in this new account. The language of H.R. 1249 \n     defers to future appropriations bills to instruct the USPTO \n     on how to access fees in the new USPTO account. Therefore, \n     despite some claims to the contrary, the creation of this new \n     account, alone, will not stop diversion.\n\n  The Innovation Alliance, a major coalition of innovative companies, \nand CONNECT, an organization dedicated to supporting San Diego \ntechnology and life science businesses, among others, also believe that \nthe House language is insufficient to prevent fee diversion.\n  Without this protection from fee diversion, this bill could well make \nour patent system worse, not better. Many of the changes made by this \nbill will impose additional burdens on the PTO. For example, the CBO \nfound that the new post-grant review procedure would cost $140 million \nto implement over a 10-year period; the new supplemental review \nprocedure would cost $758 million to implement over that period; and \nthe changes to the inter partes reexamination procedure would cost $251 \nmillion to implement.\n  All told, these changes would impose additional duties on the PTO \ncosting over $1 billion to implement over a 10-year period. If the PTO \nis not permitted to keep the fees it needs to meet these obligations, \npatents will take even longer to be issued, and the promised \nimprovements in patent quality may prove to be ephemeral. We won't \nencourage innovation; we won't create new jobs.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, to support the strong antidiversion language \nthat we passed this Spring, and to end fee diversion once and for all.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nto the America Invents Act offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I, along with my fellow members of the Appropriations Committee, \nshare the Senator from Oklahoma's goal of ensuring that all fees paid \nby inventors to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, are used \nonly for the operations of the PTO. The PTO fosters American innovation \nand job creation by providing protections for ideas and products \ndeveloped by our entrepreneurs, businesses and academic institutions.\n  As the chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the \nPTO, I have worked to ensure that PTO receives every dollar it collects \nfrom inventors. But, while I share the Senator's goal, I oppose his \namendment for three reasons.\n  First, the amendment is unnecessary. It is a solution in search of a \nproblem. The underlying America Invents Act before the Senate today \nensures that PTO can keep and spend all of the fees collected. This \nlegislation establishes a Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund. Any \nfees collected in excess of annual appropriations would be deposited \ninto the fund, and those fees would remain available until expended \nsolely for PTO operations.\n  The creation of this fund is not a new idea. Provisions of several \nbills reported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee in prior \nyears allowed PTO to keep and spend fee revenue in excess of \nappropriations levels. I can assure my colleagues that the committee \nwill continue to support such language.\n  Second, the amendment would significantly reduce oversight of the \nPTO. The Senator from Oklahoma's amendment would establish a new, off-\nbudget revolving fund for PTO fees. This would put the PTO on \nautopilot, without the oversight of an annual legislative vehicle to \nhold the agency accountable for progress and wise use of taxpayer \nfunding.\n  Since fiscal year 2004, funding for PTO has increased by over 70 \npercent. At the same time, however, the backlog of patent applications \nhas climbed to more than 700,000. It now takes over three years for PTO \nto make a decision on a patent application. This is unacceptable. While \nAmerica's inventors are waiting in line, their ideas are being stolen \nby other countries.\n  Through annual appropriations bills, the Appropriations Committee has \nsucceeded in forcing management reforms that have slowed the growth of \nPTO's backlogs and improved employee retention. While further \naccountability is needed, the America Invents Act keeps PTO on budget \nand on track for continued oversight by the Appropriations Committee \neach year.\n  Finally, the Senator's amendment could have unintended consequences. \nIf PTO were permitted to operate on autopilot, the agency could face \nfee revenue shortfalls and the Appropriations Committee would not be \npoised to assist. The committee continually monitors the agency's fee \nprojections to ensure the agency can operate effectively. It is not \nwidely known, but over the past 6 years, PTO has actually collected \nnearly $200 million less than the appropriated levels.\n  In fact, I recently received a letter from the Director of the PTO \ninforming my Subcommittee that fee estimates for fiscal year 2012 have \nalready dropped by $88 million. I will ask consent to have this letter \nprinted in the Record. If PTO was put on autopilot as proposed by the \nSenator's amendment, the committee would no longer have the tools to \nprovide the necessary funding to keep our patent and trademark system \noperating should a severe funding gap occur.\n  The PTO's full access to fee revenue is critical to American \ninnovation and job creation. I commend Chairman Leahy for his efforts \nto improve the patent system and ensure that PTO funding is spent \nwisely and effectively. I support the funding provisions of the America \nInvents Act and oppose the Coburn amendment. I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              United States Patent\n\n\n                                         and Trademark Office,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, September 1, 2011.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chair: This letter provides you with the United \n     States Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO) current, revised \n     fee collection estimates for fiscal year (FY) 2012, as \n     requested in the report accompanying H.R. 3288 (Pub. L. No. \n     111-117).\n       The President's FY 2012 Budget supports an aggressive \n     approach to improving operations at the Agency, reducing the \n     patent backlog and contributing to economic recovery efforts. \n     The fee collection estimate submitted with the FY 2012 \n     President's Budget\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\n     earlier this year was $2,706.3 million, including a 15% \n     interim increase to certain patent user fee rates. This \n     increase will help fund efforts to reduce the backlog of \n     unexamined patent applications. Using more recent \n     information, outcomes of events, and projections of demand \n     for USPTO services, we now expect fee collections for FY 2012 \n     to be in the $2,431.9 million to $2,727.6 million range, with \n     a working estimate of $2,618.2 million (a decrease of $88.1 \n     million from the FY 2012 President's Budget estimate).\n       The projected decrease is attributable to factors both \n     internal and external to the USPTO; namely, a change in \n     strategic direction resulting in the Office not pursuing a \n     cost recovery regulatory increase to Request for Continued \n     Examination fee rates (this was estimated to generate about \n     $70 million in patent application fees), the decision not to \n     pursue a Consumer Price Index increase to patent statutory \n     fees, and the decrease in demand for USPTO services as a \n     result of processing reengineering gains from compact \n     prosecution. The USPTO bases these revisions on current \n     demand as well as discussions with our stakeholders about \n     expected trends. The USPTO also reviews filing trends in \n     foreign patent offices, which have experienced similar \n     difficulties in estimating demand.\n       In closing, the USPTO would like to thank the subcommittee \n     for their support of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. We \n     are especially grateful for the subcommittee's support in \n     ensuring all fees collected by the USPTO will be made \n     available for the USPTO to use in examination and \n     intellectual property activities supporting the fee paying \n     community.\n       If you or your staff have any questions, please contact Mr. \n     Anthony Scardino, the USPTO's Chief Financial Officer, at \n     (571) 272-9200. Thank you for your continued support of the \n     United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David J. Kappos,\n                                     Under Secretary and Director.\n     Identical Letters sent to:\n       The Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Ranking Member, Subcommittee \n     on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, Committee \n     on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       The Hon. Frank R. Wolf, Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, \n     Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, Committee on \n     Appropriations, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       The Hon. Chaka Fattah, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on \n     Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, Committee on \n     Appropriations, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand what the Senator from \nOklahoma says, but the Coburn amendment can derail and even kill this \nbill. So, as I have told the Senator, I will move to table in a moment. \nBut this bill would otherwise help our recovering economy. It would \nunleash innovation and create jobs.\n  I have worked for years against Patent Office fee diversion, but I \noppose this amendment. Its formulation was already rejected by the \nHouse of Representatives. They have made it very clear. There is no \nreason they will change. This amendment can sink years of efforts by \nboth Republicans and Democrats in this body and the other body to pass \nit. Actually, this amendment could kill the bill over a mere formality: \nthe difference between a revolving fund and a reserve fund.\n  We have worked out a compromise in good faith. The money, the fees--\nunder the bill as it is here--can only be spent at the PTO, but the \nonly thing is, we actually have a chance to take a look at what they \nare spending it on, so they could not buy everybody a car or they could \nnot have a gilded palace. They actually have to spend it on getting \nthrough the backlog of patents. It will not go anywhere else. It will \nonly go to the Patent Office.\n  So we should not kill the bill over this amendment. We should reject \nthe amendment and pass the bill. It is time for us to legislate. That \nis what the American people elected us to do. That is what they expect \nus to do. Let's not kill the bill after all this work over something \nthat will really make no difference in the long run. So I therefore \nwill move to table the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has not yet expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I think I have reserved my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has reserved his \ntime. He has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I will make the following points, and I \nwould ask for order before I do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could we please have order so the Senator from \nOklahoma can speak.\n  Mr. COBURN. It is true that the House bill moves the money to where \nit cannot be spent elsewhere, but there is no requirement that the \nmoney be spent in the Patent Office. There is a written agreement \nbetween an appropriations chairman and the Speaker that is good as long \nas both of them are in their positions. This is a 7-year authorization. \nIt will not guarantee that the money actually goes to the Patent \nOffice.\n  This bill, with this amendment in it, went out of the House Judiciary \nCommittee 32 to 3 in a strong, bipartisan vote. It was never voted on \nin the Senate because the appropriators objected because of a technical \nerror, which has been corrected in this amendment. So it violates no \nHouse rules, it violates no condition and, in fact, will guarantee that \nthe Patent Office has the funds it needs to have to put us back in the \nplace we need to be.\n  This bill will not be killed because we are going to make sure the \nmoney for patents goes to the Patent Office. Anybody who wants to claim \nthat, ask yourself what you are saying. We are not going to do the \nright thing because somebody says they will not do the right thing? We \nought to do the right thing.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, because this amendment would kill the \nbill, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Florida (Mr. Rubio).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

This is important \nlegislation.\n  The President's speech is at 7 o'clock. We will gather here at 6:30 \nto proceed to the House Chamber.\n  When the President's speech is over, we will come back here, and I \nwill move to proceed to the debt ceiling vote that we know is coming. \nIf that motion to proceed fails, then we will be through for the week \nas far as votes go. If the vote to proceed is affirmative in nature, we \nwill be back tomorrow, and there will be 10 hours allowed, but we don't \nhave to use it all.\n  We will have to finish this matter tomorrow. I think it is clear that \nI hope we don't proceed to that, but we will have to see. I am here \ntomorrow. That\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nvote will start very quickly tonight, as soon as the speech is over. We \nwill be in recess subject to the call of the Chair. The vote will start \nquickly.\n  Also, I have talked to the Republican leader about how we are going \nto proceed next week. We don't have that defined, but I am waiting to \nhear from the Speaker, either tonight or tomorrow, to make more \ndefinite what we need to do next week.\n  Again, we have one more vote after the President's speech tonight.\n  Mr. President, I move to reconsider the last vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote on passage of the measure. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 6 months ago, the Senate approved the \nAmerica Invents Act to make the first meaningful, comprehensive reforms \nto the Nation's patent system in nearly 60 years. Today, the Senate has \ncome together once again, this time to send this important, job-\ncreating legislation to the President to be signed into law.\n  Casting aside partisan rhetoric, and working together in a bipartisan \nand bicameral manner, Congress is sending to President Obama the most \nsignificant jobs bill of this Congress. The bill originated 6 years ago \nin the House of Representatives, when Chairman Smith and Mr. Berman \nintroduced the first patent reform proposals.\n  After dozens of congressional hearings, markup sessions, and \nbriefings, and countless hours of Member and staff meetings, through \ntwo Presidential administrations, and three Congresses, patent reform \nis finally a reality.\n  The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act is a bipartisan bill and a \nbipartisan accomplishment. This is what we in Washington can do for our \nconstituents at home when we come together for the benefit of the \ncountry, the economy, and all Americans.\n  I especially thank Senator Kyl for his work in bringing this bill to \nthe floor of the Senate--twice--and Senator Grassley for his commitment \nto making patent reform the Judiciary Committee's top priority this \nyear. Chairman Smith, in the other body, deserves credit for leading \nthe House's consideration of this important bill. I look forward to \nworking with him on our next intellectual property priority--combating \nonline infringement.\n  I thank the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who worked \ntogether to get quorums and get this passed. I thank them for their \ncontribution.\n  Mr. President, I acknowledge several members of my Judiciary \nCommittee staff, specifically Aaron Cooper, who sits here beside me. He \nspent more hours than I even want to think about, or his family wants \nto think about, working with me, other Senators, Members of the House, \nother staff, and stakeholders to preserve the meaningful reforms \nincluded in the America Invents Act, as did Susan Davis before him. Ed \nPagano, my chief of staff, kept everybody together. I also thank Bruce \nCohen, my chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee, who every time I \nthought maybe we are not going to make it would tell me ``You have to \nkeep going,'' and he was right. Erica Chabot, Curtis LeGeyt, and Scott \nWilson of my Judiciary Committee staff have also spent many hours \nworking on this legislation.\n  I also commend the hard-working staff of other Senators, including \nJoe Matal, Rita Lari, Tim Molino, and Matt Sandgren for their \ndedication to this legislation. Chairman Smith's dedicated staff \ndeserves thanks as well, including Richard Hertling, Blaine Merritt, \nVishal Amin, and Kim Smith.\n  I would also like to thank the majority leader for his help in \npassing this critical piece of legislation.\n  The America Invents Act is now going to be the law of the land. I \nthank all my colleagues who worked together on this.\n  In March, the Senate passed its version of the America Invents Act, \nS. 23, by a 95-5 vote. One of the key provisions of the legislation \ntransitions the United States patent system from a first-to-invent \nsystem to a first-inventor-to-file system. The Senate considered and \nrejected an amendment to strike this provision, with 87 Senators voting \nto retain the transition.\n  When this body first considered the America Invents Act, some \nsuggested that along with the first-inventor-to-file transition, the \nlegislation should expand the prior user rights defense. The prior user \nrights defense, in general, is important for American manufacturers \nbecause it protects companies that invent and use a technology, whether \nembodied in a process or product, but choose not to disclose the \ninvention through the patenting process, and instead rely on trade \nsecret protection. The use of trade secrets instead of patenting may be \njustified in certain instances to avoid, for example, the \nmisappropriation by third parties where detection of that usage may be \ndifficult. These companies should be permitted to continue to practice \nthe invention, even if another party later invents and patents the same \ninvention.\n  In the United States, unlike in our major trading partners, prior \nuser rights are limited to inventions on methods of doing or conducting \nbusiness. The Senate bill included only a very limited expansion of \nthis defense, and required the Director of the Patent and Trademark \nOffice, ``PTO'', to study and report to Congress on the operation of \nprior user rights in other countries in the industrialized world, and \ninclude an analysis of whether there is a particular need for prior \nuser rights given the transition to a first-inventor-to-file system.\n  The House-originated bill, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which \nthe Senate is considering today, makes important improvements to expand \nprior user rights beyond just methods of doing business. These \nimprovements will be good for domestic manufacturing and job creation. \nI agree with the chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary that \ninclusion of expanded prior user rights is essential to ensure that \nthose who have invested in and used a technology are provided a defense \nagainst someone who later patents the technology.\n  I understand that there is some confusion regarding the scope of the \ndefense in the bill. The phrase ``commercially used the subject \nmatter'' is intended to apply broadly, and to cover a person's \ncommercial use of any form of subject matter, whether embodied in a \nprocess or embodied in a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter \nthat is used in a manufacturing or other commercial process. This is \nimportant particularly where businesses have made substantial \ninvestments to develop these proprietary technologies. And if the \ntechnology is embedded in a product, as soon as that product is \navailable publicly it will constitute prior art against any other \npatent or application for patent because the technology is inherently \ndisclosed.\n  The legislation we are considering today also retains the PTO study \nand report on prior user rights. I again agree with the chairman of the \nHouse Committee on the Judiciary, that one important area of focus will \nbe how we protect those who make substantial investments in the \ndevelopment and preparation of proprietary technologies. It is my hope \nand expectation that Congress will act quickly on any recommendations \nmade by the PTO.\n  Section 27 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act requires a study by \nthe United States Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, on effective ways \nto provide independent, confirming genetic diagnostic test activity \nwhere gen patents and exclusive licensing for primary genetic \ndiagnostic tests exist. I support this section, which was championed by \nMs. Wasserman Schultz, and look forward to the USPTO's report.\n  I want to be clear that one of the reasons I support section 27 is \nthat nothing in it implies that ``gene patents'' are valid or invalid, \nnor that any particular claim in any particular patent is valid or \ninvalid. In particular, this section has no bearing on the ongoing \nlitigation in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, \n___ F.3d ___, 2011 WL 3211513 (Fed. Cir. July 29, 2011).\n  In Kappos v. Bilksi, ___ U.S. ___, 130 S. Ct. 3218 (2010), the Court \nfound that the fact that a limited defense to business method patents \nexisted in title 35 undermined the argument that\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\nbusiness method patents were categorically exempt from patentability. \nSpecifically, the Court held that a ``conclusion that business methods \nare not patentable in any circumstances would render Sec. 273 [of title \n35] meaningless.'' Bilski, 130 S. Ct. at 3228. But the section 27 study \nis readily distinguishable from the substantive prior user rights \ndefense codified in title 35 referenced in Bilski. A ``gene patent'' \nmay or may not be valid, and that has no impact on the USPTO study, \nwhich mentions the existence of gene patents issued by the USPTO (but \nstill subject to a validity challenge), but focuses on the effect of \npatents and exclusive licensing of genetic diagnostic tests, regardless \nof whether there are relevant patents. This study will be useful and \ninformative for policymakers no matter how section 101 of title 35 is \ninterpreted by the courts.\n  There has been some question about the scope of patents that may be \nsubject to the transitional program for covered business method \npatents, which is section 18 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. \nThis provision is intended to cover only those business method patents \nintended to be used in the practice, administration, or management of \nfinancial services or products, and not to technologies common in \nbusiness environments across sectors and that have no particular \nrelation to the financial services sector, such as computers, \ncommunications networks, and business software.\n  A financial product or service is not, however, intended to be \nlimited solely to the operation of banks. Rather, it is intended to \nhave a broader industry definition that includes insurance,brokerages, \nmutual funds, annuities, andan array offinancial companies outside of \ntraditional banking.\n  Section 34 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act requires a study by \nthe Government Accountability Office, GAO, on the consequences of \npatent infringement lawsuits brought by non-practicing entities under \ntitle 35, United States Code. The legislation requires that GAO's study \ncompile information on (1) the annual volume of such litigation, (2) \nthe number of such cases found to be without merit, (3) the impact of \nsuch litigation on the time to resolve patent claims, (4) the related \ncosts, (5) the economic impact, and (6) the benefit to commerce.\n  Following the House passage of H.R. 1249, the Comptroller General \nexpressed concern that Section 34 may require it to answer certain \nquestions for which the underlying data either does not exist, or is \nnot reasonably available. Where that is the case, I want to make clear \nmy view that GAO is under no obligation to include or examine \ninformation on a subject for which there is either no existing data, or \nthat data is not reasonably obtainable. Further, GAO is not required to \nstudy a quantity of data that it deems unreasonable.\n  In my view, GAO can satisfy its requirements under section 34 by \ncompiling reasonably available information on the nature and impact of \nlawsuits brought by non-practicing entities under title 35 on the \ntopics outlined in section 34(b). Where it deems necessary, GAO may use \na smaller sample size of litigation data to fulfill this obligation. \nGAO should simply note any limitations on data or methodology in its \nreport.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nGene L. Dodaro, Comptroller General of the United States, detailing \nGAO's possible limitations in complying with section 34.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     United States\n\n\n                              Government Accountability Office\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman,\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Lamar S. Smith, Chairman,\n     Hon. John Conyers, Jr., Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     House of Representatives.\n       I am writing to express our concern regarding a provision \n     relating to GAO in H.R. 1249, the Leahy-Smith America Invents \n     Act. Section 34 of the bill would require GAO to conduct a \n     study of patent litigation brought by so-called non-\n     practicing entities, that is, plaintiffs who file suits for \n     infringement of their patents but who themselves do not have \n     the capability to design, manufacture, or distribute products \n     based on those patents. As the Supreme Court and Federal \n     Trade Commission have noted, an industry of such firms has \n     developed; the firms obtain patents not to produce and sell \n     goods but to obtain licensing fees from other companies.\n       The GAO study required by H.R. 1249 would mandate a review \n     of: (1) the annual volume of such litigation for the last 20 \n     years; (2) the number of these cases found to be without \n     merit after judicial review; (3) the impacts of such \n     litigation on the time required to resolve patent claims; (4) \n     the estimated costs associated with such litigation; (5) the \n     economic impact of such litigation on the economy; and (6) \n     the benefit to commerce, if any, supplied by such non-\n     practicing entities.\n       We believe this mandate would require GAO to undertake a \n     study involving several questions for which reliable data are \n     not available and cannot be obtained. In the first instance, \n     the mandate would require identification of non-practicing \n     entities that bring patent lawsuits. While some information \n     about these entities may be obtainable, a definitive list of \n     such entities does not exist and there is no reliable method \n     that would allow us to identify the entire set from court \n     documents or other available databases. Moreover, quantifying \n     the cases found to be meritless by a court would produce a \n     misleading result, because we understand most of these \n     lawsuits are resolved by confidential settlement. Similarly, \n     there is no current reliable source of information from which \n     to estimate the effects of litigation by such entities on \n     patent claims, litigation costs, economic impacts, or \n     benefits to commerce. Further, because GAO does not have \n     legal access to these private parties, we would have to rely \n     on voluntary production of such information, a method we \n     believe would be unreliable under these circumstances and \n     would yield information that is not likely to be comparable \n     from entity to entity.\n       Finally, empirical estimates of the effects of patent \n     litigation on various economic variables would likely be \n     highly tenuous. Measures of the cost of litigation or other \n     variables related to quantifying patents or litigation would \n     be highly uncertain and any relationships derived would \n     likely be highly sensitive to small changes in these \n     measures. Such relationships are likely to lead to \n     inconclusive results, or results so heavily qualified that \n     they likely would not be meaningful or helpful to the \n     Congress. In that regard, we understand recent regulatory \n     efforts to determine the economic and anti-competitive \n     effects of such litigation have not been successful.\n       We appreciate your consideration of this matter and we \n     would be happy to work with your staff regarding potential \n     alternatives. GAO could, for example, identify what is \n     currently known about each of the specific elements \n     identified in Section 34. Managing Associate General Counsel \n     Susan Sawtelle, at (202) 512-6417 or SawtelleS@gao.gov, or \n     Congressional Relations Assistant Director Paul Thompson, at \n     (202) 512-9867 or ThompsonP@gao.gov, may be contacted \n     regarding these matters.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Gene L. Dodaro,\n                         Comptroller General of the United States.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The America Invents Act is now going to be the law of the \nland. I thank all my colleagues who worked together on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, rising in opposition, this is not a \npatent reform bill, this is a big corporation patent giveaway that \ntramples on the rights of small inventors. It changes ``first to \ninvent'' to ``first to file,'' which means if you are a big corporation \nand have lots of resources, you will get there and get the patent.\n  Secondly, it doesn't keep the money where it belongs. It belongs in \nthe Patent Office. Yet, instead of having reforms that will help us \nexpedite patents, it is giving away the money that is needed to make \nthis kind of innovation work.\n  Third, the bill is full of special giveaways to particular industry \ncorporations, as we have just witnessed with votes on the floor.\n  Fourth, by taking away the business patent method language, you will \nmake it more complicated and have years and years of lawsuits on \npatents that have already been issued. If this is job creation, I have \nnews for my colleagues; in an innovation economy, it is siding with \ncorporate interests against the little guy. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I voted against passage of the \npatent reform bill because it contained an egregious example of \ncorporate welfare and blatant earmarking. Unfortunately, this special \ninterest provision was designed to benefit a single interest and was \ntucked into what was otherwise a worthwhile patent reform bill. As I \nnoted earlier today when I spoke in support of the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, needed reform of our \npatent laws should not be diminished nor impaired by inclusion of the \nshameless special interest provision, dubbed ``The Dog Ate My Homework \nAct'' that benefits a single drug manufacturer, Medicines & Company, to \nexcuse their failure to follow the drug patent laws on the books for \nover 20 years.\n  Again, as I said earlier today, patent holders who wish to file an \nextension of their patent have a 60-day window to make the routine \napplication. There is no ambiguity in this timeframe. In fact, there is \nno reason to wait until the last day. A patent holder can file an \nextension application anytime within the 60-day period. Indeed, \nhundreds and hundreds of drug patent extension applications have been \nfiled since the law was enacted. Four have been late. Four.\n  I remind my colleagues of what the Wall Street Journal had to say \nabout this provision:\n\n       As blunders go, this was big. The loss of patent rights \n     means that generic versions of Angiomax might have been able \n     to hit pharmacies since 2010, costing the Medicines Co. \n     between $500 million and $1 billion in profits.\n       If only the story ended there.\n       Instead, the Medicines Co. has mounted a lobbying offensive \n     to get Congress to end run the judicial system. Since 2006, \n     the Medicines Co. has wrangled bill after bill onto the floor \n     of Congress that would change the rules retroactively or give \n     the Patent Office director discretion to accept late filings. \n     One version was so overtly drawn as an earmark that it \n     specified a $65 million penalty for late filing for ``a \n     patent term extension . . . for a drug intended for use in \n     humans that is in the anticoagulant class of drugs.''\n       . . . no one would pretend the impetus for this measure \n     isn't an insider favor to save $214 million for a Washington \n     law firm and perhaps more for the Medicines Co. There was \n     never a problem to fix here. In a 2006 House Judiciary \n     hearing, the Patent Office noted that of 700 patent \n     applications since 1984, only four had missed the 60-day \n     deadline. No wonder critics are calling it the Dog Ate My \n     Homework Act.\n\n  This bailout provision was not included in the Senate-passed Patent \nbill earlier this year. It was added by the House of Representatives. \nThe provision should have been stripped by the Senate earlier today. \nThe fact that it wasn't required me to vote against final passage.\n Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, due to health concerns of my mother, \nI was absent for the motion to table amendment No. 599 offered by \nSenator Coburn to H.R. 1249, the America Invents Act, final passage of \nH.R. 1249, and on S.J. Res. 25.\n  Had I been present for the motion to table amendment No. 599 offered \nby Senator Coburn to H.R. 1249, I would have opposed the motion in \nsupport of the underlying amendment, and would have voted ``nay'' on \nfinal passage of the America Invents Act. H.R. 1249 is significantly \ndifferent than the original Senate bill that I supported, and will \nultimately not accomplish the goal of modernizing the patent process in \nthe United States in the most effective manner.\n  The patent process in our country is painfully slow and inefficient. \nIt takes years from the time an invention is submitted to the Patent \nand Trade Office, PTO, to the time that the patent is granted and the \nholder of the patent gains legal rights to their invention. Currently, \nthere are over 700,000 patents waiting for their first review by the \nPTO. I supported the original Senate bill, S.23, which would have \nensured that the PTO was properly funded, reducing the time between the \nfiling of a patent and the granting of the same. This bill, which \npassed the Senate by a 95-5 margin on March 8, 2011, included critical \nprovisions that would have ensured that user fees paid to the PTO would \nstay within the Office to cover its operating costs, rather being \ndiverted to fund unrelated government programs.\n  Unfortunately, the House of Representatives removed these important \nprovisions, which were critical to securing my support for patent \nreform. A modernized patent process that restricted ``fee diversion'' \nwould have spurred innovation and job creation. Small inventors have \nraised concerns about the new patent processes that the bill sets \nforth, and without adequate protections against fee diversion, I am \nunable to support this bill. Additionally, I have concerns about House \nlanguage that resolves certain legal issues for a limited group of \npatent holders. I support the underlying goals of this bill, but for \nthe aforementioned reasons, I would have voted ``nay'' on H.R. 1249 had \nI been present.\n  Had I been present for the rollcall vote on S.J. Res. 25, I would \nhave voted ``yea.'' I strongly disapprove of the surge in Federal \nspending that has pushed our national debt to $14.7 trillion, and \nfirmly believe that Congress must cut spending immediately and send a \nstrict constitutional balanced budget amendment to the States for \nratification. We must also give job creators the certainty they need to \nhire new workers and expand operations, growing the economy and \nincreasing revenue in the process. Instead of pretending that more \ndebt-financed spending will create prosperity, Congress should take \njob-destroying tax hikes off the table, overhaul our burdensome \nregulatory system, and immediately pass the pending free trade \nagreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to explain my vote on one amendment \ntoday. But I would first like to commend Chairman Leahy for his long \nyears of work on patent reform, which culminated in final passage this \nevening of the America Invents Act. I proudly supported this \nlegislation, and I am sure it's gratifying for the senior Senator from \nVermont that the Senate overwhelmingly voted to send this bill to the \nPresident's desk.\n  But like most bills that the Senate considers, this legislation is \nnot perfect, as I know the chairman himself has said. There is one \nmajor way that the bill we approved today could have been improved, and \nthat is if we had retained language in the original Senate bill that \nguaranteed that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would be able to \nmaintain an independent funding stream. For that reason, I commend \nSenator Coburn for his effort to amend the bill to revert back to that \nbetter funding mechanism. For years, we have asked the PTO to do more \nthan its funding levels have allowed it to do well. And while the bill \nwe passed today takes important steps towards committing more resources \nto\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\nthe PTO, I did prefer the independent funding stream approach.\n  Senator Coburn's amendment may have been the better approach, but I \nvoted to table the amendment because it could well have permanently \nsunk this enormously important legislation. Sending the bill back to \nthe House with new language that the House has rejected and says it \nwould reject again would have, at best, substantially delayed the \nreform effort and, at worst, stymied the bill just when we were \nreaching the finish line. And this bill is important it can help our \neconomy at a critical juncture and can even result in my state of \nColorado getting a satellite PTO office, which would be a major jobs \nand economic driver. I also worked with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to include important provisions that will help small businesses. \nNone of this would have been possible if we amended the bill at this \nlate stage.\n  I remain committed to working with colleagues in the coming months \nand years to make sure that PTO gets the resources it needs to do the \njob that Congress has asked it to do.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nbill was passed, and I also move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5443-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on Sunday, this Nation will pause to \nremember a painful day in American history.\n  On September 11, 2001, I was glued to the radio in my pickup on a \nlong drive back home to Big Sandy. It wasn't until I stopped at a \nBillings restaurant that I finally saw on TV what I had heard about all \nday. The pictures were surreal.\n  Although the attacks of 9/11 weren't America's first test of \nuncertainty, all of us knew this Nation would change forever.\n  In the hours and days and weeks following the attacks of September \n11, 2001, Americans, neighbors, and perfect strangers joined together \nto fill the streets despite their differences. They poured out their \nsupport. They redefined the United States of America. I knew then that \nthis great Nation would overcome. Events that unite us will always make \nus stronger. I was reminded of that on May 2, when Navy SEALs found and \nbrought swift justice to Osama bin Laden, prompting spontaneous \ncelebrations across Montana and the rest of the country.\n  We must never lose sight of our ability to find common ground and \nwork together on major issues that affect us all. We have much more in \ncommon than not, and we should never forget that. It is what built this \ncountry. It is what made this the best Nation on Earth, and we need to \nsummon that spirit again as we work to rebuild our economy.\n  Over the past decade, we have been reminded of some powerful truths \nthat we can never afford to lose sight of. We can never take the \nsecurity of this country for granted. There are and, sadly, always will \nbe people out there bent on destroying what America stands for, taking \ninnocent lives with them. They are always looking for the weakest links \nin our security. They are trained and well financed. But our Nation's \ntroops, our intelligence agents, our law enforcement and border \nsecurity officers are even better trained.\n  I am particularly concerned about weaknesses along the Montana \nnorthern border with Canada. Up until recently, only a few orange cones \nin the middle of a road protected the country from terrorism. \nUnfortunately, the days when orange cones did the trick are behind us.\n  I have worked on the Homeland Security Committee to improve this \nNation's security, and things are better than they were a decade ago. \nWe are still working to achieve the right mix of people, technology, \nand know-how to secure the northern border.\n  We have also been reminded that America's military can achieve \nanything asked of it. This comes with a cost. Similar to so many folks \nof the greatest generation after Pearl Harbor day, hundreds of \nMontanans signed up to defend our country after 9/11. I stand in deep \nappreciation for the men and women who, in those dark hours, stood for \nour country. I thank them and their families for their service, their \nsacrifice, and their patriotism.\n  In the years since 9/11, American forces have paid a tremendous price \nin Iraq and Afghanistan in lives and livelihoods. Until only a few \nyears ago, veterans had to fight another battle at home trying to get \naccess to the benefits they were promised. Too many veterans are still \nfighting for adequate funding and access to quality health care \nservices that they have earned. As one veteran said, ``The day this \nNation stops taking care of her veterans is the day this Nation should \nstop creating them.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  Montanans are reminded that some out there are still willing to \ninvade our privacy and trample on our Constitution in the name of \nsecurity and freedom. Measures such as the PATRIOT Act, which I have \nconsistently opposed, forfeit some basic freedoms. Some lawmakers \naren't stopping there.\n  In the House, a bill called the National Security and Federal Lands \nProtection Act would allow the Department of Homeland Security to waive \nlaws and seize control of public lands within 100 miles of the border, \neven if that means closing off grazing lands, shuttering national \nparks, and trampling on the rights of private land owners. That would \nhave an enormous impact on the whole of Montana. If bad bills such as \nthat are turned into law, America loses.\n  Our Constitution is a powerful document, and terrorists want nothing \nmore than to watch our rights crumble away by the weight of our own \npolicies. We can, and we will, remain strong. But we must do it with \nrespect to our rights and freedoms.\n  Today, as on Sunday, my prayers are with those Americans who have \ndied at the hands of terrorists on and since 9/11 and for the tens of \nthousands of troops still on the frontlines in Afghanistan and \nelsewhere and for the families of thousands of American troops who have \ndied in service to this country since that terrible day.\n  My wife Charlotte and I stand with all Montanans in saying thank you \nto the members of our military, present and past, especially those who \nhave come home with injuries, seen and unseen. This Nation will never \nforget your sacrifices.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, many of us remember exactly where we \nwere on the morning of September 11, 2001. We will never forget the \nfootage from New York as the towers fell, from the Pentagon as fire \nraged, and from Pennsylvania, where United flight 93 was grounded in a \nfield. We questioned who would do this, if another attack was coming, \nand if we were safe in our own country anymore. The tragedy suffered by \nour nation on that day left us with important lessons to learn, \nimprovements to make, and a renewed sense of urgency towards the future \nof our society and national security.\n  On that Tuesday morning, we were victims of a terrible attack that \nkilled 2,961 American citizens, destroyed $15 billion of property, and \nlaunched us into a battle we continue to fight. The actions of the \nterrorists also sparked the spirit of a nation united. It left us with \na resolve to regroup, rebuild and recover while renewing our country's \nreputation as a world leader and symbol of freedom.\n  The impacts of 9/11 were not lost on Alaskans. Although thousands of \nmiles away at the moment of attack, Alaskans sprung into action to help \ntheir countrymen in any way possible. Some deployed to Ground Zero, \nsome sponsored fundraisers or blood drives, and some to this day are \nserving their country in the ongoing operations in\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\nAfghanistan, Iraq and around the world.\n  Today, we pay homage to our fallen heroes. On Sunday, I will join my \nfellow Alaskans in honoring those courageous first responders at the \n2011 Alaska Fallen Firefighter Memorial Ceremony and 9/11 Remembrance \nin Anchorage. We will remember firefighters and other first responders \nwho gave their lives on September 11, 2001 and since then. To them, \nemergency response was far more than a job--it was a vocation they felt \nwas worth risking their lives in the face of incredible danger.\n  I urge Alaskans to join with all Americans across the country to \nserve their neighbors and communities on what Congress has deemed \nPatriot Day.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, our Nation will soon observe and reflect \non the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.\n  A decade after vicious terrorist attacks killed thousands of innocent \npeople and caused immeasurable grief to victims and survivors, America \nhas shown the world that 9/11 may have changed life as we knew it, but \nit has not changed America's commitment to freedom, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness.\n  The national tragedy tapped an overwhelming sense of solidarity and \nsacrifice among Americans from across the country. Consider the \nselfless acts of courage and patriotism from the moment the hijackers \ncommandeered three airplanes on that clear September morning 10 years \nago: from the passengers aboard United flight 93, to the first \nresponders who reported to the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and \nthe heroes who serve on the front lines from within the Nation's \nmilitary and from behind-the-scenes in our intelligence and \ncounterterrorism operations.\n  Thanks to the allegiance of public servants and private citizens, our \nmen and women in uniform and our captains of commerce and industry, the \nUnited States of America continues to serve as a beacon of hope, \nfreedom and opportunity to the rest of the world. Those who sought to \nundermine the exceptionalism of the American people underestimated the \nresiliency of the American people.\n  Consider the recent protests across the globe, where after decades of \noppression, the people of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya have thrown out \nautocratic regimes in the pursuit of self-government, economic \nopportunity, higher standards of living and personal freedoms. The 10th \nanniversary of 9/11 offers Americans and our friends around the world \nthe opportunity to embrace the common threads that tie us together.\n  For more than two centuries, the United States has attracted millions \nof newcomers to live and work in the land of opportunity. Generations \nof Americans have scaled the ladder of economic and social mobility, \nenjoyed the freedoms of press, speech and religion, and embraced the \nups and downs of entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation. \nUnleashing the power of the individual has served as a catalyst for \neconomic growth and prosperity for the last 235 years.\n  Along the way, the United States evolved as an economic, cultural and \nmilitary leader in the world. The 9/11 terror attacks dealt a \ndevastating blow to America and all of humanity. And yet, 10 years \nlater, America still stands as the shining city on the hill. Despite \nthe economic downturn, America still bears the promise of better days \nahead. Despite high unemployment and unprecedented public debt, the \nAmerican dream still serves as the magical elixir that ultimately \ndefines the Nation's resiliency and bone-deep belief in the goodness of \nAmerica.\n  That bone-deep belief in the goodness of America flows through the \nveins of those called to serve their country in the U.S. military, \nincluding one of Iowa's own hometown heroes who lost his life in the \nline of duty this summer. Jon Tumilson enlisted in the Navy after \ngraduating from high school in 1995. A 35-year-old Navy SEAL from \nRockford, he was one of 30 Americans killed in one of the deadliest \nattacks on U.S. forces since 9/11. My wife and I were able to pay our \nrespects to this fallen Navy SEAL at his funeral in August. The long-\ntime Iowa Hawkeye football and wrestling fan left behind family members \nand loved ones, including his beloved Labrador retriever named Hawkeye. \nThe black lab led family members into the school gymnasium for the \nservice and proceeded to lie next to the casket of his owner. They say \na picture is worth a 1,000 words. The image of Tumilson's dog lying \nnext to the flag-draped casket brought three words to mind; loyalty, \nloss and love.\n  I honor the memory of the many Iowans who've died in military service \nsince 9/11, and all the soldiers and veterans who have served their \ncountry to protect U.S. national security and preserve our American way \nof life.\n  May their sacrifice remind us of their bone-deep belief in America's \ngoodness. We must keep their legacy and love of country close to mind \nas we work to put America back on the right track towards economic \ngrowth and prosperity.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Sunday is September 11. It will be 10 years \nafter thousands perished in the worst terrorist attack the United \nStates has ever seen. It was a day America lost fathers, mothers, \nsisters and brothers, and it was a day we will never forget.\n  With that historic date approaching, I think that it is imperative \nthat we honor the tremendous bravery of our public safety officials. \nEvery day they are on the front lines in one of our Nation's most \npressing battles--protecting our neighborhoods, our communities, and \nresponding fearlessly when tragedy strikes. And it is around this time \nevery year that we particularly remember their bravery in responding to \none of the most horrific tragedies of all.\n  The best way to honor our first responders is to make sure we are \ngiving them the tools they need to be successful, to be safe and to do \ntheir job in a way that does not expose them to needless dangers. Right \nnow, it is unimaginable, but we are not doing that. When it comes to \npublic safety communications, these everyday heroes don't have the \nnetworks they need and depend on.\n  Too often first responders lack the interoperable networks that are \nessential to providing an effective response in emergencies. They lack \nthe ability to communicate with one another, with other agencies and \nacross different city and state lines. This hampers our ability to \nrespond to crisis. Whether that crisis is a terrorist attack or natural \ndisaster, it puts lives in unnecessary danger.\n  Shouldn't a firefighter be able to wirelessly download a floor plan \nof a burning building before running into it? Shouldn't a police \nofficer be able to receive an immediate digital snapshot of a dangerous \ncriminal? And shouldn't an emergency medical technician be able to \nreceive life-saving medical information on a patient following an \naccident? If the average American traveler is able to wirelessly pull \nup a map to route a summer road trip why shouldn't our first responders \nbe able to utilize the same type of technology to save lives?\n  Far too much time has passed for Congress to not act. That is why I \nhave been working, side by side with the Commerce Committee's ranking \nmember, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to pass S. 911, the Public Safety \nSpectrum and Wireless Innovation Act. This bipartisan legislation would \nimplement a nationwide, interoperable wireless broadband communications \nnetwork for our first responders.\n  It would set aside the 10 megahertz of spectrum known as the ``D-\nblock'' for public safety to support the network and help foster \ncommunications for our first responders across the country.\n  It would also give the Federal Communications Commission the \nauthority to hold incentive auctions based on the voluntary return of \nspectrum. These auctions, in turn, will provide funding to support the \nconstruction and maintenance of a public safety network and will free \nup additional spectrum for innovative commercial uses. In an industry \nthat has created 420,000 new jobs over the past decade, this bill is \ncrucial to that continued growth.\n  In short, this bill marries much needed resources for first \nresponders with smart commercial spectrum policy. It can keep us safe--\nand help grow our economy. That is why this legislation has the support \nof every major public\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nsafety organization across the country including in my State of West \nVirginia. It is also why this bill has strong support from governors \nand mayors across the country and why we have the support of our \nPresident and the administration.\n  This week, as we come together as a nation to remember and honor the \nlives lost on 9/11, I also urge my colleagues to support the Public \nSafety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act. And to those who say we \ncannot afford to do this now, I say we cannot afford not to. Because \nthis effort is about saving lives. But if this reason is not compelling \nenough, it is important to know this: this legislation pays for itself. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and even the \nindustry itself, incentive auctions will bring in revenue well above \nwhat funding public safety requires, leaving billions over for deficit \nreduction. This is a win-win-win.\n  In closing, let me say that we have a once-in-a-generation \nopportunity to provide our public safety officials with the spectrum \nthey need to communicate when tragedy strikes. And with voluntary \nincentive auctions we can pair this with funding.\n  Let's seize this moment. This is not Republican, this is not \nDemocrat. It is quite simply the right thing to do. Let's do something \nhistoric--together.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in \ncommemorating the 10th anniversary of September 11, 2001. I remember \nthat morning so vividly. It was stunningly clear and beautiful with a \ncrispness in the air that hinted that fall was just around the corner. \nAnd then, with a sudden ferocity, the airliners crashed into the World \nTrade Center, WTC, the Pentagon, and Somerset County, PA. Barely 2 \nhours elapsed between the first hijacking and the collapse of the North \nTower of the WTC, 2 horrific hours that forever changed our Nation and \nthe world.\n  We mourn the lives that were lost in New York City, here in the \nWashington metropolitan area, and in Pennsylvania. The emotional trauma \nof those losses affected each and every American. Millions of us \nremained glued to our TV sets, watching unbearable images of death and \ndestruction.\n  We remember the 3,000 people who perished on 9/11. The attacks spared \nno one: Blacks, Whites, Christians, Jews, and Muslims; the young and \nold; parents, children, siblings; Americans and foreigners--all these \nand more were among the victims. The attack was not on one ethnic \ngroup, but on a way of life. It was an attack on our freedom and our \ndedication to its preservation.\n  We honor the selfless actions of our first responders, including \nfirefighters, police, paramedics, and other emergency and medical \npersonnel, all of whom did not hesitate to answer the call of duty and \ndemonstrated extraordinary bravery and courage in our hours of need.\n  We also honor our brave service men and women who have taken the \nfight to the terrorists on foreign soil. We must never forget our \ncountry's solemn obligation to our service men and women, our veterans, \nand their families.\n  There is no question that 9/11 and the days that followed were \ndifficult ones. But they were also among our proudest ones. It brought \nout the best of the American spirit. Men and women waited in lines for \nhours to give blood, children donated their savings to help with relief \nefforts, communities sponsored clothing drives, and different faith \ngroups held interfaith services.\n  On 9/11 and in the days and months that followed, Americans stood \ntogether. Our response showed the world that Americans have an \nunquenchable love of freedom and democracy. It showed American \nresilience, vigilance, and resolve.\n  Much has changed since that day in September. The 9/11 attacks \npropelled our Nation into a new kind of warfare, unlike any war we have \never fought. They exposed the scope, depth, and utter ruthlessness of \nthe al-Qaida network. And the attacks revealed gaps in our national \nsecurity. Evolving threats required new tools.\n  I am proud of how far we have come in addressing the challenge \npresented by al-Qaida or other terrorist organizations. While our \nsecurity networks are far from perfect, in the decade since the 9/11 \nattacks, we created the Department of Homeland Security to streamline \nand better integrate the Federal departments and agencies responsible \nfor protecting us. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement at all levels \nhave become much more aggressive in pursuing terrorist threats at home \nand abroad. These measures have been largely successful.\n  And let us remember arguably our greatest success against al-Qaida: \nPresident Obama's bold stroke to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. The \nraid was the result of painstaking intelligence gathering and analysis \nand thorough planning, and it was a remarkable display of our Special \nForces capabilities and the extraordinary heroism of our men and women \nin uniform.\n  The end of al-Qaida is in sight. Their future is bleak. They have far \nless global impact than they used to. They cling to an outdated and \nempty ideology, with little mainstream influence in the Muslim world. \nIndeed, the recent Arab Spring demonstrates that people in Middle \nEastern countries--especially young people--are more interested in \nfreedom and democracy than in being susceptible to al-Qaida's \nrepressive ideology.\n  Even as al-Qaida becomes more and more marginalized, evolving state- \nand nonstate-sponsored threats to our Nation's security persist. One of \nour greatest challenges will be securing cyberspace. The Internet has \ngrown into one of the most remarkable innovations in human history. But \nit carries risks.\n  Our current system allows hackers, spies, and terrorists to gain \naccess to classified and other vital information. Today's cyber \ncriminals, armed with the right tools, can steal our identities, \ncorrupt our financial networks, and disrupt government operations. \nTackling cybersecurity in a meaningful way will fill one of the last \nholes that exist in our national security regime.\n  As our government moves to extinguish the remnant of al-Qaida and \naddress new threats, we must strive to maintain a careful balance \nbetween protecting our Nation and protecting our civil liberties. \nCommemorating 9/11 should remind us of what makes us unique as a \nnation. Our country's strength lies in its diversity and our ability to \nhave strongly held beliefs and differences of opinion, while being able \nto speak freely and not fear that we will be discriminated against by \nour government or our fellow citizens.\n  After the 9/11 attacks, I went back to my congressional district and \nmade three visits as a Congressman. First, I visited a synagogue and we \nprayed together. Then, I visited a mosque and we prayed together. \nFinally, I visited a church and we prayed together. On that day in \nSeptember, Americans banded together, regardless of our personal belief \nor religion.\n  My message that day was clear: we needed to condemn the terrorist \nattacks and to take all necessary measures to eliminate safe havens for \nterrorists and bring them to justice. But my other message that day was \nequally important: we cannot allow the events of 9/11 to make us \ndemonize a particular religion, nationality, creed, or community. In \nthese trying times, we cannot let our society succumb to the temptation \nto scapegoat one group.\n  We did it before--with the Palmer Raids following World War I, the \ninternment of 120,000 Japanese-American citizens during World War II, \nand the McCarthy-era witch hunts. These were shameful events of our \nhistory. We must strive to live up to our Nation's highest ideals and \nprotect our precious civil liberties, even when doing so is difficult \nor unpopular. We must always remember how we stood united on 9/11 and \nshowed the world the depth of our commitment to ``E Pluribus Unum.'' \nOut of many, one.\n  Our many faiths, origins, and appearances should bind us together, \nnot break us apart. They should be a source of strength and \nenlightenment, not discord and enmity. All of us belong to smaller \ncommunities within the larger community we call the United States. Each \ncommunity has an obligation to the larger community to promote the \nsafety and well-being of each and every one of us. There is a mutual \nself-interest in preserving and nurturing our freedom.\n  September 11, 2001, was a dark day. We remember those who perished \nand mourn with those who lost family and friends. We honor those who \nresponded and those who fought and continue to fight to keep us safe.\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\n  Archibald MacLeish wrote, ``There are those who will say that the \nliberation of humanity, the freedom of man and mind, is nothing but a \ndream. They are right. It is the American dream.'' 9/11 was a \nnightmare. As horrific and cruel as it was, however, it can't \nextinguish the dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5446-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DEBRA BROWN STEINBERG\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the attacks of September 11, 2001, \ncertainly had a profound impact on all Americans. In addition to the \nsadness, anger, fear, and, ultimately, resolve, we all felt in the \naftermath of the attacks, many were also infused with a renewed sense \nof patriotism and fellowship that inspired them to engage in public and \ncommunity service. As we approach the tenth anniversary of this \nterrible tragedy, I would like to honor one individual who answered the \ncall to service, and who has done so much to help victims of the \nattack, Debra Brown Steinberg.\n  Debra was in New York City on September 11, and from her apartment \nshe could see the smoke pouring out from the World Trade Center. As she \ndesperately waited for news about her stepson, she made an agreement \nwith God: if her stepson would come home safely, she would work to help \nthe victims of the attack. Thankfully, her stepson did come home \nsafely, and Debra has more than fulfilled her promise.\n  Utilizing her sharp legal acumen and more than 30 years of \nprofessional experience, Debra has become a passionate advocate for the \nfamilies of those who perished in the 9/11 attacks. A partner in the \nrespected New York firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, Debra was \nintegral in putting together a consortium of law firms that have worked \ntogether to deliver pro bono services to 9/11 families.\n  Early on, Debra realized that, if her firm was going to give victims \nthe assistance they truly needed, they would have to do more than \nsimply offer free legal advice. Under her direction, the consortium has \ntaken a holistic approach toward assisting the families; not just \noffering counsel, but also seeking to ensure they receive the services \nthey need, and lobbying lawmakers and regulators to ensure that all \nvictims have access to the Victim Compensation Fund. Debra has also \nrepresented many victims' families, pro bono, before the fund to ensure \nthat they are fairly compensated.\n  Perhaps Debra's most amazing work has been her advocacy on behalf of \nsome of the most vulnerable victims of the attacks: immigrants who were \nin the country illegally when their relatives were killed during the \nattacks on the World Trade Center. These individuals, as the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security has put it, ``share with all Americans \na moment of loss and pain and pride that is now a defining part of our \nnational history.'' However, because of their status, they were forced \nto cope with their pain and sadness in isolation, afraid to seek \nassistance or to offer their help for fear of being found out. Our \nNation cannot help but feel a deep connection and commitment to this \ngroup.\n  Debra has worked tirelessly to assure that we live up to this \ncommitment and to enable these victims to participate in rebuilding \nafter the attacks. With her guidance, 11 of these spouses and children \nof innocent victims of the attacks have provided assistance to the \nFederal Government in its 9/11 related investigations and prosecutions. \nDebra also successfully represented these families before the Victim \nCompensation Fund to ensure that they received equal consideration. \nFinally, she has fought doggedly to ensure that these families can \ncontinue to work and live in the United States. Due in great part to \nher work, these family members have so far been able to stay in the \nUnited States and their cases are now being considered for a temporary \nvisa that would allow them to live and work legally in the United \nStates. Let us all hope that DHS is able to quickly conduct its review \nso that these families can leave the shadows and rebuild their lives.\n  Over the years, my office has had the privilege of assisting Debra in \nher efforts, and I have witnessed firsthand her dedication to assisting \nthe families of 9/11 victims. Those she has represented are certainly \nlucky to have had her on their side. Given all that Debra has done, \nit's no wonder that the American Bar Association honored her with the \nprestigious Pro Bono Publico award in 2006. She has also received the \n9/11 Tribute Center Award in 2009 and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor \nin 2007. Her work has also been recognized several times by my \ncolleagues here in the Senate, as well as in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the New York State Legislature.\n  Mr. President, I commend Debra Brown Steinberg for her commitment to \nassisting families of 9/11 victims. Her efforts truly personify the \nAmerican values of fairness and patriotism. The U.S. Senate, and the \nAmerican People, owe her our sincerest gratitude.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in morning business to talk \nabout a situation in Texas, the wildfires and the drought.\n  Since we were mostly home during the August recess, I saw the floods \nin the Midwest and on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. I saw the \nhurricane that hit New York and all along the East Coast. At the same \ntime, with all the extra water in the East, we have had as much as 60 \ndays in parts of Texas with no rain whatsoever. The drought is killing \nlivestock. It is killing land. It is a sad situation. What has \nhappened, of course, is, from that, the wildfires have been able to go \nfarther than we have ever seen in Texas before.\n  Just in the past 7 days, the Texas Forest Service has responded to \n176 fires, destroying nearly 130,000 acres. This year alone, over 2,000 \nfires have burned more than 2 million acres in Texas. We have high \nwinds and drought conditions, which are a terrible combination in this \ninstance.\n  Yesterday, the Texas Forest Service responded to 20 new fires, which \nconsumed nearly 1,500 more acres. One of the hardest hit areas is \nBastrop County, which is near Austin. I was talking to some of my \nconstituents in Houston, which is not near Austin, and they were \ntalking about seeing and smelling the smoke in Houston from these fires \nin Bastrop.\n  An assessment has been completed as of now that says 785 homes were \ncompletely destroyed, 238 homes have been reported lost as a result of \nother fires over the past 3 days, and the fires are so big that they \nare being photographed from space.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have asked the President to add the recent \nwildfires from just this last week to his previous disaster declaration \nfrom this spring, which did include wildfires. I want the people of \nTexas to know that Senator Cornyn and I are working together to get all \nthe Federal help they need. I have been in contact with the State \nrepresentatives from the area, the mayors, and the county judges to get \nthe reports. So far they feel they have gotten the help they have \nneeded. But now, in the aftermath, we will need to be part of any kind \nof disaster bill that goes through this Senate or is declared by the \nPresident.\n  It is my hope we can work through that next week and make sure we \ninclude these most recent fires along with the flood disaster relief \nthat supposedly will come to the floor next week. So we are going to \nwork on it and try to help these people. We can't replace the \ngraduation pictures and the wedding pictures and the children's \npictures that are lost. This is the human loss you see in this type of \na situation. But we can certainly help these people rebuild, and that \nis what we want to do.\n  We are going to be on the job trying to help in every way we can, \nknowing there will not be a 100-percent replacement because the \nphotographs and the personal items and grandmother's wedding ring may \nnot be recovered, but we are going to do what we can, as Americans \nalways do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this afternoon, we held a hearing in the\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\nConstitutional Subcommittee on the Senate Judiciary Committee on new \nvoting laws that are being passed in many States. It was one of the \nfirst hearings on Capitol Hill on the subject, and I thank you very \nmuch for attending as a member of the subcommittee.\n  We had an array of witnesses, starting with Members of the Senate and \nMembers of the House of Representatives, expressing various points of \nview on this issue. What we discussed was the new laws in States that \nare establishing new standards for voting in America. It is essential \nfor us on this subcommittee, with our jurisdiction and responsibility, \nto focus on this issue of voting rights.\n  As has been said so many times, there is no more important right in \nAmerica. The right to vote is a right people have given their lives \nfor.\n  As we look at the checkered history of the United States, we find \nthat though we honor the right to vote, from the very beginning, we \nhave compromised that principle. We started off with requirements of \nproperty ownership. We didn't allow women to vote for so long. African \nAmericans were not given that opportunity for decades. Over the years, \nwe have had as many as 10 different constitutional amendments focusing \non extending the right to vote.\n  When we get to the heart of a democracy, it is about voting. That is \nwhy these new State laws are so important and so important for us to \nreflect on.\n  Requiring a photo ID for most of us at this station in life or who \nare in business, it seems like a very common request. We present our \nIDs when we get on airplanes and in so many different places. But for a \nsubstantial percentage of Americans, they don't carry a government-\nissued ID. They live their lives without the need of one. Now State \nlaws are requiring these IDs for people before they can vote. It sounds \nlike a minor inconvenience, and for many people it would be just that. \nBut for others, it could be more.\n  If there is not a good opportunity for a person to acquire an ID \nwithout cost, in a fashion that doesn't create hardship, many people \nwill be discouraged from voting. They will just think: This is another \nobstacle in the path of exercising my right to vote, and maybe I will \nstay home.\n  That is not good for a democracy. We should be leaning in the other \ndirection, trying to expand the electorate, expand the voting populous \nin this country, expand the voice of the voters in this country, not \nthe opposite. Many of these State laws in the seven States that have \nnow put in photo IDs create significant hardships.\n  We have a problem in Wisconsin, for example, and I have written to \nthe Governor asking him to give me his impression of how he will deal \nwith these issues.\n  One out of five people in Wisconsin do not have an ID; 177,000 \nelderly people in Wisconsin do not have the ID required by law; more \nthan one-third of young people don't have an ID. Particularly among \nAfrican Americans under the age of 24, 70 percent do not have the ID \nnecessary to vote in Wisconsin. So, you say, they have their chance. \nThe election will not be until next year, they have plenty of time.\n\n  It turns out that in the State of Wisconsin there is only one \nDivision of Motor Vehicles Office that is open on a weekend in the \nentire State. That to me seems unconscionable and unacceptable. We need \nto take a hard look at this and the first stop will be the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Department of Justice.\n  They asked me after the hearing today, what are we going to do next? \nThey said what we will do next is follow the law. The law says the \nDepartment of Justice has to weigh each of these changes, whether it is \nvoter registration in Florida or whether it is the voter ID or the \nlimitation on early voting and decide whether this violates the basic \nstandards of the Voting Rights Act. They have 60 days to do so after \nthe law is enacted.\n  I have spoken to the division, Civil Rights Division. It is my \nimpression they are going to move on this in a timely fashion. This is \na critical issue. I am afraid it is way too political. The forces \nbehind change in virtually every State--not every one but virtually \nevery State--have come from the same political side of the equation. It \nis not lost on those of us who do this for a living what is at stake \nhere. If certain people are denied access to the polls, discouraged to \nvote, and those people turn out to be historically those voting on one \nside or the other, it is going to create not only a personal hardship \nbut a distortion in the election outcome and I hope we can sincerely \nwork together on the Judiciary Committee and with the Department of \nJustice to resolve this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5447-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5447-S5448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ANNE WALL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to thank a \nremarkable person on my staff who is moving to a new job. Anne Wall of \nChicago is one of my most trusted staff members. She has been my Senate \nfloor director for more than two years. A few C-SPAN viewers may \nrecognize Anne as a regular on the floor of the Senate. Those of us who \nworked closely with her on both sides of the aisle know she is one of \nthe smartest, hardest working, and most gracious members of the Senate \ncommunity. No matter how early in the morning or late at night, Anne \nWall is always there with a smile and a good answer. If an agreement \nneeds to be worked out, Anne is there to offer a fair and constructive \nsolution.\n  Next week Anne Wall starts an exciting new chapter in her life. My \nloss is the gain of a former Senator from Illinois, President Barack \nObama. Anne is going to the White House to work as a Special Assistant \nto the President. I am going to miss working with her, as everyone on \nmy staff will. Fortunately, we are going to see her often on Capitol \nHill in her new job, representing the President of the United States.\n  A little about her background will explain how Anne came to the \nSenate. Anne grew up in Palos Heights, in the south suburbs of Chicago. \nShe is a first-generation suburbanite. Her dad Michael and mom Liz both \ngrew up on the South Side of Chicago, which means that Anne has the \nSouth Side in her blood. In Chicago that is noteworthy.\n  However, when Anne was a kid, her family did something that was \nconsidered heretical. They had, as South Siders, season tickets to the \nChicago Cubs. That made the Walls something of an anomaly among South \nSiders, and it probably helps explain why Anne is able to work so well \nacross the aisle here in the Senate.\n  Politics was not discussed much in the Wall home, but Anne developed \nher own interest in politics at a very early age, at every level. In \nthe eighth grade she became the first girl ever elected class president \nat St. Alexander Grade School. That same year, Anne Wall became the \nfirst girl in her town to serve as ``Mayor for a Day'' of Palos \nHeights. She won that honor on the strength of an essay she wrote.\n  Anne attended high school at one of the most remarkable South Side \ninstitutions, Mother McAuley--a terrific Catholic girls school which \nusually fields one of the best volleyball teams in the State. Anne went \nto the school run by the Sisters of Mercy, where she was elected \npresident of the student council. It was in that South Side Chicago \nhigh school that Anne Wall started to go astray. While her colleagues \nand friends in high school were reading Rolling Stone, Anne Wall was \nreading Roll Call. Anne read Roll Call, not for its accounts of \npartisan fights, but because she wanted to know how government works. \nShe wanted to understand the rules and the mechanics of Capitol Hill. \nAs her mom said, ``Who does that?''\n  I will tell you who: Anne did; someone who wanted to serve her Nation \nand understand how the government can be a force for good.\n  She earned a bachelor's degree from Miami of Ohio College, and went \non to DePaul University Law School, where she was chosen to serve on \nthe Law Review. In her final year at law school, Anne worked as an \nintern in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago. After law school, she \nclerked for two distinguished jurists, Cook County Circuit Court Judge \nAllen Goldberg and Cook County Circuit Court Judge Lynn Egan, before \nsigning on as associate counsel at a prestigious Chicago law firm and \nmaking a few bucks. But that wasn't where her heart was.\n  In 2006, Anne Wall decided to leave the world of private law and its \ncomfortable compensation to come to Capitol Hill. She saved up money \nbecause\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\nshe knew she was going to take a pretty significant pay cut. Our office \nhad the good luck and good sense to hire Anne, but we started her off \nat the bottom of the staff ladder. She started writing constituent \nletters and answering e-mails. She said whenever she questioned this \ncareer move from a prestigious law firm to answering letters in the \noffice of a Senator, she would look at another lawyer hired at the same \ntime and also writing letters and say: And he went to Harvard.\n  The people of Illinois were fortunate to have talented people such as \nAnne working for them. She quickly discovered the glamor of staff life \non Capitol Hill, however. Anne's first apartment in Washington, the \nonly one she could afford on the meager salary which I paid her, \nunfortunately was infested with vermin, the roof leaked, and one night \nit fell in. But she didn't want her mom to worry so she told her she \nwas living in a wonderful place on Capitol Hill.\n  After 1 year, we promoted Anne to serve as my office counsel. She \nquickly learned the ins and outs of the Senate ethics rules, and I \nbrought her on to counsel me on close calls on ethics decisions. Her \ncounsel was always valuable and her answer was always ``no.'' I knew \nthat and expected it and I am glad she steered me on the right path so \nmany times.\n  In 2008 I asked her to work for me on the Senate floor and once again \nshe excelled. In January of 2009 she became my floor director here in \nthe Senate. As my right hand on the floor, Anne Hall helped help steer \nthe majority whip operation and the entire Senate through historic \nchanges: health care reform, Wall Street reform, and a long list of \nother historic endeavors.\n  Whatever the task, whatever the challenge, Anne Wall has always \nbrought good humor, intelligence, and integrity to the task. When Anne \nwas not winning elections or reading Roll Call in high school, she \nplayed tennis. It was one of the things she loved to do. She was ranked \nas one of the top high school players in the State, but not being able \nto play tennis regularly is another one of the sacrifices Anne made to \nwork in the Senate. The job takes too much time. I hate to tell Anne, \nbut she won't be able to pick up her tennis racquet again in the new \njob she is taking in the White House.\n  These are challenging times for America's families and businesses and \nwe need bright, dedicated people giving it their all to get us through \nto a brighter day. Fortunately, America is up to that challenge, and so \nis Anne Wall. I am wishing her the best of luck.\n  When Anne Wall left Chicago, her law firm promised they would take \nher back in a heartbeat if she didn't like it in Washington. They kept \nher office vacant for months, hoping she would return. No such luck. We \nfeel the same way in the Durbin office about losing Anne. She is always \nwelcome to rejoin our staff. There will always be a place for her, but \nwe are not holding her job for her. My new floor director is a person \nwho has been Anne's right-hand person for the last 2\\1/2\\ years, Reema \nDodin. Reema is equally dedicated to this Nation and the Senate, and I \nknow she will do an outstanding job.\n  In closing, I want to thank Anne personally for all the fine and \ntireless work she has given the Senate. She helped us make history. We \nhope she will enjoy reading about this floor tribute in Roll Call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5448-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMEMBERING MICHAEL GAROFANO, SR. AND MICHAEL GAROFANO, JR.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to two \ndedicated public servants in Vermont who passed away tragically in the \nfloods of Hurricane Irene.\n  Both Michael Garofano Sr. and Michael Garofano Jr. were employees at \nthe Rutland City Water Facility in Rutland, VT, where they served at \nthe interest of their communities until the very end. During the worst \nhours of Hurricane Irene in Vermont, Michael Sr. and Michael Jr. sought \nto protect the people of Rutland by inspecting the town's water system \ninfrastructure. In this brave moment, both men unfortunately lost their \nlives as the waters of Mendon Brook rose to threatening levels. We will \nalways remember them for their everlasting courage, evident by their \nextreme dedication to protecting their family and beloved community \nduring a crisis.\n  Michael Sr. joined the Rutland City Water Facility as its manager in \n1981. He served zealously, ensuring that the water of Rutland City was \nsafe at all times for those living in the region. He was also a member \nof the American Water Works Association where he was committed to \nbenefitting not only Vermont, but also the country, in its pursuit of \nclean water. Michael was highly respected and honored by those who \nworked under his supervision. He was known as one of the best employees \nthe industry had to offer.\n  Michael Sr.'s son, Michael Garofano Jr., also had the interest of \nwater quality at heart. As a water operator at the Rutland City Water \nFacility, he too braved the elements of Hurricane Irene to serve his \nfamily and community. As an independently contracted landscaper, \nMichael's loyalty to his community was widely recognized. At a mere 24 \nyears of age, both his accomplishments and bravery are of honorable \npraise.\n  Michael Garofano Sr. and Jr. are survived by wife and mother, \nCelestine ``Sally''--Sitek--Garofano and son and brother, Thomas \nGarofano of Rutland, Vermont. My wife Marcelle and I wish to express \nour deepest condolences to Sally, Thomas, and Michael Sr. and Jr.'s \nextended family. In the days following the hurricane, many acts of \nbravery have been displayed throughout our state. All of Vermont can be \nproud of Michael Sr. and Michael Jr.'s incredible courage and the \nlegacy they both have left behind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the obituary for Michael Garofano Sr. \nand Michael Garofano Jr. from the Rutland Herald be printed in the \nRecord so all may recognize two men whose acts of bravery will not soon \nbe forgotten.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                          Michael J. Garofano\n\n   Published in Rutland Herald from September 2 to September 3, 2011\n\n       Michael J. Garofano, 55, of Rutland died Sunday afternoon, \n     Aug. 28, 2011, with his son Michael, as a tragic result of \n     Hurricane Irene in Rutland.\n       He was born in Rutland, Vt., on March 27, 1956, the son of \n     Patrick and Jacqueline (Roussil) Garofano.\n       Michael was a graduate of Rutland High School, Class of \n     1974. He graduated from Vermont Technical College in 1976, \n     with an Associate Degree in Water Quality.\n       He was employed as the Water Treatment and Resource Manager \n     in the Rutland City Department of Public Works since 1981.\n       He enjoyed his family, especially his three boys. He \n     enjoyed puttering around the house and fixing things. Mike \n     had a dry sense of humor and gave everyone a nickname.\n       Surviving are his wife, Celestine ``Sally'' (Sitek) \n     Garofano of Rutland; a son, Thomas A. Garofano of Rutland, \n     his parents of Rutland; two brothers, Thomas and his wife \n     Maureen of Georgia, Vt., and Patrick and his wife Cindy of \n     Daphne, Ala.; three sisters, Mary Goodchild and her husband \n     Harvey of Rutland, Lynn Helrich of Anchorage, Alaska, and \n     Stephanie Urso and her husband Frank of Proctor, Vt.; mother-\n     in-law Valeria Sitek of Rutland, Vt.; sister-in-law Chris \n     Giddings and her husband Fred Hellmuth of Pittsford; and \n     several nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles and cousins.\n       He was predeceased by a son, Robert M. Garofano, on April \n     8, 2010.\n       Funeral services for Michael J. Garofano and his son \n     Michael G. will be held Friday, September 9, 2011, at 11 a.m. \n     at St. Peter's Church in Rutland.\n       Visiting hours for Michael J. Garofano and his son Michael \n     G. will be held Thursday from 3 to 7 p.m. at Clifford Funeral \n     Home in Rutland.\n       The family is intending to create a memorial fund to honor \n     Michael and his son via the purchase of a plaque or similar \n     item to be placed at the City Reservoir.\n       In lieu of flowers, you may send donations payable to the \n     Garofano Memorial Fund, c/o Rutland City Treasurer's Office, \n     PO Box 969, Rutland, VT 05702-0969.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5448-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5448-S5449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, on August 26, 2011, we recognized the 40th \nanniversary of Women's Equality Day. It is on this day that we \ncelebrate the many contributions of women in advancing our society by \nfighting for equality and justice. This day also marked the 91st \nanniversary of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which \nguaranteed women the right to vote in 1920. Wyoming was the first in \nthe world to allow women to vote and own property. Wyoming adopted it \nin 1820. That was 50 years before the nation adopted women's suffrage.\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\n  Wyoming has a long history of advancing women's rights and actually \nrefused to become a state when the option was women losing their \nrights. Wyoming became the first State to elect a female Governor, \nNellie Tayloe Ross, just 5 years after the 19th amendment was ratified \nby the U.S. Congress. We also had the first female Justice of the \nPeace, Esther Hobart Morris and her commemoration is one of only a few \nfemale statues displayed in the U.S. Capitol today.\n  While we are certainly proud of our past, I am honored to currently \nserve in Wyoming's congressional delegation alongside U.S. \nCongresswoman Cynthia Lummis who has been a remarkable leader for \nWyoming as she continues the proud tradition of leadership of women in \nour state. Speaking of firsts, Congresswoman Lummis became the youngest \nwoman ever elected to the Wyoming State Legislature. She was also the \nfirst woman to serve on the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo Board. Cynthia \nhas taken on a variety of roles ranging from a lawyer and rancher to a \nlegislator and Wyoming State treasurer. Now in her role in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, her work continually impresses me as she does \nan outstanding job serving her constituents and fighting for their \ninterests in Congress.\n  Without a doubt, the ratification of the 19th amendment to our \ncountry's Constitution was a landmark in our need to recognize the \nvoices of women and recognize their contributions to our country. While \nthere is no doubt we are a better country for offering full franchise \nto women, it needs to be recognized that on Equality Day our Nation \nrecognizes a turning point for progress and civil rights, a watershed \nmoment in our ongoing pursuit of liberty and justice for all.\n  Women serve as a pillar of strength in our country. I am proud to \nrecognize the 141st year of Wyoming women voting and this 91st \nanniversary of women gaining the right to vote and look forward to \nwelcoming their achievements and contributions in the years to come and \nassuring that equality is not just a word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5449-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BLAIR, NEBRASKA FLOOD RESPONSE EFFORTS\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, as you are aware, my home State of \nNebraska has battled devastating flood waters throughout much of this \nsummer. As often occurs during disasters, it resulted in neighbors and \ncommunities coming together to help one another. On display in \nimpressive fashion was the sense of determination and self-reliance \nthat is woven into the character of our citizens and the fabric of our \nState. I have been privileged to witness the resiliency of Nebraskans \nmany times throughout my public service as a county commissioner, \nmayor, Governor, secretary of agriculture and now, as a U.S. Senator. I \nam deeply moved by it. The flooding has been tragic, but the response \nhas been inspiring. One shining example of this resiliency and \ncompassion occurred in Blair, NE. In fact, the organized and dedicated \nresponse in Blair so impressed officials at the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency and the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency that on \nSeptember 2, 2011, they issued a news release about the incredible \nresponse efforts in Blair. It is entitled, ``How the People of Blair \nTook Care of Their Own,''and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             How the People of Blair Took Care of Their Own\n\n                          (By Paul Lomartire)\n\n       Blair, NE.--As the gritty, brown Missouri River just kept \n     rising in early June, so did the will of the people in this \n     small city northwest of Omaha. Residents of Blair's Northview \n     Apartments and the Longview Trailer Court were forced out of \n     their homes by flooding. Blair homes along the river were \n     also flooded and the Cottonwood Marina and Restaurant on the \n     Missouri River was destroyed and washed away.\n       ``It happened so fast, the reality of this flood coming,'' \n     recalls Harriet Waite, director of Blair's Chamber of \n     Commerce. ``It was like, OK, we are going to do this'.''\n       What they did in this city of almost 8,000 residents was to \n     form a committee of eight citizens to help house and feed \n     their neighbors who were flooded out of their homes. With \n     Washington County and the City of Blair governments creating \n     green lights, the committee of eight drove the rescue bus.\n       Blair is on the banks of the Missouri River across from \n     Iowa, their eastern neighbor.\n       When the flooding began in early June, Washington County \n     and the City of Blair struck a deal to rent the 76-room \n     Holling Hall on the former Dana College campus. The cost was \n     $5,000 monthly to the bank that owned the former Lutheran \n     college founded in 1884, which was forced to close in 2010.\n       ``We cared about our business community staying open,'' \n     explained Phil Green, Blair's assistant city administrator. \n     ``When we knew the water was coming, there was a lot going on \n     with Cargill building levees to protect their plant and \n     levees for our water treatment plant to keep it from \n     flooding. We had to take care of employees in Blair whether \n     they lived here or in Iowa. Our priorities for housing at \n     Dana were Washington County residents and Washington County \n     workers.''\n       The committee of eight and other volunteers took care of \n     everything from organizing meals at Holling Hall to \n     maintenance, cleaning and security. Those families at Holling \n     Hall were asked to pay $150 per family unit to offset the \n     cost of utilities.\n       Move-in at the vacant Dana College facility was on the \n     weekend of June 11-12. There were 23 adults and 11 children \n     comprising 13 families. Blair's business community donated \n     all the supplies for Holling Hall, including paper products, \n     plastic ware, cleaning supplies, personal hygiene items and \n     more. Donated meals came from mom-and-pop restaurants, \n     national chains and local churches.\n       The population of flood survivors at Holling Hall hit a \n     highpoint on July 8, with 115 people made up of 83 adults and \n     32 children. One-third of Dana's temporary residents were \n     from Iowa.\n       Helen Mauney works at Crowell's Nursing Home in Blair and \n     lives across the river in Mondamin, Iowa. Flooding meant that \n     she couldn't get across the bridge to go home. Co-workers \n     told her that she could find temporary housing help at city \n     hall.\n       ``They're wonderful people,'' she says of the ad hoc \n     housing committee that administers Holling Hall, where she \n     has lived for more than two months. ``They made it as nice as \n     possible. I appreciate everything they did.''\n       The quickly-formed Washington County Cares Committee is now \n     an efficient, tight-knit unit that delivered on its plan to \n     have all the flood survivors relocated by the end of August \n     and close Holling Hall.\n       Now the committee is transitioning into the Washington \n     County Long-Term Recovery Committee, according to assistant \n     city administrator Green. They are being advised by a Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency Voluntary Agency Liaison. That \n     help became possible on August 12, when the president \n     declared a major disaster that designated Washington and \n     eight other Nebraska counties eligible for Individual \n     Assistance.\n       Not only has the committee of eight cared for flood \n     survivors' daily needs for nearly two months, they also were \n     able to assist with deposits or rental payments up to $500 to \n     help with relocation from Holling Hall. That money came from \n     $30,000 in donations the committee has received.\n       ``At the core,'' says Aaron Barrow, a Blair police \n     lieutenant and committee member, ``there's a really strong \n     city government and local business community that has a very \n     good working relationship with the ministries. Government \n     didn't solve all the problems, but a partnership between \n     government, business and churches did solve problems.''\n       ``This city and this county are very generous,'' said \n     Kristina Churchill, who is the Holling Hall Food Coordinator. \n     ``It didn't surprise me that we got help. What surprised me \n     was how much help we got.''\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5449-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5449-S5450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           BIG SKY ALL STARS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Yogi Berra once said, ``I think \nLittle League is wonderful. It keeps the kids out of the house.'' A \nteam of talented young athletes from Montana spent a lot of time out of \nthe house this summer on an amazing and inspiring run all the way to \nthe Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA.\n  The Big Sky All Stars from Billings were the first team ever from \nthe, State of Montana to qualify for the Little League World Series. I \napplaud the dedication of the teams manager Gene Carlson, coaches Mark \nKieckbusch and Tom Zimmer, the players, and their families for their \nsuccess and all the miles they've traveled, making Montana so proud \nalong the way.\n  The team began their run in June and July by winning district and \nstate championships back home in the Treasure State. The boys then \ntraveled to California where they won the Northwest Regional \nChampionship which qualified them for the Little League World Series.\n  Of the thousands of Little League teams that take the field across \nthe\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\nU.S. every season, only eight qualify for the Little League World \nSeries. Across Montana folks from Billings to Bigfork gathered in their \ncommunities to cheer on our all-stars. The team prevailed in their \nfirst three games in the tournament with heart-stopping victories \nbefore national television audiences.\n  Those three wins brought them to the U.S. Championship game on August \n27 where they put up a commendable fight against the Ocean View All \nStars from Huntington Beach, California. The boys from Billings made \ntheir home state so proud. They reached their goals by exemplifying the \nMontana values of grit, determination, and hard work. Through great \nteam work and encouragement from their coaches and families, these \nyoung men exceeded expectations.\n  Upon their return to Billings the team was greeted by a throng of \nsupporters at the airport. The youngsters were also recognized with a \nparade and ceremonies at many local events this past week. I would like \nto join with Montanans from across the state and folks around the \ncountry in congratulating the Big Sky All Stars on their fantastic \nseason and wishing them the best in the future.

After graduating \nfrom South Carolina State University, Major Glover was commissioned as \na second lieutenant in the Army Aviation Corps. After completing \nrequirements to become a UH-60 Blackhawk pilot, he served in Korea, \nwhere he served as a platoon leader for Bravo Company, 1-52nd Aviation \nRegiment supporting South Korean Special Operations Forces.\n  After his Korea tour, Major Glover was assigned to Fort Bragg, NC. \nMajor Glover deployed with his unit to Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of \nOperation Joint Forge. During this deployment he acted as forward \ndetachment commander during the Kosovo air strikes. In addition, he \nprovided aerial security support at the G-8 conference in Sarajevo, \nBosnia, for President Clinton and other key leaders.\n  Following his Fort Bragg assignment, he assumed command of HHC-1-\n212th Aviation Company at Fort Rucker, AL. As the company commander, \nMajor Glover managed the two largest Army heliports, training over \n2,000 students and as an instructor pilot received his Army Senior \nAviator Badge flying over 1,500 hours.\n  Following company command, Major Glover became a system evaluator for \nthe procurement of new military system and equipment at Aberdeen \nProving Ground, Maryland. He was then deployed to Iraq as an operations \nofficer of a military transition team that trained over 830 Iraqis and \nconducted over 100 combat missions.\n  After he returned from Iraq, Major Glover was selected as an Army \ncomptroller and worked in the Pentagon at the Army Asymmetric Warfare \nOffice, AAWO in the Improvised Explosive Device, IED, Division. During \nthat time he was one of the original combat vehicle architects of the \nMine Resistant Ambush Program, MRAP, and worked with Congress and \ndefense leaders to fund 12,000 vehicles valued at $17 billion.\n  Major Glover was then selected as a Department of Defense \ncongressional fellow and served as an Army fellow in the U.S. Senate \nfor 1 year. After his tenure as a military fellow, he most recently \nserved as Army congressional legislative liaison in the Army Senate \nLiaison Division. He represented the Army on Capitol Hill and conducted \nnumerous codels and staffdels across the world. He has coordinated over \n1,500 Capitol Hill and White House tours for State, local, and military \nconstituents.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the grateful nation, I join my colleagues \ntoday in saying thank you to MAJ Sam Glover for his extraordinary \ndedication to duty and service to the country throughout his \ndistinguished career in the U.S. Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5450-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DR.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the passing of Dr. Larry Manning Ross, a great South \nCarolinian, who not only served his country honorably in uniform but \nalso worked tirelessly as a psychologist for many years.\n  Dr. Ross graduated from Citadel in 1963 and served in the Vietnam \nwar, where as a captain he was wounded in 1968. For his actions, Dr. \nRoss was awarded the Silver Star and the Vietnam Cross. After being \nmedically discharged from the military, Dr. Ross went on to earn a PhD \nin psychology and taught at the University of South Carolina. He served \nin private practice until he could no longer practice.\n  Dr. Ross was an incredible man who made countless sacrifices for his \nfamily and for his country and for that I would like to honor \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5450-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5450-S5451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING DIMILLO'S FLOATING RESTAURANT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, there are small businesses in cities \nand town across America that are local landmarks for a variety of \nreasons--whether they serve exceptional food, create a fun atmosphere, \nor possess a unique character. One such small business, DiMillo's \nFloating Restaurant in Maine's largest coastal city of Portland, enjoys \nall of these traits, and has been a community favorite since opening \nits doors in its current location in 1982. Today I commend DiMillo's \nfor its remarkable achievements and determined resilience, and to \nhighlight its remarkable story.\n  DiMillo's restaurant began serving some of Portland's favorite meals \nin 1982 after many reinventions of creator Tony DiMillo's dream. Tony \nopened his first restaurant, Anthony's, on Fore Street in 1954. After \ntwo relocations of the restaurant, he settled on changing his company's \nname to that of his last name, and moved the restaurant to Portland's \nscenic waterfront after purchasing the abandoned Long Wharf. Tony \nquickly evolved his business from a single restaurant to a multi \nfaceted empire by creating DiMillo's Marina and eventually DiMillo's \nYacht Sales, all on the newly renovated wharf.\n  The flagship of the DiMillo spirit lies in DiMillo's Floating \nRestaurant, a refurbished car ferry that originally ran between \nDelaware and New Jersey. By the time the DiMillo family purchased the \nvessel in 1980, its fate was sealed as a popular landmark of the \nPortland waterfront. DiMillo's Floating Restaurant is one of the \nlargest converted ferries of its kind and is able to accommodate over \n600 guests at any given time. The restaurant offers patrons a wide \nvariety of the Gulf of Maine's bounty, from lobsters and haddock to \nscallops and clams. In homage to the family's Italian ancestry, \nDiMillo's also offers a number of both unique and classic Italian \ndishes, from seafood scampi to ricotta meatballs.\n  Like so many small Maine businesses, DiMillo's has been forced to \nadapt to the persistent economic downturn, as well as today's rising \nenergy costs. Recently, the company announced that it will be raising a \n35-foot wind turbine to help cut the cost of the electrical needs of \nthe business. As part of their movement towards sustainability, \nDiMillo's has also pledged to consider adding solar panels to its \nenergy future.\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\n  It is with great pride that I acknowledge the successes of small, \nfamily-owned businesses, because these are the firms that help maintain \nthe character and virtue of Main Street America. The long-term success \nand longevity of DiMillo's Restaurant and the entire DiMillo family is \na byproduct of strong work ethic, responsive customer service, and a \nhigh level of quality.\n  The motto of the DiMillo family has always been, ``A tradition of \nexcellence for generations to come.'' And these words continue to ring \ntrue today, whether it is through their efforts at the restaurant, the \nmarina, or in their yacht sales business. DiMillo's is an excellent \nexample of our nation's unique and celebrated entrepreneurial spirit. I \ncongratulate everyone in the DiMillo's businesses for their resilience \nand dedication to the community of Portland, and wish them many years \nof continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5451-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO OFFICER TIM DOYLE\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I join the Rapid City Police \nDepartment in honoring Officer Tim Doyle.\n  Officer Doyle was serving temporarily on the Street Crimes Unit, \nbefore resuming his work as a school liaison officer. The Street Crimes \nUnit was specially designed to handle public nuisance issues and has \nmade noticeable improvements to the quality of life in Rapid City \nneighborhoods. During what seemed to be a typical stop on August 2, \n2011, Officer Doyle was one of three officers shot while on duty. \nOfficer Doyle was shot in the face, and two of his fellow officers, \nOfficer Ryan McCandless and Officer Nick Armstrong, later died from \ntheir injuries.\n  Officer Doyle left the hospital 1 week after the shooting and then \nreturned to work in less than 3 weeks. He assumed his newly assigned \nposition as a Central High School liaison officer in time for the first \nweek of school, with his jaw still wired shut and a bullet lodged in \nhis chest.\n  Officer Tim Doyle is a four-year veteran of the Rapid City Police \nDepartment, and a certain hero. Tim joined the Rapid City Police \nDepartment on July 30, 2007. He was hired as a police officer assigned \nto the Field Services Division. In August 2010, he was assigned as the \nschool liaison officer for Southwest Middle School in Rapid City, SD.\n  Originally from Minnesota, he received his bachelor of science degree \nin chemical engineering from the South Dakota School of Mines and \nTechnology in Rapid City. He worked as an engineer in Minnesota for \nmore than a decade before returning to Rapid City to pursue a career in \nlaw enforcement.\n  Officer Doyle continues to recover quickly, due to his remarkable \ncourage and the incredible support of his family, friends, fellow \nofficers, and the Rapid City community.\n  On September 14, 2011, Officer Tim Doyle will be honored with two \nawards from the Rapid City Police Department. He will receive the \nDistinguished Service Cross, which is bestowed upon members who \ndistinguish themselves by demonstrating exceptional bravery, despite an \nimminent risk of serious bodily injury or death. Officer Doyle will \nalso receive the Purple Heart medal, awarded for a serious physical \ninjury received in the line of duty.\n  So today I wish to honor this extraordinary public servant. I extend \nmy thoughts, prayers and best wishes to Officer Doyle, his family, \nfriends, his fellow public servants in the Rapid City Police \nDepartment, as well as the community at large who have shown \noutstanding support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5451-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5451-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5451-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5451-S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT'S ADDRESS CONCERNING PROPOSALS TO CREATE JOBS AND IMPROVE THE \nECONOMY DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2011--\n                                 PM 18\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \npapers; which was ordered to lie on the table:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, and fellow \nAmericans:\n  Tonight we meet at an urgent time for our country. We continue to \nface an economic crisis that has left millions of our neighbors \njobless, and a political crisis that has made things worse.\n  This past week, reporters have been asking ``What will this speech \nmean for the President? What will it mean for Congress? How will it \naffect their polls, and the next election?''\n  But the millions of Americans who are watching right now: they don't \ncare about politics. They have real life concerns. Many have spent \nmonths looking for work. Others are doing their best just to scrape \nby--giving up nights out with the family to save on gas or make the \nmortgage; postponing retirement to send a kid to college.\n  These men and women grew up with faith in an America where hard work \nand responsibility paid off. They believed in a country where everyone \ngets a fair shake and does their fair share--where if you stepped up, \ndid your job, and were loyal to your company, that loyalty would be \nrewarded with a decent salary and good benefits; maybe a raise once in \nawhile. If you did the right thing, you could make it in America.\n  But for decades now, Americans have watched that compact erode. They \nhave seen the deck too often stacked against them. And they know that \nWashington hasn't always put their interests first.\n  The people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities. \nThe question tonight is whether we'll meet ours. The question is \nwhether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the \npolitical circus and actually do something to help the economy; whether \nwe can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this \nnation since our beginning.\n  Those of us here tonight can't solve all of our nation's woes. \nUltimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our \nbusinesses and our workers. But we can help. We can make a difference. \nThere are steps we can take right now to improve people's lives.\n  I am sending this Congress a plan that you should pass right away. \nIt's called the American Jobs Act. There should be nothing \ncontroversial about this piece of legislation.\n  Everything in here is the kind of proposal that's been supported by \nboth Democrats and Republicans--including many who sit here tonight. \nAnd everything in this bill will be paid for. Everything.\n  The purpose of the American Jobs Act is simple: to put more people \nback to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working. It \nwill create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, \nmore jobs for veterans, and more jobs for the long-term unemployed. It \nwill provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it \nwill cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every \nsmall business. It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, \nand give companies confidence that if they invest and hire, there will \nbe customers for their products and services. You should pass this jobs \nplan right away.\n  Everyone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs \nbegin. And you know that while corporate profits have come roaring \nback, smaller companies haven't. So for everyone who speaks so \npassionately about making life easier for ``job creators,'' this plan \nis for you.\n  Pass this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get \na tax cut if they hire new workers or raise workers' wages. Pass this \njobs bill, and all small business owners will also see their payroll \ntaxes cut in half next year. If you have 50 employees making an average \nsalary, that's an $80,000 tax\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\ncut. And all businesses will be able to continue writing off the \ninvestments they make in 2012.\n\n  It's not just Democrats who have supported this kind of proposal. \nFifty House Republicans have proposed the same payroll tax cut that's \nin this plan. You should pass it right away.\n  Pass this jobs bill, and we can put people to work rebuilding \nAmerica. Everyone here knows that we have badly decaying roads and \nbridges all over this country. Our highways are clogged with traffic. \nOur skies are the most congested in the world.\n  This is inexcusable. Building a world-class transportation system is \npart of what made us an economic superpower. And now we're going to sit \nback and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads? At a \ntime when millions of unemployed construction workers could build them \nright here in America?\n  There are private construction companies all across America just \nwaiting to get to work. There's a bridge that needs repair between Ohio \nand Kentucky that's on one of the busiest trucking routes in North \nAmerica. A public transit project in Houston that will help clear up \none of the worst areas of traffic in the country. And there are schools \nthroughout this country that desperately need renovating. How can we \nexpect our kids to do their best in places that are literally falling \napart? This is America. Every child deserves a great school--and we can \ngive it to them, if we act now.\n  The American Jobs Act will repair and modernize at least 35,000 \nschools. It will put people to work right now fixing roofs and windows; \ninstalling science labs and high-speed internet in classrooms all \nacross this country. It will rehabilitate homes and businesses in \ncommunities hit hardest by foreclosures. It will jumpstart thousands of \ntransportation projects across the country. And to make sure the money \nis properly spent and for good purposes, we're building on reforms \nwe've already put in place. No more earmarks. No more boondoggles. No \nmore bridges to nowhere. We're cutting the red tape that prevents some \nof these projects from getting started as quickly as possible. And \nwe'll set up an independent fund to attract private dollars and issue \nloans based on two criteria: how badly a construction project is needed \nand how much good it would do for the economy.\n  This idea came from a bill written by a Texas Republican and a \nMassachusetts Democrat. The idea for a big boost in construction is \nsupported by America's largest business organization and America's \nlargest labor organization. It's the kind of proposal that's been \nsupported in the past by Democrats and Republicans alike. You should \npass it right away.\n  Pass this jobs bill, and thousands of teachers in every state will go \nback to work. These are the men and women charged with preparing our \nchildren for a world where the competition has never been tougher. But \nwhile they're adding teachers in places like South Korea, we're laying \nthem off in droves. It's unfair to our kids. It undermines their future \nand ours. And it has to stop. Pass this jobs bill, and put our teachers \nback in the classroom where they belong.\n  Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get extra tax credits if they \nhire America's veterans. We ask these men and women to leave their \ncareers, leave their families, and risk their lives to fight for our \ncountry. The last thing they should have to do is fight for a job when \nthey come home.\n  Pass this bill, and hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged young \npeople will have the hope and dignity of a summer job next year. And \ntheir parents, low-income Americans who desperately want to work, will \nhave more ladders out of poverty.\n  Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get a $4,000 tax credit if \nthey hire anyone who has spent more than six months looking for a job. \nWe have to do more to help the long-term unemployed in their search for \nwork. This jobs plan builds on a program in Georgia that several \nRepublican leaders have highlighted, where people who collect \nunemployment insurance participate in temporary work as a way to build \ntheir skills while they look for a permanent job. The plan also extends \nunemployment insurance for another year. If the millions of unemployed \nAmericans stopped getting this insurance, and stopped using that money \nfor basic necessities, it would be a devastating blow to this economy. \nDemocrats and Republicans in this Chamber have supported unemployment \ninsurance plenty of times in the past. At this time of prolonged \nhardship, you should pass it again--right away.\n  Pass this jobs bill, and the typical working family will get a \nfifteen hundred dollar tax cut next year. Fifteen hundred dollars that \nwould have been taken out of your paycheck will go right into your \npocket. This expands on the tax cut that Democrats and Republicans \nalready passed for this year. If we allow that tax cut to expire--if we \nrefuse to act--middle-class families will get hit with a tax increase \nat the worst possible time. We cannot let that happen. I know some of \nyou have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as \nyou live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise \nmiddle-class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away.\n  This is the American Jobs Act. It will lead to new jobs for \nconstruction workers, teachers, veterans, first responders, young \npeople and the long-term unemployed. It will provide tax credits to \ncompanies that hire new workers, tax relief for small business owners, \nand tax cuts for the middle-class. And here's the other thing I want \nthe American people to know: the American Jobs Act will not add to the \ndeficit. It will be paid for. And here's how:\n  The agreement we passed in July will cut government spending by about \n$1 trillion over the next ten years. It also charges this Congress to \ncome up with an additional $1.5 trillion in savings by Christmas. \nTonight, I'm asking you to increase that amount so that it covers the \nfull cost of the American Jobs Act. And a week from Monday, I'll be \nreleasing a more ambitious deficit plan--a plan that will not only \nallow us to boost jobs and growth in the short-term, but stabilize our \ndebt in the long run.\n  This approach is basically the one I've been advocating for months. \nIn addition to the trillion dollars of spending cuts I've already \nsigned into law, it's a balanced plan that would reduce the deficit by \nmaking additional spending cuts; by making modest adjustments to health \ncare programs like Medicare and Medicaid; and by reforming our tax code \nin a way that asks the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to \npay their fair share. What's more, the spending cuts wouldn't happen so \nabruptly that they'd be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from \nhelping small business and middle-class families get back on their feet \nright away.\n  Now, I realize there are some in my party who don't think we should \nmake any changes at all to Medicare and Medicaid, and I understand \ntheir concerns. But here's the truth. Millions of Americans rely on \nMedicare in their retirement. And millions more will do so in the \nfuture. They pay for this benefit during their working years. They earn \nit. But with an aging population and rising health care costs, we are \nspending too fast to sustain the program. And if we don't gradually \nreform the system while protecting current beneficiaries, it won't be \nthere when future retirees need it. We have to reform Medicare to \nstrengthen it.\n\n  I'm also well aware that there are many Republicans who don't believe \nwe should raise taxes on those who are most fortunate and can best \nafford it. But here is what every American knows. While most people in \nthis country struggle to make ends meet, a few of the most affluent \ncitizens and corporations enjoy tax breaks and loopholes that nobody \nelse gets. Right now, Warren Buffet pays a lower tax rate than his \nsecretary--an outrage he has asked us to fix. We need a tax code where \neveryone gets a fair shake, and everybody pays their fair share. And I \nbelieve the vast majority of wealthy Americans and CEOs are willing to \ndo just that, if it helps the economy grow and gets our fiscal house in \norder.\n  I'll also offer ideas to reform a corporate tax code that stands as a \nmonument to special interest influence in Washington. By eliminating \npages of loopholes and deductions, we can lower one of the highest \ncorporate tax rates in the world. Our tax code shouldn't give an \nadvantage to companies that can afford the best-connected lobbyists. It \nshould give an advantage to\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\ncompanies that invest and create jobs here in America.\n  So we can reduce this deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for this \njobs plan in the process. But in order to do this, we have to decide \nwhat our priorities are. We have to ask ourselves, ``What's the best \nway to grow the economy and create jobs?''\n  Should we keep tax loopholes for oil companies? Or should we use that \nmoney to give small business owners a tax credit when they hire new \nworkers? Because we can't afford to do both. Should we keep tax breaks \nfor millionaires and billionaires? Or should we put teachers back to \nwork so our kids can graduate ready for college and good jobs? Right \nnow, we can't afford to do both.\n  This isn't political grandstanding. This isn't class warfare. This is \nsimple math. These are real choices that we have to make. And I'm \npretty sure I know what most Americans would choose. It's not even \nclose. And it's time for us to do what's right for our future.\n  The American Jobs Act answers the urgent need to create jobs right \naway. But we can't stop there. As I've argued since I ran for this \noffice, we have to look beyond the immediate crisis and start building \nan economy that lasts into the future--an economy that creates good, \nmiddle-class jobs that pay well and offer security. We now live in a \nworld where technology has made it possible for companies to take their \nbusiness anywhere. If we want them to start here and stay here and hire \nhere, we have to be able to out-build, out-educate, and out-innovate \nevery other country on Earth.\n  This task, of making America more competitive for the long haul, is a \njob for all of us. For government and for private companies. For states \nand for local communities--and for every American citizen. All of us \nwill have to up our game. All of us will have to change the way we do \nbusiness.\n  My administration can and will take some steps to improve our \ncompetitiveness on our own. For example, if you're a small business \nowner who has a contract with the federal government, we're going to \nmake sure you get paid a lot faster than you do now. We're also \nplanning to cut away the red tape that prevents too many rapidly-\ngrowing start-up companies from raising capital and going public. And \nto help responsible homeowners, we're going to work with Federal \nhousing agencies to help more people refinance their mortgages at \ninterest rates that are now near 4%--a step that can put more than \n$2,000 a year in a family's pocket, and give a lift to an economy still \nburdened by the drop in housing prices.\n\n  Other steps will require Congressional action. Today you passed \nreform that will speed up the outdated patent process, so that \nentrepreneurs can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as \npossible. That's the kind of action we need. Now it's time to clear the \nway for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for \nAmerican companies to sell their products in Panama, Colombia, and \nSouth Korea--while also helping the workers whose jobs have been \naffected by global competition. If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, \nI want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and \nChryslers. I want to see more products sold around the world stamped \nwith three proud words: ``Made in America.''\n  And on all of our efforts to strengthen competitiveness, we need to \nlook for ways to work side-by-side with America's businesses. That's \nwhy I've brought together a Jobs Council of leaders from different \nindustries who are developing a wide range of new ideas to help \ncompanies grow and create jobs.\n  Already, we've mobilized business leaders to train 10,000 American \nengineers a year, by providing company internships and training. Other \nbusinesses are covering tuition for workers who learn new skills at \ncommunity colleges. And we're going to make sure the next generation of \nmanufacturing takes root not in China or Europe, but right here, in the \nUnited States of America. If we provide the right incentives and \nsupport--and if we make sure our trading partners play by the rules--we \ncan be the ones to build everything from fuel-efficient cars to \nadvanced biofuels to semiconductors that are sold all over the world. \nThat's how America can be number one again. That's how America will be \nnumber one again.\n  Now, I realize that some of you have a different theory on how to \ngrow the economy. Some of you sincerely believe that the only solution \nto our economic challenges is to simply cut most government spending \nand eliminate most government regulations.\n  Well, I agree that we can't afford wasteful spending, and I will \ncontinue to work with Congress to get rid of it. And I agree that there \nare some rules and regulations that put an unnecessary burden on \nbusinesses at a time when they can least afford it. That's why I \nordered a review of all government regulations. So far, we've \nidentified over 500 reforms, which will save billions of dollars over \nthe next few years. We should have no more regulation than the health, \nsafety, and security of the American people require. Every rule should \nmeet that common sense test.\n  But what we can't do--what I won't do--is let this economic crisis be \nused as an excuse to wipe out the basic protections that Americans have \ncounted on for decades. I reject the idea that we need to ask people to \nchoose between their jobs and their safety. I reject the argument that \nsays for the economy to grow, we have to roll back protections that ban \nhidden fees by credit card companies, or rules that keep our kids from \nbeing exposed to mercury, or laws that prevent the health insurance \nindustry from shortchanging patients. I reject the idea that we have to \nstrip away collective bargaining rights to compete in a global economy. \nWe shouldn't be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the \ncheapest labor and the worst pollution standards. America should be in \na race to the top. And I believe that's a race we can win.\n  In fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore \nprosperity is just dismantle government, refund everyone's money, let \neveryone write their own rules, and tell everyone they're on their \nown--that's not who we are. That's not the story of America.\n  Yes, we are rugged individualists. Yes, we are strong and self-\nreliant. And it has been the drive and initiative of our workers and \nentrepreneurs that has made this economy the engine and envy of the \nworld.\n  But there has always been another thread running throughout our \nhistory--a belief that we are all connected; and that there are some \nthings we can only do together, as a nation.\n  We all remember Abraham Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union. \nBut in the middle of a Civil War, he was also a leader who looked to \nthe future--a Republican president who mobilized government to build \nthe transcontinental railroad; launch the National Academy of Sciences; \nand set up the first land grant colleges. And leaders of both parties \nhave followed the example he set.\n  Ask yourselves--where would we be right now if the people who sat \nhere before us decided not to build our highways and our bridges; our \ndams and our airports? What would this country be like if we had chosen \nnot to spend money on public high schools, or research universities, or \ncommunity colleges? Millions of returning heroes, including my \ngrandfather, had the opportunity to go to school because of the GI \nBill. Where would we be if they hadn't had that chance?\n  How many jobs would it have cost us if past Congresses decided not to \nsupport the basic research that led to the Internet and the computer \nchip? What kind of country would this be if this Chamber had voted down \nSocial Security or Medicare just because it violated some rigid idea \nabout what government could or could not do? How many Americans would \nhave suffered as a result?\n  No single individual built America on their own. We built it \ntogether. We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, \nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with \nresponsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another. \nMembers of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.\n  Every proposal I've laid out tonight is the kind that's been \nsupported by Democrats and Republicans in the past. Every proposal I've \nlaid out tonight will be paid for. And every proposal is designed to \nmeet the urgent\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\nneeds of our people and our communities.\n  I know there's been a lot of skepticism about whether the politics of \nthe moment will allow us to pass this jobs plan--or any jobs plan. \nAlready, we're seeing the same old press releases and tweets flying \nback and forth. Already, the media has proclaimed that it's impossible \nto bridge our differences. And maybe some of you have decided that \nthose differences are so great that we can only resolve them at the \nballot box.\n  But know this: the next election is fourteen months away. And the \npeople who sent us here--the people who hired us to work for them--they \ndon't have the luxury of waiting fourteen months. Some of them are \nliving week to week; paycheck to paycheck; even day to day. They need \nhelp, and they need it now.\n  I don't pretend that this plan will solve all our problems. It \nshouldn't be, nor will it be, the last plan of action we propose. \nWhat's guided us from the start of this crisis hasn't been the search \nfor a silver bullet. It's been a commitment to stay at it--to be \npersistent--to keep trying every new idea that works, and listen to \nevery good proposal, no matter which party comes up with it.\n  Regardless of the arguments we've had in the past, regardless of the \narguments we'll have in the future, this plan is the right thing to do \nright now. You should pass it. And I intend to take that message to \nevery corner of this country. I also ask every American who agrees to \nlift your voice and tell the people who are gathered here tonight that \nyou want action now. Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an \noption. Remind us that if we act as one nation, and one people, we have \nit within our power to meet this challenge.\n  President Kennedy once said, ``Our problems are man-made--therefore \nthey can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.''\n  These are difficult years for our country. But we are Americans. We \nare tougher than the times that we live in, and we are bigger than our \npolitics have been. So let's meet the moment. Let's get to work, and \nshow the world once again why the United States of America remains the \ngreatest nation on Earth. Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless \nthe United States of America.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, September 8, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5454-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:52 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2832.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to limit regulation of \nnuisance dust in areas in which that dust is regulated under State, \ntribal, or local law, to establish a temporary prohibition against \nrevising any national ambient air quality standard applicable to coarse \nparticulate matter, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor many times, as \nwe all do, to discuss issues that are important to our States, in my \ncase the State of Nebraska, on issues that are important for our \nNation. Many times those comments deal with what seems to be the \nconstant regulatory assault on our Nation's job creators.\n  In meetings across Nebraska--and I did 15 townhall meetings in \nAugust--the second and third questions I often got, if not the very \nfirst, concerned the regulatory burden our Federal agencies are placing \non our job creators.\n  This administration has generated nothing short of a mountain of \nredtape, including hundreds of new regulations. Of these, at least 219 \nhave been categorized as significant. What that means is they will cost \nmore than $100 million per year, $100 million taken out of our economy \nto finance regulation. The administration doesn't even dispute the \nmountain of redtape, nor does it dispute the size of the mountain that \nis created.\n  In a letter from the President to Speaker Boehner, the White House \nidentified seven regulations on its agenda, each costing not $100 \nmillion but at least $1 billion per year. These costs take important \ncapital out of our economy. These costs weigh on our job creators. \nThese costs punish the little guy, and there is no doubt about it.\n  This mountain is so massive, the administration has had to expand the \nFederal workforce itself to write the regulations and to enforce them. \nEmployment at Federal agencies is up 13 percent since President Obama \ntook office.\n  With unemployment in excess of 9 percent, and underemployment greater \nthan that, this administration is expanding the size of government to \nfuel more job-suppressing restrictions, and it makes no sense. It makes \nno sense to me as an individual Senator, but it makes no sense to the \npeople of Nebraska.\n  For this reason, I am introducing legislation with the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona to press the pause button on this massive wave of redtape \nbefore it engulfs our very economy.\n  Our legislation is very straightforward. It says: Our small \nbusinesses are getting crushed; our citizens can't find jobs. Freeze \nthe regulatory onslaught through 2013.\n  But our work simply cannot stop there. We also need some targeted \nregulatory reforms to rein in government bureaucracies that are simply \nout of control. Thus, I will also be introducing two other pieces of \nadditional legislation today to help temper the endless quest for \nadditional power, jurisdiction and, therefore, regulation.\n  The first one would close a loophole that allows agencies to grab \npower\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nwithout opportunity for Congressional review.\n  Under the current state of the law, the Congressional Review Act \npermits Congress to use special procedures to step in and to disapprove \nof agency rules. However, in this administration, agencies have \nrecently chosen to use what they call ``guidance documents'' instead of \nrules to achieve their policy preferences and to expand their power.\n  I am troubled by this trend because their efforts appear to \ndeliberately and intentionally circumvent American law specifically \ncrafted to protect citizens from aggressive bureaucracies. We have an \nexample, but there are many. I wish to use this one.\n  I am talking about a guidance document issued jointly by EPA and the \nArmy Corps of Engineers on May 2 of this year. It is very recent. The \nguidance documents's goal is clear--to expand Federal power over \nwaterways.\n  But don't take my word for it. According to the EPA's own analysis, \nthe guidance would significantly expand the waters of the United States \nsubject to Federal control and regulation.\n  The Midwestern Farm Bureau has said the guidance ``defines \njurisdiction in the broadest way possible.''\n  This is a page straight out of this administration's playbook. If \ntheir policy goal is rejected by Congress, they use their regulatory \npower to accomplish their agenda any way they can. Stretch the law, \nignore the law, claim that the statute is too ambiguous, circumvent it, \nput out a guidance document to interpret it. That is exactly what they \nare doing. We have seen this playbook used over and over by this \nadministration and its Federal agencies.\n  They should have gotten the message after an unsuccessful attempt \nduring the last Congress to vastly expand their jurisdiction over \nvirtually all waters, from irrigation ditches to farm ponds. But like a \nchild that hears ``no'' from his parents, they jumped ahead, the \nadministration went ahead anyway through this guidance document.\n  As the North Dakota Farm Bureau president described it, the EPA's \nguidance is an end run around Congress, and I am quoting:\n\n       If you can't get what you want with Congress' blessing, \n     make an end-run around them. That seems to be what is \n     happening here. And make no mistake. If this guidance is \n     adopted, EPA could regulate any or all waters found within a \n     State, no matter how small or seemingly unconnected to a \n     Federal interest.\n\n  The agencies could not convince Congress to change the law. So now \nwhat is happening? The same goal is being pursued in a different way \nthat bypasses us. Notably, both the House and the Senate have expressed \nstrong concern about this guidance document. Twenty Senators sent a \nletter noting that it represents a dramatic expansion of Federal power \nover private land.\n  In another letter, 41 Senators asserted that making changes to the \nscope of the agency's activities through guidance instead of through \nrulemaking is ``fundamentally unfair.'' This letter requested the \nagencies ``abandon any further action on this guidance document.'' This \nis a very significant concern. This guidance document also has shown us \nthat there is a huge loophole through which agencies can circumvent the \nrulemaking process in its entirety, as well as circumventing \ncongressional intent in order to expand Federal power.\n  The legislation I introduced today closes the loophole. It amends the \nCongressional Review Act to cover both traditional rules and guidance \ndocuments--no more end run around Congress. Consequently, agencies \nwould be on notice that the loophole through which they intend to \ncircumvent our will and the will of the American public is now a closed \ndoor. In other words, citizens would have another layer of protection \nfrom agencies seeking to unfairly expand Federal jurisdiction.\n  Finally, today I am introducing the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention \nAct. Farmers and ranchers across this Nation are concerned about the \nEPA's efforts to regulate dust. Despite what the administrator is \nsaying in farm country, EPA is still in the midst of their review of \nthe National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter or, \nput simply, ``farm dust.'' In rural America, farm dust is a fact of \nlife. I grew up on a farm. It is dusty there. We kick it up while \ndriving on unpaved roads or working in farm fields. Farm dust has long \nbeen considered to have no health concern at ambient levels. However, \nEPA is considering bringing down the hammer by ratcheting down that \nstandard to a level that would be economically devastating for many in \nour rural areas. That defies common sense.\n  To restore common sense to these burdensome job-threatening \nregulations and to give certainty to rural America, I am introducing \nthis legislation. The bill simply says no to EPA regulating dust in \nrural America. Yet it maintains the protections of the Clean Air Act to \npublic health. It provides immediate certainty to farmers in rural \nareas by preventing revision of the current dust standard for a year. \nAfterward, EPA could regulate farm dust but only if they followed a \nscientific standard. First, they would need to show scientific evidence \nof substantial adverse health effects caused by dust. Thus far, the \nstrongest the EPA can conjure up in terms of science is to say it is \n``uncertain.'' Second, EPA would need to show that the benefit of \nadditional regulation outweighs economic costs. These are commonsense \nstandards. Yet the EPA has unfortunately been unable to see the light, \nmaking this legislation necessary.\n  These are three commonsense regulatory reforms that are sorely \nneeded: a 2-year moratorium on job-constraining regulations; No. 2, \nmaking agency guidance documents subject to a simple up-or-down vote by \nCongress; and stopping the ill-advised farm dust regulation. They would \nprovide much certainty and relief for our Nation's job creators and our \nAmerican workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor these important efforts. I urge the \nWhite House to support us. The runaway train of regulation is weighing \ndown on America's ingenuity and job creation. It is time to unshackle \nAmerican workers with these commonsense reforms.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President I congratulate the Senator from Nebraska \non his typically commonsense, reasonable presentation about how we \nmight take steps to deal with the smothering regulations that are \nputting a big wet blanket on job growth in this country, and the idea \nof a timeout to stop the avalanche of new regulations makes sense. Farm \ndust--the idea of regulating farm dust makes no sense. Slowing down the \nability of Federal agencies to get around the regulatory process by \nissuing guidance, that is commonsense. These are three sensible steps \nthat would help create an environment that would make it easier and \ncheaper for job creators to create private sector jobs in this country \nand I congratulate the Senator from Nebraska for his comments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1534. A bill to prevent identity theft and tax fraud; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I am filing legislation \naimed at stopping criminals from filing fraudulent tax returns with \nstolen Social Security numbers.\n  Specifically, the bill unveiled today would make it a felony \npunishable by as much as five years in Federal prison and/or a fine of \nno less than $25,000 for using another's Social Security number or \nother identifiable information to file a federal tax return and \nincreases penalties for negligent or reckless disclosure of taxpayer \ninformation by tax preparers; require the IRS to develop a nationwide \nPIN system in which identity theft victims can receive a pin number to \nput on their tax return; and, allow identity theft victims to ``opt-\nout'' of electronic filing of their Federal tax returns; protect Social \nSecurity numbers of deceased taxpayers by restricting public access to \nthe records; direct an investigation by the Treasury Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration to examine the role of prepaid debt cards and \ncommercial tax software in facilitating fraudulent tax refunds; and \npermanently extend the information-sharing authority between the IRS \nand Federal and state correction authorities needed to prevent inmate \ntax fraud and require the agency to work specifically with state and \nlocal law enforcement officials on criminal investigative matters that \ninvolve violations at Federal and State or local level.\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 259\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions than the term ``fetal \n     alcohol syndrome'' and therefore has replaced the term \n     ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella term describing \n     the range of effects that can occur in an individual whose \n     mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of cognitive disability in Western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas, although the economic costs of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders are difficult to estimate, the cost of \n     fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the United States was \n     approximately $6,000,000,000 in 2007, and it is estimated \n     that each individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost \n     the taxpayers of the United States between $860,000 and \n     $4,000,000 during the lifetime of the individual;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that they could make the world \n     aware of the devastating consequences of alcohol consumption \n     during pregnancy by establishing International Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome Awareness Day;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if ... a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol ... would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2011, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize the effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection during the ninth hour \n     of September 9, 2011, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5463-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 260--COMMEMORATING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                 DEDICATION OF SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK\n\n  Mr. WEBB (for himself and Mr. Warner) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 260\n\n       Whereas the 75th anniversary of the dedication of \n     Shenandoah National Park corresponds with the Civil War \n     sesquicentennial, enriching the heritage of both the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States;\n       Whereas in the early to mid-1920s, as a result of the \n     efforts of the citizen-driven Shenandoah Valley, Inc. and the \n     Shenandoah National Park Association, the congressionally \n     appointed Southern Appalachian National Park Committee \n     recommended that Congress authorize the establishment of a \n     national park in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia for the \n     purpose of providing the western national park experience to \n     the populated eastern seaboard;\n       Whereas, in 1935, the Secretary of the Interior, Harold \n     Ickes, accepted the land deeds for what would become \n     Shenandoah National Park from the Commonwealth of Virginia, \n     and, on July 3, 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     dedicated Shenandoah National Park ``to this and to \n     succeeding generations for the recreation and re-creation \n     they would find'';\n       Whereas the Appalachian Mountains extend through 200,000 \n     acres of Shenandoah National Park and border the 8 Virginia \n     counties of Albemarle, Augusta, Greene, Madison, Page, \n     Rappahannock, Rockingham, and Warren;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park is home to a diverse \n     ecosystem of 103 rare and endangered species, 1,405 plant \n     species, 51 mammal species, 36 fish species, 26 reptile \n     species, 23 amphibian species, and more than 200 bird \n     species;\n       Whereas the proximity of Shenandoah National Park to \n     heavily populated areas, including Washington, District of \n     Columbia, promotes regional travel and tourism, providing \n     thousands of jobs and contributing millions of dollars to the \n     economic vitality of the region;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park, rich with recreational \n     opportunities, offers 520 miles of hiking trails, 200 miles \n     of which are designated horse trails and 101 miles of which \n     are part of the 2,175-mile Appalachian National Historic \n     Trail, more than 90 fishable streams, 4 campgrounds, 7 picnic \n     areas, 3 lodges, 6 backcountry cabins, and an extensive, \n     rugged backcountry open to wilderness camping to the millions \n     of people who annually visit the Park;\n       Whereas the Park protects significant cultural resources, \n     including--\n       (1) Rapidan Camp, once a summer retreat for President \n     Herbert Hoover and now a national historic landmark;\n       (2) Skyline Drive, a historic district listed on the \n     National Register of Historic Places;\n       (3) Massanutten Lodge, a structure listed on the National \n     Register of Historic Places;\n       (4) 360 buildings and structures included on the List of \n     Classified Structures;\n       (5) 577 significant, recorded archeological sites, 11 of \n     which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places; \n     and\n       (6) more than 100 historic cemeteries;\n       Whereas Congress named 10 battlefields in the Shenandoah \n     Valley for preservation in the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields \n     National Historic District and Commission Act of 1996 \n     (section 606 of Public Law 104-333; 110 Stat. 4174), and \n     Shenandoah National Park, an integral partner in that \n     endeavor, provides visitors with outstanding views of \n     pristine, natural landscapes that are vital to the Civil War \n     legacy;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park also protects intangible \n     resources, including aspects of the heritage of the people of \n     the United States through the rigorous commitments of the \n     Civilian Conservation Corps and the advancement of Civil \n     Rights as Shenandoah's ``separate but equal'' facilities \n     became the first to desegregate in Virginia;\n       Whereas, on October 20, 1976, Public Law 94-567 was \n     enacted, designating 79,579 acres within Shenandoah National \n     Park's boundaries as wilderness under the Wilderness Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), which protects the wilderness character \n     of the lands ``for the permanent good of the whole people''; \n     and\n       Whereas Congress should support efforts to preserve the \n     ecological and cultural integrity of Shenandoah National \n     Park, maintain the infrastructure of the Park, and protect \n     the famously scenic views of the Shenandoah Valley: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 75th anniversary of the dedication of \n     Shenandoah National Park; and\n       (2) acknowledges the historic and enduring scenic, \n     recreational, and economic value of the Park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5463-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5463-S5464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Res. 259\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions than the term ``fetal \n     alcohol syndrome'' and therefore has replaced the term \n     ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella term describing \n     the range of effects that can occur in an individual whose \n     mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of cognitive disability in Western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas, although the economic costs of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders are difficult to estimate, the cost of \n     fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the United States was \n     approximately $6,000,000,000 in 2007, and it is estimated \n     that each individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost \n     the taxpayers of the United States between $860,000 and \n     $4,000,000 during the lifetime of the individual;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that they could make the world \n     aware of the devastating consequences of alcohol consumption \n     during pregnancy by establishing International Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome Awareness Day;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if ... a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol ... would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2011, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize the effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection during the ninth hour \n     of September 9, 2011, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5465-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEDICATION OF SHENANDOAH \n                             NATIONAL PARK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any related statements be printed in the Record.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 260\n\n       Whereas the 75th anniversary of the dedication of \n     Shenandoah National Park corresponds with the Civil War \n     sesquicentennial, enriching the heritage of both the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States;\n       Whereas in the early to mid-1920s, as a result of the \n     efforts of the citizen-driven Shenandoah Valley, Inc. and the \n     Shenandoah National Park Association, the congressionally \n     appointed Southern Appalachian National Park Committee \n     recommended that Congress authorize the establishment of a \n     national park in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia for the \n     purpose of providing the western national park experience to \n     the populated eastern seaboard;\n       Whereas, in 1935, the Secretary of the Interior, Harold \n     Ickes, accepted the land deeds for what would become \n     Shenandoah National Park from the Commonwealth of Virginia, \n     and, on July 3, 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     dedicated Shenandoah National Park ``to this and to \n     succeeding generations for the recreation and re-creation \n     they would find'';\n       Whereas the Appalachian Mountains extend through 200,000 \n     acres of Shenandoah National Park and border the 8 Virginia \n     counties of Albemarle, Augusta, Greene, Madison, Page, \n     Rappahannock, Rockingham, and Warren;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park is home to a diverse \n     ecosystem of 103 rare and endangered species, 1,405 plant \n     species, 51 mammal species, 36 fish species, 26 reptile \n     species, 23 amphibian species, and more than 200 bird \n     species;\n       Whereas the proximity of Shenandoah National Park to \n     heavily populated areas, including Washington, District of \n     Columbia, promotes regional travel and tourism, providing \n     thousands of jobs and contributing millions of dollars to the \n     economic vitality of the region;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park, rich with recreational \n     opportunities, offers 520 miles of hiking trails, 200 miles \n     of which are designated horse trails and 101 miles of which \n     are part of the 2,175-mile Appalachian National Historic \n     Trail, more than 90 fishable streams, 4 campgrounds, 7 picnic \n     areas, 3 lodges, 6 backcountry cabins, and an extensive, \n     rugged backcountry open to wilderness camping to the millions \n     of people who annually visit the Park;\n       Whereas the Park protects significant cultural resources, \n     including--\n       (1) Rapidan Camp, once a summer retreat for President \n     Herbert Hoover and now a national historic landmark;\n       (2) Skyline Drive, a historic district listed on the \n     National Register of Historic Places;\n       (3) Massanutten Lodge, a structure listed on the National \n     Register of Historic Places;\n       (4) 360 buildings and structures included on the List of \n     Classified Structures;\n       (5) 577 significant, recorded archeological sites, 11 of \n     which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places; \n     and\n       (6) more than 100 historic cemeteries;\n\n       Whereas Congress named 10 battlefields in the Shenandoah \n     Valley for preservation in the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields \n     National Historic District and Commission Act of 1996 \n     (section 606 of Public Law 104-333; 110 Stat. 4174), and \n     Shenandoah National Park, an integral partner in that \n     endeavor, provides visitors with outstanding views of \n     pristine, natural landscapes that are vital to the Civil War \n     legacy;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park also protects intangible \n     resources, including aspects of the heritage of the people of \n     the United States through the rigorous commitments of the \n     Civilian Conservation Corps and the advancement of Civil \n     Rights as Shenandoah's ``separate but equal'' facilities \n     became the first to desegregate in Virginia;\n       Whereas, on October 20, 1976, Public Law 94-567 was \n     enacted, designating 79,579 acres within Shenandoah National \n     Park's boundaries as wilderness under the Wilderness Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), which protects the wilderness character \n     of the lands ``for the permanent good of the whole people''; \n     and\n       Whereas Congress should support efforts to preserve the \n     ecological and cultural integrity of Shenandoah National \n     Park, maintain the infrastructure of the Park, and protect \n     the famously scenic views of the Shenandoah Valley: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 75th anniversary of the dedication of \n     Shenandoah National Park; and\n       (2) acknowledges the historic and enduring scenic, \n     recreational, and economic value of the Park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/08/senate-section/article/S5465-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
